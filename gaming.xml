<p>You might recall that Nintendo revealed the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/here-are-japans-best-selling-switch-and-switch-2-eshop-games-for-2025">most-downloaded eShop titles</a> in the region at the end of last year, but Famitsu's list accounts for the industry at large, giving PlayStation and Xbox titles a chance to get in on the fun.</p>
<p>That said, only one non-Switch release was able to make the 2025 top 10, with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> breaking in at fourth with some PS5 representation.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067iquhmt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>As you might expect, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> led the proceedings, with over 2.5 million sales in the region since the Switch 2 launched in June. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> was a big enough hitter on Switch 1 and 2 that it occupied the remaining spots on the podium, and other Switch 2 exclusives like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> snagged a spot too.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is still outselling <em>most</em> new games in Japan, too. Because of course it is.</p>
<p>Here's Famitsu's full list of the best-selling games in Japan in 2025:</p>

<p>As you might expect from those numbers, the Switch and Switch 2 also nabbed the top two spots in Famitsu's total hardware sales for 2025. The new system came out on top, naturally, with almost 3.8 million units to its name since launch (over half of <em>all</em> home consoles sold in the region last year), but the Switch 1 clung onto second while the PS5 sat in third.</p>
<p>Here's Famitsu's list of the best-selling consoles of 2025 in Japan — note, the 'Switch' entry includes sales for the Lite and OLED models, 'PS5' comprises base, Digital and Pro editions, 'Xbox Series X|S' also accounts for the Series X Digital Edition, and 'PS4' adds in any Pro sales:</p>

<p>All of this means that Japan's game market is in a pretty healthy position thanks to the last 12 months. Famitsu estimates that the market has grown by 38.8% in the last year, with hardware spending at 282.69 billion yen (up 49.3%) and software spending at 135.44 billion yen (up 21%).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Back in October 2025, shortly after <strong>Ubisoft</strong> unveiled its subsidiary, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Vantage Studios</a></strong>, a new branch formed in partnership with <strong>Tencent</strong> to house the <strong>Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six</strong>, and <strong>Far Cry </strong>franchises, head of the Assassin's Creed series, <strong>Marc-Alexis Côté, </strong>was <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-tencent-subsidiary-reveal-vantage-studios/">confirmed to be leaving the company by Ubisoft</a>. While Ubisoft initially framed Côté's departure as his choice, saying that he declined a role within Vantage Studios and that he had "<em></em><em>chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft</em>," three days later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-series-boss-didnt-choose-to-leave-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/">Côté published his own statement</a>, saying he didn't choose to leave, but that instead "<em></em><em><strong>Ubisoft asked me to step aside</strong></em>."</p>



<p>While Côté claimed that he held "<em>no resentment</em>" at the time, that statement appears to be in question after <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">Radio-Canada</a> reported that Côté is now <strong>suing Ubisoft for $1.3 million,</strong> accusing Ubisoft of "<em>constructive dismissal</em>" to avoid paying him severance.</p>



<p>Côté had been with Ubisoft for two decades, with the majority of that time spent working on the Assassin's Creed franchise, and the final three years of his tenure as the head of the entire series. The suit alleges that in the summer of 2025, a meeting was held to discuss a new "<em>head of franchise</em>" role within Vantage Studios, which Côté noticed would swallow up most of the responsibilities he had in his current position.</p>



<p>Côté was instead offered a "<em>head of production</em>" role within Vantage Studios, which would fall under the newly created "<em>head of franchise</em>" role, and see Côté lose most of his influence over the Assassin's Creed series and the responsibility to lead partnerships with external studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-netflix-adaptation-finds-director-johan-renck/"><strong>Netflix</strong>, which is currently working on a new Assassin's Creed TV show.</a> According to the report, in Côté's current position, he directly reported to no one save for Ubisoft's long-time boss and chief executive officer, <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>.</p>



<p>After declining the head of production role, Côté was then reportedly offered a "<em>creative house</em>" lead, which would allow him to oversee "<em>second-tier</em>" Ubisoft series. With Côté seeing himself as the "<em>guardian of the Assassin's Creed</em>" series after having been with it for so long and having spent three years at its helm, he considered the positions offered a demotion, the kind he could not accept. As he was "<em>disoriented, confused and affected by the anxiety-provoking situation</em>," according to the suit, Côté took two weeks off to reflect on how to move forward.</p>



<p>He was reportedly told that he would have to make a decision at the end of his two weeks as to whether he would accept the role offered. At the end of the two weeks, Côté determined the role was an "<em>unacceptable demotion</em>," and asked to be paid severance. Ubisoft reportedly responded by telling Côté not to come to work on October 13, and the next day, on October 14, an internal email was sent to staff outlining that Côté had "<em>chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft</em>," the same email that broke to the press that day. </p>



<p>The lawsuit alleges that Ubisoft has listed Côté's departure as a "<em>voluntary</em> <em>departure</em>" in order to avoid paying him severance. Côté is suing for two years' salary and <strong>$75,000</strong> in moral damages, which the suit is calling "<em>an abuse of power and harm to his reputation</em>." The salary, along with the additional $75K is what brings the total to <strong>$1.3 million<em>.</em></strong> Additionally, Côté is asking that the court lift his non-compete clause, so he can find a new role elsewhere in the video game industry.</p>



<p>Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for a comment on the situation, and we'll update this report if/when we hear back. Côté and his lawyer, Catherine Asselin Jobin, from Poudrier Bradet Avocats, have reportedly declined to make a statement on the matter, save for his lawyer saying, "<em>Mr. Côté</em> <em>hopes for a negotiated, swift, and satisfactory resolution to the situation</em>."</p>



<p>Though we currently only have Côté's side of the story in this matter, and we've yet to see how Ubisoft will claim the situation shook out, this is the second instance of the year already where dismissals at Ubisoft are under suspicion. At the beginning of the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/"><strong>Ubisoft shuttered its Halifax studio, laying off</strong> <strong>71 people</strong></a> a little less than three weeks after the majority of the branch <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/">voted to unionize under the CWA Canada</a></strong>.</p>



<p>While Ubisoft claims the studio shutdown had nothing to do with the team unionizing, and claims the decision was made well before organizational efforts at the studio began, CWA Canada has pushed back on that narrative and has filed a complaint with Nova Scotia's labour board, seeking clear evidence from Ubisoft to prove its claims. When the two sides last met, CWA Canada claimed Ubisoft had brought none of the requested evidence.</p>



<p>Public and legal pressure from the CWA Canada has already caused Ubisoft to consider raising the severance it plans to give the 71 fired workers, and CWA Canada continues to apply pressure to the company after it discovered that Ubisoft had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">given <strong>nearly $1 billion</strong> in tax subsidies over the last five years for operating in Halifax</a>.</p>



<p>It's also worth noting that Marc-Alexis Côté is the second lead of a franchise at Ubisoft to leave the company since the reveal and establishment of Vantage Studios, with The Division lead<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">, <strong>Julian Gerighty</strong>, announcing his departure just last week</a>. Rumours circulated in October 2025 of his departure, which <strong>Massive Entertainment</strong> denied at the time, though with Gerighty set to join <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong>, his departure doesn't appear to have the same issues that Côté alleges he had.</p>

Suffice it to say that <em>RuneScape </em>at the end of 2026 should look a lot different to how it looks today.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>RuneScape</em>'s 25th anniversary is shaping up to be special.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In April, player character avatars will be completely updated, with features like models, animations, and hairstyles getting an overhaul. More updates will be introduced "based on community feedback" as well.</p><p>You'll gain more control over your house this year, too, allowing you to build a space that "feels personal, welcoming, and worth visiting", according to Jagex. The Construction skill will increase to 120, and you'll get a new recipe system that lets you unlock and build new furniture.</p><p>It's not all tweaks to existing systems and features, though. <em>RuneScape </em>is also getting "the largest area expansion" in its history in the form of Havenhythe, which will be arriving "in multiple parts throughout the year".</p><p>Havenhythe is a "progressively vampiric" area that brings new quests, new early-game bosses, and a new level cap for your Hunter skill, with new story and boss content also arriving later in the year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gamers love AI in game dev — they just don’t know it yet, says Razer’s CEO]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview</link>
            <guid>1410022</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We’re back to start the year off with a very special live interview with Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan, which we taped in front of a terrific audience at Brooklyn Bowl in Las Vegas during CES.</p><p>Razer is obviously best known for making mice, keyboards, and gaming PCs in its signature black and bright green, with a smattering of RGB LEDs to set everything off. But the company always makes splashy announcements at CES, and this year was no different — and along with the hype, there was plenty of controversy.</p><p>This year, Razer earned those splashy headlines and more than a little controversy for something it calls Project Ava, an AI companion that has a physical presence in the real world as an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854705/razer-ai-anime-waifu-hologram-desk">anime hologram that sits in a jar on your desk</a>. Ava is powered by, you guessed it, Elon Musk’s Grok.</p><div><p><em>Verge</em> subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free <em>Decoder</em> wherever you get your podcasts. Head <a href="https://www.theverge.com/account/podcasts">here</a>. Not a subscriber? You can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/subscribe">sign up here</a>.</p></div><p>There are a lot of choices bundled up in all of that, and Razer can’t really fall back on the “it’s just a prototype” defense. It’s taking $20 “reservations” and entirely expects to ship this thing, potentially even this year. So I spent a good chunk of time in this interview asking Min some very obvious questions, to which I’m not sure I got very satisfying answers.</p><p>I really wanted to know if Min and Razer had really thought through the implications of building AI companions, after a string of stories detailing the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/technology/chatgpt-lawsuit-suicides-delusions.html">mental health issues</a> chatbots have caused for so many people. And of course, I wanted to know why Min and Razer had chosen Grok, which is facing outrage around the world for allowing users to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/855832/grok-undressing-children-csam-law-x-elon-musk">create deepfaked pornographic images of real women and children</a>.</p><p>Min says they chose Grok for its conversational capabilities. But he was also not very convinced by the notion that products like this always end up being turned into creepy sexual objects, despite an entire year of headlines about AI psychosis and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/05/magazine/ai-chatbot-marriage-love-romance-sex.html">people turning chatbots into romantic partners</a>.</p><p>That exchange really set the tone for the rest of my conversation with Min, which focused on why exactly he’s pushing Razer so hard into AI when it does not seem at all clear that the core gamer demographic wants any of this. The gaming community at large has been absolutely rocked by the AI art debate that’s ripped through the broader industry in the past 12 months, with concerns over labor, copyright, and even just experimental AI use in game development putting some of the industry’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/859551/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-gen-ai-concept-art-reddit-ama">most beloved studios into full-blown crisis mode</a>.</p><p>Gamers themselves are fairly hostile toward AI, which you can see in the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTJmdYkieb6/">comments on Razer’s own CES AI posts</a>. So I asked Min about that, and how he would know if he had made the right bet here in the face of all this pushback.</p><p>As you can tell, there was a lot of back and forth here, and this was a really good conversation. Min and I really dug into some of the biggest issues in tech and gaming, themes that are going to be central throughout 2026. It’s also great to do these kinds of episodes live in front of an audience. I think it’s going to give you a lot to think about.</p><p>Okay: Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan. Here we go.</p><p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p><strong>Hello, welcome to </strong><strong><em>Decoder</em></strong><strong>. I’m Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, and Decoder is my show about big ideas and other problems. Today, I’m talking with Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan. Welcome, Min.</strong></p><p>Thank you for having me.</p><p><strong>Nailed it. Thank you to our audience. We are live at Brooklyn Bowl at CES. I’m very excited to be doing this in front of a live audience. You’re going to hear them throughout the show because Min has no shortage of extremely controversial things to say.</strong></p><p>We’ll see, we’ll see.</p><p><strong>I was promised “extremely controversial.”</strong></p><p>Oh, is that right?</p><p><strong>I mean, that’s what they told me. Let’s get into it. You’ve made a bunch of announcements here at CES. You’ve obviously been with Razer for a long time. You founded Razer, and you’re over 20 years into the job. The gaming industry is undergoing a lot of turmoil lately because of AI. You’re making huge investments in AI. There’s a hologram waifu we should talk about that you’ve introduced throughout the show.</strong></p><p><strong>I actually wanna start with something very basic. I’ve been covering CES for about 20 years as well. Razer loves CES. You love CES.</strong><strong><br></strong></p><p>We love it.</p><p><strong>Every year, there is a huge suite of Razer products announced. There are weird projects and concepts. Why are you so invested in CES? Of all the companies, I think Razer has the most consistent enthusiasm for this show in particular.</strong></p><p>It’s odd, and we were just talking about it yesterday. It’s over 20 years at this point in time, and I think we’ve been at CES maybe 15 years or so. And from the very early days at Razer, I remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337944/we-are-experiencing-digital-experiences">Pepcom</a>, a massive hall with a little table there, talking about gaming products. Back then, I think we were probably one of the few, if not the only, gaming equipment providers.</p><p>It’s really grown for us. I think what has happened is we have a huge online community, people are very passionate about things that we come up with, what’s the latest and greatest, and we’ve really grown this community, and we have all been kind of invested in what we’re gonna be launching at CES. So it kind of started a couple of years ago when we said, “Okay, why don’t we not just bring the stuff that we’re gonna launch, but some of the things that we’ve got cooking in the Razer labs and stuff.”</p><p>We brought it to CES, it has been a hit, and we said every year, “Why don’t we bring more of our concept products? Some of which will come to market, some of which do not, and let’s see what the community thinks.” So we’re a company that is for gamers, by gamers. We really like to hear what the community would like to say about our product, and it gives us an opportunity to present the stuff that we’ve got, get the feedback, and then we go back and polish it a little bit.</p><p><strong>Well, I’m curious. I mean, this is kind of a meta question about how this show in particular has changed so much over the years. The idea of even having a big tech trade show has gone in and out of favor. If you look at where a lot of the action is this week in Vegas, it’s actually in the Aria and Vdara, where the ad tech people are doing whatever weird stuff they’re doing. I don’t even know what’s going on over there, man. It’s goofy. </strong></p><p><strong>This is about getting attention, right? I mean, you launch things at trade shows because the press and creators are here, and you can get a lot of attention. Razer doesn’t need help getting attention. Why still do it here?</strong></p><p>Well, it’s an opportunity, I think, for us also to catch up with our partners, friends, and show a little bit of what we have been working on under the hood. But it’s been a tradition of sorts. I think the community expects us to be here. I’d love to see more of these in-person events right now, especially post-pandemic, and what has happened.</p><p>From a gaming perspective, we’ve also lost a couple of big events in the year. So it’s a great way to kind of kick it off. It’s a little early in the year for us, though. We wish it would be maybe mid-January or something like that. But it’s a bit of a tradition for us. I hope it continues, I hope it gets bigger along the way, and it’s massive right now. But it’s good fun.</p><p><strong>Do you think you’re still getting the same amount of attention from this kind of thing as you would if you just had your own events?</strong></p><p>Well, we have our own events, pretty much, but it’s a good opportunity just to catch up with partners. I think that’s been a real opportunity for us. And it’s also a good opportunity for us to kind of bring the rest of our audience along, from the gaming community, who may not necessarily be keen so much on all tech, but they really wanna see what’s the latest and greatest in gaming tech. And that’s what we do.</p><div><p><strong>So let me ask you about the announcements here. There’s an </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854756/razer-concept-ai-wearable-headphones-project-motoko"><strong>AI headset called Project Motoko</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></div><p>Yes.</p><div><p><strong>You’ve got </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855038/razer-forge-workstation-ai-dev-hardware"><strong>AI PCs for software developers</strong></a><strong>, which is really interesting. I wanna talk to you about that. And then there’s </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854705/razer-ai-anime-waifu-hologram-desk"><strong>Project Ava, which is a spinning hologram</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></div><p>Yes. We’ve got Madison also, which is a project that we’ve brought across, which showcases the latest and greatest in immersion technology. We’ve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854601/razer-concept-gaming-chair-speakers-rgb-lights-rumble">put it into a gaming chair</a>, so that’s a setup for games.</p><p><strong>I can’t believe I forgot the chair. The most important.</strong></p><p>Yeah, the chair, it’s getting a lot of traction. And a whole lot more, and not just hardware, but software.</p><p><strong>So how do you decide what is going to be a real product you’re gonna ship? The AI PCs, I think, are real products you’re definitely gonna ship. That’s just happening. And then here’s the concept, just to get attention and feedback. How do you make that kind of choice?</strong></p><p>Actually, we’ve got a labs team internally, which charts and pretty much looks at things far out, in terms of the industry, where we think the industry’s going, and how we can build toward that. In essence, the decision to green-light a project to an actual product is really like, “Is this cool? Do we think it’s gonna do well?” We kind of started with that, with the gaming mouse, right?</p><p>We very rarely sit down with the finance people and say, “Oh, do we do projections and things like that?” It’s really more of a “by the seat of our pants” kind of thing. It’s cool, we like it, it’s gonna be fun, we want it for ourselves. I think the real kind of trigger there is, do we want it for ourselves? And if we really want it for ourselves, and we think it’s cool, we’ll bring it to market.</p><p><strong>Every year, there’s always some project; some of them come out, some of them don’t come out. One year, you </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24343016/more-than-1-million-in-refunds-are-going-out-to-people-who-bought-razers-zephyr-face-masks"><strong>announced a respirator that got you into a lot of trouble, and you had to recall the product</strong></a><strong>. How do you make the call of, “Okay, this project, it’s out, it’s successful, it’s doing what we want it to do, we’re gonna keep investing,” versus “this was a one-off.” What’s the metric of success there?</strong></p><p>Well, scaling it. I think scaling it is definitely something that we would like to do. And sometimes we’re really early. For example, I think over a decade ago we built a complete gaming PC in a handheld. For that matter, we brought it to market at the same time. Today, we’ve seen handhelds out there, and we haven’t launched our handheld, for example, at this point.</p><p><strong>Do you have one?</strong></p><p>We might. We will see. But not today.</p><p><strong>So you got claps for that already.</strong></p><p>I think for us, when we launch a product, we look at the attraction for it. You know, is this something that we want? Do we wanna invest in the next generation? Do we wanna kind of provide a roadmap across to it? So we essentially work very closely with the community.</p><p>We keep talking about “for gamers, by gamers,” but we really believe in that. We’ve got a really big fan base that’s very passionate. Everyone’s got an opinion. We love hearing opinions. We’ve got social media, we chat with them often, so on and so forth. That’s what really guides us, and we really let the community guide what we build for the future.</p><p><strong>All right, so now I have to ask you about Project Ava.</strong></p><p>Sure.</p><p><strong>Did you say to your team, “I want a holographic anime waifu on my desk”? You say that the metric is “what we want.” Who was like, “I want this”?</strong></p><p>Sure. So actually, yeah, somewhat. Well, not so much in the specific words, “I want an anime waifu,” and things like that. But we did hack together a holographic projector to have a character there. We had ideas like that in the past, where we’ve created holographic projectors for game companies. But back in the day, to say, “Hey, look, is there a way that we can do a holographic representation of some of your latest characters?” and stuff like that.</p><p>With AI, we were now able to get that personality there and have conversational AI coming through. I think the tipping point for us was really not just making great hardware, and not just having great software, but also, now with great intelligence, I think, coming out together with it. And it’s that premise of being able to have a semi-physical representation of an avatar, to me being able to chat, as opposed to clicking a button or typing on something, and having a little thing over there.</p><p>It’s really exciting in our imaginations for ourselves, you know? It’s cool. We’ve always had that, whether it’s a game like a super AI in <em>Halo</em>, like Cortana, for example. So it’s a little bit of sci-fi, us growing up always wanting something cool like that, and so we said, “Hey, it’s a great concept,” and I think the community loves it.</p><p><strong>Are you aware of the very common trope about actually building superintelligence from sci-fi movies? The one that’s “you should not build the </strong><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/torment-nexus"><strong>Torment Nexus</strong></a><strong>?”</strong></p><p>Well, for us, I think in this case it’s more… Well, I’m familiar with that, of course.</p><p><strong>[Laughs] Just checking.</strong></p><p>Yeah, yeah. But, I mean, with the guardrails… That is also, I think, on a broader level, from an AI discussion and things like that, trust and safety is one of the things that we do look at internally at the company. But specifically for Ava, it was just cool. It was just awesome to be able to have a product like that, and hopefully we will.</p><p><strong>So is Ava going to come out? Because I think that my understanding, or my reaction to this product, changes based on whether it’s actually coming out or if this is just a concept that people can react to. But you’re taking pre-orders for it. It’s like 20 bucks to pre-order it.</strong></p><p>Yes, we’re taking reservations for it at this point in time.</p><p><strong>It seems like it’s going to come out.</strong></p><p>We plan to put it out, but we do want to get as much feedback, to hear what the concerns are, right? Are there things that we can do better? What’s cool? What are the characters that we would like to get on? We’d also like to get the feedback from many of the game partners, at the same time, to do really specific character models, so on and so forth. And then finally, I think on the trust and safety part, we also wanna make sure that we take that into consideration. Are there things that we need to know? We’re working with our model partners at the same time.</p><p><strong>So the model partner with Ava is Grok.</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>I would say that there’s a pretty significant disconnect between saying you care about trust and safety and partnering with Grok, which is in the </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/859715/x-grok-ai-deepfakes"><strong>middle of a deepfake porn scandal</strong></a><strong>. As we speak, as we’re sitting here, Grok is undressing people left and right. I’m confident that we will be undressed by the end of this podcast.</strong></p><p>But Grok has the best–</p><p><strong>Can you care about trust and safety, and also partner with Grok?</strong></p><p>Well, I think for Grok, you know… We picked Grok also because it’s got the best conversational AI at this point, for us. At least from a conversation, personality side of things, and that’s one of the things that we looked at from a tech perspective. Now, ultimately, however, we do see Ava as an open platform, right? If somebody wants to be able to use a different model, it’s one of the things that we’re taking into consideration. And we are multi-model, right? But I think from a perspective of an avatar, from a conversational AI for CES, we feel that Grok has a really great conversational AI model at this point. So that’s one of the reasons why we picked Grok.</p><p><strong>Grok, also made by Elon Musk, who has his own anime waifu ideas, I would say. There’s something there that is, you know, not necessarily just trust and safety. The idea that you would have a pet on your desk that looks like a person, that can talk to you, that’s a big door to open for a lot of people. Are you worried about that at all?</strong></p><p>Well, the doors have been open since Tamagotchi.</p><p><strong>I think there’s a pretty big step difference between… Like my daughter has a Tamagotchi. I’m never worried that this thing is alive.</strong></p><p>Right.</p><p>Sure. But from a virtual perspective, and as a gamer, we’ve interacted with NPCs and stuff like that. And of course, NPCs are getting smarter with AI, and I do hope they get smarter. It gets more engaging. And I think we’re still in the early days. Now, the question, I think, where it’s going to lead to is something that we need to discover, right? And, of course, we need to discover it in a responsible manner to figure out how we do that, and put the right guardrails in. What do we do in terms of AI, in terms of this? That’s something that we’re learning.</p><p>So building great hardware, I think, is part of it. Grok is powering this for us at this point in time, and this is something that we feel, from a conversational perspective, they do an incredible job at. Now, over and above what else can we do to ensure that, ultimately, when we do launch the product, how do we make sure that it’s going to do the right things and be able to converse and be the great companion that we want it to be?</p><p><strong>This is very much what I mean by saying I react to it differently when it’s just a concept, and it opens the door to these conversations, versus you are going to sell this thing to people. And I think when you sell it to people, the responsibility skyrockets. We’ve all looked at what’s happened with OpenAI models over the last year or so. People have fallen in love with them. Famously, Bing proposed to journalist Kevin Roose </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html"><strong>on the front page of </strong><strong><em>The New York Times</em></strong></a><strong>. People are having relationships with these products. They are being driven to </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/858102/characterai-google-teen-suicide-settlement"><strong>very negative outcomes</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p><p><strong>Do you think that you have to do something else to make sure that doesn’t happen with Ava, who will be represented in human-like form on your desk? Like the opportunity to have a relationship is gonna change, right? And from what I have been told, from our reporters, Razer people are saying, “We don’t want this to be a companion in that way.” OpenAI said that about ChatGPT, and yet, here we are. So what have you learned from that already?</strong></p><p>So we work closely with the model providers. I think this is something that we work closely on with them, with respect to that. We do talk to them often about what the plans are for the future, with respect to this. But I think what is clear is that these are still early days, right? It is still new for us to discover. I’m sure that there will be concerns or issues that will come about, and evolving what’s happening for technology is something that we do.</p><p>Now, maybe it’s even a hardware lock that we need to put in. We don’t know, right? Or it’s more software guardrails that we have to put into place at this point in time. That’s one of the reasons why we decided to put it as a concept first out there, to get the feedback. And we’re not gonna be able to think of everything, but we would like to be able to get as much thought, concern, and care into the product before we actually launch it, which is why we’ve also intentionally, in a very intentional and deliberate manner, said, “We don’t know when we’re gonna launch this.” We really do not.</p><p>I would suspect, for us, it will be a phased approach to a certain extent, with dev kits out there first to be able to discover more. Someone’s gonna be able to do more with it, perhaps, to load up different models and to have it say things that we may not necessarily want it to say, and we’ll find out. And then, accordingly, we’ll just grow the product.</p><p><strong>I understand all this, but you’re taking the money, right? You’re taking the pre-orders. Why take pre-orders if you don’t think you’re ready?</strong></p><p>So what we have actually said is that these are reservations. They’re not pre-orders, per se. So, ultimately, when we do launch the product, and it could be a long way out, by then, because of the specs… We have not disclosed the actual specs of the product, and even, for example, which character models, or even which model it’s gonna be running at this point in time. We’re leaving that absolutely open.</p><p>And of course, at the end of the day, if somebody says, “Look, this isn’t the product that I thought it was going to be,” that’s fine. Cancel the reservation, and we’ll remain open and see how the product evolves at that point in time.</p><p><strong>Are you ready for a customer, a few years from now, falling in love with their hologram on your desk that you have provided?</strong></p><p>I don’t think that’s how we would want to design the product.</p><p><strong>It’s going to happen.</strong></p><p>We don’t know.</p><p><strong>That’s what happens with all these tools.</strong></p><p>I suppose we literally do not know, right? I use the example when I play a game, and I’m really invested in the game, I really enjoy it, and I feel a sense of loss... Well, I wouldn’t call it unhappiness, but loss when I finish a game. But it’s a great game. I’m fully invested in a movie, I’m fully invested in a game. Is that how we see it? Perhaps, right?</p><p>We want to create products that people care about, whether that’s a gaming mouse, a laptop, or whatever software platforms. We want people to care about it. I don’t necessarily think that we want somebody to fall in love with one of our products and marry them. It might happen. Who knows? It could.</p><div><p><strong>There are other CEOs who come on this show, they’re like, “You should marry my AI,” and </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24216748/replika-ceo-eugenia-kuyda-ai-companion-chatbots-dating-friendship-decoder-podcast-interview"><strong>straightforwardly say these things to me</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></div><p>Really?</p><p><strong>All the time.</strong></p><p>Okay.</p><p><strong>The reality is, some people are having their romantic lives rocked because a cloud service got deprecated, and then you’re gonna have to deal with that. I’m just saying, these are the questions that are coming for you once you put a character that people can have an emotional relationship with.</strong></p><p>Well, I would say that potentially that could happen, but that’s definitely not something we plan to build the product toward. I mean, we have, for example, people really passionate about Razer products, right? Some of them have come to me, and they have said, “Look, I’m so passionate about this product, it’s part of my life. I’m gonna tattoo the product on myself,” and things like that. We didn’t plan to do that.</p><p>But we did, however, plan to make the best possible product. We put incredible amounts of care and concern, I think, in terms of design. And that’s what we plan to do with Ava at the same time, or Motoko, or Madison, or any of the products that we bring to the market.</p><p><strong>One more question on this, and then I’m gonna ask you the </strong><strong><em>Decoder</em></strong><strong> questions and talk about the rest of your AI investment, which is pretty substantial. You said you’re working with the model partners, and that is how you’re thinking about trust and safety. Is xAI a good partner when it comes to trust and safety, as it relates to Grok? Because I’m looking at the product you’re shipping today, and I would say, “No.”</strong></p><p>Sure. So I think, and I speak broadly, I think, for all of the partners that we’ve got. I think for the vast majority of all the models out there, I think there’s, of course, a lot of focus in terms of intelligence, really trying to get to that point, but trust and safety really is one of the things that pretty much all our partners really do care about. And that’s one of the reasons why… Each model, I think, excels in different ways at the same time. And I think for us, we really wanna find the best possible model. And ultimately, in what shape or form we ship at the end of the day, that’s one of the things that we will take into consideration.</p><p><strong>Is xAI a good partner when it comes to trust and safety?</strong></p><p>Specifically, I don’t really like to comment on that at this point in time because I don’t have enough information, I think, right now. I really don’t. My focus to date has been more in terms of what’s the best conversational model that we’ve got, and they’re great, they’re fantastic.</p><p><strong>Again, I suspect we’ll be undressed within the next 45 minutes. They’ve got one idea, and they’re good at it.</strong></p><p><strong>Let me ask you the Decoder questions. If you’ve got a trick, you gotta play the hits, you know? Let me ask the Decoder questions ‘cause I think that’s gonna lead into some of the big investments you’re making, and the change that’s coming to Razer as a company over the next few years. You’re really invested in design. You’re a product designer, that’s some of your background. How is Razer structured in a way that lets you stay focused on design?</strong></p><p>So I focus on product at the company. We’ve got a really pretty flat structure at Razer. I’ve got about 40, 50 direct reports. We really work as a team. And the entire company is really focused, I think, in terms of product first. You know, that has always been the mantra for the organization, but we’ve got a really great team, very talented team members. And everyone has worked together for a while. We’ve got team members who have been there for the last 20 years together with us, growing alongside us.</p><p>I would say that the guiding north star for us is just about the gamers. We’ve been consistent in that respect, despite the fact that in the very early days, gaming or gamers were not considered a big industry or demographic. But we’ve been laser-focused in terms of that as we’ve grown. Even with the industry growing at this point in time, the opportunities for us to go like, “Hey, why don’t you do productivity at the same time? Why don’t we go into this other area?” And stuff like that. We’ve just said, “Look, we know what we’re good at.” We remain focused on it. We align the team members all the time, and that’s how we are structured.</p><p><strong>How many people are at Razer?</strong></p><p>About 2000.</p><p><strong>When I say structure, I mean literally organized. Does everybody report to you? Where do all those 2000 people go?</strong></p><p>No. In the traditional structure, we’ve got our operations and supply chain. We’ve got legal, so on and so forth. But we’ve got a pretty flat, I think, management team structure, and we don’t have multiple layers from that perspective. And we consistently keep a very single-minded focus to say that, “Look, the product’s always the most important. The customer, in our case, the gamer, is always the most important for us.” And pretty much we ask ourselves the question, right? If there’s no direction or management mandate when it comes down to this, just figure it out. Like, what would the customer want, what would the gamer want? That’s what we do.</p><p><strong>You’re primarily based in Singapore. I know you come back and forth a lot. Where is most of the company based?</strong></p><p>Well, we’re everywhere. A third of our business is in the US, a third in Europe, and a third in Asia at this point in time. So we’ve got team members spread out. We’ve got close to 20 offices worldwide. We’re dual headquartered in Irvine and Singapore.</p><p><strong>When I think about the market of gamers, we’re here, obviously, in the United States. It’s very obviously focused on what this market wants. Gaming is growing in China at a high rate, right? We’re adding more gamers in other places. When you say, “We’re focused on the gamers,” the gamers in different regions want different things. How do you make those decisions? How do you decide which needs are gonna drive your roadmaps or your design ideas?</strong></p><p>Exactly that. You know, the gamers from, or the needs from, every country or region that we’ve got… We’ve got team members from design in each of the various regions, and we do focus on pretty much two constituents, the way that we see it. The first of which would be the game developers. That’s who we work with, very closely with. And then on the other end of the spectrum, we’ve got the gamers. And what we do is focus on what the gamers want, what the game developers want, and we see ourselves as the link in between. And we keep both as happy as we can.</p><p><strong>This brings me to the other </strong><strong><em>Decoder</em></strong><strong> question I ask everybody on the show. How do you make decisions? Do you have a framework? Do you have an organized way of making decisions?</strong></p><p>I think we are dictated by what we feel the customer wants. That’s what dictates our decisions at any point in time. We talk to the gamers, and when we say “talk to the gamers,” it could be directly through social media, it could be through our customer base, it could be through our sales and marketing team, and things like that. And anecdotally, we figure out, is this what we want? And if this is something that they are keen or passionate about, we then make the decision to say, “Okay, cool.” And we have a very quick, flexible, and… We’re very nimble, I would say, at Razer, wherein we try to do as little as possible, but to scale as fast as possible just for our customer base.</p><p><strong>This is gonna lead me to the big decision. You have </strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-06/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-interview-at-ces-2026-strategy-investment-and-ai-focus"><strong>announced you’re investing $600 million into AI</strong></a><strong> over the next few years. You’re gonna hire 150 AI engineers, I think. The gamers hate it. The gamers, I think, are in open revolt against AI coming into their games, into their platforms. Certainly, developers are very worried about what’s gonna happen to software development. We’ve seen game studios rocked by AI. </strong></p><p><strong>That’s a pretty big disconnect. Even, I think, in the announcement of the CES tag line for Razer at CES, which is, “AI is the future of gaming.” I </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTJmdYkieb6/"><strong>looked at the Instagram comments</strong></a><strong>. If you’re listening to the gamers, you’d be like, “Well, we’re done with this.” How are you reconciling that gap?</strong></p><p>So, I would say that the question is, “What are we unhappy with?” When I say we, I mean us as gamers. I think we’re unhappy with generative AI slop, right? Just to put it out there. And that’s something that I’m unhappy with. Like any gamer, when I play a game, I want to be engaged, I wanna be immersed, I wanna be able to be competitive. I don’t want to be served character models with extra fingers and stuff like that, or shoddily written storylines, so on and so forth. I think for us, we’re all aligned against gen AI slop that is just churned out from a couple of prompts and stuff like that.</p><p>What we aren’t against, at least, from my perspective, are tools that help augment or support, and help game developers make great games. And I think that’s fundamentally what we are talking about at Razer, right? So if we’ve got AI tools that can help game developers QA their games faster, better, and weed out the bugs, I think, along the way, we’re all aligned, and we would love that. If we could get game developers to have the opportunity to create better, to check through typos and things like that, to create better games, I think we all want that. So I think that’s the way that we see it.</p><p>One of the things that we’re building, for example, at Razer is what we call a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676444/razer-is-making-its-ai-tools-available-to-all-developers">QA companion</a>. So QA tends to be an expensive endeavor. Like the gamer doesn’t see it at the end of the day, but it can take up like 30 to 40 percent of the cost, or delay games for the longest time. Now, what we’ve done is create a companion, a tool that works with the human QA tester to be able to automatically fill in forms, to say, “Okay, if this is…” Say the form is a Jira ticket, to say “this is a bug that is identified, there’s a graphical bug, there’s a performance bug.” All that’s logged very quickly, so it’s sent to the developer at the same time. The developer then can go in and say, “Okay, this is how I’ll fix the bug,” or, “These are suggestions on how I fix the bug.”</p><p>The way that we see it is that AI is a tool to help game developers make better games. In this case, rather than replacing human creativity — and that’s something I personally feel very passionately about — we want to figure out how we use AI in the gaming industry to get AI to do things better. In the broader scheme of things, I think that’s what we have been focused on. But there are other reasons why I think gamers are unhappy with AI, and I agree with them. I don’t like slop either, right? That’s one. Two, is it raising the cost of RAM? It is also raising the cost of RAM. I don’t like that at the same time.</p><p>Back in the day, there was the GPUs versus crypto situation and things like that, and this is the same thing. So I do think, however, that all gamers would love better games, more fun games, more engaging games, and if AI can help create that by doing better QA, I mean, I’m all for it.</p><p><strong>I want to poke at that a little bit harder, but let me just ask you: is Razer feeling the RAM crunch and the GPU crunch like everybody else?</strong></p><p>Oh, yes, absolutely. Because we make laptops and things like that.</p><p><strong>How badly has that affected you?</strong></p><p>I mean, we haven’t announced the prices for the next round of laptops, for example, and this is something that concerns me because the RAM prices are going up, and we want to be able to make sure our laptops remain affordable and within the reach of gamers out there. But it has been moving. It is such a volatile situation at this point in time that it’s hard for us to even figure out what the pricing is at this junction.</p><p><strong>Do you think you’ll be able to pick a number and be confident in that number by the time the laptops have to come out?</strong></p><p>I don’t know if I can pick a number right now as I speak with you, and by the end of the podcast.</p><p><strong>Yeah, that’s bad.</strong></p><p>It is bad. It is bad right now.</p><p><strong>You have competitors in the PC industry like Apple, Microsoft, and others. They can move their margins around. They have services, businesses, and stuff that attach to these laptops. Maybe they’ll take a hit on the RAM because you’re gonna have to pay for iCloud for the rest of your life, or whatever it is you’re gonna do. You don’t have that kind of secondary business. Is that more of a danger to you?</strong></p><p>Well, we do have a secondary business of sorts. So hardware is a big part of our business. We actually have a services payments business where we do payments for a lot of the game companies out there, and that’s one of the strategies that we use to try to make our products more available to everyone. That’s the way that we kind of see it.</p><p>We are an ecosystem of sorts. We do great hardware, I think, for game developers and the gamers out there. But we’ve got a software platform that we are able to bring across to all the gamers out there. And of course, it’s a services business at the same time. But the RAM situation, at the end of the day, is still an evolving situation right now.</p><p><strong>Do you think it will cap out, and do you think we’ll have enough data center capacity, and things will go back to normal?</strong></p><p>I wish I knew. I really don’t.</p><p><strong>Is there a point at which the price of RAM, or the price of a marginal Nvidia GPU, becomes too high for you to sustainably do laptops at your scale?</strong></p><p>I would say I’m hoping that it doesn’t come to that, right? I think, in short, we’ve seen this happen with the industry multiple times in the past, spiked in terms of pricing. What’s great is that as long as manufacturing kicks in, and we are able to kind of keep up, it’s just economics at the end of the day. There is a spike in terms of pricing. We believe that at some point it will come down. What goes up must come down, and what goes down at some point goes up, too.</p><p><strong>Let me come back to what you’re saying about AI and development. AI is the future of gaming. You’ve announced products here, and we’ve talked about Ava, the headset with the cameras and the AI stuff in it. That’s consumer AI products, right? Those are consumer products. And you’re saying your bet is on AI helping developers make better games faster. There’s a gap there, right? </strong></p><p><strong>AI is the future of gaming is an all-encompassing tag line. It means a lot of things to a lot of people, but it sounds like your bet is very specifically in sort of the more enterprise side of the house, helping developers do games better. Is it correct that it’s much narrower than what people are perceiving?</strong></p><p>Well, I think the tag line’s very broad, but it’s easier to do a catchier tag line when it’s a broad tag line, as opposed to when it’s hardware we look at or software and stuff like that. But in short, for us, we run an ecosystem. We’ve got hardware, we’ve got software with services. Starting with the hardware, I think we do see that AI is going to be part of the whole kind of conversation. The way that we look at it would be things like whether it’s AI companions, or whether it’s making smart headphones, like with Motoko. We see all of this as augmenting what’s happening today, not replacing it.</p><p>So it’s not a gen AI conversation that we’ve got. It’s about how we bring the smarts, where we design products, and how we bring additional value to our users. For example, using our gaming headphones, all of a sudden, we can provide additional AI capabilities. Is that great? Absolutely. So, that’s one of the things that we’re looking at from a hardware perspective.</p><p>Now, from a software and services perspective, as we work with the game developers and publishers, and so on and so forth, we look at additional tools that can make their games better. We can work closely with them on a QA companion basis, for example. And then some of these core technologies, as we provide for them, can then make better games, over and above. So I believe that at some point, it’s not just games, but AI is just gonna be so prevalent or ubiquitous that every single vertical, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, is gonna have some elements of AI there. And we are just going along with it.</p><p><strong>I’ve heard this pitch a lot, and I have a lot of reactions to it. But I guess the simplest way of asking this question is, what have you seen that makes the bet worth it? Because I’ve evaluated a lot of these AI products, the merch team has reviewed a ton of them. We have literally just tried to do the things that Microsoft says you can do in the ads, and the products don’t work. Right? There’s this massive gap between what everyone says is gonna happen, or should be happening, and what is actually happening in the products.</strong></p><p><strong>You know, to be a cynic about it for the sake of getting a laugh out of this audience, I will tell you the products are best at convincing you that you should love them, and doing crimes, and they’re not so good at identifying what’s on your screen and helping you get a task done. They are really good at that in the domain of software development, right?</strong></p><p><strong>I can see why you’re pushing there with game developers. It’s obvious that Claude Code has ushered in some kind of revolution, and Cursor has ushered in some kind of revolution. In your vertical, you have something to offer that is different. But in the broad sense, this belief that it’s all just gonna happen, I think, has come up against the reality of what the products can do today. So what have you seen that suggests we will overcome that gap that makes you so confident?</strong></p><p>Well, occasionally I go on podcasts where the guy is more concerned that someone’s gonna fall in love with my product in the long run. And I think maybe there’s something there. No, but you see, it’s early days. It could completely be the worst possible idea. It could completely go off the rails and become off the spectrum, where it’s just the most phenomenal product that somebody completely falls in love with, so on and so forth, right? And I think the reality is gonna be something in between. The way that we see it, it’s probably closer to bringing more value to people, and that’s what we want to be able to do.</p><p>We want to be able to get to the point where AI is going to be helpful to all customers, all users. And that’s also one good example where, at CES… I was just looking at some of the stats, and they said, “What’s the biggest buzz at CES?” And there were a lot, like Ava, Motoko, and things like that. And for what it’s worth, we’ve literally just put vision capabilities, audio capabilities on a headphone, and combined it with AI. It’s not a quantum leap from a hardware design perspective, but it has captured so much imagination at this point in time. People are going, “Oh, wow. Now I can bring AI on the go with me at any point in time.” It’s truly something revolutionary at this juncture. So the way that we see it, and maybe that’s something that–</p><p><strong>Wait.</strong></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Can we just hit pause on that? What specifically do you think is revolutionary about having the AI and the cameras in the headphones with you all the time?</strong></p><p>Well, I would say that, first off, we are really looking at being able to have an unobtrusive universal form factor to enable AI smarts.</p><p><strong>I think the whole industry is looking for this one factor, right? This is like when I hear about the platform shift, you suddenly had this massive input device paradigm shift, right? We’re going from touchscreens or mice to voice and vision. I get that. No one has sorted out that form factor, so your bet is headphones.</strong></p><p>Our bet is on headphones in the sense that we don’t necessarily have to retrain human beings as a whole with an entirely new form factor. And so I don’t have to change any behavior of sorts. Boom, tomorrow we can get you AI smarts immediately. And that, I think, is the promise. There’s a disconnect today with the possibility of AI and what it could be, and that’s where we see ourselves as designers, having that responsibility, or the opportunity, so to speak, to be able to design in such a way that we don’t necessarily have to change the entire behavior.</p><p>For what it’s worth, in the very early days, it could be, for that matter, a mouse. It’s just a mouse. Why is a mouse so important that today we’ve brought it from a mouse all the way to a gaming mouse, and now the gaming mouse is a broader category than productivity, right? Gaming mice right now dominate the mouse category at this point in time. And right now, we can call it a smart headphone, and that’s the way we see it. We don’t necessarily have to retrain everybody to say, “Oh, you’ve gotta put on glasses. You’ve gotta be able to bear with the weight,” and things like that.</p><p>So that is one of the things that we’re doing with Motoko, and a lot of the work that we do is actually on the software side of things, right? How do we ensure that we get context faster? How do we ensure that we are able to do all of that? So it’s both hardware/software fusion and a sense of fusion at the same time, that we are really focused on in terms of bringing the experience over. That’s something that we believe is the reason why people go, “Oh, I absolutely get it, right now, why I would want something like that.”</p><p><strong>So the model in the Motoko that I saw is ChatGPT. </strong></p><p>It is ChatGPT.</p><p><strong>Why’d you pick ChatGPT for the headphones and Grok for Ava?</strong></p><p>So, ChatGPT for the headphones was primarily more from the premise that we think it’s a good assistant, in terms of CV capabilities, identifying things, and being able to give very quick feedback at the same time. But it could very well run Grok also at the same time. And the way that we are kind of presenting this is that whether it’s for Ava, or whether it’s for Motoko, or any of our other products, we are multi-model.</p><p>That was one of the things that we wanted to be able to do. We believe that at some point in time, you see Gemini doing really well. We see Grok doing really, really well. We see ChatGPT having advances in various aspects. This race to intelligence is just great for all of us as consumers, right? When I mention that Grok has great conversational AI, I think it is the best for conversational AI at this point in time. ChatGPT’s doing great, I think, in terms of it as an assistant, for reasoning and things like that. And that’s what we see ourselves. We see ourselves as owning the vertical from a gaming perspective, being able to work with all the best intelligence or the AI out there, and then bringing and designing a product or service tailored for our users, and within the gaming vertical.</p><p><strong>So the vision is that I’m wearing headphones that have cameras, microphones, and speakers. I’m walking through the airport, and I’m just asking it, “Where is my gate?” and it’s telling me the answer from ChatGPT. Or is it more that I’m sitting at my desk playing a game and it’s helping me through the game?</strong></p><p>All of the above. You can literally do that with Motoko at this point in time.</p><p><strong>But this is what I mean about the capability gap. I think if I walk through the airport and I ask ChatGPT where my gate is, it would not get that right at this point in time. Like, there’s a model capability gap there.</strong></p><p>I believe that if you use ChatGPT today and you’re providing snapshots with some context, like, let’s say, location, to a certain extent, you could. I would be messaging on my phone with ChatGPT, for example, and it could give me the reasoning to be able to bring me there, to a great extent. I’ll give an example, right? I would literally use ChatGPT for a whole bunch of day-to-day tasks and stuff like that. It’s got great reasoning; it’s able to do that. And now we are layering on vision capabilities, and that’s just another level of input.</p><p>Over and above, we’ve got far-field microphones. So audio capabilities also come to bear. With all of this, we’re able to give a lot more information across to ChatGPT, which does all the reasoning, I think, for us. And that’s where we see it coming through. So constantly, the smart or intelligence is part of how we see us designing AI hardware, at this point in time.</p><p><strong>It seems like you have a pretty big reliance on the models themselves, right? You’re obviously not training your own models. You wanna be multi-model, you wanna let people choose. Are you thinking of yourself more as being the best at the hardware, the form factor, and having the best microphones and cameras, and that will let people use the models more conveniently?</strong></p><p>Well, we are an ecosystem, but I think for gamers. It’s not just, I think, in terms of the hardware, but most of our work is actually done at the software side. If I use CES as an example, if I’ve got Ava, when I wake up, it’s giving me information like what’s happening in the day and what my day is gonna be today, so on and so forth. When I get out of my apartment, and I go out into the street, to the subway, et cetera, then I’ve got Motoko at the same time. But with persistent memory, it will know exactly what has been happening in the home. Ava is somewhat following me everywhere in my day. I’m not gonna fall in love with it yet.</p><p>But in short, it’s following my day, I’m going around, I’m looking at it, I’m asking for directions. When I get to the office, I could literally still be with Motoko, which is another form factor. So the way that we see it is that the intelligence is persistent, and it follows you. The form factors that are presented are hardware form factors. It’s a little bit like how we’ve designed our product at this point in time. We have a singular software platform where we are able to give you a great gaming experience, over and above. You could be using one of our mice, our keyboards, and so on and so forth, a laptop. These are just representations, at the end of the day. And that’s how we designed it, and there are particular problems that we need to solve that the models don’t provide for us. You know, context.</p><p>So that’s one of the things that our AI scientists do really well. We’ve got advanced retrieval augmented generation (RAG), we’ve got context, and we really focus on that. Persistent memory is something that we are very good at, at the same time. And these are fundamental problems that AI scientists need to solve. These are the things that our team does, so we work with the best models out there. And we also have the capabilities of creating physical representations, and that’s something that we’ve got a huge advantage at.</p><p><strong>Doesn’t a lot of the value here just accrue back to these models? And yet, even if you’re building all this stuff above the models and around the models to make them work the way you want, it seems like, “Okay, my Ava is gonna be powered by ChatGPT no matter what.” If I want that unified experience, I’m just kind of, at the end of the day, talking to an instantiation of ChatGPT all day long, right? </strong></p><p><strong>Because then I have Grok over here and ChatGPT in the headphones, you can’t unify that. So at the end of the day, it’s all Gemini, or whatever model I choose. So, can you provide enough value to charge a premium on top of the ChatGPT subscription to make that work?</strong></p><p>So that’s, I think, where our angle is, from the software perspective. We believe that we can bring enough value of persistence across to the user, and progressively we will see even more users who will say, “Look, this is what I want, to be able to go from one model to another,” for example. Or if I’m happy with just a single model, and if I’m a techie and I’m happy to just go directly and play around with it, we provide that open platform. So being open is one of the things that we truly believe in.</p><p><strong>One of the things you notice when you cover AI enough is the idea that the AI startups are just wrappers on OpenAI, and then eventually OpenAI will just eat them as the models get more incapable. We’ve seen that play out already a little bit. </strong></p><p><strong>You obviously have hardware. Razer’s a different business, but you can see that dynamic here, where the core model capability might start to get the memory you’re talking about, where the core model capability might start to get the persistent personality across devices that you’re talking about. </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/827607/openai-hardware-prototype-chatgpt-jony-ive-sam-altman"><strong>OpenAI is making hardware</strong></a><strong>, we are told. There’s a competition with the core provider that is coming in different dimensions. How are you thinking about that?</strong></p><p>Well, I think the entire tech industry has always been wrappers, for that matter, not necessarily from an AI perspective, but it’s the question of when you build a wrapper, do you provide enough value from the wrapper that you build? And that’s the thing, where it’s also very hard for anyone to be all things to all people. And I don’t think OpenAI wants to be all things to all people. I don’t think Grok wants to be all things to all people.</p><p>For us, we tend to be very focused on our vertical. We are not tempted to try to produce something else different at any point in time. And our vertical is really for the gamers. This is something we’ve got huge domain knowledge in terms of what the gamers want, what the game developers want. We’ve got distribution; we’ve got about 70,000 game developers using our SDK. We’ve got 150 million gamers on our software platform. We’ve got distribution, I think, across to that. Can the models go out there and try to build the distribution? Yes, but do they prefer to partner?</p><p>And I think the answer is they do prefer to partner. Fundamentally, we have a huge amount of data, I think, on the gamers, their preferences, what they want, what they like, and that we can bring that across to the models at the same time, which is our IP, for that matter. I think with that in mind, as I say, having all these verticals, you may call it building wrappers of sorts, but these are very deep wrappers that we have to build. A lot of customization, a lot of building, and it’s more than just hardware, right? It’s not hardware.</p><p>As I say, the hardware is just part of the equation. It’s the software part that we need to do. It’s the R and D work that we need to do, for example, to get persistence in this space and context. So to get the context for our users, that’s where our data comes in at the same time, to be able to kind of pivot and focus on that.</p><p><strong>I think one of the reasons people like companies like Razer, and like dealing with products that Razer makes, is that you just buy them and you’re done. Like you can just buy the mouse, and then you own it, and it’s fine. You can just buy the laptop. I’m not in an ongoing subscription relationship with you, unless I want to be.</strong></p><p>Sure.</p><p><strong>One of your competitors, Hanneke Faber from Logitech, </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206847/logitech-ceo-hanneke-faber-mouse-keyboard-gaming-decoder-podcast-interview"><strong>came on the show</strong></a><strong> a year or two ago, and she was like, “I wanna build a forever mouse,” and what she meant was a subscription mouse, and she’s never coming back on the show again, I think, </strong><a href="https://gizmodo.com/logitech-ceo-wants-to-sell-you-a-subscription-based-forever-mouse-2000480678"><strong>based</strong></a> <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2419903/logitech-forever-mouse-was-just-a-bad-idea.html"><strong>on</strong></a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-mice/logitechs-forever-mouse-could-mean-peripherals-go-the-way-of-coffee-beans-tvs-and-printer-ink-by-pushing-a-subscription/"><strong>the</strong></a> <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/31/logitech-ceo-forever-mouse-hanneke-faber-ai-hardware/"><strong>reaction</strong></a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/logitech-has-an-idea-for-a-forever-mouse-thatrequires-a-subscription/"><strong>to</strong></a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214857/logitech-subscription-mouse-decoder-podcast-hanneke-faber"><strong>that</strong></a><strong>. That’s my understanding of how they felt about that interview. </strong></p><p><strong>All the things you’re talking about are ongoing relationships, ongoing development costs. I hear it, and I hear the promise. I also hear, “I’m gonna have to pay a fee every month.” Like this is where that comes from. You need to pay the developers, you need to pay for cloud uptime to make the AI system alive. How much are you gonna charge for all of that?</strong></p><p>Well, we’ve always had an ongoing relationship with our customer. That’s the thing, right? The way that we see it from Razer is that when somebody buys a Razer mouse, they tend to buy another Razer mouse in the future. They expand the devices that they own from us. So we’ve always had a long-term relationship with our customer, from that perspective. At some point in time, as we think through the whole AI uptime, so on and so forth… I mean, we’ve had cloud costs also in the past, maintaining profiles in clouds. For us, I think that’s one of the things that we want to figure out. What can we do to ensure that we bring value?</p><p>I think that’s our obsession. If there is no value, our customers won’t pay for it, we won’t pay for it ourselves, right? So to that end, that’s our focus, I think, in respect of it. And it could be through… We build into the hardware cost, for that matter, if that makes sense, and I’ll be candid: We have literally not thought through this in great detail. But the way that we see it is, how do we identify that value to the user? And from there we are very clear, we message this. This is the value that we see out of this, and we’ll let the market decide.</p><p><strong>I look at that reaction from gamers, probably, to AI in the industry. There’s slop. I think there’s a lot of reaction to slop, and there’s a lot of reaction to game studios being in whatever amount of crisis the game studios appear to be in. There’s whatever reaction to consolidation. And then there’s the relentless fee seeking from the games industry, that everything is gonna be a subscription, everything is gonna be free to play with DLC, everything is gonna be an ongoing, recurring cost, over and over and over again. </strong></p><p><strong>The industry’s really moved to that model across the board, and I think people are feeling that pain. So then they hear AI, and they say, “Okay, someone else is gonna ask me for 10 bucks a month, or 20 bucks a month.” Can you avoid that? Can you just price it into the hardware? Is that going to be inevitable?</strong></p><p>So, as I mentioned, I don’t know if we’re gonna price it into the hardware. We are still figuring it out. But I would say that, at the end of the day, the question is how much value are you getting on it, right? I mean, I pay for Spotify because I see the value in paying for Spotify. I get a whole library of music, and so on, and with Xbox Game Pass, so on and so forth.</p><p>There are times when I would prefer... I mean, I look back, and I go like, “Oh, I wish I could just pay one time for this title.” There are microtransactions, there are subscription fees. But at the end of the day, I think, myself as a consumer, myself as a gamer, I would say… I would just look at anything. I would say if it’s worth that amount of money to me, I would pay for it. Otherwise, I’ll vote with my wallet. That’s the way I see it.</p><p><strong>Are you seeing signs that the AI stuff is gonna be worth paying for that way? I mean, this is the bubble. We’re gonna spend all this money, we’ll forward invest in all this infrastructure. We’re gonna skyrocket the price of RAM and GPUs, and then at the end of the day, people are going to say, “That’s not actually worth the 20 bucks a month.”</strong></p><p>I don’t necessarily see it as AI, per se, but I see the kind of value that I get out of it. So, for example, a ChatGPT subscription, or a Grok subscription, for that matter. I do see value in it, and that’s why I pay for it. And that’s the way I see it. I don’t see myself as paying for AI, per se. I see it as what am I getting out of a chatbot, for example, that can advise me on travel matters, health matters, whatever it is, my day-to-day, and stuff like that. Is that worth 20 bucks to me?</p><p><strong>Because you’re a billionaire, right?</strong></p><p>Sure.</p><p><strong>I’m just saying, the marginal cost is meaningless to you.</strong></p><p>20 bucks is still 20 bucks, that’s right.</p><p><strong>I’m just saying.</strong></p><p>Right.</p><p><strong>I think for a lot of people, that is meaningful, especially stacked on top of all the other money they pay. Basically, I’m saying, do you see that critique of AI as a bubble? That the investment has not yet delivered the value that will make it so obvious that the investment’s worth it?</strong></p><p>So I see that. I mean, huge amounts of investments are going into it. We are investing in AI, I think, as we speak. But I do see the potential at this point. In many cases, I mean, look at the number of paid subscribers for ChatGPT, for example. People do see the value in terms of whether it’s a chatbot AI, so on and so forth. I do think the potential is going to be realized.</p><p>Now, in many cases, I think there will be AI slop. I mean, I’ve paid for subscriptions that, at the start, I thought were gonna be great, but I’ve canceled them. But I do believe that in many cases, and in some cases that we have not even envisaged yet, the potential will be realized.</p><p><strong>Let me ask you broadly, I mean, you obviously talk a lot to game developers. You and I actually were just talking backstage about the nature of art in the age of AI, and the nature of craft. That industry is going through an enormous amount of turmoil right now. What do you think the outcome looks like? What do you think makes that all feel good at the end?</strong></p><p>I would say that the outcome that we see, and I think it’s gonna be the likely outcome, is that AI tools are gonna be helping human developers develop faster and better. And I think that’s the natural outcome, where we’re talking about graduating, whether it’s an analog kind of way of creating art versus digital. And I think it’s gonna be the same thing.</p><p>We’re going to see human artists use AI tools to kind of really bring their vision to life. We’ll see new forms of artists, artists of whom may not necessarily have been so adept in terms of using a paint brush or using Photoshop, now being able to kind of wordsmith and craft great pieces of art with prompts throughout. So that’s, I think, what’s going to happen, where we will see even more human creators, now with the help of more tools.</p><p>Maybe I’m an optimist, but I really, truly see that AI tools will come to fall, because at some point in time, we’re going to see so much slop out there that we’re going to crave for really great art, really great design. And that’s what’s gonna happen. We’ve seen a cycle go over and over and over again.</p><p>So, with the amount of slop out there, we’re going to see some level of art rise to the top, and that kind of art may still be created with the same tools that created the slop, but with great care, with great discernment, to be able to do something truly different. The difference will come from human ingenuity, not from countless prompt mashing, so to speak.</p><p><strong>So I feel like I have to ask you this now. What games are you playing right now?</strong></p><p>Oh, it depends.</p><p><strong>What meets the bar?</strong></p><p>What meets the bar? I play a lot of single-player games at this point in time, like Civilization and stuff like that. I still do a lot of that. I do play some MMOs of sorts, shooters, and I still play a lot of the battle royale genre. So things like that.</p><p><strong>You just named genres. What games are you playing that meet the bar?</strong></p><p>That meet which bar?</p><p><strong>You’re talking about human ingenuity and creativity. What games are you playing right now that meet the bar?</strong></p><p>Oh, well, I play random stuff. If you’re talking about human ingenuity… I even play some of the Roblox games at this point in time, right? But a lot of the games, and maybe I talked broadly in terms of genres primarily because I appreciate the human ingenuity that’s gone into the genres themselves.</p><p>One hundred people dropped on an island with a circle that comes through. I mean, while I enjoy the game itself, I also appreciate the mechanics, the thought that has gone into them, and the premise that the designer has figured out. In PUBG, for example, it’s this primal instinct of humans to be the last man standing, so to speak. So it’s things like that that I appreciate, and I think it’s art.</p><p><strong>Okay. What’s next for Razer? What should people be looking for?</strong></p><p>More of the same, I would say, in the sense. When I say more of the same, I’d say nothing has changed from day one for us, and that has always been our mantra. And we used to say, all the time, that the mantra for us… Our “for gamers, by gamers” mantra has really followed us from day one, where the gaming industry didn’t really exist as an industry, even the hardware industry or software, and so on and so forth.</p><p>We believe that we’ve designed products for ourselves that we enjoy, that I enjoy using at any point in time, and that tomorrow, when the gaming industry grows dramatically, we will still be focused on games. Even though there are multiple opportunities for us to kind of expand out there. And even now, when we talk about the gaming industry in somewhat of a doldrums at this juncture, I believe that we’re gonna see the next great genre come through, right? Whether it’s MMOs in the early days, MOBAs, and then battle royales, we’re gonna see the next great genre. We’re hoping to see Grand Theft Auto VI at some point in time, right?</p><p>So all that, we look forward to, but we’re just pretty much laser-focused. It’s just that the demographic has really changed. The word gamer has also changed through the years. The games have changed through the years, right? For us, we’re just sitting here, very focused, and designing great products for ourselves.</p><p><strong>Min, this has been great.

            <p>A first major update for Minecrafty block-build-and-basher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> arrived over the weekend, and it's added in some extra danger. There are now dinosaurs running around in the underground jungles. These are work-in-progress dinos, so who knows what might happen if you end up earning their big lizard ire. Also, the in-game bedtime's now half past seven.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These things and more can be found in the update's <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-patch-notes-update-1">beefy notes</a>. The dinos and other NPCs which now roam the underground jungles use "placeholder behavious" for the moment, and you'll need to generate some new unexplored areas in the biome in order to have them pop up.</p>
<p>Outside of that, some inhabitants of Hytale's blockverse have had knockback resistance added to them, the likes of foxes have been made less gung-ho about attacking folks, and fire-themed characters can't take fire damage. "Skeletons should no longer take drowning damage," developers Hypixel add, seemingly hedging their bets in case bony bathing continues to prove fatal on occasion. Kweebecs and Trorks have also had a couple of tweaks made to them.</p>
<p>Outside of those, a few extra options have been added to the character creator, while the audio/visuals attached to hitting and breaking various materials have been made a bit more crunchy. "You can now sleep starting at 7:30 PM" reads another noteworthy note, with Hytale's previous earliest bedtime having been 9:00PM.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-first-hotfix-targets-crash-inducing-hairdos-and-buckets-as-its-devs-outline-update-plans-for-the-next-few-months">you'd imagine</a>, the update's also heavy on key bug fixes and crash abatement, plus less glamourous quality-of-life tweaks like ensuring weapon attacks check for line of sight. Hytale being like Minecraft, you can of course also turn to mods for minor tweaks which eliminate any remaining annoyances official updates have yet to deliver. Or, you know, if you think the game needs <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/not-enough-poops">several different variants of poo</a>.</p>
<p>If you're still yet to give Hytale a go, we've got handy guides to the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-how-to-play-multiplayer-dedicated-server-hosting">setting up a server</a>, getting it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-hytale-on-steam-deck">running on the Steam Deck</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-how-to-get-cobalt">hunting down key materials</a>.</p>

            <guid>1410013</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>First responders, including six fire engines, descended upon Rockstar Games’ Edinburgh office, Rockstar North, early on Monday following reports of structural damage to the offices of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-new-trailer-rockstar-1851779300"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> maker</a>. The result of an apparent explosion of some kind, the incident thankfully left no one injured.</p> <p>“We were alerted at 5:02 a.m. on Monday, 19 January to attend an incident on Holyrood Road, Edinburgh,” a spokesperson for emergency crews <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25776012.gta6-dev-rockstar-north-building-taped-off-boiler-explosion/">told <em>The Herald</em></a>. “Operations Control mobilized three fire appliances and specialist resources to the scene, where firefighters worked to secure structural damage at a commercial building. There were no reported casualties and crews left the scene at 9:21 a.m.”</p>

 <p>According to Rockstar, the explosion was the result of a boiler malfunction and the studio remains fully operational as it prepares for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860">launch of <em>GTA 6</em> in November</a>.</p> <p>“Early Monday morning, there was a malfunction in one of the heating boilers at Rockstar North,” a spokesperson for Rockstar Games told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> in an email. “Many thanks to those that reached out with concern, and also to the police and fire crews who were on scene quickly to assess the situation–please know that everyone is well and our studio remains open and operational.”</p>

 <p>The office has recently been at the center of an ongoing labor dispute with 31 fired developers who were <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">trying to unionize</a>. The workers claim they were targeted for trying to organize while Rockstar maintains they were fired for violations of confidentiality rules, including leaking <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-multiplayer-one-detail-leak-court-docs-player-count-32-rockstar-2000659780">development and gameplay details</a> in a union Discord channel with outside observers.</p>

 <p>A judge reviewing the case recently denied the fired <em>GTA 6</em> devs <a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-wins-initial-ruling-against-fired-gta-6-devs-we-regret-that-we-were-put-in-a-position-where-dismissals-were-necessary-2000658984">immediate relief</a> in the form of back pay, but a full ruling on the overall merits of the complaint is still pending.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Much in the same way that I started this year by telling my loved ones I would cut down my portion sizes in 2026 to attend to my ageing body, Zenimax Online Studios began the year by saying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-yearly-expansions-and-folding-its-premium-content-into-the-base-game-but-its-also-gaining-a-battle-pass">they would be releasing smaller updates for Elder Scrolls Online</a> to refresh the MMO's creakier content.</p>
<p>Both Edler Scrolls Online and I shall end 2026 leaner and able to climb stairs without our knees popping.</p>
<p>But, in announcing its move from Expansion-sized chapters released every 12 - 18 months to smaller Season updates released every three months, it wasn't clear what this meant for new zones. Would the world of Tamriel stay locked at its current size, with additional areas being too large a thing to add in a Season update?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Many players have expressed concern that we're not doing zones anymore," game director Nick Giacomini tells me in a follow-up interview, "That's not true. We are. We are doing zones, and we're going to talk more about that very soon."</p>
<p>While Giacomini won't be drawn on exactly where may be added to Tamriel next, he said "I think players will be happy when they see what's coming in the next twelveish months."</p>
<p>Though, he does say players should expect changes on what to expect from a new zone. "With [zones], like everything, we're asking ourselves instead of just 'Here's a zone, exactly the way that you've experienced zones [before],' we're taking a look at it at a fundamental level. What can we change here to make this more interesting, exciting and in line with what players want, so it'll be a different flavour."</p><p>Explaining the miscommunication, executive producer Susan Kath says "We had 45 minutes to deliver a huge amount of information, much of which is difficult to convey when we can't actually show it yet." One area players are wanting more information is around Tamriel Tomes, the MMOs new battle pass system. "It would be a heck of a lot easier if I could just be like, 'Here, I'm in the game. Let me show you exactly what I mean by this'," continues Kath. They will be adding clarifying details in live streams, AMAs, and explanatory posts in the coming months.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>While Giacomini won't talk about what or how new zones will be added to Elder Scrolls Online, he will say how the team plan to enrich the world of Tamriel. In the same stream when they announced the move to Seasons, Giacomini and Kath explained that Orsinium, Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, and the Imperial City will be folded into the base game. Previously these locations and their associated quests were all held back as premium content.</p>
<p>This broadening of the base game, Giacomini argues, will lead to more opportunities for all players. "It gives us more flexibility. When we wanted to make something available for all players in the past that meant, we had to design within these base game zones. And while those zones are big, you're doing yet another series of quests in Auridon, or what have you. This enables the design team to explore more."</p><p>Now a quest can be made available to all players that takes them from Auridon to the Imperial City with a stop off in Orsinium without the designers needing to worry about what expansions a player has bought. Giacomini says before the team would ask themselves, "If we do, that means only X percent of players are going to be able to participate."</p>
<p>Again, Giacomini falls short of saying what these news quests will be, but he points to what was said in the announcement stream. "We talked about Western <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> being folded in as well. Chronologically, that's much later than Somerset. But it makes sense, because we're going to be releasing something within the Skyrim areas, and we want to allow as many players as possible to participate."</p>
<p>This broader canvas upon which to draw new questlines sounds promising, bringing new life to old areas. We still have to wait and see how well Zenimax Online Studios delivers on its promises for these smaller updates. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-smaller-expansions-are-not-in-any-way-a-result-of-last-years-layoffs">Giacomini and Kath say that the team's capacity to deliver wasn't impacted by last year's layoffs</a>. The truth of that will be proved in March with the launch of Season Zero.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-clears-out-its-magsafe-charger-stand-at-its-lowest-price-charge-your-iphone-apple-watch-and-airpods-for-less-2000659479</link>
            <guid>1409992</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The multi-functional, portable Anker MagSafe Charger Stand powers your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods simultaneously in one location. This compact cube connects to an outlet via a single USB-C AC adapter connection and can be easily placed on any available desktop or nightstand. On top of the stand is a fold-down charger for an Apple Watch, and on the bottom of the unit is a designated area for wireless charging cases for AirPods. Plus, you can fold up the entire unit and take it with you if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6773/">Go to Amazon to purchase the Anker 3-in-1 Multi-Device Wireless Charging Stand for just $97, saving $53 and reducing the price by approximately 35% from the original $150.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6773/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2><span>Set it on your desktop, charge everything, and forget about it </span></h2>
<p><span>The design of Anker’s 3-in-1 multi-device wireless charging stand allows you to place your iPhone in a horizontal position to view your screen, and place your Apple Watch on top of the unit and your wireless charging case for AirPods at the bottom, all in a relatively uncluttered manner. In addition, the iPhone portion of the unit is adjustable, allowing you to view your screen in both portrait and landscape orientations. Also, the stand is collapsible and can fit in a small drawer or travel pouch when collapsed.</span></p>
<p>As part of the Anker MagSafe wireless charging system, the unit supports MagSafe-compatible iPhone models with up to 15 watts of fast wireless charging. The internal magnets ensure the iPhone lines up correctly and that you don’t have to slide it around to find the optimal charging spot every time. The charging dock for your iPhone holds it steady in either portrait or landscape orientation, allowing you to view your screen while it charges.</p>



<p>Support for Apple Watches is extensive, covering most models. The raised platform for the watch allows the bands to hang naturally, and the back of the watch rests on the charging surface, eliminating the need to bend your watch straps into awkward positions. The base of the unit includes a pad specifically designed for wireless charging cases for AirPods, providing a specific charging location for your earbuds rather than forcing you to share the space with your iPhone.</p>
<p>A major advantage of this wireless charging stand’s travel-friendly design is that it can be used even when you don’t have access to multiple outlets. Closed, the unit appears to be a standard small black plastic box with a single USB-C port on the side so that it won’t snag on anything else in your backpack or carry-on. When opened next to a bed or on a small table, it eliminates the need for three separate charging stations while requiring only a single outlet.</p>

            <p>The release date for Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter Marathon has seemingly leaked via an Xbox Store pre-order trailer.</p>
<p>According to this trailer, Marathon will be released on 5th March. There was also mention of a Deluxe Edition.</p>

<p>The trailer itself has since been removed from its original source, though the footage with Marathon's release date can still be found online.</p>
<p>"Infil into the dark sci-fi world of Tau Ceti 4: A derelict colony rife with rival Runners, hostile UESC security forces, and unpredictable environments. Play with your crew, as a solo Runner, or form uneasy alliances with proximity chat,"  reads <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28">Marathon's official blurb</a>.</p>
<p>"Scavenge, buildcraft, and take on greater PvPvE challenges - culminating with the derelict Marathon ship hanging above."</p>

<p>Back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-months-after-being-delayed-indefinitely-bungies-troubled-marathon-finally-gets-release-window-and-price">Bungie confirmed Marathon would be released sometime in March</a>, though at this time it didn't give a specific day.</p>
<p>After announcing its March release window, Marathon's art director and veteran Bungie developer Joseph Cross announced his departure from the company. "I'm incredibly proud of the visual world we built for Marathon. Getting support at this scale for something a bit different is rare, and the art team at Bungie is the best in the biz. I'll be enjoying playing the game as a fan with all of you," Cross said last month.</p>
<p>"Massive thank you to everyone who has supported through all of it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-art-lead-departs-bungie-of-his-own-volition-ahead-of-games-new-release-date">Cross confirmed his departure from the studio was his own decision</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">it was discovered the extraction shooter used artist Antireal's work without permission</a>.</p>

            <p>It's safe to say <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is 2026's biggest indie hit so far, with the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">securely funding the next two years of development</a> before it was even out into early access last week. It seems the idea of a proper competitor to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> was a golden one, but that isn't stopping modders and passionate tinkerers from putting Minecraft <em>inside</em> Hytale.</p>
<p>On 17th January, X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/iamcxv711">iamcxv7</a> (Sadat Sahib/ssquadteam <a href="https://github.com/ssquadteam">on GitHub</a>) posted he'd gotten Minecraft running in Hytale's world map through "pure pixel data manipulation," which sounds pretty bonkers and signals the new blocky sensation may have a bright future ahead when it comes to modding and all sorts of experiments.</p> <div>

<p>The achievement was also shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qflbs7/got_minecraft_030_running_in_hytale_map/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">on Reddit</a>, where the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qflbs7/comment/o05iv7j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">full explanation of the process</a> was explained: "No GPU, no OpenGL calls - just pure CPU-based 3D rendering". In short, no one who's really into software and creative problem-solving knows what he's saying, but it's all impressive if you're aware of the basics. At the time of writing, the game "runs entirely server-side at 35 FPS with a resolution of 320x240," so this isn't a trick of playing a short gameplay video via Hytale and calling it a day. It is an old version of Minecraft (0.30) though. That doesn't exactly make it any less impressive, however.</p>
<p>Further digging through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SSquadTeam/submitted/">Sahib's Reddit profile</a> also reveals other stunners, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qfp9xb/gameboy_gameboy_colour_emulator_working_in_hytale/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">GB and GBC emulation</a> working through the same process (quite convincingly, I must add) and the entirety of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qg9lah/fully_functioning_windows_95_inside_hytale_wip/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Windows 95</a> reportedly running with no visible hiccups.

It must also be noted the game hasn't been released on Steam at the time of writing, making its success story on PC far more impressive as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">Valve's platform becomes the go-to place for millions of gamers</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rockstar-north-fire-explosion-grand-theft-auto-vi/</link>
            <guid>1409971</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Edinburgh fire crews rushed to the <strong>Rockstar North</strong> offices on Monday at 5 am BT after a reported "<em>explosion in a boiler room</em>," according to <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25776012.gta6-dev-rockstar-north-building-taped-off-boiler-explosion/">The Herald</a> and <a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp">Edinburgh Live</a>. Fire crews stayed on the scene at the <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong> developer's office for three hours, working to secure "<em>structural damage</em>" to the building. No casualties have been reported as a result of the incident.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the <strong>Scottish Fire and Rescue Service</strong> <strong>(SFRS)</strong> said, "<em>We were alerted at 5.02 am on Monday, 19 January to attend an incident on Holyrood Road, Edinburgh</em>," in a statement to The Herald. "<em>Operations Control mobilised three fire appliances and specialist resources to the scene, where firefighters worked to secure structural damage at a commercial building</em>. <em>There were no reported casualties and crews left the scene at 9.21 am</em>."</p>



<p>It's unclear what caused the reported explosion at the Rockstar North offices, as the situation continues to be investigated by Police Scotland, and the area reportedly remains cordoned off. Beyond the lack of reported casualties, no injuries have been reported either, a thankful result likely due to the fact that the incident happened so early in the morning.</p>



<p>While thankfully, no one was hurt from the incident, it's unclear how far the reported "<em>structural damage</em>" goes, and what other damage the fire caused to the building and the interior offices. Neither Rockstar or Take-Two Interactive have published a statement regarding the incident, though with Rockstar North being the lead studio for Grand Theft Auto VI, it's likely we'll hear something from Rockstar or Take-Two soon, even if it is just a statement directed towards the company's shareholders and not players, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">to say whether or not the incident will result in yet another delay fro GTA VI.</a></p>



<p>It's also perhaps the most unlikely way anyone thought we'd see the Rockstar North offices back in the news, as the Edinburgh office has been the center of a different story for the last few months. Back at the end of October 2025, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">Rockstar fired 34 workers</a></strong>, several from the Rockstar North offices, with others scattered across the UK and an additional three in Toronto, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/">alleging the workers had been leaking confidential information</a>. </p>



<p>The workers and their union, the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB), deny the allegations and instead accuse Rockstar of union-busting. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">IWGB has filed legal claims against Rockstar</a>, and most recently had <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-judge-denies-fired-rockstar-employees-interim-pay-iwgb/">its bid for interim relief for the fired workers <strong>denied</strong> by a UK judge</a>. </p>



<p>The firings have led to several protests outside of the Rockstar North offices, and Rockstar and Take-Two offices across the globe, including in Paris, New York, and at the Rockstar Toronto offices in Canada, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">Wccftech spoke with one of the workers fired from Rockstar Toronto and the CWA Canada media union that organized the demonstration</a>.</p>

Additionally, there have been "no reported casualties", so thankfully, it sounds like nobody's been hurt.</p><figure role="group">

<p>At present, it's thought that the explosion was caused by some kind of boiler issue; Dexerto says that "reports from the area" point to a boiler room as the source of the blast, so it sounds as though the damage was accidental, although it's hard to say this early on.</p><p>Just in case you need a reminder, Rockstar North is the studio responsible for <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is currently scheduled to be released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e57d7053-b3ca-42ed-afdb-4ef5c5958b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in November this year</a> after two <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fbc88268-1772-45bc-9881-7e2e1cd1ca6d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delays</a> pushed it back from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6fad3f9b-bebd-4488-8603-3fe30fd9ffe3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">original 2025 release window</a>.</p><p>The game is one of the most hotly-anticipated releases on the calendar this year. It'll follow two protagonists, Jason and Lucia, and it'll be set in the fictional state of Leonida, which is based on Florida (which means you'll be able to visit Vice City once again).</p><p>It's unclear whether the explosion will hamper <em>GTA 6</em>'s development any further. Let's hope that operations resume as normal and that employees are able to return to work safely.</p>
<p>This explosion also comes just a couple of months after Rockstar <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2fb963bf-6dd1-47b3-bfbd-3f16511b3076" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">fired a number of employees</a> who were involved in union activity, a move that parent company Take-Two insists wasn't motivated by union-busting.</p><p>Following that decision, hundreds of Rockstar employees <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-employees-letter" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="419ae453-4f41-4d14-ac9c-25d978963601" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">banded together to write an open letter</a> demanding the terminated employees' reinstatement, although it doesn't sound as though Take-Two acceded to that demand.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

But with <em>New Horizons</em>, some of that slowness became tedious: crafting its many items one at a time, painstakingly building cliffs and rivers by hand, picking up and placing objects one by one.</p><p>As I gathered when I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/845242/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-switch-2-edition-features">previewed</a> it last month, the newly released, free 3.0 update for <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> addresses those issues with quality-of-life fixes that still fit the spirit of <em>Animal Crossing</em>. It’s a small update in terms of content — there’s just enough here to give you a reason to revisit the game if you’ve been looking for one, and not much more than that — but major in reducing friction where there wasn’t meant to be any.</p><p>Separately, there’s also the new Switch 2 Edition, which noticeably improves <em>New Horizons</em>’ performance and ups its resolution. Otherwise, it doesn’t add anything that important — but for $4.99, it doesn’t really have to.</p><div><p id="nintendo-switch-2-edition"><h2>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</h2></p></div><p>The main appeal of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is the performance upgrade. On the original Switch, <em>New Horizons</em> would start to struggle as you placed more and more decorations around your island, sometimes to the point of severe frame rate drops. It meant that building out your island could also make it progressively less playable. My island is a pretty bare construction zone, so when I downloaded the Switch 2 upgrade, I visited several highly decorated Dream Addresses to test it out.</p><p>Anecdotally, I can say that there’s a significant improvement in how <em>New Horizons</em> runs, at least to my eye. All the Dream Addresses I visited were so busy with decor, from thickets of trees to loads of furniture covered in custom designs, that there were completely inaccessible areas — and I didn’t see any significant lag or choppiness like I’d expect on the original Switch version. It’s a boon for maximalist decorators, especially those of us who still want our islands to be functional amid chaotic and cluttered builds.</p><p>For me, that alone is worth the $5 upgrade. (If you don’t own the game already, the Switch 2 version is $65 to the original Switch’s $60.) Otherwise, the Switch 2 Edition doesn’t add anything you <em>need</em> to have. Nintendo did show a side-by-side comparison of the game’s improved resolution in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nODHyw3lgs&amp;t=1s">trailer for the upgrade</a>, but I didn’t really notice the difference (with the caveat that simple visual fidelity is not particularly important to me in most games). The new megaphone, which lets you use the Switch 2’s microphone to call the names of villagers and locate them, didn’t work well for me; I saw Fuchsia, walked a short distance away so she was out of frame, and called her name, but got no reply.</p><p>And then there are the Joy-Con mouse controls, which are available when decorating interiors, creating custom designs, and writing messages on the bulletin board. I’m sure there’s someone out there who will find the mouse controls useful or intuitive, but I am not that person. First of all, I originally played this game on a tiny Switch Lite screen and I’m really enjoying this new world of playing it on a TV, so forgoing my Pro Controller to slide the right Joy-Con around on my couch cushions is not a compelling proposition. But I also found that the sensitivity of the mouse controls actually made it harder for me to be precise about item placement.</p><div><p id="3-0-update"><h2>3.0 update</h2></p></div><p>The free 3.0 update, which is available on both the Switch and the Switch 2, feels like the bigger upgrade on the merits of the quality-of-life tweaks alone. I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/845242/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-switch-2-edition-features">wrote last month</a> that this update might actually get me to finish decorating my island, and I’ve already spent hours doing exactly that.</p><p>The most impactful change is one so minor, it wasn’t even called out in the update’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nODHyw3lgs&amp;t=1s">announcement trailer</a>: you can strafe.</p><p>Before, when you were decorating or terraforming or even gardening, you’d have to constantly reorient yourself. If you were building a cliff while facing north, for example, you’d have to build one block of the cliff, move a little bit to the right, then turn to face north again without accidentally walking too far north and missing your mark. I would usually do a little circle to position myself and make sure I was aiming the tool in the right place, and even then, I’d frequently be a <em>little</em> bit off and accidentally destroy the bit of cliffside I’d just built. It was so awkward and clunky that I cleared out my entire island in order to redesign it and then… stopped playing the game for four years.</p><p>Now, you can press L and your character will hop into place in the grid, and while holding L, you can move in any direction without changing the direction you’re facing. You still have to do all your terraforming by hand, but the process has been completely streamlined. Press L to line yourself up, build the cliff, move one space over to build the next piece. That’s it. I’ve used it to build and destroy cliffs and rivers, dig up rows of plants, lay down new paths, and even count how many spaces in the invisible grid I would need for a particular project. I’m actually having fun with construction now that the act of doing it isn’t a massive pain.</p><div><p>Resetti is now my best friend</p></div><p>On top of that, Resetti is here to help you clean up your island in what’s possibly the only process in this game that can be described as instantaneous. He can “reset” the entire island, just the beaches, or individual areas you walk to and designate for him, sending the furniture to your storage so long as you have room. (And you <em>will</em> have room, since there are two new storage upgrades to unlock with a new max of 9,000 items.) I used his services to instantly pick up and put away the dozens of copies of the “wheat field” furniture item I’d used to decorate a rural area of my island, which I’d wanted to change but didn’t have the willpower to do manually.</p><p>Plants can now be stored, which allowed me to finally dig up and put away a bunch of bushes that were in my way. And while Resetti doesn’t clean up trees, bushes, or planted crops, he <em>does</em> pick up and put away flowers (or he’ll throw them away if you ask), which in my case saved me from what would’ve been an hour or more of digging up and moving flowers around. Resetti is now my best friend.</p><p>The 3.0 update is a designer’s dream, really. And it’s mostly thanks to those small changes and additions; the new Slumber Island feature, with which you can create up to three separate islands in a dream world, is a sandbox for hardcore decorators to play around in without having to demolish their main islands after all this time.</p><p>Outside of that, the new content is mostly just an excuse to revisit the game, rather than anything as groundbreaking as, you know, strafing. The main addition is a hotel on the pier. It isn’t novel; you’re tasked with decorating some hotel rooms, it introduces a handful of new furniture and clothing items to collect, and the hotel itself attracts tourists to your island to provide a bit of variety. It feels like an extension of the 2021 <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> DLC, which I really enjoyed.</p><p>A few days ago, some of my islanders informed me it had been three years and 11 months since I’d spoken to them. At that time, I really didn’t think I’d be back. But with the hotel, 3.0 gave me just enough of an excuse to return to <em>New Horizons</em>, and the quality-of-life updates are giving me a reason to stay a while.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjY1MTI2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Kallie Plagge</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/863747/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-3-0-switch-2-quality-of-life]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Although the INIU Ultra Slim 45W Portable Charger is only about the size of a credit card and fits in a back pocket, it has a 10,000 mAh battery, a built-in USB-C cable, and dual USB-C outputs, along with a single USB-A output. It also features protection against overcharging and automatically turns off when the device goes dormant, so you won’t waste electricity. Plus, it’s approved for flight travel by many airlines, so you don’t have to leave it behind on vacation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3991/">You can purchase the INIU Ultra Slim 45W Portable Charger today from Amazon for $20. This is a savings of 17% off the usual $24 price tag.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tides of Tomorrow has been delayed to April 2026, just over a month before its previous release date. </p>



<p>Digixart and THQ Nordic’s next title was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-tomorrow-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> back in June 2025 during a PlayStation State of Play event, where the developers spoke a bit about the game’s unique multiplayer system. The title received a release date for February 2026, but that has been delayed to April due to feedback from the demo; more details below. </p>







<h2 id="h-tides-of-tomorrow-gets-a-new-release-date">Tides of Tomorrow Gets a New Release Date</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2678080/announcements/detail/493840283288472149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from the developers of Tides of Tomorrow reveals that the game is now set to release on April 22, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The developers considered renaming the title to Tides of the Day After Tomorrow, but decided against it. Instead, they are now delaying the release to work on the feedback they received from the demo. </p>



<p>Tides of Tomorrow’s demo and ongoing beta received extensive feedback, prompting the devs to delay the game. The additional time will be used to “respond to player input and implement improvements.” The extra time will allow the developers to “ensure the best possible experience for the upcoming narrative-driven adventure.” </p>



<p>While players wait for the upcoming title, they can check out the 40-minute <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3951580/Tides_of_Tomorrow_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">demo</a> on Steam, which lets them explore a location from the game’s opening act. As this is a narrative-driven adventure, the demo can be replayed to uncover new gameplay, storylines, and consequences. The game also features a unique multiplayer experience where players can follow a friend or a favourite streamer, and the system will generate a tailored experience by combining your choices with theirs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has published a Warhammer lore explanation for the existence of female Custodes following a new miniature range announcement on Friday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During a preview livestream, the British company behind tabletop wargames Horus Heresy and Warhammer 40,000 revealed new models for the Adeptus Custodes, a faction made up of genetically-engineered, functionally immortal transhumans who work as the Emperor’s bodyguards on Terra. The Custodes are not Space Marines. Indeed, they are bigger, faster, and more powerful than the average Space Marine. And, as we shall explore, they are created in a very different way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop showed off new, eye-catching Custodes models during the livestream, and alongside the male types are female types. While female Custodes had been mentioned in previous Warhammer 40,000 material, and even starred in an official Warhammer animation, their debut in miniature form was enough to set off complaints online from some who accused Games Workshop of retconning the established lore. These people believe the Custodes should remain male only because, they insist, this is what the lore had set out. Some also accuse Games Workshop of pandering to a "modern audience" with the female Custodes, echoing the so-called “anti-woke” rhetoric.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/19/custodes-image2-0ixb1sbgx4-1768821269708.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Female Custodes are now in-game. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps mindful of this reaction, Games Workshop had a <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/kcuvmezh/new-custodes-your-questions-answered/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lore article</a> ready to go following the reveal. In it, the company explained how female Custodes are made possible and how they differ from Space Marines, which remain male only. The gist, according to this article, is there is no retcon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lore wise, Space Marines are made from human males, willing aspirants or unwilling conscripts on the cusp of adolescence,” Games Workshop explained. “They are subjected to a series of horrific trials, and the strongest emerge as remorseless killers, their humanity stripped away so they can serve as living weapons in the Emperor’s armies. There are no female Adeptus Astartes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Custodes are not Space Marines. Other than the obvious point that they are both towering, gene-enhanced warriors, the similarities pretty much stop there. Custodes are taken as infants and recrafted by ancient science.The process is arcane and bespoke to each individual. The Emperor himself retained oversight of the process (at least until that whole Horus Heresy thing went down).”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/19/image6-6-u7wp04o8ym-1768821383328.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop also addressed the belief that all the Custodes are made from the sons of Terran noble houses, as set out by Custodes lore established for the 8th Edition of Warhammer 40,000. While some Custodes are made this way, that was not the only source of recruitment, Games Workshop explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Other methods might have been equally overt, others far more secretive,” the company said. “Noble daughters could also have been taken, and at some point, you run out of noble houses — even after you’ve conquered all of Terra, the inexorable war machine of the Imperium still requires a constant churn of recruits.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop concluded: “all Custodes, male or female, embody the pinnacle of the genetic and cellular engineering the Emperor employed when creating his armies. They are all flawless creations, pushed beyond the limit of human potential. There is no difference in combat efficacy between a male Custodian and female Custodian.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s safe to say the weekend has been packed with ‘discourse’ following the Custodes reveal. YouTube comments, social media, and subreddits do indeed have many comments from people complaining about the mere existence of these female Custodes models. Some are so upset they’re threatening to leave the hobby behind over it. But it’s important to note that there is a significant pushback on this sentiment from many Warhammer 40,000 fans who have no problem whatsoever with female Custodes and dismiss any retcon concerns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that, for all the complaints about retcons, Warhammer 40,000 “lore,” such as it is, has always been an unreliable thing. Indeed, it is built upon the idea that all we know of what was, what is, and what will be comes from <em>a certain point of view</em>. Crucial events are often delivered from a character’s perspective, and that character may have an agenda of their own. The Imperium itself — a rotting, fascist regime built upon 10,000 years of propaganda — twists the facts, if we can even call them such. There is little in the Warhammer 40,000 universe that can be relied upon. That is kind of the point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we’ve been here before. The Necrons — now one of the most popular xenos factions in the setting — were once mindless automatons all. Now, we have novels about individual Necrons with more personality than your average agent of the Inquisition. We don’t call the Imperial Guard the Imperial Guard anymore (well, we’re not meant to!). We are to refer to the Guard as the Astra Militarum and not to say another word on it thank you very much.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/19/tithes-1768821769620.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Tithes Episode 2 stars an Adeptus Custodes called Tyrith. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From the same 8th Edition Custodes codex that stated all the Custodes are made from the sons of Terran noble houses:</p><blockquote>Not even the most knowledgeable of the Imperium’s scholars can say when the Emperor fashioned the Custodians. The truth is hidden in fragments of the past, accounts of figures appearing in crude hieroglyphs and cave etchings, stasis-locked scads of parchment and gene-sealed tomes that no man now can open.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">And:</p><blockquote>The method by which such remarkable individuals are created has always been known only to those of the Imperial household, and is carried out by the most accomplished chirurgeons and bio-alchemists of Terra within gilded laboratories locked away from the sight of Humanity’s masses. With the Adeptus Custodes fighting only for the Emperor himself, and beholden to the commands and scrutiny of no other, the secrets of their recruitment have never been revealed, for not even the High Lords of Terra have the right to demand them.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop had laid the groundwork for the introduction of female Custodes by mentioning Custodes Calladayce Kesh in the latest Custodes codex back in April 2024 (some didn’t like the way this was done, or the tweet Games Workshop put out about it back then, and at the time there were no female Custodes models to go alongside the lore reveal).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Since the first of the Ten Thousand were created, there have always been female Custodians.</p>— Warhammer Official (@warhammer) <a href="https://twitter.com/warhammer/status/1779544596172689822?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in September 2024, fans were treated to a Warhammer animation starring a female Custodes called Tyrith Shiva Kyrus, who spent her time ripping tyranids to shreds and staring down Space Marines in the way only a Custodes can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tyrith Shiva Kyrus was Games Workshop's first portrayal of a female Custodian since the lore revelation that Custodians could be any gender just a handful of months prior. "This fact came as a real surprise to many, since it wasn’t something previously explored," <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/TBbxxG5O/the-tithes-episode-2-custodes-dont-ask-twice/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Games Workshop said at the time</a>. "That, in and of itself, isn’t a particularly unusual thing for Warhammer 40,000 and its lore; there are simply loads of things the Warhammer Studios have never expressly stated, whether that’s ruling them in or out. Since the earliest conversations about bringing the Horus Heresy to the tabletop and Black Library fiction, the exact nature of the Custodians has been under discussion — after all, their origins and means of creation, unlike for example, the Legiones/Adeptus Astartes, are shrouded in mystery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A significant advantage to this portrayal is that it helps us to address a common misconception — that the Custodes are just bigger, better Space Marines. They aren’t. Space Marines were made through industrialised ritual to be mass-produced, brute-force weapons of conquest. And even 10,000 years after their creation, draped in self-assigned glory, that’s still true of them at their core. Each Custodian, on the other hand, is unique. Painstakingly made through peerless craft and arcane artifice, their physique, their psyche, their very soul, is a bespoke instrument of the Emperor they unquestioningly serve."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These "gaps" in the Warhammer lore, where things are left unsaid or unexplained, are "quite intentional," Games Workshop said as part of that same September 2024 explanation. "They let you as collectors, players, and fans fill the spaces with your own characters, stories and narratives — making the Warhammer hobby truly yours," the company continued. "They also allow us to revisit factions through miniatures, stories, and animations and offer something new and interesting. (Imagine how sad it would be if we ever said 'And that’s it. That’s everything you’ll ever see in this army. No new models ever.' – that’d be rubbish.)"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we finally have female Custodes minis, which shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise at all. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40k/comments/1qew51e/comment/o00wvvt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As redditor SchmittVanDean put it over the weekend</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And it's increasingly embarrassing and weird, like people who still complain bitterly about the Necrons. Tithes Episode 2 is a really fun short story of a female Custodes and her Sister of Silence buddy and the characterisation of their motivations and interactions — especially with Space Marines — are fantastic; their depiction and the way they fight is just cool. The new models are exceptional. The lore rationale — the Custodes are created via a perfected form of the earlier mass production gene editing that could only produce male Space Marines — improves both Marines and Custodes conceptually as factions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1qgz6n2/comment/o0g4yx7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as redditor tghast said</a>: “I truly truly truly could not think of something I give less of a shit about.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed leader Marc-Alexis Côté is reportedly suing Ubisoft following a surprise and suspicious departure from the company last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">Côté left Ubisoft in October</a> with the company claiming he'd chosen to leave but Côté claiming he was pushed out. <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">Radio Canada</a> said Côté's lawsuit seeks CAD $1.3m (£698k) for a mixture of lost severance pay and "moral damages", and for Ubisoft to lift Côté's non-compete clause.</p>
<p>The lawsuit apparently claims (I can't independently find the filing) that problems began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">when Ubisoft created new company Vantage Studios with Tencent</a> in October, to control its most valuable gaming properties. These include Assassin's Creed - the franchise Côté was leading, or so he thought. Côté quickly discovered that Vantage was hiring for a new role, Head of Franchises, that would effectively overrule him.</p>

<p>He alleges that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot blocked his application for the role because Côté was based in Canada and not France, and said he was offered a lower role as Head of Production instead. "Tense" discussions ensued and resulted in an offer for Côté to lead a "Creative House" looking after second-tier Ubisoft brands.</p>
<p>Côté, "disoriented, confused, and affected by the anxiety-inducing situation", according to the filing, took a break from the company to think and reflect.</p>
<p>Ubisoft management apparently told him that at the end of his two week period of reflection, he'd have to make a choice whether or not to accept the position offered, which Côté saw as an "unacceptable demotion" and therefore a form of "disguised dismissal", so he demanded severance pay in accordance with that.</p><p>Côté had been expected back at work on 13th October but the lawsuit said Ubisoft told him not to show while it formulated a response. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">The company then suddenly announced he had left the company of his own accord</a>, seeking new opportunities elsewhere, which the lawsuit claims Ubisoft did to avoid paying severance and to apply a non-compete clause. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">Côté wrote an emotional message at the time,</a> claiming he did not walk away but was asked to step aside.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has not yet responded to the lawsuit filing.</p>
<p>Marc-Alexis Côté worked at Ubisoft for 20 years, spending 15 of those on Assassin's Creed. He was a lead level designer on Brotherhead, director of 3, and then led Ubisoft Quebec as it made Black Flag add-on Freedom Cry, and Syndicate. He was senior producer of Odyssey, and then in 2022, Côté stepped up to take control of the entire Assassin's Creed franchise, rebooting it somewhat and kicking off the new era with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Assassin's Creed Shadows, which launched in March last year</a>.</p>

<p>As Côté tells it, Ubisoft offered him a leadership position at one of its new Creative Houses, but Côté saw this as a demotion since the Creative Houses wouldn't be in charge of Ubisoft's first-tier franchises.</p><p>Following this, Côté took two weeks off work, and when he returned, Ubisoft gave him an ultimatum to accept the job or not. Côté declined and formally demanded severance pay from Ubisoft, which he says they didn't give him.</p><p>For context, Côté <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bedd26ab-2db9-443d-9a58-5d57561ce134" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">departed Ubisoft in October last year</a>. According to the studio, his departure was voluntary, with the company stating that he had decided to "pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft".</p><p>That's why Côté is demanding such a high sum of money; it effectively amounts to two years' worth of severance pay, as well as an extra $75,000 for moral damages (i.e. harm to his reputation and an abuse of power on Ubisoft's part).</p><figure role="group">

<p>Palworld devs have teased upcoming Pals through new concept art revealed from their 2nd Anniversary video. </p>



<p>Pocketpair has been hard at work growing the Palworld game and the franchise. In terms of content, we saw the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-ultrakill-collab-arrives-in-december-2025-with-home-sweet-home-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultrakill Collab and the ‘Home Sweet Home’ update</a> arrive last month. Additionally, we also saw a new Palword <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-facing-more-pokemon-rip-off-allegations-with-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TCG announced last week</a>, extending the franchise’s reach in the card game genre. Now, we have got a small tease for what’s in store for their 1.0 update, which will finally get the game out of early access. </p>







<h2 id="h-palworld-reveals-concept-art-for-upcoming-pal">Palworld Reveals Concept Art for Upcoming Pal </h2>



<p>Palworld’s 2nd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0M82qgvIxE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Anniversary video</a> starts with Bucky, Head of Publishing &amp; Communications at Pocketpair, addressing the community. Bucky reveals that developers are working hard on the Palworld <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-1-0-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.0 update</a>, which seems to be the game’s “biggest update ever”. However, they can’t show a sneak peek of this update at the moment, as it is still in development. They did have some concept art to showcase for upcoming Pals in Palworld. </p>



<p>The first concept art depicts a dragon-like creature with elements of a Lotus flower around it. The next one had a fluffy but angry-looking creature that seemed to have electric abilities. The third Pal concept art in Palworld featured a blue-and-white-coloured bird with a cloud around its face. The fourth concept art featured an eel-like Pal that could seemingly detach its lower half to turn into a blade. The last art showcased twin creatures in blue and red accents. </p>



<p>Apart from the Pal concept art, towards the end of the video, Bucky also teases another creature, asking, “That sounds like…a whale???” The statement was followed by an in-game cinematic that showed the player atop a mythical, whale-like creature, en route to a mysterious tree. Interested readers can check out the 2nd Anniversary teaser below: </p>

<p>Meet the new boss</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo of America has a new President and COO, and during the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HNNugGXKQ0?t=3522">15th Annual New York Game Awards</a>, Devon Pritchard made her first public appearance in her new role.</p>
<p>Introduced by ex-Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé and New York Times columnist Harold Goldberg, Pritchard appeared via a pre-recorded video to celebrate the Game Awards and the nonprofit 'Playing With Purpose' writing programme, which looks to provide workshops in journalism and game narrative writing in school across New York.</p>
<p>If you're unable to watch the video right now, here's Pritchard's message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hi everyone, it is great to be here. My name is Devon, and before anything else, I want to celebrate the New York Game Awards. 15 years of supporting the games industry and in doing so lifting up the voices, stories, and dreams of so many.</p>
<p>"This show connects people who are united by a shared belief that every dream matters, and that everyone deserves a chance to do meaningful and creative work in games and storytelling. The 'Playing With Purpose' programme supports the creators, the coders, the writers, and anyone else dreaming big to join this community and bring all that makes them unique.</p>
<p>"I'm excited to meet you! To hear those stories and to learn from your journeys. And remember, like any good video game character, you're on an adventure, and every step you take matters. There's some gnarly bosses, sure, but also many good friends along the way who will support you, and powerful rewards for those who persevere.</p>
<p>"So keep believing, keep playing, and know that you truly belong in this game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pritchard took over the role of President and COO of Nintendo of America when her predecessor, Doug Bowser, stepped down at the end of 2025.</p>
<p>Pritchard will have a big task ahead of her in spearheading the next generation of Nintendo with the Switch 2. The console has gotten off to a great start, but concerns around price uncertainty and Game-Key Cards linger in the minds of fans around the world.</p>

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed series lead Marc-Alexis Côté is suing Ubisoft for damages, alleging that his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-says-leaving-ubisoft-wasnt-his-choice-instead-down-to-restructure-musical-chairs">abrupt October departure from the company</a> after 20 years wasn't a matter of personal choice, but a case of "constructive dismissal". That, in <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/dismissals/constructive-dismissal">non-legalese</a>, means that the developer believes he was left with no choice but to resign, having been offered new roles he viewed as demotions amid a round of corporate musical chairs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">CBC Radio-Canada</a>, Côté's lawsuit against Ubisoft has been filed in Quebec and seeks $1.3 million Canadian dollars  - around $935,000 in US currency - in damages on his behalf. That cash is designed to cover two years worth of the developer's salary, plus moral damages and an additional lifting of a non-compete clause which currently limits his games industry job options.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Côté learned in a summer 2025 meeting that as part the Ubisoft rearrangement which came with the company setting up a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">new Tencent-backed subsidiary called Vantage Studios</a> to oversee the running of Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, they'd be installing a "head of franchise" based in France. According to Canada-based Côté, that gig absorbed lots of his duties as Assassin's Creed series head, and he was subsequently offered roles as Assassin's Creed production head reporting to that new head of franchise or as the leader of a "creative house” overseeing another Ubisoft game series.</p>
<p>Seeing that as a demotion, Côté's lawsuit asserts that he took two weeks to think about things, then declined and asked for his severance pay. Ubisoft are cited by the suit as having responded by telling him not to show back up to work, then announcing his departure in a fashion which painted it as being your standard voluntary parting of ways.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p>
<p>When RPS reached out to the publishers for comment following Côté's initial comments about his departure back in October, we received the following response:</p>
<blockquote>Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025, Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build. We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today. His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors."</blockquote>
<p>We'll see how these legal wranglings shake out.</p>
