That great disturbance in the Force you just felt wasn't a million voices crying out in terror. It was, in fact, me crying out in terror a million times. You see, Aspyr have just announced that they're porting Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles to PC and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2443630/Star_Wars_Episode_I_Jedi_Power_Battles/">Steam</a>. I have a complicated relationship  with Jedi Power Battles, in the sense that I think I still have scars on my thumbs from when I played it all night on a busted PS1 controller. I have bled for this game. I'd close my eyes after each six-hours session and see fields of lightsabers flickering and dancing like luminous leeches, chasing me through the Dagobahnian jungles of my dreams.

Jedi Power Battles isn't even all that amazing. Originally published in 2000, it just happened to come along at a time when myself and a friend were obsessed with Jedi Knights and the seven lightsaber duelling forms. It was an atrocious period in my life, nestled squarely between my liverish career as a Trekkie and my later, more forgiveable spell in the labyrinths of Tolkien and Warhammer. I had a dedicated Jedi name, I think. Evaed Paleee? It is very important that I don't remember this era in great detail, so I'll be watching the below PC port trailer through squinting eyes and parted fingers. Here you go:

<p>
A quick overview: Jedi Power Battles is a scenic, fairly punishing 3D platformer-brawler that follows the events of the Phantom Menace movie, except that I don't remember Liam Neeson tumbling into pits quite so regularly, or Ewan McGregor being unable to hack through a Pilot Droid's forearms, or Samuel L Jackson getting launched by a little green man. The best thing about it is that you get a bunch of nicely animated Jedi movesets to, as the case may be, argue about till 3am, at which point it belatedly occurs to you that you've never been kissed in your whole adolescent life, and that your bedroom smells of mortality.
</p><p>
What are Aspyr doing with it all? Well, you can expect a choice of modern or classic controls, secret areas unlocked from the start, Vaselined visuals, cute flourishes such as Big Head mode, and a total of 13 returning and newly playable characters, including the Rifle Droid and Tusken Raider. It's out 23rd January. Here's hoping they give it a bit more time than they did the recent Battlefront port, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-devs-working-to-address-bugs-following-disastrous-launch">a planet-sized shambles</a>.

It filled up in seconds as players eagerly signed up to be guinea pigs for whatever the Mario maker is cooking up. No one knows for sure what that might be, but fans are already speculating based on some new clues.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“We will perform a test called Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program related to a new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service offered for the Nintendo Switch system,” the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced yesterday</a></span>. It said the only requirements for acceptance were that users be 18 years old, have a registered Nintendo account, and an  active Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.</p><p>The slots <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/IntroSpecktive/status/1844393893854577021&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/IntroSpecktive/status/1844393893854577021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared to fill up</a></span> within seconds of applications going live. “Registration for this test is now full.

But those combing through the website were able to garner some additional info about the mysterious test. </p><p>According to dataminer OatmealDome, downloads for the special software would start the week of October 21 with the test going live on October 23. Users need at least 2.2GB free on their Switch’s internal storage. “Nintendo also recommends using TV mode and a wired connection during the test,” OatmealDome added.</p><p>That last part might be the most telling, and it has some fans thinking this might be a test for a new cloud streaming feature. That would explain why a wired connection is recommended and why users must have active Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscriptions. Presumably, if there was a cloud streaming feature, it would be paywalled behind that $50 a year membership. Or perhaps Nintendo would even use it to raise the price. Streaming could be used to play newer games that the Switch isn’t natively powerful enough to run, or even facilitate retro emulation for devices like the GameCube or Nintendo DS. </p><p>There have already been streaming experiments on Switch, though <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/17gqluf/resident_evil_2_cloud_trash/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/17gqluf/resident_evil_2_cloud_trash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they’ve rarely gone well</a></span>. The <em>Kingdom Hearts 1 </em>and <em>2</em> remasters, for example, are only available on Nintendo’s device via streaming, as is the <em>Resident Evil 2</em> remake. It’s possible the new software might aim to remedy those shortcomings, or be part of a third-party partnership. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1693868974033756457?t=4b1Tmt1BioYa0xk6CTzchA&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1693868974033756457?t=4b1Tmt1BioYa0xk6CTzchA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft has the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games over Ubisoft+</a></span> as part of the Microsoft acquisition.

<p>The difficulty tiers are one of the most significant changes you’ll find going into the most recent season of Diablo IV. There are no longer World Tiers; instead, Blizzard took a step back and reintroduced the Torment system from Diablo 3. It’s straightforward enough on the surface, but you’ll soon find the game proves more challenging than ever before. Here’s what you need to know about the new Diablo 4 difficulty levels when creating a character in Season 6!</p>



<h2 id="h-an-overview-of-the-diablo-4-difficulty-levels">An Overview of the Diablo 4 Difficulty Levels</h2>



<p>Instead of jumping through World Tiers 1-4, Diablo 4 offers eight difficulty levels ranging from Normal to Torment IV. The higher up the scale you go, the better the rewards, but the more challenging the enemies. On Torment difficulty, the ARPG will challenge you, requiring you to prioritize proper build and gear planning.</p>



<h3 id="h-normal">Normal</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Default</li>



<li>Standard difficulty setting with baseline EXP and gold drops.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-hard">Hard</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Default</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 75% more Experience</li>



<li>Monsters drop 75% more Gold</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-expert">Expert</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Complete the Prologue</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 125% more Experience</li>



<li>Monsters drop 125% more Gold</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-penitent">Penitent</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Complete the original story campaign</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 175% more Experience</li>



<li>Monsters drop 175% more Gold</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-torment-i">Torment I</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Conquer The Pit of the Artificer – Tier 20 at Level 60</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 300% Gold and Experience</li>



<li>Ancestral items drop</li>



<li>Increased Legendary, Unique, and Mythic drops</li>



<li>Armor reduced by 250</li>



<li>Resistances reduced by 25%</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-torment-ii">Torment II</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Conquer The Pit of the Artificer – Tier 35 at Level 60</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 400% Gold and Experience</li>



<li>Increased Legendary, Unique, and Mythic drops</li>



<li>Armor reduced by 500</li>



<li>Resistances reduced by 50%</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-torment-iii">Torment III</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Conquer The Pit of the Artificer – Tier 50 at Level 60</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 500% Gold and Experience</li>



<li>Increased Legendary, Unique, and Mythic drops</li>



<li>Armored reduced by 750</li>



<li>Resistances reduced by 75%</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-torment-iv">Torment IV</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Conquer The Pit of the Artificer – Tier 65 at Level 60</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 600% Gold and Experience</li>



<li>Increased Legendary, Unique, and Mythic drops</li>



<li>Armored reduced by 1000</li>



<li>Resistances reduced by 100%</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-torment-difficulties-in-diablo-4">How to Unlock Torment Difficulties in Diablo 4</h2>



<p>As mentioned briefly above, you can unlock the new Torment difficulties in Diablo 4 by progressing through the game until you reach the new max level of 60. From there, open up The Pit and progress deeper into the end-game mechanic until you reach Tier 65. Once you hit this point, you’ll unlock all Torment difficulties. </p>



<p>You only need to reach Tier 20 to unlock Torment I, though!</p>

Sign-ups went live on Thursday morning and the playtest quickly filled up. Now fans have to wait 10 days to learn what this program is all about.</p><p>Speculation around the program is already running, with some jokingly (?) suggesting that it might be an Arms 2 playtest or the <a href="https://x.com/juneybee03/status/1844147115448242359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">return of the Miiverse</a>. Others wondered if it might have something to do with Nintendo Switch Online retro games, such as the release of GameCube games on the service.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/07/01/miiverse0724131280jpg-e930671280wjpg-9c6bd4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Could the Miiverse be making a comeback? It's just one of many theories being generated by fans right now.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"I want to believe Miiverse could be coming back. Limited numbers, different language regions, could definately be a test for moderation strategy etc.," journalist <a href="https://x.com/LaurakBuzz/status/1844396508650897829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura Kate Dale wrote on X/Twitter</a>. "Test now, make it a launch day Switch 2 feature. Bring it back Nintendo!"</p><p>For those who don't recall, the Miiverse is a defunct service introduced on the Wii U. It was much-loved for the wholesome creativity that it generated from fans as well as its various online hooks. The service <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/29/nintendo-miiverse-to-shut-down-in-november">officially went offline in 2017</a>.</p><h2>What we know about the Nintendo Switch Online playtest</h2><p>Here's what we do know: Playest users must have have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership as of October 9. They must be 18 years of age or older, and they have to be registered in Japan, the U.S., the UK, France, Germany, Italy, or Spain. The test download is 2.2GB.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want to believe Miiverse could be coming back</p></div><p>Crucially, Nintendo appears to want players to play docked and with a strong Internet connection. This is leading some fans to theorize that Nintendo is testing a cloud-based streaming service for Switch games, similar to the kind offered by Xbox, PlayStation, and Nvidia.</p><p>As for whether it's Switch 2 related, the playtest <em>does </em>take place on the anniversary of the Nintendo Switch reveal on October 20, 2016. But with Nintendo's next-gen console still remaining elusive despite heavy rumors of an October reveal, we have to take pretty much every rumor to do with the Switch 2 with a grain of salt at the moment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"Feels like if it was a thing for something known. There is not much reason to keep it as just 'new feature' or NSO," one fan speculated on <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-program-begins-oct-23-6-pm-pst-expansion-pack-tier-only-%E2%80%94-tl-dr-in-thread.11282/page-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Famiboards</a>. "They’d probably just say it publicly like other stress test announcements in the past. It’s probably something new, but could range from really unexciting to something pretty hype that Nintendo announces in the week following the application closure."</p><p>One way or another, Nintendo fans will just have to sit tight and wait until the playtest kicks off on October 20. Maybe they can set the time on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-latest-in-long-line-of-weird-nintendo-hardware-some-failed-hard">their new Alarmo</a>.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sand-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If stomping your way across the desert on a giant, leggy, weaponized platform with a few of your best friends sounds like a good time, have I got a game for you. Especially if along the way you want to explore a ruined world, scavenge wrecks and ruins, take pot shots at other scavengers, and get in a few knock-down drag-out landship brawls with hostile crews with their own custom-built Trampler mechs.</p><p>That's just what goes down in Sand, an upcoming PvPvE survival shooter where you and your crew want to get down to the planet Sophie, get the goods while exploring the surface, and get out—hopefully making a profit in the process. The world is an alternate history before World War 1, so your gear and the world is all this riveted industrial stuff from the age of iron-clad dreadnoughts, old western revolver-rifles, trousers with suspenders, and some absolutely legendary facial hair. I was able to sit down and try a PvP only test build of Sand with some of the developers, showing off a game that has a clear design vision I think will really resonate with some gamers.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Sand Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Taking a bold note from more crafting-heavy games like Rust, or from or map-based games like Sea of Thieves, Sand has a slower pace of events. Your Trampler can be pretty fast, depending on how you outfit it, but it still moves and turns like a great stomping ship. Spotting enemies in the distance by their smoke plume is one thing, but your pilot has to do a good job maneuvering and it always helps to have a navigator plotting the course. That's not to mention your real purpose for hitting the surface: loot. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Trampler battles are also slower-paced. It's a challenge just lining up targets as the gait of your mech throws off aim and the rolling dunes present a constant challenge in just getting a good  line of sight. </p></div><p>Shipwrecks and island towns litter the once-wet surface of planet Sophie, any of which could have the find that lets you strike it rich. Or the ammo and power cores that keep your ship going for another round of searches. Or the weapons and gear that outfit your crew for a boarding action against another ship that was more successful in finding riches.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>To get all that done you have to take a more methodical approach, and the controls reflect that. You can carry very little loot on your person before you need to find a container to hold it in instead, for example. You always have to aim before firing a weapon, which I found really helped differentiate the size and purpose difference between the pistol, revolver-rifle, and sniper rifle I found on the surface. (I found shotgun shells too…but no shotgun.) </p><p>Trampler battles are also slower-paced. It's a challenge just lining up targets as the gait of your mech throws off aim and the rolling dunes present a constant challenge in just getting a good  line of sight. Other Tramplers take a lot of hits from a cannon to go down, requiring you to destroy their engine room for real takedown—which depending on how good a shot you are might take more shells than you brought with you or found on the surface. But it's either that or board the enemy Trampler, kill the crew, and capture their helm to make it your own.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With that much work and risk in a Trampler-on-Trampler brawl, you need to be sure it's worth it—because there's a real sting in spending ten or fifteen minutes chasing someone down to realize they just didn't have anything worth stealing. Not to mention the circumstance I can foresee players dreading the most: when a fight starts and the other salvage crews start circling like vultures to pick off whoever survives. That's a scenario I saw more than once through my binoculars.</p><p>Not for my crew, though! We had a giant Trampler to stomp around in, a ramshackle monster that the developers assured me was not something you can build with starting resources. And build it you do. A pretty robust, in-depth system of Trampler design lets you place sleeping compartments, the helm, storage facilities, the engines, decks, more engines, fighting balconies, fighting emplacements, and guns all over these things. You can even do cool stuff like customize where doors and hatches are located to make your ship a maze that enemies will struggle to invade. All of that takes resources you've gathered on the planet below and that you're—at least somewhat—risking when you take down your new steel behemoth for another run.</p><p>Which is something I already know I'll find myself doing whenever I next get my hands on Sand.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Amazon has revealed the next batch of PC games that'll be available through its Prime Gaming service, and in October, subscribers can look forward to 28 games in total.</p><p>As a reminder, once you claim the free games from Prime Gaming, they are yours to keep forever--even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and score some great freebies.</p><p>Available right now, the first batch of games is a solid selection of action, puzzles, and musical fun. Some of the highlights here include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-straight-roads/" data-ref-id="5000-492251">No Straight Roads</a>, a rhythm-action game where you fight the good fight against an evil EDM empire, the over-the-top brutality of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-eternal/" data-ref-id="5000-483372">Doom Eternal</a>, and the multiplayer fun of paranormal extermination in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-561168">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a>. Would you kindly also look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bioshock/" data-ref-id="5000-22526">BioShock Remastered</a>, for a fresh tour of Rapture?</p><p>Starting October 17, there'll be five more games to add to your library, although there aren't too many noteworthy titles here. Since it is the horror season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killing-floor-2/" data-ref-id="5000-272955">Killing Floor 2</a> is a savage option to consider in case you have a digital bloodlust, while the two-pack of Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Ghoul Patrol is a 16-bit blast from the past where you can save people from the undead, chainsaw-wielding killers, mummies, and other spooky monsters.</p><p>When October 24 rolls around, things get even spookier with this wave of games. The creepiest one here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stasis-bone-totem/" data-ref-id="5000-521983">Stasis: Bone Totem</a>, an unnerving and atmospheric underwater adventure with classic point-and-click gameplay. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gargoyles/" data-ref-id="5000-16237">Gargoyles Remastered</a> is a revival of the '90s classic 16-bit platformer with improved graphics, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-gunk/" data-ref-id="5000-516158">The Gunk</a> is a more relaxing tale of a pair of opportunists cleaning up a planet infected with parasitic filth.</p><p>Finally, October 31 ends the month with a bang. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deaths-door/" data-ref-id="5000-529059">Death's Door</a>, one of the best indie games of 2021, is an isometric action-adventure where you'll play as an adorable crow armed with a sword and set loose in a mysterious world. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/scorn/" data-ref-id="5000-455808">Scorn</a> has a few shortcomings in its design, but when it comes to gross-out visuals that would make HR Giger proud, it's in a class of its own. There's also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/a-plague-tale-innocence/" data-ref-id="5000-465637">A Plague Tale: Innocence</a>, an incredible story with <em>too many rats </em>and the cheeky Pokemon-like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/coromon/" data-ref-id="5000-506718">Coromon</a> to close the month out with.</p><h2>Prime Gaming free games for October 2024</h2><h3>Now available</h3><ul><li>Hive Jump Survivors</li><li>SCARF</li><li>Tomb Raider: Legend</li><li>The Eternal Cylinder</li><li>Spirit of the North</li><li>No Straight Roads</li><li>BioShock Remastered</li><li>Doom Eternal</li><li>DreadOut 2</li><li>Ghostbusters: Spirit Unleashed - Ecto Edition</li><li>Priest Simulator: Vampire Show</li><li>The Gap</li></ul><h3>October 17</h3><ul><li>Mystery Box: Hidden Secrets</li><li>Vlad Circus: Descend into Madness</li><li>Through the Darkest of Times</li><li>Killing Floor 2</li><li>Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Ghoul Patrol</li></ul><h3>October 24</h3><ul><li>Pumpkin Jack</li><li>The Gunk</li><li>Stasis: Bone Totem</li><li>Gargoyles Remastered</li><li>Monster Train</li><li>Morbid: The Seven Acolytes</li></ul><h3>October 31</h3><ul><li>A Plague Tale: Innocence</li><li>Death's Door</li><li>Haunted Hotel: Personal Nightmare Collector's Edition</li><li>Scorn</li><li>Coromon</li></ul><p>Prime subscribers will also be able to the following games in October via the Prime Gaming Luna channel:</p><ul><li>Amid Evil</li><li>Valfaris</li><li>Perish</li><li>Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine</li><li>Tormented Souls</li><li>Dusk</li><li>Mortal Shell</li><li>Doomblade</li><li>Monster Harvest</li><li>Alien: Isolation</li><li>XDefiant</li><li>Fortnite</li><li>Lego Fortnite</li><li>Rocket Racing</li><li>Fortnite Festival</li><li>Fortnite Battle Royal</li></ul>

                <p dir="ltr">In 2022, Color Gray Studio and Playstack dropped The Case Of The Golden Idol--a point-and-click investigation game centered around the titular gilded totem--and it quickly became a smash hit. Now, after announcing the follow-up at last year's The Game Awards, Color Gray and Playstack have confirmed that The Rise Of The Golden Idol will launch on November 12, while a new demo is available on Steam today.</p><p dir="ltr">The Rise Of The Golden Idol continues the story of the cursed curio, as it takes place in the 1970s--300 years after the Cloudsley family's exploits in the first game. The new story follows a relic hunter who has heard stories about the Golden Idol, and they've decided to seek out the ancient artifact for themselves.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Blizzard Entertainment was reportedly toiling away on a mobile version of Overwatch in the past, though it's unknown whether the project is still in active development. A new book about the acclaimed developer--titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Play-Nice-Future-Blizzard-Entertainment/dp/1538725428?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</a>--drops the little nugget of info about the hero-shooter series.</p><p dir="ltr">In the book, author Jason Schreier references an Overwatch mobile project when talking about Walter Kong. Here is the passage from Play Nice: "Overwatch was led by Walter Kong, who oversaw the release of regular heroes and content for Overwatch 2 as well as new projects, like a mobile version of the franchise."</p><p dir="ltr">There has been no official comment on a mobile edition of the Overwatch franchise. Overwatch 2 launched last year as a free-to-play game for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. The title offers cross-platform play, so it's possible a mobile project would be the same experience but for smartphones and tablets, or it could be something completely different, if it still exists at all.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="567225701" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

			<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1844377892303798752" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new statement posted on X</a>, developer Sports Interactive has made the difficult decision to delay Football Manager 25. This isn't the first delay the game has experienced, as the game was originally set to release in September, but after an update that was posted on the Football Manager website, they announced that they needed more time to work on the game. Unfortunately, those who were excited to jump into the new era of Football Manager will have to wait a little bit longer. The title has now been delayed once more, and the game is now set to release in March 2025.</p>
<p>Football Manager 2024 was a massive game for the company and was one of the most groundbreaking titles released by Sports Interactive. However, it seems that they've now got stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to meet the deadline to appease the football fans. However, the fans in the comments on the statement are not happy at all and are coming at them with total aggression. A lot of the comments are telling the developers to skip working on Football Manager 25 entirely and move on to FM26. Which, realistically, what is stopping Sports Interactive from saying that Football Manager 25 is Football Manager 26 after making some tweaks?</p>
<p>Tempers are rising, with most saying to scrap the game as there is "no point in releasing it at the end of the season." For the vast majority, Sports Interactive has had a monopoly on this particular genre of sports gaming, with FIFA being a strong competitor in the football gaming scene. However, when it comes to combining football with a management sim, no one does it quite like Sports Interactive does.</p>
<p>In their statement, they mention, "Following discussions with Sega, our licensors, and partners, we have agreed the best course of action is to delay the launch until March 2025... This additional time has not been sufficient to ensure the game quality and experience meet your expectations and our very high standards."</p>
<p>While most Football Manager games are a <a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-xbox-game-pass-positive-football-manager-head-says/">huge financial success</a> for Sports Interactive, they are not the only company that is suffering during this time in the games industry. Companies that you wouldn't expect to are having difficulties, with layoffs being a disappointing constant at this point in time, alongside many games either being scrapped or delayed. At this point, it's uncertain whether there will be any development or release issues with Football Manager 26 or whether they will just skip a season due to timelines being too tight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sunderfolk-a-tactical-co-op-adventure-game-inspired-by-tabletop-rpgs-is-dreamhavens-first-internal-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, multi-studio developer Dreamhaven, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dreamhaven-studio-blizzard-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> four years ago by former Blizzard boss Mike Morhaime, announced its first internal game, Sunderfolk. It's a tactical cooperative adventure game inspired by tabletop roleplaying games and set in a fantasy world made by Dreamhaven's Secret Door team.</p>
<p>Sunderfolk features an unfolding narrative that will take adventurers on a quest through the Sunderlands, starting in Arden, their idyllic home village, which they've been recruited to save. As they battle their way through the mines, wilds, and labyrinths of the game's fictional world, players will meet colorful characters, discover hidden secrets, and develop new cooperative strategies to defeat their enemies. One of the twists of Sunderfolk is that each player can use their phone or tablet to control their character during a session that can be either local (couch co-op is fully supported) or online.</p>
<p>Chris Sigaty, Secret Door's studio head, said:</p>
<p><em>We have a bunch of dedicated board and tabletop game fanatics on the team at Secret Door—getting together for game night has been a regular highlight for many of us going back years and years. As developers we also like to look at what inspires us and think about how to make those types of experiences easier to get into, so that more people can enjoy them as much as we do. With Sunderfolk, we’re excited to offer players a game that’s easy to pick up and play, while still challenging to master, and we can’t wait to share it with the world.</em></p>
<p>Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Dreamhaven, added:</p>
<p><em>The team at Secret Door, and really all of us at Dreamhaven, are all about bringing players together around fun experiences. Sunderfolk is a beautiful game, it’s full of personality and charm, and it also creates epic moments where everyone is engaging directly with each other to work out strategies or celebrate victories. There’s nothing quite like it, and we’re really looking forward to seeing what players think.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Sunderfolk | A New Way to Play" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fBOhgqT3Q78?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sunderfolk features six different heroes (Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, Rogue), each with their own strategic role and passive abilities. Players can customize them and equip them with weapons, armor, items, and skills as they level up. In battle, players must strategize positioning and turn order, selecting from their deck of Skill Cards to perform moves, attacks, and use items. Luck is also a factor, with Fate Cards played each turn that can affect their effectiveness. As missions are completed, players gain experience and rewards, gradually unlocking ways to customize their decks. After the missions, players will return to Arden, the party's base of operations, to upgrade merchants for new items and equipment&nbsp;and befriend the townspeople for rewards.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when Sunderfolk is released at some point next year on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2414270/Sunderfolk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010574" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch, only one copy of the game (which is a premium title with TBD pricing) will be required to start a four-player session, clearly an attempt to incentivize non-hardcore gamers to try it.</p>
<p>Progress from one session will carry over to the next (tied to the host's game), so groups can pick up where they left off without having to start over. If a party member is unable to make a session or has to leave early, the host can choose to take control of that person's Hero so that the Hero is ready to continue the quest when the person returns.</p>
<p>Similarly, if one or two players miss a session, the remaining players can continue the adventure without any problems. When the missing players return, they'll gain the same level (and corresponding Skill Cards) as the rest of the party, but they'll lose any gold and other items collected during the missed missions. (However, players can trade gold and items with each other while in town, so the loot from all missions can eventually be distributed however the players wish.<br>
players choose).</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-pc-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-pc-in-october/">coming to PC</a> after 14 years, and there’s finally a posted price for players. </p>



<p>According to the store pages for the game on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/red-dead-redemption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668510/Red_Dead_Redemption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Read Dead Redemption will cost $50. That price puts it at the same for the Nintendo Switch version of the game.</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption on PC features the base game along with the Undead Nightmare DLC. There are new updates for the game, however, including native 4K resolution at 144Hz, Ultrawide and Super Ultrawide support, HDR10, and full mouse and keyboard functionality.  In addition to that, there will be support for AMD FSR 3.0 and Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and DLSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>What it won’t include, however, is any multiplayer component. The remaster is the single-player experience, only.</p>



<p>If you are looking at picking up the game on PC, you won’t need the most powerful system to play. According to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system requirements</a>, the minimum required is an Intel Core  i5-1670 or  AMD FX-9590 and an Nvidia GTX 960 or AMD Radeon R7 360.</p>



<p>What do you think of the $50 price point for Red Dead Redemption on PC? Let us know in the comments and in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/read-dead-redemption-pc-price-has-been-revealed.895/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums.</a> </p>

			<p>It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-thursday-adds-22-games-to-october-lineup-including-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">GFN Thursday</a>, which means there are new games being added to the ever-growing catalog on GeForce NOW. This time, the update comes with something a bit more important than just games, as Game Sync has finally been added for Battle.net accounts. Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox, and Ubisoft Connect stores already have game library sync, and Battle.net is one of the last to join the roster on that front. This GeForce NOW Thursday sees the addition of Diablo IV's Vessel of Hatred DLC to the cloud, meaning members of GeForce NOW will be able to stream it without having to wait to download the game. Those who are Ultimate members will be able to play the game at up to 4k and 120 FPS.</p>
<p>Having your client accounts linked to GeForce NOW means that the gaming experience will be more seamless than ever. It allows for "plug and play" activity, meaning that you'll be able to stream some of the most current and popular games out there right now on a top-notch rig without worrying that it's going to cause your low-tier rig to combust into flames by running in 4k. By now, adding Battle.net to the mix means that all of your games will be more accessible than ever, and you will have the potential to play the games on a variety of devices, including your phone and TV.</p>
<p>Those who own the game through Battle.net will no longer have to worry about their games not syncing up to GeForce NOW, as the update for Blizzard games will officially be rolling out to members this week. Along with the addition of Diablo IV's long-awaited expansion, there are six new games for members to stream, with plenty more games to come over the next couple of weeks to see out October. Here are all of the games that you can expect to see on the Geforce NOW client, available to stream from a powerful rig, with the player getting to choose how long their gaming sessions are via the tier of their subscription.</p>
<p>Below is the list of all of the games that are being released this week and will be available for members to stream as soon as they are released on the platform mentioned.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-6</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/timberborn-update-6-adds-full-3d-water-physics-mod-support-and-more.1006257/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Mechanistry has released&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>Update 6, which introduces a number of major new features to the beaver city-builder, including new water physics, official mod support, and more.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a string of major updates for&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>since its Early Access release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-sales-surpass-100k-copies-in-first-week">back in September 2021</a>, with other big major updates adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-timberborn-update-adds-infinite-metal-and-more">infinite metal</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-adds-robot-beaver-workers-and-more">robot beaver workers</a> (yes, really), and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-4-brings-new-map-faction-changes-and-more">new maps</a>.</p>
<p>The first big new feature in Update 6 is a new 3D water physics system, which replaces Mechanistry's "cleverly designed 2.5-dimensional system". You can now run layers of fluids on top of one another, over buildings, and more. That's right: you can finally build&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>aqueducts if you wish.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/timberborn-update-6-water-physics.jpg?itok=kzm3HyTQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/timberborn-update-6-water-physics.jpg?itok=oLm_J2Lg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Timberborn</em>'s new water physics open up a range of possibilities.</figcaption></figure><p>This new water physics system introduces a range of other possibilities to&nbsp;<em>Timberborn</em>, including new automated sluice gates, new metal platforms with overhangs, and more. You can also look forward to new vertical power shaft buildings to add efficiency to your colony.</p>
<p>Since many&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>players have been requesting more concrete endgame objectives for the game, Mechanistry has introduced Wonders, which are advanced structures you can work towards in order to "complete" your run if you want to.</p>
<p>Once a wonder has been constructed, you can change where you start for future runs on a map as well, giving you a little more flexibility in terms of how your next&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>game goes.</p>
<p>Another major feature that's been added in&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>Update 6 is official mod support; you can now download and run&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>mods via the Steam Workshop, which should make changing up your game that much easier.</p>

<p>If you want to see everything that's new, you can check out the full&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>Update 6 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1062090/view/4617965876718311948" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes right here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062090/Timberborn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. It previously cost $24.99, but starting from October 24th, it'll be getting a $10 price increase to $34.99. Bear that in mind if you've been looking to pick it up.</p>

A “That’s my sister!” will escape my lips when I reunite with my younger sibling after not seeing her for months, or I’ll utter an “I like candy, everybody likes candy” while walking through the confectionary aisle in Walgreens. Those ear worms that have remained steadfastly bored into my brain for close to thirty years are from <em>Backyard Baseball</em>, a point-and-click sports arcade game first released in 1997 that just dropped on Steam by way of publisher Playground Productions. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195386" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC Probably Won’t Change V’s Fate" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195386,196251,195805" data-current="195386"><div><p>Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC Probably Won’t Change V’s Fate</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195386/195386_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195386/195386_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195386/195386_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195386/195386_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20852.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Backyard Baseball ‘97</em> as it’s now known is the original <em>Backyard Baseball</em>, exactly how you remember it, from the cartoonish sounds of some of its absurd pitches (a sopping wet spitball or a twisting corkscrew) to the silly, sloppy field gameplay that often results in dropped balls or in-field collisions, and all the (somewhat irritating) chirps from the kids in-between. The moment I boot up <em>Backyard Baseball</em> and am greeted with the goofy opening credits, it’s like a warm hug from my YiaYia or a rainbow cookie hand-delivered from my Gramps on a brisk September morning. Picking my team from a gaggle of fidgety kids on the bleachers, kids like Pablo Sanchez, the Weber twins, and Keisha Philips, is like taking a time machine back to elementary school recess days. And when I get into an actual game and remember how arcadey and silly it is, I can’t wipe the smile off my face.<br></p><p>I first played <em>Backyard Baseball ‘97</em> during a Twitch stream, and my chat was delighted to see the game we clearly all played when we were younger. “Pablo Sanchez the GOAT,” typed one person, while many derided my CPU opponent for its lineup choices. As the game began, someone typed in chat that the announcer, Sunny Day, is voiced by none other than Jen Taylor, who plays Cortana in the <em>Halo</em> games and TV series. The vibes are impeccable as I head into the first inning.</p><p>Unfortunately, nostalgia can only carry a game so far. I am no longer in elementary school, and <em>Backyard Baseball</em>’s inherent jankiness means I rarely get on-base, so the game drags on as errors abound in my infield, the opposing team loads the bases, and my tired pitcher walks batters. The chirps from the children (some of which have not aged well) get annoying after the fourth, fifth, and sixth time they echo across the field. Thankfully, gratefully, after nine long innings, I get a Power Up while at bat with Pablo Sanchez: an aluminum bat that rockets a homerun 515 yards, bringing the game, mercifully, to an end.</p><p><em>Backyard Baseball ‘97</em> is fun in snippets, and a great way to reminisce about the games of yesteryear. It’s not expensive (just $8.99 on Steam), so it could be worth playing just to remember what it was like to live a life unburdened by taxes, toxic Twitter users, and the far-reaching global implications of 9/11 (plus you can play it on your Steam Deck). </p><p>And if you enjoy playing <em>Backyard Baseball ‘97</em>, there’s lots more nostalgia headed your way, as Playground Productions will eventually release <em>Backyard Soccer ‘98</em>, <em>Backyard Football ‘99</em>, <em>Backyard Basketball ‘01</em>,<em> Backyard Baseball ‘01</em>, and <em>Backyard Hockey ‘02</em> on Steam. You can wishlist them all now. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Each player will pick one of the six classes (Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, and Rogue), and together, you’ll venture out into the Sunderlands and engage in turn-based tactical combat. During combat, there is no set player turn order, so your strategy can adapt in a moment’s notice to react to the conditions of the battlefield. With new enemies appearing at every turn, it’s up to your party to find the best approach to each mission.</p><p>Between missions, players will return to Arden and help improve the village. You’ll unlock and upgrade different local vendors, build relationships with other Sunderfolk to earn rewards, and outfit your characters with new Skills, Weapons, Trinkets, and more.</p><p>Your goal, as the heroes of Arden, is to protect the town and its Brightshard from the corruption of shadowstone and defeat the threats from the surrounding Sunderlands.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_920699"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A Couch Cooperative First <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong> – The best adventures are meant to be shared.

                          <p><span>Dreamhaven Studios provided a round-trip train from Washington, D.C. to New York and accommodation for one night so that Ars could play <em>Sunderfolk</em> and interview its creators.

<p><span>Tabletop board games and video games typically offer ways to reduce their difficulty. But getting and keeping a group together for a semi-regular game night or impromptu session across different schedules and experience levels? That can be fiendishly hard.</span></p>
<p><span>That, more than anything, is what <a href="https://www.sunderfolk.com/"><span><i>Sunderfolk</i></span></a> wants to make easier. At its core, it’s a turn-based tactical RPG with well-worn hero classes and mechanics familiar to fans of crunchy tabletop games and CRPGs. But this upcoming game from Secret Door, led by Blizzard veteran and tabletop aficionado Chris Sigaty, wants to bring more people into the game-night fold. By fusing <em>Jackbox</em>-like accessibility with tabletop mechanics and letting the game do all the hard work, <em>Sunderfolk</em> aims to reduce learning curves, eliminate setup, and encourage game nights with friends.</span></p>

<p><span>Also, you use your phone as a controller, connected to one "big screen," local or remote. But it makes sense, and it worked, at least in the two hours I got to play <i>Sunderfolk.</i> The phone is both a controller and a replacement for all the cards, tokens, and other ephemera a tabletop player would have in front of them. And it allows for quick setup of couch co-op or screencasted play. <i>Sunderfolk</i> is a game that can make use of the QR-code-scanning, Discord-arranging skills many of us learned during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Sunderfolk</i>—due out in 2025 for PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch—is aimed at both video game and tabletop audiences. It's a bold swing, and it might not have come from anywhere else but Secret Door and the developers’ refuge that team works under.</span></p>

<h2><span><b><em>Sunderfolk</em> as a gateway to game night</b></span></h2>
<p><span><a href="https://www.dreamhaven.com/">Dreamhaven</a>, the publisher of <em>Sunderfolk</em>, is what Mike Morhaime and his wife Amy are doing now after Morhaime left Blizzard, the company he co-founded, in 2019. Morhaime has teamed up with other Blizzard ex-pats to provide <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mike-morhaime-blizzard-dreamhaven-secret-door-moonshot-feature-interview"><span>a unique kind of publishing house</span></a>, one that offers equity to every employee and a great deal of autonomy to the two studios under the Dreamhaven umbrella so far.</span></p>
<p><span>Secret Door is one of those studios. It's headed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-sigaty-2811294/"><span>Sigaty</span></a>, the executive producer of <i>Hearthstone</i>, <i>StarCraft II</i>, and <i>Heroes of the Storm</i> and lead producer of <i>Warcraft III</i>. Fellow Blizzard veterans Jason Chayes and Dustin Browder head up Moonshot, the other Dreamhaven studio working on a game that, according to Sigaty, is quite different. Secret Door has its fair share of former Blizzard creators, too.</span></p>
<p><span>But Sigaty isn’t much for talking about the old days, at least with this new game to pitch. Throughout a formal presentation, an hour-long lunch, an hour-long panel interview, and every side conversation I had with him, he always came back to tabletop. Specifically, how great it is, how more people need to do game nights, and how <i>Sunderfolk</i> is Secret Door's attempt to use the best parts of video games to deliver the best parts of tabletop while letting devices trim off the tough parts. </span></p>
<p><span>Kara Centell-Dunk, senior game designer on <i>Sunderfolk</i>, has <a href="https://www.karacentelldunk.com/projects"><span>a deep background in tabletop design</span></a>. Part of her job is making sure people picking up the game don’t see how deep it is—at least right away.</span></p>


<p><span>“The further you get into tabletop games, the more you speak your own language,” Centell-Dunk said. “The deeper you get into the hobby, the harder it can be for you to pitch that hobby to other people… You start tossing around words like ‘worker placement’ and ‘drafting’ and ‘resource management,’ ‘Eurogame,’ ‘engine building.’”&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk</em> has its own kinds of mechanics to master, but tries to get players familiar with them on a curve.</span></p>
<p><span>Along with the intimidating shorthand for newcomers, experienced tabletop heads face their own challenge: teaching new players the rules and helping them enjoy something new. “</span><span>[</span><span>People</span><span>]</span><span> don’t want to look bad in front of their friends, which I think is a really human instinct… The game will run most of itself, and I love that it was a way to invite players to try experiences I think they would love.”</span></p>
<p>If it works,&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk</em> wants to get people on the couch, or, failing that, on Discord, working through turns, choosing hero builds, and, presumably, having a chance to talk about their non-mystical lives. I can't say what it's like over the long haul, but in a preview session with a fellow journalist and <span>Centell-Dunk, I found myself getting the gist quickly, seeing meatier possibilities ahead, and, yes, getting to know two people who were utter strangers minutes before boot-up.</span></p>

<h2><span><b>Two hours in the Sunderlands</b></span></h2>
<p><span>Up to four people start out <i>Sunderfolk</i> by picking one of six heroes: arcanist, bard, berserker, pyromancer, ranger, or rogue. They’re anthropomorphized animals, so the berserker is a sledghammer-wielding bear, the rogue is a weasel, and the pyromancer is (I think) a fire-bellied toad (edit: a red-bellied newt, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/sunderfolk-is-a-couch-co-op-tactical-rpg-you-play-with-a-phone-no-really/?comments=1&amp;post=43218825">actually</a>). The fantasy town you inhabit, Arden, and its central life-giving tree are under threat. Your band sets out into the Sunderlands to figure out what’s wrong and stop it.</span></p>
<p><span>Each mission takes place on a hex-based grid; you'll be defeating baddies, rescuing innocents, and reaching other grid goals. As a group, you decide who goes next, and you can coach, argue, and even use a pointing device (Overview Mode) on your phone to map out ideas on the big screen (or just get up and point). When you’re ready, you tap to activate your turn, then use your phone to swipe between cards and trace out a path on the "big screen" to move. It’s weird at first, but after a few rounds, I could largely take my turns with barely a glance at my phone.</span></p>
<p><span>Playing with the berserker bear, pyro frog, and bird arcanist, my group both talked out strategies and engaged in some good-hearted <a href="https://youtu.be/mLyOj_QD4a4?feature=shared&amp;t=51"><span>Leroy Jenkins moments</span></a>. The bird’s spells could really mess with enemies, but, like all RPG wizards, the bird was squishy. The bear’s movement was limited, but it could draw aggression and toss enemies around. My pyro frog was a glass cannon that demanded timing and zone control; I tried to spread fire around to trap enemies and boost future attacks while staying out of the melee.</span></p>

<p><span>There’s a catch to each move, though, and it’s Fate. Each action has you draw from your Fate deck, which has a required number of positive, negative, and “other” cards. A card can add or subtract from your attacks, or change it up somehow, like modifying a dice roll. As you advance, you can alter this deck so that your worst negative outcome still gives you a bit of defense, for example, or a neutral Fate card heals you.</span></p>

      Fine, I'll get you back your beetle, but only in exchange for experience points, randomly generated loot, and the chance to name him.

<p><span>On some missions, the game sends a chosen player a Madlibs-like prompt to name something in the mission. My own prompt led my team to valiantly rescue a kidnapped beetle named Michael Keaton. There were groans and grudging acknowledgments; it was the closest parallel to my tabletop experiences.</span></p>
<p><span>After each mission, you return to town where you get a little solo “maintenance” time, mostly on your phone. You level up if needed, visit people in town for some optional <i>Stardew Valley</i>/<i>Dragon Age</i>-style friendship maintenance, equip and sell Trinkets and other gear, decide where your party is heading next, and get some narrative.</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t know much of <i>Sunderfolk</i>’s narrative after just two hours and four missions. It’s linear, it’s appropriate for kids, and if you’re on a replay, it’s mostly skippable. Then again, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjali_Bhimani"><span>Anjali Bhimani</span></a> (i.e., Symmetra from <i>Overwatch</i>, Rampart from <i>Apex Legends</i>) does the majority of the voices here, so it’s not a hard listen.</span></p>
<p><span>The developers’ best guess is that the 38 missions currently in the game will take 25–35 hours on a first playthrough. The big variable, as with any game night, is how much “analysis paralysis” members of your group experience. </span></p>
<p><span>You can add new players and move on if a friend drops out, and people can play as other characters in a pinch (solo play would be running a minimum of two characters at once). <em>Sunderfolk</em> will do some auto-leveling for players who missed a session or two, and players can also gift gold or items to each other. The difficulties, adjustable at any time, span from “you pass out instead of die, infinite times” to “every creature is elite, death is real, and there’s a timer.”</span></p>
<p><span>Replayability should come from the side missions you didn’t choose last time, the range of characters and builds available, and weapons that can drastically change your play style (I didn’t get to those in my preview). The developers’ greatest hope is that players will want to introduce a wider range of friends to the game, ranging from casual gamers to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/gloomhaven-review-2017s-biggest-board-game-is-astoundingly-good/#page-2"><i>Gloomhaven</i></a> engineers.</span></p>

<h2><span><b>Can <em>Sunderfolk</em> hit with two markets?</b></span></h2>
<p><span>I asked Sigaty if, as a new 28-person studio, developing an original property for four platforms (plus mobile), Secret Door was “playing on hard mode.” He agreed and took it further, comparing Secret Door’s work to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_triangle"><span>fire triangle</span></a> of heat, fuel, and oxygen. “New team, new IP, and new game. We did all three—and question our sanity a little bit.” But it was a conscious decision, Sigaty says, and a specific challenge.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re trying to walk this really interesting line… If you come from this deeper board game side, you’ll find gameplay depth that’s there. And if you’ve never played these sorts of games before, you can get in and start playing and realizing this is something really fun,” Sigaty said. The world, too, is crafted to walk a middle line, having stakes but not being overly violent or sexualized. “We want families to be able to play together, too,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span>Then there’s the phone thing. There is no controller or keyboard option; you need an iOS or Android device with a touchscreen to play. Sigaty and his team say they’ve optimized the game for phone battery life. The game can also work fully on local network connections, leaving Secret Door’s servers only for remote play.</span></p>
<p><span>So only one person has to have the actual <i>Sunderfolk</i> game—displaying it on a TV, a Discord screencast, or wherever—while three others can scan a QR code and join by phone. </span><span>As for the diminished sales potential that might present, Sigaty doesn’t seem concerned. Playing the game is its own marketing to own the game and bring in others, he suggested, similar to playing a board game and wanting to own it yourself. </span></p>
<p><span>I asked Sigaty how Secret Door plans to pitch a brand-new game to both tabletop and video game markets, perhaps simultaneously. “If there’s a story to <i>Sunderfolk,</i> it’s to walk the middle line,” Sigaty said. “My hope is… we can appeal to both audiences and say, ‘Both of you have a place here’ and act as this bridge to those people or their friends who never really played a tabletop experience before, or maybe never played a tactical strategy game on PC or console.”</span></p>
<p><em>This post was updated at 11:35 a.m. to note that the pyromancer character is likely a red-bellied newt, not a fire-bellied toad. Ars regrets its attempt at armchair herpetology.</em></p>

The word economy, however, can be used to describe inter-related systems and activities, across a vast range of smaller subdivisions including, for example companies or even a single family.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is generally understood that game economy design concerns itself more with game design than traditional economics. While real-world economic theories and terminology are referenced and used to some extent, the game economy designer’s role, along with other designers, is to create player engagement and, specifically, things for the players to do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A game economy is a highly tailored, fabrication of a real-world economy, functioning around in-game resources, currencies and virtual goods, along with a system of engagements and activities for players. It is, in essence, a much simpler, controlled version of a real world economy.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-games-meant-for-sharing" target="_self">Book Excerpt: Designing Games Meant for Sharing</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The aspects of a game which fall under the umbrella of game economy can be tricky to define, and different genres of games utilize game economy design in different ways. However, there are a number of components, practices and theoretical tools for the game economy designer to use, which will be discussed in the following sub-sections of this chapter.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What Does a Game Economy Designer Do?">What Does a Game Economy Designer Do?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Naturally the game economy designer’s overarching task is to create the interweaving systems and flow of resources, goods and currencies within the game: a game economy. The job itself is a subspecialty within the divisions of game design and can generally be thought of as concerning the design of the systems which relate to the long-term engagement of the player. This contrasts with the other design disciplines which are working on the minute-to-minute action-phase gameplay. Game economy design concerns itself with the areas of the game which include the control for distribution of content and rewards (broadly, a progression system), and the resources, goods and currencies which are used in tandem with these systems. By extension, the game economy designer is concerned with the monetization and microtransaction elements which have become more commonplace throughout games.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/book-excerpt-game-engine-architecture" target="_self">Book Excerpt: Game Engine Architecture</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Essential to any role within the game design team is a high level of collaboration with colleagues. Game economy design is no different.&nbsp; There are certain aspects which absolutely lend themselves to two or more people sitting down in front of a computer screen and discussing the inner workings of a system. This will and should form a key part of the working day. The areas covered by you as a game economy designer will overlap one way or another with the work of a designer covering the many other systems in the game, including user interface and narrative. Beyond this, naturally you will collaborate with developers on the entire team. This is the spirit of game development, and it involves an intricate blend of technology, art, creativity and psychology, all mixed to produce fascinating end products to be enjoyed by millions.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Goals of a Game Economy">Goals of a Game Economy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A fundamental question: why do we have the need for a game economy in the first place?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The concept of a game economy is utilized to varying degrees across the different genres of games, and it is true that not all genres require a standard game economy. From the early days of the games industry, many titles had little concept of such a game economy. However, as games developed over the years, new trends surfaced, and new types of gameplay experiences and engagement developed, and therefore so did the need for a game economy.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/book-excerpt-ai-for-game-developers" target="_self">Book Excerpt: AI For Game Developers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game design as a discipline, and by extension the game designer as a role, is there to solve conceptual problems within the development cycle</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">of a game, leading to an improved player experience. Ergo, game economy typically exists to solve a number of problems often concerned with the overall player journey and long-term engagement within a game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A game economy facilitates direct player engagement. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">A game economy in this sense bleeds into the main action phase of a game (e.g. playing a mission in a shooter game, involving combat). As a game economy encompasses the systems related to player resources, goods and in-game currencies, these are used to give a degree of value and context to the goods that a player utilizes while playing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A game economy provides long-term player experience</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. One of the key aspects to a game economy is to provide a motivation for long-term engagement within a game. The controlled distribution and usage of resources should keep players coming back over an extended period of time and allow the player to establish a routine of play on a regular basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A game economy acts as the access to and the control of distribution of content. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Closely related to the motivation for long-term engagement is the need for control and by extension safety measures over the distribution of content. A game development team can only create a finite amount of content with the time and budget allowed for any project. If the pacing of the content is incorrect, players can potentially burn through this content far too quickly, ultimately causing the player to leave the game; i.e. if the player acquires the game’s most valuable content with relative ease, what reason would they have to continue playing? The game economy and, in particular, the progression systems (see below) can act as metaphorical brakes on content distribution, ultimately preventing a potentially damaging content burn rate. Aside from preventing content burn, a game economy concerns itself with session control.&nbsp; In other words, the game must provide the player with just enough content: not too little, not too much during any given play session. The details of how long a play session should be will vary depending on the game itself, the genre, platform and target audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The concept of giving utility to players is achieved by this access to content. Think of an open world game, which opens up more as the player plays, giving access to more quests, side quests, collectables, skills and surprises along the way. Alternatively, a collectable card game gives the player an expanding pool of mechanics to use, thus creating strategic depth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A game economy itself provides engagement and should generate fun. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Often, the game economy is something which is generally “felt” by the player, as opposed to being noticed in the same moment to moment fashion as core gameplay mechanics. Naturally, creating a game economy interaction which features the same emotion, sensation and buzz of action gameplay would be an impossible task.&nbsp; However, the concept of an economy generating intrinsic fun for the player is an important design consideration. The narrative design and the nature of the project can also have an impact on this. For example, if a game features fly-by-night black market trading, this could provide some inherent intrigue to otherwise relatively mundane elements.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A game economy provides adaptability and growth. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Many video games must be sustainable long after their initial launch, and postlaunch operations continuously update the game after its initial launch.&nbsp; The game economy must be built in such a way as to allow it to be expanded and modified. These updates can take many forms, such as new currencies and features which “plug into” the main game economy systems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A game economy provides access to monetization, and depth of player spending. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Monetization in the context of game economy design typically refers to the in-app/in-game purchases (microtransactions) that occur after the main game purchase or free download. These give the player access to premium (premium will be synonymous with “costing real money” throughout this book) features and content. With a strong game economy design, there will be a synergy between the regular economy and the premium (costing real money) content. One caveat is that the individual business model and game genre is a major determinant of how the game economy relates to monetization. Monetization will be covered in more detail within Chapter 4.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Key Components of the Game Economy">Key Components of the Game Economy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the goals of a game economy in mind, what are the actual building blocks and theoretical components/elements which the economy designer has at his/her disposal?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Currencies are a natural part of any economy, both virtual and real world. However, currencies do not necessarily need to exist in video games. There are many games which do not require currency and, by extension, do not have a typical game economy. This does not prevent these games from containing a progression system, and other resources for players to collect. For games which have a currency – that is, a medium of exchange – integrated into their design, the common convention is to design a soft currency, which is a currency that the player obtains from playing the game. The soft currency is used for purchases within the game that have a direct link to the gameplay and the player’s engagement. For example, soft currencies are used as a charge for upgrading weapons and equipment used by the player. Many games take the design approach of having a single soft currency with a variety of uses spread across the game’s features. This soft currency works in synergy with other more specific resources within the game, and free-to-play games typically often introduce other new soft currencies into their design, especially as these games adapt and evolve with updates post release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many games typically also introduce a hard currency. This is a currency that is acquired through real money microtransactions and can have a variety of applications. The most noteworthy use of a hard currency is for the purchase of purely cosmetic vanity items. These are often used for character customization such as items of clothing and accessories, but can also be special commands known as emotes, which players use to convey emotions or perform greetings to other players during a multiplayer game. Economy design does not preclude a hard currency from being dropped in small quantities through the gameplay. This is often used during the early stages of a game to teach the player the usage of hard currency and to help to drive potential further monetization.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Goods</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Goods are items in the game that are tangible to the player. A good in this sense can be difficult to define. Broadly speaking, these are the major items that the players owns. Not all of these may relate directly to the game economy, although from a theoretical standpoint they do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The items which are easily recognizable as goods tied to the game economy are weapons, armor pieces, cosmetic apparel and similar content tied to the in-game currencies. For example, a loot focused roleplaying game will involve repeated cycles of buying and selling these items. Other items that can be viewed as goods are, for example, tools and gadgets which many action or stealth games often incorporate into their design. These items may simply be available to use, without significant links to the game economy, and are therefore of more concern to system designers. However, the game economy designer must be a stakeholder within their design, as the use of these items will have an impact on player performance and can have a knock-on effect on other aspects of the game economy, for example, the rate at which players progress and acquire currencies and resources.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resources</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Resources can also be difficult to define, as there is often an overlap between goods and currencies, but there are typically differences to note. Resources are often collected for a specific purpose and combined or utilized within one or more of the game’s systems. They are typically precursor items used in the production of other items and are collected in abundance throughout a game environment or via core gameplay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A common type of resource which many will encounter includes crafting materials found in modern action role-playing games. For example, the player must collect the resource called “metal fragments”, which can be taken to a blacksmith non-player character, who will use these metal fragments to craft a new sword for the player. These types of resources are usually distributed in abundance and can help to provide a method for designers of large scale – particularly open world – titles to extensively populate the game environment with numerous amounts of minor rewards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although not generally thought of as a resource, experience points which are awarded through gameplay would be broadly classified as a resource for the player. These may not be used in the direct sense, but they contribute to other systems, unlocks and rewards. They would differ from a currency, as they cannot be spent by the player. There is a similarity here with professional sports leagues, where teams accumulate points from winning matches.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A word of caution regarding terminology. The term “resource” will commonly be used as an over-arching term for all elements of a game economy, from currencies to content. Keep context in mind while researching.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sources</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A source can also be called a faucet, or a tap in British English. A source is defined as a means within the game by which players receive in-game currency, resources or goods. In the context of a virtual game economy, the currency, resource or good is created from nothing and injected into the economy. With a source created, the game economy designer has the task of adjusting how much currency (or resources/ goods) this source provides to the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Typically, the most prominent source within a game economy is that which generates in-game soft currency. Sources for soft currency are used as a method for providing the main reward for the player’s engagement with the core gameplay. As the currency is generated from everyday engagement by the player, this can often generate a large amount of currency simply by existing, in turn creating the main balancing task for the designer. An example would be an amount of soft currency which the player receives for completing a level in a mobile puzzle game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The source for resources is another type which you will encounter within a game economy. Designers often use more bespoke means to generate resources for players, entirely dependent on the type of game and the business model, to solve problems in the design or guide the player to playing the game in a specific method or pattern.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Consider a system where the player must upgrade weapons, and after reaching the maximum level, the player can begin levelling up the weapon again from zero, but this time with new powered-up features on the weapon permanently available. In order to reset the weapon, the player must use a rare resource only acquired from completing specific weekly missions within the game. The use of these therefore guides the player into a weekly engagement with the game, controlling the means by which the player can upgrade weapons.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources for goods can be more difficult to define and are not to be confused with traders (see section below). Sources for goods, like resources, are often used to solve specific design problems, but can be a main part of the game’s core engagement. For example, many roleplaying games function around the collection of loot; items dropped by enemies. An example would be a sword dropped by a monster after the player kills it, within a fantasy role-playing game. Sources for goods can also provide the player with certain rewards for regular engagement with the game, to aid retention. An example would be a consumable health potion which is given to the player for returning to the game a specific number of times within a set period (though in practice, currency is used more predominantly in this instance).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sinks</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A sink (sometimes called a drain) is a way or object/element within the game which removes currency, resources or goods from the economy. A sink destroys the currency, resource or good, removing it permanently. Sinks are used to combat currency inflation and work in conjunction with sources. It is also the task of the designer to balance the sinks to remove sufficient currency, resources or goods relative to the rate at which the sources are generating.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A sink for currency can initially seem obvious to design but can quickly become tricky to add to a game while keeping a sense of credibility within the experience and the established narrative of the game.&nbsp; Definitions become more obscure with currency sinks relative to the type of game. Take the example of purchasing a store item. Within the context of a single player game without player-to-player trading, this can act as a currency sink, with the currency being taken out of the economy. We should note that this currency is being replaced by a good. In essence, this behaves more like a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>converter </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(see below).&nbsp; Naturally, the player must get something in return for spending their hard-earned currency, so finding intricate ways of removing the currency while giving something in return which is continually needed and desired, something moreover that can be given repeatedly over the player’s lifetime with the game, is a key design challenge. Within a game which involves player trading, buying items from other players would not act as a sink at all, as the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>trader </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(see below) would exchange the currency and the good between the two parties. Given the fact that soft currency is readily printed by playing a game, it naturally</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">tends to be in abundance, with designers left straining to find ways to remove it. A few examples of currency sinks would be: an amount of soft currency charged for upgrading a piece of equipment, or an amount of currency charged to begin a new match, which may be used for certain game modes in multiplayer titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The concept of sinks for resources may be used for specific cases within the game. Resources tend to have controlled distribution relative to the game and are given very specific uses, so their need for blatant sinks is not the same as for currencies. Resources function effectively with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>converters </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(see below), for example where they can be transformed into goods. This would effectively be a sink for the resource and a source for the good.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sinks for goods can take different forms, and game designers often come up with quite innovative ways to remove items from a player, again specific to the genre and business model of the game. Roleplaying games often allow players to sell unwanted items to non-player character vendors, in return for small amounts of currency or resources.&nbsp; While this is theoretically a trade, the good is being destroyed by the vendor, and the amount of currency given back is typically a fraction of the amount that the good was purchased with. In certain cases, games may feature items or weapons which are permanently lost, for example if the player character is killed during a mission.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Converters</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Converters are mechanics which transform one type of good, currency or resource into another within the game. A useful way of thinking about the converter is that it is acting as a source and sink simultaneously, producing one element in return for instantly destroying another. While this can be applied in many ways within games, the most obvious use of the converter lies within the design of crafting systems, or the harvesting of resources or similar mechanics within strategy, or construction and citybuilding simulation games. For example, players will collect certain raw resources deposited from the game environment and will use these in conjunction with a nonplayer character (e.g. a blacksmith) to create a new tool or weapon. The use of converters can be applied across many genres of games and can be used as part of puzzle solving within games, or indeed any system whereby players collect multiple components and then combine these into a single whole item. The behavior of the converter should not be described as a variation of a sink. Although the number of elements can be reduced, the converter does not totally destroy anything without replacing it with something else. It is a theoretical tool at the disposal of the game economy designer, to be utilized in various situations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Traders</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Traders are mechanics which exchange goods, resources or currencies between different entities within the game. As a definition this can seem overly technical, but in practice the trader is a theoretical way of describing the behavior of, for example, a player purchasing a weapon from another player, for an amount of in-game money. The trader mechanic transfers in-game money from the account of Player A to the account of Player B and transfers the weapon from the account of Player B to the account of Player A. This is where we can observe the nuances of traders and the overlap between traders and sinks. If the player buys a new item from a non-player vendor character, this is not trader functionality. From the player’s perspective it appears to be the same, i.e. they give away one element and receive a different one in return. But in this instance, the player is interacting with the game which destroys the in-game currency and creates an item out of nothing to give to the player. A trader as a theoretical object must not destroy or create anything, it simply exchanges different existing elements between entities in the game. Even within a game which involves player to player trading, from the perspective of one player, the trader appears to act like a converter on the surface, but in terms of the overall economic balance, and crucially for the designer, the two are different.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game Genre and Business Models">Game Genre and Business Models</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For those of us who have had a strong passion for video games from a young age, the concept of genre is something from which we derive our main emotional connection to the games we enjoy. As the years go by and we purchase new devices, and their associated titles, we connect to specific types of games and find new favorites, and obsessions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the ever-changing landscape of the games industry, the factors constituting the different game genres have also changed. There is still a lot of ambiguity, with many games breaking trends, and fusing defining elements from different genres.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What defines a game’s genre? Genre is the French word for type, and the term is often heard in the context of films. However, what characterizes the video game medium is that genre mainly refers to the type of gameplay involved, as opposed to the type of story being told. Some of the main video game genres with which I have always associated personally are the following:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• First-person shooter</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Action adventure</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Sports</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Racing</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Puzzle</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Strategy</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are a plethora of sub-genres within each of these, and the list could extend for many pages.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How are these different genres relevant to the game economy?&nbsp; Naturally, some genres lend themselves to a typical game economy far more than others, but there is a large gray area in between the extremes which includes varying aspects and elements of a game economy. A strategy game such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clash of Clans </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">features a prominent game economy and metagame, while a story-driven adventure or interactive drama title may feature no game economy in the immediate sense. However, there may be progression systems built into a story-driven game, even if they are not prominent and player facing, so the generic principles and theory within this book should be able to be readily applied whenever the needs arise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this point, it becomes necessary to address the two major business models that dominate the games industry: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Free-to-Play </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Premium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Free-to-Play</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A game which follows the free-to-play business model is available for players to play without any upfront real money cost and is the dominant business model for mobile games. Monetization is built into the game via the use of non-compulsory microtransactions, which the player can carry out from within the game. The microtransactions provide the user with some benefit(s), closely related to the game’s design, such as content, or some other more optimal experience for the player to enjoy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Monetization should be built into the game from the ground up and be considered during development as part of the process of building the game’s economy. Tagging on a monetization strategy at the end of a project will inevitably lead to a more mediocre result.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A pattern of effective design for free-to-play games tends to involve a single core method of play, which takes place in consistently measurable play sessions, and from here the player builds an expression around this core experience, with engagement, retention and ultimately monetization features wrapped around this. A good example of this would be the game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rocket League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which shifted business models to free-to-play, from originally being a premium title. The game centers around multiplayer matches, with other features such as tournaments, customization and live events all complementing this single user experience (Figure 1.1).</span></p><p>Figure 1.1 Typical gameplay loop for a free-to-play game.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Premium games are games in which the player must pay an upfront cost. Many of the most popular franchises on PC and console are premium products.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a premium experience demands that a player part with real money before beginning to play, there is more leeway for the game to be a self-contained journey, which combines different challenges, rhythms of engagement, types of gameplay and experiences (Figure 1.2).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A single player, open world, story-driven game could be considered an archetype for this, with a narrative that changes, progresses and adapts to context, combined with a mixture of combat and problem solving gameplay, and many other surprises along the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are exceptions to this, with some sports and racing games being genres which could conveniently lend themselves to the free-to play type of engagement. It is worth bearing in mind that these games are often high budget, yearly iterating franchises, with licenses from sports associations, and often in themselves contain expansive career and season modes, requiring a large time investment from the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Paymium </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is a term that can be used to refer to the practice of a premium game also including the opportunity for further in-game microtransactions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I feel the need to make a small qualification in relation to the detailed chapters which form the remainder of this book. It is certainly true that a great deal of game economy and monetization design has its heart in the free-to-play model, and this should be taken into consideration. However, bearing in mind the readership for this book,&nbsp;</span></p><p>Figure 1.2 Player engagement diagram for a typical premium product.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">and the changing nature of the games industry, I have attempted to generalize the concept of game economy to systems which can be applied to solve meta design-related problems within different games. These potential solutions will be largely independent of the business model the project is using, but will also allow for the perception that some genres lend themselves to game economy more than others.&nbsp; Often, there is overlap between free-to-play and premium design, and the methodologies can be readily applied across different projects. By extension, game design can be boiled down to a series of problems to solve whatever interconnected systems are present. Therefore, it is very relevant as an economy designer to think of and apply the theory to whichever project-specific problems present themselves, and to be able to, for example, use and reapply free-to-play best practices in a premium game where relevant and whenever the needs arise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now we will begin the deep dive, by first looking at the high-level driving force behind the game economy, in “player motivation”.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Player Motivation">Player Motivation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a prelude to going into the specifics of building the game economy, it is important to start asking the most high-level questions about the overall design of the game, which is, in essence, part of the game’s overall direction. This is something which must happen before preproduction fully starts, and is usually handled within a small team, including the game director who sets the creative vision for the project. To get to the bottom of player motivation, and with the business model being already decided, there are a series of questions which will help set the scene for the metagame.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first question is who is the target audience for the game? Every game needs a target audience. Different titles appeal to different people, with varying life habits and character traits. Keeping the game’s meta features in line with the overall creative vision is part of the economy designer’s role, and identifying the target audience helps with this. The target audience guides everything about the game, from the type of content and features to the pacing of progression, and the multitude of decisions that will be made along the way. For example, if you are building a game for a more casual audience, it would not be sensible to spend a lot of development resources building an incredibly deep series of meta systems which are not going to be discovered by the majority of players. Likewise, an economy which is too simplistic would not appeal to the audience of a more hardcore game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second question is what are the main emotions that the game’s design wants to generate in players? You need to identify how you would like your players to feel while playing the game, and how these feelings connect with each other. These involve everything from the waves of emotion that occur during a single round of gameplay, and during a single play session, all the way through to the overarching emotions over the player’s lifetime with the game. Is there anything in particular you are looking to ignite in players? There are many different emotions that are intrinsic to video games, and the design of the metagame and economy can play on these. Satisfaction, happiness and surprise can be powerful positive emotions to generate in players. However, you must also look to conjure up more negative emotions such as frustration and disappointment along the way. A game requires this to complement the positive times. Pride and envy, which are themselves extremely powerful feelings, can also be exploited. With insights gained from the first two questions, the third question is: what are players going to be doing within the game? This will typically adhere closely to the genre of the game. Take a step back into the persona of the player and ask the question, what am I doing in a game? Naturally, the first answer that comes to mind is trivial. In a racing game you are racing vehicles, probably cars in some form. But really, there are sub-genres within this, with their own experiences that cater to different players. There is often one over-arching goal, but there are many different segments of player experience to take into consideration. For example, a game could involve engaging in quick races, to build up a collection of vehicles, with upgrades helping with this collection process. The game could have a story mode, various multiplayer modes and ranked leagues. What are the predominant elements to consider, and how do they come together into a coherent whole?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Developing an Economy">Developing an Economy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The natural follow-on from the previous questions is to take the answers and put them into more of a context within a system of components which help to build up a working game economy. With the</span></p><p>Figure 1.3 Diagram showing the highest level of theoretical game economy components.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">knowledge of the components of the economy, we can now think about the overall experience of the game, and what the player is doing in terms of the gameplay. This can be seen as a hypothetical directional thought process to ignite the game economy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We can address the highest-level theory of the economy by thinking through and answering questions related to the following topics:&nbsp; Activities, Intensity, Rewards and User Journey (Figure 1.3).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Activities</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What are the core activities that happen within the game, through the different types of gameplay in relation to the game economy?&nbsp; Ultimately you are addressing the question of what the things are that players are doing. This could be the main story battles that onboard new players and keep them engaged for multiple subsequent play sessions. Other examples could involve quick battles, daily challenges or end-game boss raids.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Intensity</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The intensity takes the activities and contextualizes them in terms of how much time and effort they require from the player. This will then be used to define what type of rewards they tie into. For example, an end-game boss raid would require far more valuable, rare rewards compared to a simple daily logon reward, which would require a small amount of the game’s main (and easy-to-acquire) soft currency. This is an important step. It may seem like common sense, but it is important during the course of development to identify and keep a measure of the type or quantity of rewards that are given through different game play modes or features, and how these may potentially change. During the cold reality of game development, it is quite common to be pushed into re-using certain rewards. Economy designers can find themselves not differentiating sufficiently between easy-to-acquire and extremely grind-focused rewards, which in turn has a detrimental effect on the player’s overall engagement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rewards</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This step requires the designer to define the currencies which will drive the economy. In addition to this, the resources can be considered. In reality, the line between currencies and resources can become blurry. The goods which serve as rewards must also be defined, and in general how these all tie together. This stage involves asking the question “why does the player care about investing in this economy?”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>User Journey</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this stage you will be considering the overall user journey of the player. This ties heavily into the overall progression system (regardless of how prominent and/or complex the progression system is). It is this section that will serve as the initial spark for the more complex design of the user journey. At this point you must reflect on how things will change over time from a high-level standpoint.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is an early onboarding phase, which can be more contrived and designer controlled. The player investment is small at this point and should therefore require minimal effort. There will be a mid-level phase where players are in the system, with less predictability around the player’s experience. Last, although not relevant to all players, an end-game phase for the most experienced and skilled individuals must be considered.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We must ask ourselves, what do we do to keep players going forward? What activities are unlocking, and what types of rewards and currencies are focused on during certain points within the user journey. For example, how are these rewards distributed at the end game compared to the mid-game phases?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this stage, it will be prudent to roughly map out the stages of the user journey on paper, which will serve as the basis for planning the deeper, detailed design to follow.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Reference">Reference</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Virtual Economies: Design and Analysis, Vili Lehdonvirta and Edward Castronova, 2014</span></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V was released almost ten years ago on PC, but with some choice mods, the popular open-world title by Rockstar Games can look as mind-blowing as some of the best games released in the current console generation.</p>
<p>A new video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> shows the fifth entry in the series running with mods like <a href="https://www.razedmods.com/gta-v">NaturalVision Evolved</a> and <a href="https://gtareal.club/">GTA 5Real</a>, among others, at 8K resolution. At times, it's almost difficult to say this is Grand Theft Auto V and not a more recent, current-generation game.</p>

<p>Fans of the series by Rockstar Games will have to make do with Grand Theft Auto V for a little while longer, as its highly-anticipated sequel will be released sometime next year. Given the game's ambition and scale, however, the release date could slip to 2026, although, as of last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">it hasn't been delayed internally yet</a>. Its ambitious nature could also make it impossible for current generation consoles, including the soon-to-be-released PlayStation 5 Pro, to run it at<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/"> 60 frames per second</a>, forcing players who want to experience the new rendition of Vice City at high refresh rates to wait for the PC version, which has yet to be officially announced.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, Xbox One and Xbox 360.</p>
