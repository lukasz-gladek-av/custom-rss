			<p>If you were unaware, <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/gamescom-award">Gamescom</a> has its own set of awards given out at the annual event that are voted on by members of an independent jury, with the purpose of the awards being "<em>to honor outstanding games, extensions, exhibitors, booths, merch, as well as announcements and trailers</em>," per the <a href="https://media.koelnmesse.io/gamescom/redaktionell/gamescom/downloads/pdf/gamescom-award/regulations.pdf">awards regulations</a>. For <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, there was a clear winner, with Capcom and Resident Evil Requiem hogging the spotlight and being one of three games to take home multiple awards.  </p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem took home wins for Best Visuals, Best Audio, the Most Epic Game, and the Best Sony PlayStation Game at this year's show. The only other titles to grab multiple awards were Hela, an indie game that won Most Entertaining and Most Wholesome, and Anno 117: Pax Romana, which won Best PC Game and Best Booth, though technically that last one goes to Ubisoft for the Anno 117: Pax Romana booth.</p>



<p>The other notable win in this year's awards was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gamescom/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> taking home the prize for Best Trailer, which was one of the few awards not voted on by the pre-selected jury, but by the general public.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/axbylute-will-actually-sell-intel-and-tencent%E2%80%99s-gigantic-glasses-free-3d-handheld.1278531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337860/intel-brought-a-big-honking-stereo-3d-handheld-gaming-pc-to-ces-2025">one of the wildest Intel prototypes I witnessed at CES</a> was a giant handheld gaming PC with an 11-inch autostereoscopic (read: glasses-free) 3D screen, detachable controllers, an Intel Lunar Lake chip, and a dedicated toggle to switch between 2D and 3D modes.</p><p>Co-developed by Intel and Tencent Games, it was called the Sunday Dragon 3D One and <a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/813/251.htm">dubbed an experimental product</a>. But now, Abxylute, the company best known for kickstarting <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/abxylute/abxylute-cloud-gaming-handheld-console">a $199 cloud gaming handheld</a>, tells <em>The Verge</em> that it will actually sell this massive Windows handheld as the <a href="https://abxylute.com/products/abxylute-3d-one">Abxylute 3D One</a>.</p><p>It should go on sale in late September or early October for a price under $1,700, marketing head Eunice Lu tells me.</p><p>Abxylute largely seems to be whitelabeling the product. The company’s photos look like the one I saw at CES, up to and including the model name “Sunday Dragon 3D One” printed on the back, though Lu tells me final units won’t have that branding. The company’s also upfront that it will come with Tencent’s eye-tracking 3D display, co-developed with partners Intel and display maker BOE.</p><p>It should even have a Tencent app that claims to add 3D depth to your 2D photos, videos, and games, using a real-time interleaving algorithm, though you won’t always need to rely on that: Abxylute claims the product’s specifically optimized to deliver 3D for 50 of the top Steam games, including <em>Black Myth: Wukong, Naraka Bladepoint </em>and<em> Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</p><p>One important difference since CES: it has new twin touchpads on each of its detachable grips! Those grips also have magnetic drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks and triggers.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338654/i-finally-touched-the-msi-claw-8-ai-plus">MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> that I’m currently reviewing (which recently got a graphics driver update that gives it competitive performance with other top Windows handhelds), it’ll feature Intel’s Core Ultra 258V chip and 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, powering a 120Hz 16:10 screen.</p><p>Unlike MSI’s 8-inch handheld, however, this is a huge 3-in-1 convertible: its 10.95-inch 2560 x 1600 display can lean back on a kickstand as you detach the controllers, or plug into a magnetic keyboard folio, when you’re not holding up its entire 2.45 pounds (1.11kg) between your two hands. And yet it only houses a 50 watt-hour battery, smaller than the Claw 8 or the Asus ROG Ally X. It also advertises a switchable display with 60Hz and 120Hz modes — not a variable refresh rate, which I’ve found provides smoother gameplay on handhelds like these.</p><p>Some of the screen’s specs are intentional for 3D reasons, though. Lu says “3D mode requires the display to run at 120Hz,” and it’s deliberately a large screen: “smaller panels noticeably reduce the naked-eye 3D effect, so this form factor was chosen to preserve stereoscopic quality.” Thinking back, it’s true that I’ve enjoyed glasses-free 3D screens more when they’re larger, as you can move your head more to appreciate the depth without running into a screen bezel.</p><p>Even if it’s not as portable and far pricier than the competition, I bet the Abxylute will have devotees: my colleague Antonio <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment">appreciates the idea of big handhelds</a> after toying with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339992/acer-nitro-blaze-11-gaming-handheld-steam-deck-size-comparison">the Acer Nitro Blaze 11</a>, a handheld the same size and shape as this!</p><p>And it’s also possible creators looking for a glasses-free 3D device will buy one with no intention of gaming: the screens can be handy to preview 3D models and artistry, though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24036574/leia-glasses-free-3d-ces-2024">laptops and standalone screens with the tech also exist</a>.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/763957/axbylute-will-actually-sell-intel-and-tencents-gigantic-glasses-free-3d-handheld#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/763957/axbylute-will-actually-sell-intel-and-tencents-gigantic-glasses-free-3d-handheld]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-new-bubsy-game-actually-looks-awesome-seriously.1278528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When, earlier this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> kicked off with the reveal of a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-first-five-minutes-of-bubsy-is-all-the-bubsy-we-nee-1749075286"><em>Bubsy</em></a> game, many online, myself included, went “Oh no…” as we shook our collective heads. But despite the last few <em>Bubsy</em> games being bad, it seems this new one,<em> Bubsy 4D</em>, might actually be…good? In fact, it might even be awesome. Really. Seriously.</p> <p>Back in the early ’90s, Bubsy starred in a handful of fairly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubsy#History">well-received 2D platformers</a>. But then in 1996, the <em>Bubsy</em> series made the leap to 3D, and everything went south. People hated <em>Bubsy 3D</em> and to this day, it is still called one of the worst platformers ever made. Then, in the last decade, we started getting new <em>Bubsy</em> games. They were also bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/PecXsy5-0yw"><em>Really</em> bad.</a> But now, a few years after Atari bought the franchise, <em>Bubsy 4D</em> is here, and it just might turn things around for the hopping feline.</p> <p><em>Bubsy 4D</em> is being made by <a href="https://www.fabraz.com/">Fabraz</a>, a renowned indie studio that has made a name for itself developing fun, innovative, and colorful 3D and 2D platformers that feel amazing to play, like <em>Demon Turf</em> and <em>Slime San</em>. And since announcing the game earlier this week at Gamescom, the studio has started releasing gameplay of <em>Bubsy 4D</em>, and it looks wonderful!</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Because a lot of people were curious: Here's me playing the same Bubsy 4D level without trying speedrun it. <a href="https://t.co/Xcm6mygpS8">pic.twitter.com/Xcm6mygpS8</a></p> <p>— Fabraz: Demon Tides ➡️ Gamescom (@Fabrazz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fabrazz/status/1958646093031366982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In new gameplay shared from the Gamescom demo, we can see <em>Bubsy 4D</em> in action, and the game looks vibrant and slick. Movement and jumping look snappy, but there’s some weight to Bubsy, so it’s not too floaty. I’m also a fan of<a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1958190420598366399"> Bubsy’s personality in the videos released so far, too</a>. Another wild fact about this new <em>Bubsy</em> game: It contains fully voiced, 3D animated cutscenes.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fun fact, Bubsy 4D has fully voiced cutscenes cus' why not! <a href="https://t.co/DrL6A75f9x">pic.twitter.com/DrL6A75f9x</a></p> <p>— Fabraz: Demon Tides ➡️ Gamescom (@Fabrazz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fabrazz/status/1958456027675795909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I can’t believe I’m saying this in the year of our lord 2025, but I’m very excited about a <em>Bubsy</em> game. Everything I’ve seen of Fabraz’s<em> Bubsy 4D</em> looks incredible. And people who have played the demo at Gamescom seem positive about how it plays and feels, which is only making me more excited for this sequel. <a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1958916894548803679">There’s also an outfit that blurs Bubsy’s private parts</a> and is a reference to Sonic. <a href="https://x.com/Fat_Bard/status/1958938923507306765">Even the game’s music sounds great!</a> So yeah, I want to play<em> Bubsy 4D</em> right now. But I can’t. Which makes me very sad. Damn you, Bubsy!</p> <p><em>Bubsy 4D</em> is set to launch on consoles and PC… eventually. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3237970/Bubsy_4D/">You can wishlist it now on Steam.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nvidia Cuts Prices Of RTX 50-Series GPUs In Europe]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nvidia graphics cards are getting a bit cheaper in Europe as the company has lowered the prices of a number of RTX 50-series GPUs.</p>



<p>Cut by nearly 10% in some cases, the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 have seen their prices drop across the region. The move comes as the Euro contains to strengthen against the United States (US) dollar.</p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-cuts-geforce-rtx-50-prices-in-europe-as-eur-strengthens-against-us-dollar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>, the top-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 is retailing for €2,099, a 9.88% drop from the launch price of €2,329. The next-highest card, the RTX 5080, is now 9.4% lower at €1,059. The RTX 5070 has fallen 9.24% from €649 to €589. Lastly, the low-end RTX 5050 has a smaller drop, but still a drop nonetheless, of 6.7% to €251.</p>



<h6 id="h-more-tech-news-intel-giving-away-battlefield-6-with-cpu-or-gpu-purchase">More Tech News: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-giving-away-battlefield-6-with-cpu-or-gpu-purchase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intel Giving Away Battlefield 6 With CPU or GPU Purchase</a></h6>



<p>While the prices are lower in Europe, there’s been no sign that the US will see anything similar any time soon. Due to the state of global economics, companies are looking at ways they can continue to sell products while generating revenue. In this instance, it’s more of a case of adjusting for the aforementioned strength of the Euro against the US dollar than anything else.</p>



<p>With the prices a bit lower, are you going to pick up a new Nvidia GPU? Let us know down below, and take the discussion even further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Division 2 has revealed its Year 7 roadmap for 2025 and beyond at Gamescom. Furthermore, the next season of the title is only a few weeks away.</p>



<p>Developed by Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment, The Division 2 has been going steadily since its release in 2019. Taking over for the original, the game has expanded its boundaries, both in locations like Washington, DC and in modes like the roguelike Descent. Now, the future of the multiplayer shooter has been laid out, thanks to a new update from Gamescom.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Starting off the new content for Year 7 of The Division 2 is The Pact, a new season launching September 9th, 2025. We get a glimpse of what it will be like in the trailer above. As per <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/4235uGIN3QkbDq4iNQVlT1/the-division-2-at-gamescom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> on The Division 2’s website, The Pact focuses on the enemy factions, which have joined up. New to the season is Retaliation, a permanent open-world activity that adds Control Points mechanics.</p>



<p>After The Pact, the next season, titled Mutiny, will launch later this year. It plans on adding new modifiers, as well as a new companion mechanic. While details are scarce about Mutiny, the team promises that fans will hear more in the coming months. In the roadmap, there is mention of the franchise’s tenth-year anniversary, so there’s many reasons to look forward to that, whether it be The Division 3 or bigger expansions.</p>



<p>What do you think of the upcoming roadmap for The Division 2? Will you be joining in on The Pact and Mutiny? Let us know in the comments and on the forums!</p>

While this could just be a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wizards-of-the-coast-says-no-truth-to-rumors-that-magic-the-gatherings-spider-man-crossover-will-only-get-one-print-run">fairly limited preorder allocation</a> and more will come later, we’ve been seeing some eye-wateringly gigantic markups on the secondary market in the build-up to launch (September 26).</p><div catalogid="5f900a08-75a3-42a4-b812-6847123c4fb5" id="216020"><div id="216020" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marvel's Spider-Man - Collector Booster Box (12 Packs)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, just a single Collector Booster is listed at a "Market Price" of <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OPZ4?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$88 at the trusted resale site TCGPlayer</a>. <strong>This </strong><em><strong>only </strong></em><strong>contains 15 cards. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Play Booster Boxes (including 12 packs) aren't much better, <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xq05?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reaching close to $1000</a> on the resale market right now, so buying in bulk isn’t exactly economical either. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, what's the big deal, and why are Spider-Man Collector Boosters flipping for so much already?</strong> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a mix of a few factors. Collector packs are supposedly a shortcut to the coolest, most valuable cards in a set. 11 to 13 of them are Traditional Foil cards, but there are still 5 commons, 4 uncommons, and 5 rare or higher, with a ‘Headliner Mythic’ in around 1% of boosters.</p></div><div catalogid="5f900a08-75a3-42a4-b812-6847123c4fb5" id="216021"><div id="216021" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marvel's Spider-Man - Collector Booster (1 Pack of 15 Cards)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With cards like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAnMY?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless Soul Stone already sitting at around $475 resale</a>, there’s no shortage of chase cards in the Spider-Man MTG crossover, though prices will likely shift once the Universes Beyond set fully lands. The catch is most of those big pulls will generally be locked behind Collector Boosters, which, as we have discussed, aren’t exactly cheap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combine that with Magic riding an all-time high after Final Fantasy and Edge of Eternities, the hype of its first major Marvel crossover starring Spider-Man, and demand easily outpacing supply, and those boosters might as well be worth their weight in cardboard… or gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But just like the Collector Boosters, every other preorder for the upcoming Spidey set is sold out. That includes the Gift Bundle, Booster Bundle, Scene Box, and Prerelease Pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want those before launch, your best bet is still the secondary market at trusted resale sites like, as we've mentioned, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObml7?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>.

      </div>
<p>"We are always thinking about what we could do for the Metal Gear series," added producer Noriaki Okamura. "But in regards to remaking future titles, currently we're just focusing on the now, and we thought what would be the best way to reach both the old fans and potential new fans as well."</p><p>The most in-demand candidate for a remake may be Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, which has been locked in on PS3 for 17 years. Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 brought the original trilogy to consoles in 2023.</p><p>In a separate interview, Okamura and Korekado said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-era-of-metal-gear-solid-is-being-entrusted-to-a-new-generation-of-developers-if-its-made/1100-6534207/" data-ref-id="1100-6534207">they plan to hand the franchise over to a new generation of creators</a> if Konami decides to make a new Metal Gear Solid games. The creator of the franchise, Hideo Kojima, recently indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/" data-ref-id="1100-6533601">he won't play the new MGS Delta</a>. Okamura has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-producer-would-love-to-work-with-hideo-kojima-on-metal-gear-solid/1100-6524582/" data-ref-id="1100-6524582">shared his admiration for Kojima</a> and vocalized his desire to work with him on the MGS franchise in the future.</p><p>Ahead of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater's August 28 launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, Konami revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/platinum-games-developed-metal-gear-delta-snake-eaters-secret-mode/1100-6534133/" data-ref-id="1100-6534133">Platinum Games worked on a new version of Snake's Nightmare</a>, a secret mode from the original game. Meanwhile, original Solid Snake voice actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/david-hayter-has-done-a-180-on-metal-gear-solid-5/1100-6533954/" data-ref-id="1100-6533954">David Hayter shared his thoughts about Metal Gear Solid 5</a>, which was the only primary game in the series he didn't lend his voice to.</p>

<p>Bunny hop</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Maximum Entertainment and Little Sewing Machine have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bye_sweet_carole">Bye Sweet Carole</a>, a horror game inspired by Don Bluth and animated Disney movies, is launching on Switch on <strong>9th October 2025</strong>, just in time for Halloween.</p>
<p>The date was announced yesterday via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPc5ya2f_Y0">IGN Live Showcase</a>, with Maximum Entertainment sharing the trailer earlier today.</p>
<p>Taking place in the early 1900s in Britain against the backdrop of the women's suffrage movement, Bye Sweet Carole follows Lana Benton as she searched for her missing best friend, Carole Simmons. This takes her to Bunny Hall orphanage, a place that hiding a dark truth.</p>
<p>And part of that mystery takes her to a Wonderland-esque world, the kingdom of Crolla, that is under the control of Mr Kyn, a terrifying figure, and a group of ravenous rabbits. Will she find Carole? And will Lana make it home with her friend safely?</p>
<p>Lana won't be alone, though — she makes friends with a shape-shifting creature called Mr Baesie, and certain sections of the game have you controlling him. Lana herself can also change into a bunny rabbit, because of course — they do like their bunnies here.</p>


<p>Ahead of the game's release date announcement, we got to chat with Bye Sweet Carole's director, Chris Darril, best known as the creator of the <strong>Remothered</strong> series. Keep an eye out for our interview this weekend!</p>
<p>A physical release has also been confirmed for <a href="https://x.com/MaxEnt_Retail/status/1958923256670405091">21st October in North America</a>, which will include the game, a digital OST, and a reversible cover sheet.</p>
<p>With the game dropping on Switch right around spooky season, we're looking forward to diving into this one by the fireplace. <em>Let us know if you're doing the same in the comments</em>.</p>

            <p>Did you know that the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater"> Metal Gear Solid 3</a> on PS2 had a reworked Zone of the Enders 3 prototype hidden in it? I didn't. The secret minigame in question is "Guy Savage", a barebones hack-and-slasher featuring hook swords, bestial transformations and zombie coppers. It's framed as a dream of Naked Snake's - triggered by a combination of torture and an unhelpful reference to Dracula from radio contact Para-Medic during a codec conversation before saving. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>The original Guy Savage was directed by long-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> writer Shuyo Murata. The dreamy minigame returns in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, an Unreal Engine remake which launches next week. It's a lot glossier this time, however, because the new version has been contracted out to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> studio PlatinumGames. They've gone to town on the visuals, trading the old jailhouse backdrop for a moonlit graveyard, though the spinning and gouging looks pretty much as before. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1LIylZ8VaM">a video of the PS2 version</a>, and here's some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m0fnaLwXgw">footage of the updated one</a> from Gamespot.
</p>
<p>Learning about Guy Savage gives me the heebie jeebies, somehow. Delta Snake Eater is Konami's latest bid to show that Metal Gear Solid has a future after Hideo Kojima, but it's also a fawning tribute to the guy, a careful recreation of every eccentric flourish that took root under his eye, whether it truly came from Kojima or no.
</p>
<p>As I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-metal-gear-solid-need-a-new-kojima-konami-have-many-people-in-mind-but-its-difficult">attempted to articulate last August</a>, Delta Snake Eater feels stranger than the average blockbuster remake project because Kojima has built up a brand for bespoke designer's asides - brilliant or silly titbits born of Kojima's own proudly brandished fan obsessions, that create a feeling of closeness to the auteur, even if they were executed by one of his underlings.</p><p>Konami have extracted all those wonky fossilised organs and sent them off to be rehydrated and plumped up, then pushed them back into the game's body while grafting on new skin. In the case of the Guy Savage, the fossilised organ is also the aborted stub of <em>another</em> game, the Zone of the Enders threequel Konami cancelled in 2013. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-3s-remake-includes-a-mini-game-made-by-platinum/">Apparently</a>, Kojima wanted the minigame to be Gradius initially, but decided an original game would be better.
</p>
<p>It's just weird! Video games are weird! They are the ultimate haunted houses. This is probably the only thing I've discovered about Delta Snake Eater that seriously interests me. We'll hopefully have a review ourselves before the remake's release next week, on 28th August.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>John Cena has a brief cameo in this summer’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/superman-israel-palestine-woke-clark-kent-punk-rock-1851786212"><i><span>Superman</span></i></a><span> as Peacemaker, the foul-mouthed mercenary the wrestler-turned-actor has played since 2021’s </span><i><span>The Suicide Squad</span></i><span>. That movie was part of the old DC Comics shared universe (DCEU), so it seemed odd that Cena’s character would appear in James Gunn’s new take on Superman, considering he was, ostensibly, part of a different multiverse. Well, </span><i><span>Peacemaker</span></i><span>’s second season premiered last night, and through a reshot scene, has plucked the antihero from one universe into another without making a huge stink about it.</span></p> <p><span>In Peacemaker’s first season finale, Cena’s character met up with the Justice League from the previous film universe, including Jason Momoa’s Aquaman and Ezra Miller’s Flash. The rest of the team was mostly obscured in shadows and only seen as silhouettes, but Momoa and Miller’s presence makes it clear they’re likely accompanied by Henry Cavill’s version of Superman, who portrayed the superhero from 2013 to 2023. This ties Peacemaker to the old continuity, which again complicates Cena’s appearance in </span><i><span>Superman</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Season two’s premiere episode, “The Ties That Grind,” addresses this with an opening sequence called “Previously in the DCU,” which recaps the previous season with one major change. Rather than calling the Justice League for help as he did in the finale, this section is reshot and redubbed to instead show the Justice Gang featured in </span><i><span>Superman</span></i><span> arriving on the scene. Nathan Fillion and Isabela Merced reprise their roles as Guy Gardner and Hawkgirl, while silhouettes of Superman, Supergirl, and Mister Terrific are also shown but obscured in shadow, like in the original scene.</span></p>

Normies don’t care about all this canon stuff so intimately.”</span></p> <p><span>“It doesn’t matter if it’s not completely consistent in the past. So I thought the simple way was really the best, which is just saying, yeah, this world is a little different. We know there’s universes, and this is the universe in which everything was exactly the same as Season 1, except for the Justice League.”</span></p> <p><span>Some fans might be annoyed at the handwavey nature of this change, but it’s probably a good thing </span><i><span>Peacemaker </span></i><span>didn’t have to spend a whole episode throwing its hero through the multiverse to justify him showing up in future projects. Now it can just get back to what it actually wants to do rather than wasting all those precious, costly minutes of runtime, not to mention the precious time of us viewers. New episodes of </span><i><span>Peacemaker </span></i><span>premiere on HBO Max on Thursday nights at 9 p.m. Eastern.</span></p>

<p>After years of waiting, The Division 2 is getting a survival mode called Survivors is coming in 2026. Announced at Gamescom, the team at Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment showed off some of the new mode.</p>



<p>Since its release in 2019, The Division 2 has been going strong with new updates and expansions. Earlier yesterday, the team laid out the roadmap for Year 7, with plans for two new updates. Beyond that, as revealed today, a whole new way to play will be what fans have been asking for for quite some time.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-division-2-survivors-officially-revealed-at-gamescom">The Division 2: Survivors Officially Revealed at Gamescom</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image from Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>While a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/division-2-project-gamescom-reveal-panels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tease earlier this month</a> did hint at it, it has now been confirmed that The Division 2 will get a Survival Extraction mode. Called The Division 2: Survivors, the project is in early development with Magnus Jansén directing. However, in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/enWR3N37m6wAbtZbV4nuA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> on the official page of the game, executive producer Julian Gerighty released a statement, saying:</p>



<p><strong>“The Division 2: Survivors is as much your baby as it is ours, and we strive for transparency during its development,”</strong> Gerighty states. <strong>“Clear communication and community involvement are a focus as we build the new experience, and we will be closely involving you as we move forward on the development journey.”</strong></p>



<p>Concept art of the mode, including Survivors’ logo, can be found on the blog, as well. We see some familiar landmarks in Washington, DC, all dusted in snow. Given how the base game plays, it’ll be interesting to see how the mode comes out. Still, it seems like it may be far off in terms of release. However, the team sounds positive that it will live up to expectations.</p>

		<p>While there’s another two days of Gamescom 2025 over this weekend for the general public, for press, the show always comes to an end on Friday… just in time for me to name drop a few games for What We Played!</p>
<p>But what can I actually tell you about right now? There’s quite a few things embargoed until next week, but in the here and now, I’ve been able to share previews of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/resident-evil-requiem-preview-first-person-frights-third-person-delights/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-preview-slicing-through-this-samurai-revival/">Onimusha</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/22/borderlands-4-preview-gamescom-2025/">Borderlands 4</a>, I played a smidgeon of Kirby Air Ride and Pokémon Legends: Z-A, a little Directive 8020, and on and on and on. The next job is to write as much of this up as quickly as possible, so stay tuned over the next few days and weeks!</p>

<p>Having a far more sedate gaming experience, <strong>Aran</strong> reviewed Tiny Bookshop, and said that the exceptionally chilled out book-selling game “may be my game of the year.” High praise!</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been thoroughly enjoying Echoes of the End, for review, as well as a bit of&nbsp;Death Stranding and Smash Bros., while Jim has continued on with Far Cry 5, though is starting to feel some of the grind setting in with the open world activities. “There are plenty of cool diversions such as platforming-like Prepper Stash sections to keep things fresh, and I’m now mainlining my way towards the ending and have the Vietnam War DLC in my sights.”</p>


<p><strong>Laura’s</strong> been playing Ra Ra BOOM for our review, and demands that the game’s name “must always be sung – to your choice of notes but ideally to the tune of the theme song for extra kudos”. She’s been joined by fellow side-scrolling beat ’em up lover Ade, and is loving the game’s art style.</p>
<p>But you can’t keep <strong>Ade</strong> away from other side-scrolling and/or licensed 1980s pop culture! There’s a Shinobi review in the pipe for next week, and he shared his thoughts on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown. Then there was some Rogue Prince of Persia – “which is excellent” – and a few more missions in Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters, though truth be told, he’s actually mainly played Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>He said, “I wasn’t impressed with the game when I played it last year but the devs have made a lot of improvements and now it’s really fun! Cloak and Dagger is my favourite pick, with Squirrel Girl and The Punisher a close second and third. Anyone else playing it?”</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been enjoying a trio of post-apocalyptic settings, and while he can’t talk about two of them right now, he can say that he’s actually continued to enjoy Wuchang: Fallen Feathers…. until he spends hours butting up against a brick wall of a boss.</p>
<p><strong>Miguel’s</strong> been playing some Shuten Order for review, along with a little Death Stranding 2, a lashing of the playtest for Fate Trigger, and a couple nights of Tekken 8 for his smorgasbord of gaming.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Dom’s</strong> been on holiday, but has been taking a break from taking a break by playing a bit more of Story of Seasons.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/feature-whats-it-like-to-attend-gamescom-2025.1278453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ccda75e40182b/gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Anthony Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve never been to <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en">Gamescom</a> before. I’ve heard all the rumours, though. Gamescom is obviously an event I’ve been aware of for a very long time and it appears to have been growing in stature as of late – even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-get-a-closer-look-at-nintendos-gamescom-2025-booth">Nintendo decided to return this year</a> after skipping the show in 2024.</p>
<p>If you’ve been to the show before, then this piece isn’t for you. Attending for the first time, I thought I’d share my own experience for those who may want to consider attending in future.</p>
<p>The show takes place at <a href="https://www.koelnmesse.de/">Koelnmesse</a> – no laughing in the back, I know the name sounds like what happens the day after a particularly spicy curry – which is in the German city of Köln (aka Cologne).</p>

<p>The predicted weather for the week was relatively warm 24-28°C (~75-83°F), and only staying for two nights meant I could pack lightly. I filled my trusty <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/gundam-the-08th-ms-team-gundam-backpack-ground-type/13/7097oh">Gundam backpack</a> with some clothes, toiletries and my work gear (laptop, powerbank, etc.), and I was good to go.</p>
<h2>Let’s-a-go!</h2>

<p>Flying from the UK, my journey started early Tuesday morning with a 1-hour drive to Birmingham Airport, boarding a Lufthansa 1.5-hour flight to Munich and then sub 1-hour connecting flight arriving in Cologne mid-afternoon. The return journey was very different, but more on that later.</p>
<p>The airport isn’t that far from the city centre, so taking the train is probably the most cost-effective route. However, time wasn’t really on my side as I still needed to check-in to my hotel in the city and then figure out how to get to the venue before Opening Night Live, there was a simpler answer: Uber.</p>
<p>I’d seen taxi rides quoted at upwards of €100, so the €35 being quoted by Uber seemed logical (and I was sharing the ride with Sammy from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a>).</p>
<h2>Where to stay?</h2>
<p>20 minutes or so later we were dropped off at our respective hotels and all checked-in. I stayed at 3-star <a href="https://hotel-windsor-koeln.de/en/">Hotel Windsor</a> – I couldn’t resist the name, having recently visited <em>our own</em> <a href="https://www.legoland.co.uk/">Windsor</a> — which is <em>slightly</em> on the edge of the city but still only a 10-15 min walk.</p>

<p>We did book accommodation slightly late (maybe 1-2 months before), and unfortunately, the prices are clearly hiked up around the time of Gamescom. We’re talking about €200-250 a night for even 3-star hotels. Advice: don’t leave it late, book early!</p>
<p>Location-wise, though, I was relatively happy. The city is split in half by the Rhine River, with the exhibition centre on the right-hand side of the water. Your instinct might be to get a hotel on the same side, but I wouldn’t. The majority of the city restaurants, squares, bars etc. are on the left side.</p>
<h2>Getting Around Cologne</h2>

<p>The two main landmarks will be Koelnmesse itself and <a href="https://www.koelner-dom.de/en">Kölner Dom</a>, Cologne’s absolutely stunning and unmissable (in every sense of the word) Cathedral, which is on the opposite side of the river to the event. These perfect way points mean you <em>shouldn’t</em> get lost.</p>
<p>Conveniently, the central train station is right next to that <em>beyond</em> massive Cathedral, which has a dedicated sign-posted line (or “track” in local speak). This was platform 10 whilst I was there. The Koelnmesse is the next stop across the river, so you can just about jump on any train (check the next stop on the boards).</p>
<p>I’m not going to lie, initially, I found the trains quite difficult to navigate. There are so many different naming conventions compared to the UK. Each route has its own name and there’s a mix of ICE (InnerCity Express) trains which go inter-city and more local trains too.</p>
<p>The good news is that all of this transportation is <em>free</em>. Along with your Gamescom admission ticket you are issued a travel ticket that allows you to take these local trains. The ticket itself says you must carry photo identification, but my ticket was never checked.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it’s easy to walk across the bridge, which takes around 10 minutes side to side.</p>
<h2>Opening Night Live!</h2>
<figure><a title="Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b0e4c2d77987c/gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Anthony Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As well as never attending Gamescom, I’ve also never been to one of these live showcases. My role has always been to assist our editorial teams during these shows, or simply make sure our websites don’t fall over. They would have to survive without me this time.</p>
<p>The stage and lighting were really impressive in person. Less impressive was the fact that seating was all at floor level, so unless you’re towards the front, your view isn’t anywhere near as good as it would be at a venue with tiered seats.</p>
<p>I don’t understand the concept of “pre-shows” from a consumer point of view, I can only imagine it’s a commercial standpoint to do with pricing. The pre-show had some really cool games that deserved to be in the main show, and the presenting was goofy and bordering on cheap.</p>

<p>At this point, you’ve likely seen the two-hour show (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-every-switch-1-and-2-announcement-and-trailer">or at least the highlights</a>). Attending it in person was pretty much exactly what I expected it to be, similar to watching at home but with the crowd 'woops' and 'cheers' in full Dolby Atmos quality and the bass rumble from the trailers slapping you round the face over and over again. Maybe I’m old but I think it was a bit <em>too</em> loud.</p>
<p>I'm glad I got to experience it, but I’m in no hurry to do it again. Full disclosure, I should also add that Gamescom were kind enough to invite Felix, Sammy and myself to the “VIP” ONL aftershow party where we all consumed at least 1-2 free burgers each.</p>
<h2>Is It Really That Big?</h2>
<figure><a title="Gamescom 2025 Map" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f0372dfc31bf/gamescom-2025-map.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gamescom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My ticket was provided as a QR code, so adding this to my Apple Wallet made it super easy to enter the exhibition centre at the start of Wednesday - Day 1. No having to collect your badge or wristband anywhere or any of that nonsense. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Now then, the rumours are true: Gamescom is absolutely <em>enormous</em>. Whenever I’ve attended exhibitions in the UK they usually take up 1 or 2 (maybe 3) halls at the NEC or the ExCeL.</p>
<p>Gamescom takes over the <em>entire</em> Koelnmesse exhibition center. You’re talking around 4-5 halls just for the “main” games, 1 hall for merch and cosplay (split across two levels), and another hall for indie and retro games. It’s <em>so</em> big it even spills into the carpark at the back of hall 8.</p>
<p>Throw in another 3 halls for the business only area and you start to understand the scale of it.</p>

<p>Once you get your head around the scale of it you’ll also notice the sheer quality of the stands on offer, because of the amount of floorspace on offer booth after booth oozes with slick design and is a feast for your eyes. Kudos to anyone who worked on these stands.</p>
<p>After doing an entire lap of the show (and taking <em>over 500 photos</em>) the layout was now etched in my head and I’d even discovered some hacks. You can avoid those main corridors with seas of people by moving between halls using the side doors.</p>
<h2>Queues, Queues, Queues</h2>

<p>If you’re looking at my photos thinking “it doesn’t look that bad” please keep reading. Being a member of the press I was able to look around and take all my photos on Wednesday, the day that only a small number of non-trade consumers are able to attend.</p>
<p>I felt the show get noticeably busier on Wednesday afternoon when those consumers were allowed in, but it was <em>nothing</em> compared to Thursday. Oh boy, the rumours keep getting truer.</p>
<p>335,000 people attended Gamescom in 2024 and whilst daily figures aren’t available, you’d have to estimate that at least ⅓ of them were there on each day. It’s hard to imagine 100,000 people shuffling around the event halls but in reality, it’s wave after wave after wave of people moving in every direction constantly – it’s a little overwhelming.</p>

<p>There are <em>a lot</em> of games at the show, true, but every game has a limited capacity, some better than others. Long queues for popular games form almost immediately. Some people have clearly been before and have brought their own fold-out chairs – smart – because they know they are going to be queuing for <em>hour(s)</em> before it’s their turn to grab the controller.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been to a theme park in peak season and waited 2 hours to go on a roller coaster, then you’re in the right ballpark. These are theme park-level of queues, perhaps not in physical length, but in terms of wait time.</p>
<h2>Variety is King</h2>
<figure><a title="Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6eb3b69b7ab3d/gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Anthony Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Away from a negative and onto a positive, I was blown away by the amount of different things going on at the show. There was an absolute ton of big games and an amazing amount of indie games too.</p>
<p>No only that, though, there were lots of other attractions such as the EVA (Esports Virtual Arena) booth, a human foosball table, ninja warrior-style challenges and inflatables.</p>

<p>A huge number of peripherals were showcased too, especially those from the sim-racing world, I think I counted at least six different manufacturers of racing wheels all showing off their products on sim rigs.</p>
<p>There was also a complete spectrum (<a href="https://www.timeextension.com/tags/zx-spectrum">not that one</a>) of merchandise too all the way from the stereotypical anime figurine fest all the way up to a fully stocked official LEGO store. I didn’t see anyone selling retro games, though, but almost anything else gaming you can think of.</p>

<p>As a bit of a car nerd, I was pleasantly surprised by the number of cars at the show, including this absolutely beastly GR Yaris.</p>
<h2>What Are The Food and Drink Options?</h2>

<p>The areas outside between the halls are where most of the food vendors can be found. You can get food in some of the halls but they are few and far between. I actually really liked the fact that the show generally separated the food away from the showfloor.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, outside it was the expected pom frites (chips), burgers, bratwursts (hog dogs), fried chicken and pretzels on offer. The quality was decent, probably better than food in the UK, to be honest. I should add that there was also a very popular Subway stand on the showfloor.</p>
<figure><a title="Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7c8c748035204/gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Anthony Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Inside, you could get more sweet treats like crepes and churros. Aside from these vendors, there were also some smaller convenience-style stores in the main concourse areas, but I did notice that some of these were cash-only.</p>
<p>Drinks were heavily weighted towards your usual bottles of Coke, Fanta, and Red Bull is clearly very popular in Germany. (TIL Germans love to mix Fanta and Coke to make a drink called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spezi">'Spezi'</a>).</p>

<p>Prices were slightly on the high side, with a pretzel and Red Bull setting me back around €9. On the upside service was good, fast and minimal queuing. On the downside, there aren’t many 'proper' places/tables to sit down near these food vans; you’ll end up perched on the floor or a random surface you can find, if you’re lucky.</p>
<h2>Race Across The World</h2>
<p>As I alluded to above, my return journey was not quite as simple. Lufthansa operate trains as “virtual flight connections”. Not quite sure how this worked, I arrived at the train station well ahead of time and managed to decipher the board and found my platform. So far, so good.</p>
<p>I was slightly curious as to how this all worked as the connection time between arrival at the Airport (from the train) and Departure boarding was only 30 minutes or so.</p>
<figure><a title="Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9f9896bf84d4e/gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Anthony Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I keep watching the board and suddenly my train is updated and scheduled 5 minutes late. Then 10 minutes, then 20 minutes, then 25 minutes. I check my Lufthansa app, and a notice appears “your connection is now at risk and we are monitoring the situation”. Great. It’s the last flight to BHX of the day, so if I do miss it, I’ll have to be put in a hotel overnight, and my wife will have to miss work tomorrow.</p>
<p>The high-speed (265km/h) ICE train finally arrives, and we depart nearly 35 minutes late. Whilst on the train I study the airport map to see where my gate is and the fastest route – like any good gamer would.</p>
<p>Train pulls into the station, I sling my 8kg backpack on and start running down the platform, up the stairs across the link bridge up more stairs and into the terminal. My calves are burning as it’s now 10 minutes before boarding is due to close.</p>
<p>It’s fairly late in the day, so thankfully the passport control has no queue - the guard stamps my passport and I rush through security. Of course, my backpack gets the dreaded punt of shame into the “we’re going to check your bag” lane.</p>
<p>The clock ticks on like an escape sequence at the beginning of an action game. The guard clears my bag and I sling it back on, looking like Sam Porter Bridges from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_directors_cut">Death Stranding</a> as I continue to run through the airport to my gate.</p>
<p>I reach my gate with 5 minutes to spare, only for an announcement to follow shortly after telling us that boarding is being delayed for 20-25 minutes whilst they “get the plane ready”.</p>
<p>Morale of the story: it’ll be fine.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Cologne was a nice city to visit and I felt safe walking back to my hotel fairly late at night. I can’t claim to have seen loads of the city, but what I saw was pleasant. The city centre is very tourist-friendly as it welcomes visitors to it’s Cathedral on a year-round basis.</p>

<p>Gamescom was similar to shows I’ve attended before, but on a whole new scale. It’s massive. It’s loud. It’s busy. There are people everywhere. It’s hot. It’s tiring – I did 50,000 steps across my Wed-Thu visit. The queues are often long, but not <em>always</em>.</p>
<p>Would I recommend attending? I think it comes down to your priorities. If you’re going hellbent on playing the latest AAA games, it’s a tough ask considering the cost of travel. If you’re going with friends, taking your time and soak up the festival-esque atmosphere and maybe play some games along the way, there is a much better chance you’ll get value for money.</p>
<p>Time for a sleep. 🫠</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>First-person survival horror game Stygian: Outer Gods, which launched in early access this past April, has just received its first major content update in its early access journey titled Souls of the Silent Tide. </p>



<p>The new update was released alongside a new trailer, showcasing the introduction of the House of Mists and some of the new horrors that players will experience in Souls of the Silent Tide.</p>



<p>Souls of the Silent Tide will have you carefully treading through the ritual site of head witch Agata, though there's also a secret area that you'll have to explore to find, as developer Misterial Games doesn't want to spoil that surprise.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Stygian: Outer Gods | Content Update &quot;Souls of the Silent Tide&quot; Available Now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g5KIwzMS8jk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>You'll also meet new characters, and face a few new enemies to defeat, alongside some you're already familiar with that have been given a bit of an updated moveset.</p>



<p>Souls of the Silent Tide also includes a new weapon for players to stand against these horrors with, and the update includes the first boss fight that's been added to the game.</p>



<p>If you've not yet checked out Stygian: Outer Gods, this update is a good time to check it out, not just because you'll have what was available at launch, plus this new chunk of content to play through, but because as part of the update's arrival, Misterial Games is discounting Stygian: Outer Gods for a limited time with a 20% discount.</p>



<p>After the sale however, Misterial Games and publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-smoke-and-mirrors-update-july-17/">Fulqrum Publishing</a> confirm that the price of the early access release will actually increase to $24.99 USD / 24.99 EUR / 20.99 GBP. </p>

              <p>The first thing you think about when you hear the word “Pokémon” is probably bright, colorful cartoon characters. A bright yellow Pikachu and a cuddly blue-and-white Snorlax, merrily playing on green grass under a clear blue sky. Even a fire-breathing Charizard is a cheerful orange and would probably give you a hug. So it’s a wonderful peculiarity of the franchise that various games and spin-offs have received some of the creepiest, spookiest horror movie-like trailers and ads we’ve ever seen. Following yesterday’s deeply creepy trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-evolution-trailer-2000619134"><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em>we’ve compiled the most unsettling Pokémon commercials from the last few years.</p> <p>You don’t really have to scratch very deep into Pokémon lore to find the weirdness. In fact, given it’s a game series about capturing wild animals and forcing them to fight, so you don’t even have to scratch at all. But take a look at any Pokédex and you’ll quickly <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-pokedex-entry-nintendo-switch-1849831634">find descriptions that’d have any child concerned about going to sleep at night</a>, and hell, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-top-10-worst-bruxish-mr-rime-1851606325">plenty of the Pokémon themselves are self-contained nightmares</a>. With Ghost Type and Poison Type Pokémon a routine part of the games and anime, there’s always a background element of outright strangeness that underscores so many of these gorgeous games. Which is perhaps what The Pokémon Company is tapping into when it so frequently puts out full-on unsettling, even disturbing promotional material.</p> <p>A lot of these commercials appeared in 2022, ahead of the launch of <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, but there were super-strange “found footage” creations for <em>Pokémon GO</em> as well. And clearly TPCi is still fond of the idea, given the reprisal of the horror-like approach for its latest commercial for&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-evolution-trailer-2000619134"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, which both apes Japanese horror games like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil </em>and&nbsp;also <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-ghost-girl-x-y-mega-victreebel-2000619524">hides creepy easter eggs for ghostly legends</a> from <em>Pokémon</em>‘s past. We’re really hoping to see a whole bunch more of these in the future, either in the run-up to <em>Z-A</em>‘s October release, or as the new Gen X Pokémon are finally revealed for the next mainline entry.</p>

 <h2>Zorua doesn’t care that a guy just died</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/official-trailer-asks-what-if-pokemon-legends-arceus-1847891305">So we begin in October 2021</a>, and the build up to <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>, with what I still think is the most effectively disturbing effort yet. Completely out of nowhere, the official Pokémon YouTube channel posted the following:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Rare footage of the Hisui region discovered! | Pokémon Legends: Arceus" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayJvMf--68Q?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>I just cannot celebrate this extraordinary trailer enough. It would have been so easy to go so much less hard, to offer many more clear shots of the snowy landscape, even give us more than a split-second glimpse of those two Snorunt, and then offer some scratchy images of the mysterious Pokémon in question. But someone was brave enough to say “No.” This is full-on VHS artifacting, barely discernible, and as a result so, so much more creepy. And, well, it sure sounds like the guy gets killed at the end.</p> <p>The next day, all was revealed. The <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1451171423607795716">ever-reliable Professor Oak was able to clear up the footage considerably</a>, producing the following:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mysterious footage restored! | Pokémon Legends: Arceus" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEb9gbJUUeA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>And it gets better! This could so easily have been a goof, a reveal that actually it was all fine, just made to look spooky because we couldn’t see. In fact, for a while it looks like that’s what we’re getting, with the jolly Snorunt gallivanting in the snow. Perhaps the scream at the end was just him tripping over or something? But no! After Prof. Oak removed the VHS effects layer in Premiere, this second version is somehow more disturbing than the first. Sure, we get the lovely reveal of the brand new Hisuan Zorua and Zoroark, but then the final punch of…who knows what that was?! A giant, terrifying smoke monster, lost from&nbsp;<em>Lost</em>? And he’s definitely still dead. Which makes the cold, uninterested way the Zorua and Zoroark just turn and walk away all the more disturbing.</p> <h2>Ultra Beasts are straight-up threatening humanity</h2> <p>A year later, in August 2022, <em>Pokémon GO</em> is about to add Ultra Beasts to the game for the first time. To accompany these, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR">the official&nbsp;<em>POGO</em> YouTube channel</a> begins uploading TikTok-style 20 second videos that seem part found footage, part fever dream. They’re stunningly well made, and so very effective for—appropriately—showing Pokémon appearing in the real world. The first five were compiled here:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="*CONFIDENTIAL* REPORT: Ultra Beast Sightings" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zr966xaQywg?list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR"></iframe></p> <p>By far the best is the Xurkitree. It’s just so utterly frightening, the way it’s clinging to the outside of the building, the guy’s fear, and the creature’s very obviously harmful intent. But I also absolutely adore the reveal in that final Nihilego clip, when you see it’s not just one inquisitive creature, but some sort of mass invasion. (The Buzzwole one is so poor I kind of hate it for being included.) Then later came <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwFD034UDAc&amp;list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR&amp;index=9">so many more</a>, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MO0C8Hhs3M&amp;list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR&amp;index=6">this terrified panic</a> as a Guzzlord breaks through a portal above a busy Japanese street. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1rpuYsEot0&amp;list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR&amp;index=14">check out the arrival of a massive Celesteela in Australia</a>, causing awe and fear. (And crucially, they’re all better than <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-niantic-nintendo-pheromosa-tiktok-dtf-1849477754">the weird-ass TikTok ad that was about a guy trying to sleep with a Pheromosa</a>.)</p> <h2>The cute little doggy that plays with you to death</h2> <p>OK, let’s jump forward just one month to October 2022, with Pokémon in full swing revealing more and more new entries in the Gen IX Pokédex. And once again, we have people screaming and disappearing at the end of the clips. It started with a 15-second video called “Ghost-type Pokémon in Paldea?!”</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ghost-type Pokémon in Paldea?! #PokemonScarletViolet" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTDRBA4sqPw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>That bait-and-switch with the glimpse of the Gengar and the purple bush is *chef’s kiss*, made all the better for the delicious grin on the mean ol’ ghosty’s face when he properly freaks her out. Once again, more was revealed a day later. This time our brave filmographer has returned to the scene at night, initially spooked as a delightful Mimikyu darts across the path, before then being an awful lot braver in the face of the cheeky Gengar. But there’s something else she’s interested in: a strange purple light on the ground. Suddenly, the creature leaps out from the earth! And it’s a gorgeous little doggy with a purple candle on its back. Yay! Nothing can go wrong, and surely no one’s going to die this time.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="[UK] A new Ghost-type Pokémon appeared in Paldea!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4SjpZuQmjGg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Nope, she’s dead. We know this because it turned out the Greavard, as described <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Greavard_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">in the Pokédex</a>, “gradually drains the life energy of those close to it.” But in case you thought this was malevolent, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-pokedex-entry-nintendo-switch-1849831634/15">its <em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>dex entry reads</a>,</p>

 <p>“It is said that a dog Pokémon that died in the wild without ever interacting with a human was reborn as this Pokémon.”</p> <h2>The jar of matcha that just murders a bunch of children</h2> <p>Another year forward, into August 2023, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-poltchageist-dlc-new-1850761666">there’s a surprise new short film</a> added to the official channel to explain the backstory of Sinistea’s new evolutionary form introduced in&nbsp;<em>Scarlet</em> and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>‘s DLC, Poltchageist.</p> <p>We already knew that Sinistea had a fairly messed-up existence. It’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-pokedex-entry-nintendo-switch-1849831634/8">literally “the soul of someone who died alone” trapped in a cup of tea</a>, and it’ll do you no good to drink it.&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>‘s Pokédex explains,</p> <p>“Sinistea gets into your body when you drink it, and then it steals your vitality from within. It also tastes awful.”</p>

 <p>Yum! So what about the evolved form? Well, gather around children.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Haunting Tale of Poltchageist" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMWrwe9fJJk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>I adore how tonally all over the place this is. It’s an old man telling a story to a group of very young children, that’s then immediately about a guy dying miserable and alone, before going on to talk about a Pokémon that both fixes cracks and poisons people and drains the life from their bodies as an act of revenge. That’s a messed-up thing to tell a bunch of children! But then, the storyteller’s chipped mug is restored, just like in the story! Ah, you think, he’s playing a fun prank on the children, giving them a little spooky scare. But no. No, it’s not that. Is it that Poltchageist has poisoned them all, and now is going to kill them? They sure don’t look very well. But then our friendly little cartoon killer swings by the camera, gives us a wink, and we circle in on him, Looney Tunes-style. The end! Utterly extraordinary.</p> <h2>Spinarak delivers an epic jumpscare</h2> <p>And that brings us up-to-date, and to yesterday’s <em>Legends Z-A</em> trailer. Aping games like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, the footage ostensibly created to reveal the existence of a Mega Evolved form of Victreebel contains some splendid scares, including an epic jumpscare from that cutest of beasties, Spinarak.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Given the context of the above examples, it’s definitely a big shame this one ends with a “wakka wakka!” explanation of the situation, denuding it of impact. But that’s not before that splendid little burst of frantic freakery in the middle, and that’s valuable.</p> <p>However, it all took on an even spookier tone when we noticed <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-ghost-girl-x-y-mega-victreebel-2000619524">the ghost girl staring through the window</a>!</p> <p>Please, Pokémon, keep this sort of stuff coming. We&nbsp;<em>love</em> it. Hopefully there’s something super-spoopy lined up for this October, given that seems to bring out the best in them.</p>

Yup, that means it's time to play (or replay) the original Hollow Knight! Which is exactly what a lot of folks are doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight, released on PC in 2017, has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#48h" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached an all-time high concurrent player count today on Steam (per SteamDB)</a>, eight years after release, almost certainly due to the Silksong news. At the time this piece is being written, it's sitting at 23,840 concurrent players, an all-time peak.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to this, concurrent player counts have been sitting roughly around 10,000 for months on end, usually a bit below. But after the Silksong news yesterday, they began climbing, reaching 16k yesterday afternoon and dipping slightly overnight before shooting up again today in a playercount that seems poised to climb even higher throughout the day and into the weekend. The previous all-time high was over 20k players in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is likely due to a surge of players running to replay Hollow Knight, or play it for the first time, ahead of the release of Silksong on September 4. There has been no shortage of interest in Team Cherry's standout Metroidvania in the years since its launch, as we now know it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-reaches-15-million-copies-sold">sold 15 million copies</a> across all platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, looks to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-looks-to-be-significantly-bigger-than-the-original-hollow-knight">even bigger than the base game of Hollow Knight</a> if the trailer shown yesterday is any indication, and it sounds like there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-cherry-says-it-has-plans-for-more-silksong-content-for-months-and-years-to-come">even more Silksong to come after launch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Traveler’s Tales is once again bringing a boatload of brick-breaking battles with bat-baddies to the streets of Gotham City. For 20 years, the studio has largely followed the beloved and established formula of adapting some of the biggest media franchises in the world and turning them into level-based action-adventures. But this time, TT looks to be finding inspiration outside of its own walls, but elsewhere inside its Warner Bros. family, giving the people what they want: a new Batman Arkham game in all but name.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Legacy of the Dark Knight is structured slightly differently from previous LEGO games. Not quite an original story, TT Games has immersed itself in the world of the Bat by taking different strands of the hero’s most famous stories from across comics and films to craft a narrative on its own. You’ll get a young Bruce Wayne origin story, which appears to take inspiration from Batman Begins, if the trailer is anything to go by, but later meet a Joker born in a vat of corrosive materials before later morphing into a version of Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning portrayal for a chapter or two.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I got to play through a full mission from early in the story, which took me to Ace Chemicals, a version styled heavily on the factory’s look from Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman. However, the story taking place inside those neo-gothic walls takes a leaf straight from the pages of Ed Brubaker’s one-shot comic The Man Who Laughs, as Batman is sent to investigate Red Hood. The context is set up through familiar slapstick LEGO silliness as the Bat is asked to track down three separate shipments of teddy bears in order to find what nefarious use Hood has for them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This opening takes place outside of the plant’s walls and allowed me to experiment with the instantly recognisable combat suite. I punched grunts a few times until their plastic legs broke free from their torsos and countered whenever they dared flash that little attack signal over the top of their head. Fans of the Batman: Arkham games will know exactly what I’m talking about here (as well as anyone who played the many, many action games Rocksteady’s system inspired), but from the little I experienced, I can’t see it getting much more mechanically complex from here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You can't think about being Batman in a video game without appreciating the achievements of our friends and colleagues at Rocksteady.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That obvious Arkham inspiration and desire to bring it to an even wider audience is something that Jonathan Smith, Head of Production and Strategic Director at TT Games, willfully admitted to me: “You can't think about being Batman in a video game without appreciating the achievements of our friends and colleagues at Rocksteady”, Smith said. “So as we start to think about what a rich, deep Batman combat experience is going to be like, of course, we use that as an inspiration, but then we also have new approaches that we bring to that in terms of accessibility”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The punches, kicks, and throws may well be rooted in the moveset first established in 2009’s Batman: Arkham Asylum, but this is a TT LEGO game appealing to players of all ages, so I can’t see intricate button combos becoming a key aspect. Slow-motion finishers add a sense of style to proceedings, further adding to that familiar Arkham flow. All in all, brawling felt good, if not as wholly satisfying as in Asylum and its sequels, perhaps due to the fact that making contact against the synthetic shine of LEGO bricks never fully delivers the meaty sensation that pounding flesh can (yes, I did mean to phrase it like that).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, as much as the Caped Crusader enjoys shattering cheekbones with his blunt fists and padded knees, stealth has also been a big part of his games. Again, while it doesn’t feel as robust in its design as the Arkham games, Legacy of the Dark Knight does cater to the sneakier option. High structures and perches loom ominously above enemies, which can be zipped to with ease. From there, you can use a version of detective mode that acts more like an area of effect pulse than a toggleable X-ray vision to pick out enemies below. Stealth takedowns can then be performed on your chosen prey and are animated with trademark LEGO humour; instead of a swift knockout blow, Batman will land on them with a minifig-shattering thud of his arse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the combat is heavily Arkham-coded, the remainder of the mission plays out like a classic TT adventure. Platforming is integrated through moving platforms and swinging hooks, as are puzzles that require you to switch between characters (or get help from your co-op partner) to utlise their specific skills. On this mission, I was joined by Jim Gordon, who comes packed with a foam-spraying gun that can fire blobs of goo to help you past obstacles. For example, Ace Chemicals is unsurprisingly full of hazardous chemicals, some of which can be seen spurting out of broken pipes and halting you in your path. A quick blast of the Commissioner’s cannon can soon dispose of this mess, as when it hardens, it blocks up the hole in the pipe. Past that, a door may be locked, but thanks to an obvious grappling point, it can be yanked down using Batman’s hook. It’s this swapping between batfriends and their skills that has formed the basis of LEGO games since the first Star Wars adaptation back in 2005, and still holds a certain level of charm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It does beg the question of how varied missions will be this time around, though, and the range of puzzles we’ll be faced with. When making my way through Ace Chemicals, I didn’t quite get the same “metroidvania-esque” feeling I often associate with LEGO games — knowing there’ll be many secret areas inaccessible on a first-playthrough as they require abilities you’ve not yet unlocked. This might be due to the fact that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-really-does-have-just-7-playable-characters-and-its-dividing-fan-opinion"><u>only seven characters will be playable in Legacy of The Dark Knight</u></a>, and thus the variety of powers and gadgets is vastly reduced — especially compared to The Skywalker Saga’s roster of around 400. That treasure-hunting replayability factor is a huge draw for some, so I fear a little if this is the case, but perhaps that portion of the experience is being reserved mainly for its open world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I only got to spend around 10 minutes in a small outdoor section of Gotham City, but found no shortage of things to get up to. That Arkham muscle-memory kicked in as I grapple-hooked onto a nearby roof and launched into the air before spreading my Batwings and assessing the crime-ridden alleys for activity. In my short time, I prevented a crime in progress by thumping a few goons, completed a Riddler trophy puzzle, and attempted a time trial in a Batmobile of my choosing — The Dark Knight’s Tumbler, 2022’s muscle-car like monster from The Batman, and accompanying Batcycle were on offer. Character outfits are customisable, from golden age comic interpretations to modern movie looks. How these are unlocked is yet unclear, but I wouldn’t be surprised if spending time collecting treasures dotted around the open world plays into this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Initial impressions that Legacy of The Dark Knight is an Arkham game in a LEGO wrapping are fairly spot-on, then. I settled snugly into the middle-ground between dynamic combat and collectathon puzzling the series has rooted itself so successfully in for years. I’m left very hopeful from the hour or so I’ve spent with it so far, and think it could be the perfect thing to tide Arkham fans over until Rocksteady (or somebody else willing to take up the mantle) answers the call of the Batsignal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

                <p>Team Cherry has finally, at long last, confirmed that Hollow Knight: Silksong is not only a real game, but that it will be available to play on September 4. That is soon. The game will be available to buy outright at launch, but will it also come to any subscription services, like Xbox Game Pass?</p><h3><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be on Game Pass.</strong></h3><p>Microsoft and Team Cherry have confirmed an Xbox Game Pass release for the highly anticipated game. It will be available via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, so subscribers can play it across console and PC. Alternatively, people can get Silksong via PC Game Pass for PC-only access.</p><p>It's possible Silksong could come to the less-expensive Game Pass tiers, like Game Pass Standard and Game Pass Core, at some point down the road--but this is not confirmed. If it ever does, it likely wouldn't be soon.</p><p>2017's Hollow Knight is currently available on Xbox Game Pass, or it can be purchased for $15. Hollow Knight is also available via Sony's PlayStation Plus Extra Game Catalogue.</p><p>There is no indication that Silksong could launch into PlayStation Plus. If it ever comes to PlayStation Plus, it probably won't be anytime soon. Nintendo, meanwhile, generally doesn't do day-one new releases for Nintendo Switch Online for third-party games.</p><h3><strong>A long wait</strong></h3><p>Silksong was originally designed to be an expansion to Hollow Knight before developer Team Cherry built it out further and converted it to a full standalone game. After morphing to a full game in 2019, the developers went largely silent, and there was such little news in the ensuing years that the game prompted some fans to worry if the game was real at all or if it might be stuck in development hell.</p><p>As it turns out, the developers maintain that development was always progressing and that the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">enormous commercial success of Hollow Knight afforded them the opportunity to take their time with Silksong.</a></p><p>Silksong resurfaced this week at Gamescom in Germany, and it's proving to be very popular, with long lines snaking through the convention center for a chance to play the highly anticipated game.</p><p>"Hollow Knight: Silksong appears to be exactly what we all should have expected: a strong, well-designed, visually lovely game that carries forward the aesthetic and design philosophies of the original with thoughtful, if not earth-shattering, updates," Steve Watts wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/">hands-on with Silksong at Gamescom this week</a>.</p><p>Silksong may not be a big, mainstream AAA game, but it has a lot of hype and pent-up demand behind it, so much so that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">at least three developers have delayed upcoming projects, citing Silksong.</a></p>

In a blog on Steam titled “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3314790/view/520848458437886253?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We have to delay <em>CloverPit</em> a bit (<em>Silksong</em> lol</a>),” they wrote</p><blockquote><p>Some of you might already have guessed the reason for the delay: <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p><p>The release date for <em>Silksong</em> was announced yesterday, and it’s only one day after <em>CloverPit</em> our original launch date [sic].<em> Silksong</em> is the most anticipated and wishlisted game on all of Steam and we think people will love this game and play it right at launch (including us) but that also means it will overshadow all games launching close to it. So if we stick to our original date we would risk the launch of <em>CloverPit</em> a fair bit.</p><p>We poured our hearts into our little game so of course we want to give it the best possible shot.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>PanikArcade wrote that they plan to use the delay to further polish the game.</p><p>Another indie developer, Frogteam Games, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/frogteam.games/post/3lwwege2ipc2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> Thursday afternoon shortly after the <em>Silksong</em> reveal that they were delaying the demo of their metroidvania <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2837590/Stomp_and_the_Sword_of_Miracles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Stomp and the Sword of Miracles</em></a> from August 29 to an unspecified date. Frogteam wrote that they had been planning to launch a Kickstarter for the game on September 12, “with the demo giving it a little boost beforehand,” but that they now “need to delay the demo for the sake of <em>Stomp</em>'s development. I want to give the demo room to shine, and I want to do what I can to make sure the Kickstarter is a success.” They also cited <em>Silksong</em> in their statement, writing</p><blockquote><p>Team Cherry has suddenly announced that <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, the most highly anticipated metroidvania I've ever seen, is going to release on September 4th.</p><p>Trying to market an indie game is already really, really hard. It's the task of trying to get attention in a deep sea of other amazing games. In the case of <em>Silksong</em>, however, I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale. Tiny devs like me rely on word of mouth and streamers to bring in visibility, and everyone's gonna be busy with <em>Silksong</em> for quite a while!</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Aeternum Game Studios planned to launch their metroidvania <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2710920/Aeterna_Lucis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Aeterna Lucis</em></a>, a sequel to their 2021 game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517970/Aeterna_Noctis/?curator_clanid=44082790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Aeterna Noctis</em></a>, in September, but announced on <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> Friday that they’ve now decided to delay the game to 2026. The studio wrote that “after the announcement of <em>Silksong</em>, we are fully aware that our game wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team’s effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.”</p><p>Aeternum cited a lack of dev kits as another reason for the delay and noted that “the game is already finished.” The studio also wrote</p><blockquote><p>We also want to take this opportunity to thank Team Cherry. There’s no need to wish them luck–we know <em>Silksong</em> will be a success and a masterpiece. Instead of rivalry, what we feel is gratitude: thanks to them, the metroidvania genre is more alive than ever and in fact, they were one of the main inspirations that led us to create <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> and the entire saga now in development.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>In contrast, indie studio Necrosoft has used <em>Silksong</em>’s release date to promote its RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Demonschool</em></a>, releasing on September 3. The studio wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3lwx26vg5cc2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, “Okay, sure, <em>Silksong</em> is going to sell millions of copies. But can you play it in 4:3 on your CRT like <em>Demonschool</em>!?”&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to Panik Arcade, Frogteam, Aeternum, and Necrosoft for more information.</p><p>Even bigger-name developers, like Bennett Foddy of <em>Getting Over It</em> fame, are at least mildly shook.</p><p>"Truth is we’re not sure [if we're delaying the game] yet," Foddy told Aftermath of literal walking simulator <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baby Steps</a></em>, which is currently set to launch on September 8. "We’re talking about it, though."</p><p>But is this all-hands-on-deck level of concern warranted? Simon Carless, founder of <a href="https://gamediscover.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameDiscoverCo</a> and relentless analyzer of Steam data, isn't so sure.</p><p>"In most cases, I do think devs are being too cautious in moving out of <em>Silksong</em>'s way," he told Aftermath. "Unless you feel like your buyers majorly overlap with <em>Silksong</em>'s, or you believe you are going to go viral with the same streamers who will cover <em>Silksong</em>, we've not seen a lot of evidence that game launches depress spending on other games. We've seen private research indicating that player counts for already-launched rival games were only affected if the game was in the same, very specific subgenre as that big launch."</p><p>That said, dodge rolling out of <em>Silksong</em>'s path at the last second does mean one less variable to worry about.</p><p>"One obvious issue here is that if you launch your game around <em>Silksong</em> and it's disappointing, you may always wonder if it was because you didn't move your release date," said Carless. "There's no A/B testing for that, but we do think—in general —people worry about launch windows of other games too much. It's not like the physical movie biz where there's only a fixed amount of screens to show on."</p><p>It’s not a surprise to see indie games, especially those in the same genre as <em>Silksong</em>, feeling the need to rethink their plans in light of Team Cherry’s long-awaited sequel. AAA games faced a similar challenge planning their releases around the generational juggernaut of <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-games-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a>, with some publishers telling <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Business</a> back in March that they were waiting to confirm their release dates until Rockstar picked theirs. (<em>GTA VI</em> was ultimately <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> to May 2026.)&nbsp;</p><p><em>Silksong</em>, however, is an indie from a small studio, and it came by its tidal wave of hype uniquely — growing over the years from a respectably anticipated sequel to a full-on myth, sans traditional marketing. While the game’s release certainly feels like An Event, it’s difficult to say whether it will suck the air out of the room in the same way as something like <em>GTA VI</em>. Can <em>Silksong</em> live up to the sheer weight of expectation placed upon it? And does this kind of intrigue translate to sales and days or weeks of rapt attention? For now, it’s unclear, but it’s hard to blame developers for going with a “better safe than sorry” approach.</p><p><em><strong>Update 8/22/25:</strong> Added comments from additional devs.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker"><h3>A ‘Game Capture Director’ Is The Person Who Gets The Gameplay Footage For A Video Game Trailer</h3></a><p>'The coolest thing I’ve ever done is probably put references to both Jaws and Pac-Mac in a single trailer'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/naked-gun-2025-review-movie"><h3>The Naked Gun Will Heal Cinema</h3></a><p>The Naked Gun is a glorious return to lowbrow humor, and an acknowledgement that we're not better than an extended poop joke.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is pretty darned slick. Gearbox had promised a grand overhaul of the game’s movement systems, a rejig of how weapons and customisation all works, and obviously a whole new planet to rampage across as a Vault Hunter, and I could definitely feel a lot of that when jumping into the game at Gamescom.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official Gameplay Overview - Harlowe" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EDrYNvTaFHs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s really the enhanced movement that stood out for me. Gearbox has thrown everything into this – baby, bathwater and the kitchen sink – to give perhaps the broadest movement options found in a first person shooter. With a dash, a double jump, a glide, a grappling hook, and even all the Vault Hunters having learnt to swim, the only thing that’s really left for Borderlands 5 is straight up teleporting everywhere!</p>


<p>Beyond just letting you explore the bigger, broader open areas that Gearbox have promised for the game world, the enhanced movement will really allow for more front-foot combat styles, helping close gaps quickly to unload that spicy shotgun you have, while grapple points can be a great way get to elevated positions as a sniper to unload. Though, of course, there’s nothing that’s going to stop you just keeping your distance and blasting away, as you would have done in previous games.</p>
<p>Speaking of weapons, there’s now a myriad of new possibilities — and that’s saying something, considering how broad, sprawling and crazy the options were before. There’s a handful of new weapon manufacturers that define their particular styles, so Order weapons are charge and release, while Daedalus guns can use multiple ammo types. But there’s much more control over them thanks to now being able to combine mods and properties, blending the series’ distinctive weapon tweaks to let you create something that little bit more special.</p>


<p>A Jakobs pistol, for example, has critical hits that will see the bullets ricochet to nearby enemies, but why not add a Tediore accessory that gives your gun legs, so you can thrown it on the ground and have it keep blasting your enemies? Or a Maliwan SMG that has radiation and cryo elements to switch between, but with a Tediore accessory that has you throw on reload, homing in on enemies and exploding into four further grenades? Things can get pretty wild…</p>
<p>Another great twist is being able to replace the typical grenade or ordinance slot with another weapon, giving you a heavy weapon outlet that’s surprisingly just on a cooldown. You won’t have many bullets each time, but when you can reliably trigger another significant damage dealer, it liberates you from the pain of running out of ammo for your best guns.</p>

<p>We got to play with Harlowe for the first time, trying out the new Gravatar class with some high tech options for her Ability. We stuck with the CHROMA Accelerator for her Action Skill, firing off slow-moving energy pocket orbs that deal Cryo damage and can explode on command to deal further damage. Her alternate Actions put enemies in Stasis, again with a damaging effect, or place a Flux Generator that projects a damaging field to enemies while granting allies Overshield.</p>
<p>Battling through the Vault of Inceptus for this demo took us down to a series of floating rock islands in the foggy aether, battling against Seneschal robots and soldier types; animalistic Pinheads which charged at us; and tougher, named enemies to boot. We battled through each area to power up the bounce pad to the next area, ultimately flying through the sky to a hollowed out arena to face the Primordial Guardian Inceptus — a big, broad metallic-looking creature with two stinging tails and shifting attacks and abilities.</p>

<p>Initially it bounds around this space, leaping in to attack with a sweep of its tails, before jumping up to the roof and spawning poisonous pustules adding hazards to the ground for you to avoid. That’s nothing compared to when it’s folded up in a cocoon of leaves, spreading a poisonous gas on the floor that forces you to adapt and stay up in the air.</p>
<p>It’s a fairly challenging boss battle, and really the main shame is that I don’t feel like I made the most of all of the gameplay possibilities that the game presents me. Much like min-maxing your builds in a Diablo game, you can often just go in blasting and have a nice time, but dropping into the middle of the game and with completely new loadouts to use, I didn’t quite grasp the best way to use Harlowe’s Action Skill — tricky when trying to target a fast-moving boss— and I failed to notice the grapple points in the final boss arena, which would have really helped me to stay up and away from the poisoned gas clouds. I was trying instead to jump and glide to stay off the ground, which was not entirely successful…</p>
<p>But, what I did see from this all-too-brief hands on opportunity was the potential that all of these additions off. Having enjoyed the earlier games in the Borderlands series, but skipping out on the last game, Borderlands 4 looks promising after, and is likely to pull me back into the looter shooter fold when it launches on 12th September.</p>

<p>Ready to roll</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Bandai Namco popped up at the Partner Direct last month to reveal <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a>. It's not due out until 24th October, but the studio is getting the ball rolling early by sharing a first look at the opening movie.</p>
<p>The two-minute video is full of all the classic sphere-pushing you would expect from a Katamari game. The key hook this time is era-hopping, and the movie brings that in full. Just look at that little guy work his way through the Wild West, dinosaurs, pirates and more, all while picking up objects of varying sizes.</p>
<p>All this is accompanied by one of the catchier theme songs we've heard in recent years, with chelmico's 'Katamari Time!' playing throughout.</p>
<p>We had a great time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/we_love_katamari_reroll_plus_royal_reverie">We Love Katamari REROLL + Royal Reverie</a> when it arrived on Switch back in 2023, so here's hoping that the next entry can hit similar highs.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-survivors-division-resurgence-ubisoft-gamescom-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-announces-survival-extraction-the-division-2-survivors-and-mobile-mmo-the-division-resurgence.1278396/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has arrived at Gamescom 2025 with two significant The Division 2-related announcements. Beginning with what the company is calling a "<em>survival extraction experience</em>," The Division 2: Survivors is due to launch sometime in 2026 and is the latest major part of what's been a long-tail for The Division 2 support.</p>



<p>The other big announcement is the arrival of a mobile game in The Division series, with a new free-to-play MMO called The Division Resurgence. </p>



<p>"<em>The Division 2: Survivors will bring an updated take on the survival extraction experience to The Division 2</em>," Ubisoft writes in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/enWR3N37m6wAbtZbV4nuA/the-division-2-survivors-and-the-division-resurgence">blog post</a>. Development on it is still "<em>in the early stages</em>," and is being led by Magnus Jansén as its creative director, who has been with the series since the first game which launched in 2016.</p>



<p>"<em>The Division 2: Survivors is as much your baby as it is ours,"</em> adds executive producer Julian Gerighty, "<em>and we strive for transparency during its development. Clear communication and community involvement are a focus as we build the new experience, and we will be closely involving you as we move forward on the development journey</em>." Speaking of Gerighty, he's also directing The Division 3, which we've still not seen hide nor hair of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-announced-star-wars-outlaws-director-julian-gerighty/">since it was first announced in 2023</a>.</p>



<p>That's all Ubisoft had to say about Survivors for now, though they did share a few images of concept art. </p>

<p>It also showed a graphic for a roadmap for The Division series, which, you'll notice, doesn't include The Division 3. </p>

<p>Regarding The Division Resurgence, Ubisoft says it will have "<em>the same gameplay experience as the Division games adapted to mobile gaming."</em> It'll take players into Manhattan, and be set a few months after the events of the first Division game.</p>



<p>Even though it is an exclusive mobile release, which might immediately make fans of The Division who play the games on PC or consoles disinterested, if you're big on the lore and story of the series, you might want to consider checking it out, since "<em>the Division Resurgence will bridge the narrative gap between the Division 1 and 2, adding to the existing lore with additional story beats over time</em>."</p>



<p>That said, you could also just wait to watch a recap on YouTube. But if you are keen to actually play through the story content, you can register for it now, and potentially take part in a closed beta test.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>The last major update for The Division 2 was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-battle-for-brooklyn-dlc-launches-on-may-27/">Battle for Brooklyn</a> which launched earlier this year. The next major update is the launch of Year 7's season 2, The Pact, which launches in a few weeks from the time of this writing on September 9.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-may-hint-at-return-to-dark-sun-setting</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-may-hint-at-return-to-dark-sun-setting.1278393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> Unearthed Arcana. This latest batch of playtest material features new apocalyptic-themed character subclasses, which may hint at the company returning to one of its older, and darker, settings.</p>

<h2>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Unearthed Arcana Apocalyptic Subclass Announcement</h2>

<p>As always, the latest <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Unearthed Arcana is free to download from <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ua/apocalyptic-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Beyond</a>. The new playtest material uses the 2024 rules and features four new character subclasses for the Druid, Fighter, Sorceror, and Warlock. Each subclass appears to take on a darker, postapocalyptic theme.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-circle-of-preservation-text-screenshot.jpg?itok=gueOLHGJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-circle-of-preservation-text-screenshot.jpg?itok=k2tE8BeD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Circle of Preservation Druid is all about protection. Druids of this circle can expend a use of their Wild Shape to create a large area of vegetation to grow which heals allies and cures them of certain conditions. At later levels, you can even eschew expensive material components for more advanced spells and have your hallowed areas deal radiant damage to enemies.</p>

<p>The Gladiator Fighter features a combination of martial prowess and bloody showmanship. Their Brutality mechanic lets them layer on additional weapon mastery effects with every hit like Vex or Topple, and can add their Charisma bonus to certain skill rolls. At later levels, the Gladiator also gets a Parry and Mutilate ability, which can debuff bloodied enemies.</p>

<p>The third subclass in this <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Unearthed Arcana is the Defiled Sorcery Sorceror. This Sorceror can expend hit dice to increase the damage of a spell attack. The twist is the hit dice spent can either be theirs or the enemy. At later levels, they gain auras which grant resistance to certain damage types and helps them regain sorcery points.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-sorceror-king-warlock-text.jpg?itok=NJk6qhxA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-sorceror-king-warlock-text.jpg?itok=RSw-Bxw9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, there is the Sorcerer-King Patron Warlock. As the name implies, Warlocks make a pact with a tyrannical demigod or incredibly powerful magical despot for power. As a result, you can cast certain spells like <em>Command</em> or <em>Hold Person</em> without verbal or somatic components and create auras that can make enemies frightened of you. Their endgame features include forcing enemies to auto-fail attacks.</p>

<p>On the surface, the new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Unearthed Arcana appears to be an innocuous batch of playtest material. But it is no secret that UAs usually allude to future books or supplements that Wizards of the Coast are working on. Their<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> Arcane subclass UA</a> hinting at the new Forgotten Realms books, or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revised Artificer</a> foreshadows the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-new-eberron-2025-supplement-bringing-back-older-dd-setting" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eberron</a> book.</p>

<p>With that in mind, there is a strong chance this Unearthed Arcana may imply Wizards of the Coast may return to the apocalyptic world of Dark Sun in a future book. This would be a major departure from the high fantasy of Faerun or the steampunk sensibilities of Eberron.</p>

<p>Dark Sun is set in the post-apocalyptic world of Athas, full of barren wastelands, slavery, and wizard tyrants that use the lives of their subjects to power spells. It has more in common with <em>Mad Max</em> or the classic <em>Conan The Barbarian</em> stories than <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. It is also a notoriously problematic setting packed various negative stereotypes.</p>

<p>Given the thematic text and mechanical function seen in the UA, these subclasses would be right at home in such a setting. But does beg the question as to how WOTC will present the dark themes in the setting if they choose to revisit it in 2024.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong Gameplay (Over The Shoulder Filmed) | gamescom 2025</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For those curious, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/2546388" rel="nofollow ">previous Kickstarter update</a> was a post right after E3 2019 talking about a demo for Hollow Knight: Silksong. Funnily enough, the Gamescom demo playable this week seems to be nearly identical to the experience from E3 2019 (an event that no longer exists). GameSpot did get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/">hands-on time with Hollow Knight: Silksong at Gamescom</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Kickstarter backers receiving Hollow Knight: Silksong codes was foreshadowed yesterday when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier posted on social media that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-reviews-probably-arent-going-to-be-ready-for-launch/1100-6534191/">reviews probably wouldn't be ready before the game's launch</a>. That's reportedly because Team Cherry would find it unfair for critics to play the game earlier than original backers.</p><p dir="ltr">The anticipation for Hollow Knight: Silksong's upcoming launch feels pretty tangible. For instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-just-hit-an-all-time-peak-on-steam-after-silksong-release-date-reveal/1100-6534206/">Hollow Knight just hit an all-time concurrent-players peak on Steam</a> with over 22,000 people. In addition, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/">at least three indie games are pushing back their release dates</a> now to avoid coming out near Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>

		<p>Happy Friday! It is the end of a week of annual leave for me though, so it is a deflated Friday for me. I have been on my hollibobs with my Switch, and while I had set out to play a bunch of things, the only thing I played was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview/">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> for hours, and hours and hours. You can have my full review of it next week!</p>
<p>Tef, meanwhile, is at that Gamescom, playing all sorts of things, including the awesome-looking <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-all-singing-supernatural-diy-delight/">No Ghosts at the Grand</a>. He will have loads of things to tell you about in the next few weeks as well, so definitely look out for that.</p>

<p>Aran has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/21/tiny-bookshop-review/">Tiny Bookshop</a> for review, saying,&nbsp; “It is such a chilled out game. It may be my game of the year!” Strong words for the end of August!</p>
<p>Gamoc has been playing Echoes of the End for review, which he loves, as well as a bit of Death Stranding and Smash Bros.</p>

<p>Jim is still chipping away at Far Cry 5 and although some of the open-world activities are starting to repeat themselves, there are plenty of cool diversions such as platforming-like Prepper Stash sections to keep things fresh. He says, “I’m now mainlining my way towards the ending and have the Vietnam War DLC in my sights.”</p>

<p>Ade polished off his reviews for Shinobi: Art of Vengeance and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/21/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>. He also played through the side-scrolling cheerleader beat ’em up Ra Ra Boom with Laura for her review. He’s been packing the gaming in this week though, continuing, “I’ve also tried the new Rogue Prince of Persia on PlayStation Plus – which is excellent – and a few more missions in Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters. Though most of my gaming time has been spent playing Marvel Rivals! I wasn’t impressed with the game when I played it last year but the devs have made a lot of improvements and now it’s really fun! Cloak and Dagger is my favourite pick, with Squirrel Girl and The Punisher a close second and third.”</p>
<p>Laura has been playing Ra Ra Boom, telling us, “The title of which must always be sung – to your choice of notes but ideally to the tune of the theme song for extra kudos) with @Ade. We love a good side-scrolling beat em up and Ra Ra Boom (sing it!) has such a gorgeous art style!”</p>

<p>Steve has been deeply immersed in three completely different postapocalyptic settings (four if you count the state of the real world) but two of those are super secret so he’s just been playing, “The continuing adventures of Wuchang super sexy bird girl which is still following the pattern of being really enjoyable until I spend hours bashing my head against a brick wall boss.”</p>
<p>Finally, Miguel has been playing some Shuten Order for review, along with a little Death Stranding 2, a few rounds in the playtest for Fate Trigger, and a couple nights of Tekken 8!</p>
<p>So then, have you been playing anything this week?</p>
