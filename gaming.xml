The quality is good enough that, while scrolling on social media, you'd think it was a legimate clip from YouTube or Twitch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Technically, Veo 3 should not be infringing on anyone's copyrighted material — and it's safe to assume Fortnite developer Epic Games did not sign this one off. But clearly the AI tool has had access to the millions of hours of Fortnite gameplay posted online, and is now able to reproduce a convincing representation on command.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One <a href="https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clip</a>, showing a streamer celebrating as they win a match using only their pickaxe, was apparently created within Veo 3 using a text-based prompt of nine words: "Streamer getting a victory royale with just his pickaxe".</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Uhhh... I don't think Veo 3 is supposed to be generating Fortnite gameplay <a href="https://t.co/bWKruQ5Nox" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bWKruQ5Nox</a></p>— Matt Shumer (@mattshumer_) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In writing this prompt, Veo 3 has not been told specifically to create Fortnite gameplay. Still, it understands from the context what game the user is referring to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veo 3's abilities throw up all sorts of questions, and far more pressing ones than simple copyright concerns. The ability to create footage like this undoubtedly aids users looking to fool others with disinformation, and in so doing undermine trust in legitimate footage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can not tell if this is real or not," reads one reply. "We're cooked," reads another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The only way this is possible is if Veo 3 was trained on an enormous amount of Fortnite content," a third reply reads. "Wouldn’t be surprised if everything that gets uploaded to YouTube is now being trained on despite copyright laws."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Epic for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a better look at what Veo 3 is capable of outside of video games, here's a clip of the algorithm creating a fake news report on an automobile trade show that doesn't exist, with fake interviewees answering fake questions.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Before you ask: yes, everything is AI here. The video and sound both coming from a single text prompt using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Veo3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Veo3</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@GoogleDeepMind</a> .Whoever is cooking the model, let him cook!

Xbox boss Phil Spencer suggested Muse could be used to help ideate game concepts in the future, and even somehow aid in game preservation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Muse's reveal, quickly followed by the reveal of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-quake-2-ai-prototype-sparks-debate-online">more fake gameplay footage generated by Muse of the classic shooter Quake 2</a>, has prompted further debate — and raised questions over whether the tool would remove work or replace human creativity from existing employees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite is no stranger to AI itself, of course. Last week, the game added the ability to chat with Star Wars' Darth Vader, who will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-has-only-been-live-for-an-hour-and-already-epic-has-patched-out-him-saying-fk">reply using generative AI trained on the voice of the late James Earl Jones</a>. Jones' voice is officially licensed (and was previously used to create dialogue for Disney's own Obi Wan Kenobi TV series) and sanctioned by both the late actor and his family, but the addition still prompted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actor-union-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-over-fortnites-ai-darth-vader">swift condemnation and an unfair labor practice charge from acting union SAG-AFTRA</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

It doesn't make it clear what the problem is, you'll just know the code hasn't worked. The good news is, if you use our article, we'll move codes into expired when they stop working, so you can tell the difference. If a code is in the active and working list, however, be sure to copy and paste it exactly as you see it here. We test each of the codes before uploading them, and Roblox codes are often case-sensitive, so it's important that it's exact. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Lies of P Overture Director explains how the DLC will create a complete experience</p>
      </div>
<p>Once the update goes live alongside the Overture expansion, you will get to choose from two new gameplay difficulty options, Butterfly's Guidance and Awakened Puppet. The default difficulty level will be renamed to "Legendary Stalker" in the upcoming patch. For those of you looking for a greater challenge, will be able to take part in a boss rush mode that has several tiers of escalating difficulty. Additionally, the new Death March mode is a gauntlet of boss fights where your health and inventory will be more limited.</p><p>Difficulty options in souls-like games have been a polarizing topic for years now. Dark Souls and Elden Ring developer From Software typically refrains from adding such options to its games, while other studios allow a wider selection of options to make the experience more forgiving. Stellar Blade is a good example here, as the Sekiro-influenced game offers several difficulty modes and gameplay assists. On the extreme side, Steel Rising by developer Spiders has options that turns the game into a cakewalk.</p><p>Lies of P: Overture is expected to launch in summer for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Neowiz says you can expect it to take <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lies-of-p-expansion-will-take-up-to-20-hours-isnt-related-to-that-cutscene/1100-6530393/">between 15-20 hours to complete</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-has-been-in-development-since-the-launch-of-the-first-switch-console/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> another episode of its Ask the Developer Series dedicated to upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 games, and this time it's all about Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>This could very well be the 'killer application' of the new console. Its predecessor, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-8-deluxe-best-kart-racer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, launched shortly after the launch of the original Switch and was immediately a smashing success. The game has sold over 65 million units to date, becoming one of the best-selling premium titles of all time.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Kosuke Yabuki (Producer of the Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Department) revealed in this interview that prototyping on Mario Kart World started even before the predecessor launched on the Switch, while full development began later in 2017.</p>
<p><em>We were thinking about what to do for the next Mario Kart game even during the development of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and we began prototyping in March 2017. It was at the end of that year when we officially started work on it as a project. I felt that in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, we were able to perfect the formula that we'd been following in the series up to that point, where players race on individual courses. That’s why, this time, we wanted the gameplay to involve players driving around a large world, and we began creating a world map like this.</em></p>
<p>It's an exceedingly long time to make a game by Nintendo's standards. However, the team has significant challenges to overcome, such as doubling the amount of players in a race from 12 to 24 while adding an open world. Everything became much more feasible once the decision was made to move the project to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kenta Sato (Programming Director):</strong> When we were developing for the Nintendo Switch system, it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return. We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30 fps in some cases. It was a tough situation.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kosuke Yabuki:</strong> We worked on it while kicking the can down the road in terms of deciding what to give up on, so at some point, we knew it was going to get messy. But as we'd decided to release <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-booster-course-pass-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe — Booster Course Pass</a>, we thought that would give us a bit more time to continue development. That's when the conversation of moving it to the Nintendo Switch 2 system came up, and this suddenly opened up a bunch of possibilities on what we could do. It was truly a ray of hope.</em></p>
<p>Our Nathan Birch was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out Mario Kart World</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 press hands-on event and came away favorably impressed:</p>
<p><em>Mario Kart World feels very much like a shiny new Mario Kart 8 model, which will be great for those looking for more of what that game offered, but there’s no denying the game feels a bit familiar at times. That said, Mario Kart World’s interconnected map is a compelling creation, and while I need to play more, I can imagine a lot of potential ways Nintendo could utilize, and possibly expand, their new racing world. Nintendo may be about to unleash the racing platform they support for the next decade and I’m intrigued to see where this road may lead us.</em></p>

        <p>The unbridled pungency of Butterfly's Guidance</p>

    </div>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Which sounds like the more intense experience to you, dear reader - "Butterfly's Guidance" or "Awakened Puppet"? No, this isn't me workshopping titles for my latest range of exotic fragrances. I'm referring to the new easier difficulty modes Neowiz will add to Pinnochio-powered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> alongside the game's Overture DLC this summer.
</p>
<p>
The difficulty modes will arrive in a free Lies Of P update. The standard difficulty will be "Legendary Stalker", which honestly I think is a bit of a letdown, after "Butterfly's Guidance" and "Awakened Puppet". It barely sounds like an exotic fragrance at all. Possibly you could peddle it as some kind of feline musk.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-is-getting-difficulty-options-to-make-the-soulslike-more-accessible/">VGC</a>, game director Jiwon Choi explained that "we wanted to make sure a wider audience of players could play the game," adding that the new modes are based partly on player feedback. "[By] making development adjustments and introducing these difficulty options, we can offer the experience to different types of players," he said. "This broadens the base."
</p>
<p>
This would be an obvious time to rekindle the debate about difficulty, accessibility, and the toxicity of "git gud" culture. Let me extend an avuncular arm and say: come now, friends, that debate is surely over. I think everybody agrees that giving players options that reflect their needs or preferences is fundamentally a good thing, and that there is no reason such options can't be consistent with, say, an atmosphere of abiding menace or a sense of gruelling challenge - after all, most video games and certainly, all mainstream commercial video games assist and guide players in myriad, subtle ways, even when you're playing on Mega-Bastard difficulty.
</p>
<p>
Instead, let's argue about appropriate difficulty mode naming. I have a feeling I've ranted somewhere about this before? Call me Johnny Obfuscation but I like it when developers clown around a bit with their nomenclature. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>'s European Extreme, for example, or Ready To Rhombus in <a href="http://adventuresofsquare.com/">The Adventures Of Square</a>. European Extreme is definitely some kind of abrasive cologne: it conjures up visions of dyed chest hair and revolting suede. Ready To Rhombus, meanwhile, sounds like a whimsical hemp-based aftershave with a handwritten label, sold exclusively in Camden Town.
</p>
<p>
Difficulty settings aside, Lies Of P is also getting a couple of new bossfight modes. In Battle Memories, you can replay bosses through five difficulty tiers. In Death March, you must fell as many bosses as possible with limited health and items. Again, it's all coming this summer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Earlier this week, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford made headlines, when a comment he had made on social media started making the rounds online. The comment was in response to one potential Borderlands 4 buyer, who in a post on X said "this game better not be 80 dollars". Pitchford then gave a slightly tone deaf reply, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">"real fans" would find a way to get their hands on a copy of the game no matter how much it cost</a>.</p>
<p>Pitchford's comment was met with a certain amount of backlash, and now the Gearbox head has shared another post in a bid to unmuddy the waters.</p>
<p>"If you want the truth, here it is," he wrote, with an accompanying video from an earlier interview where he was asked how much Borderlands 4 would retail for. Here, the Gearbox exec admitted he did not know how much Borderlands 4 will cost.</p>

<p>"It's an interesting time, right," Pitchford said. "On one level, we've got a competitive market place. The people who make those choices want to sell as many units as possible, and they want to be careful about people who are price sensitive. So, there are some folks who don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are."</p>
<p>He went on to state that there are also "other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing, and there's tariffs for the retail packaging" to consider.</p>
<p>"It's getting gnarly out there, guys," Pitchford said, adding Borderlands 4 has "more than twice" the development budget of its series predecessor. He reiterated that he really doesn't know the price, but when pre-orders go live, that's when we will all know how much Borderlands 4 will cost.</p>
<p>"Here's the philosophy we have, whatever the price is: we're entertainers. Yes, we want to get more resources so we can make bigger and better games - there is a reason why Borderlands 4 is so awesome," the studio head went on. "It's because you guys showed up and supported <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a>. And, we had the budget, we could more than double the budget and feel confident in that."</p>
<p>He said as a group of "artists", the studio wants everyone to be able to get their hands on Borderlands 4. "We want to make it as easy as possible for everybody to enjoy what we are creating" and that everyone who plays a Gearbox game feels like they "got the better end of the bargain".</p>
<p>In the video, Pitchford said "we're going to have a price set soon, and it might be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rising-game-prices-would-happen-sooner-or-later-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">new price that Nintendo and Microsoft have led with</a>" or "it might be that we stay back". Either way, "it's going to be the people at the publishing house that decide that".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/war-mechanic-weaves-an-intriguing-alternate-history-where-ww2-never-ended/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Alternate histories often give us the most intriguing settings. Taking what we know and twisting it into a parallel timeline might result in the light-hearted antics of Back to the Future, or skew the world into a terrifying alternative vision of the past or future, bringing us prescient stories like A Handmaid’s Tale or exploring punishing alternatives like The Man in the High Castle.</p>
<p>War Mechanic pictures a world where World War 2 never ended. Here, the Soviets stole the plans to the atomic bomb, but, lacking the scientific might to bring it to fruition, it was never completed. Without that emphatic punctuation to the conflict, it rumbled on, and while the Nazis were dispatched, it ultimately became a war between the US and the Russians, with the US war machine led by now-President Patton.</p>
<p><iframe title="War Mechanic - Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FydGoDMoiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Within that, War Mechanic takes you to Nordhook. This island-based military outpost has fallen into disrepair, and you’re tasked with pushing the US military front from this remote locale, with economic and technological might the order of the day. Starting off in the opening area for our hands-on session, War Mechanic sees you rebuild, repair and enhance your base of operations, so that you can then push further into the body of the island, unearthing secret tech, or collecting scrap to turn into useful items for the war effort.</p>
<p>Your main character, Jack, is focused, inquisitive and intelligent, making an interesting counterpoint to your weasel-like companion Bill, who oozes underhandedness like a cheap cologne. He’s the one transporting you to the island you’re going to call home for the foreseeable future, and there’s a nice bit of narrative drive to wash over you as the boat careens towards its goal.</p>


<p>War Mechanic has some real Bioshock and Fallout 4 vibes, and its alternate history setting is intriguing, throwing up a variety of questions about this unusual island and its mysteries. Given that both sides during the Second World War utilised island bases, and they’re interesting enough without populating them with killer spider robots and steampunk hardware, it feels as though the team have settled on a perfect setting for their narrative.</p>
<p>We talked to lead developer, Rafał Lewkowicz, who told us, “We like history! We like history a lot! That’s probably the basis for everything here.” It’s clear that the team at Chronospace have a very specific vision of this period of time, and they’re having lots of fun exploring the possibilities that it gives them, in terms of storytelling, and the technology that they’ve created in-game.</p>
<p>You’re equipped with a pistol from the outset, which is absolutely necessary to deal with the spider-like robot drones that have been left to defend the island. They’re a constant source of anxiety, and my favourite moments with them was seeing them scurry off behind a building in the distance, and carefully following in the hope that I could take them out before they ran straight up to me and exploded.</p>
<p>They will home in on your location, and you have to react quickly and decisively unless you want to lose a large chunk of your health. Fortunately, there are plenty of healing packs littered around in this opening area, but it’ll be interesting to see if these become rarer as you advance, ramping up the difficulty. One thing we do know from screenshots is that these spider-bots don’t stay small…</p>

<p>Alongside your pistol, you’ve got a burner, which is good for collecting coal down the mines as much as it is for melting down scrap that you can then turn into other things via the game’s crafting and upgrade mechanics. It doesn’t feel too much like busy work here, and finding a crashed plane blocking the middle of the road that you can then dismantle is plenty of fun.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the demo, you unlock an enhanced German car, and once you’ve found a blueprint and crafted the design, you can stick a handy machine gun on its roof, ideal for the sudden horde of spider-bots that come your way once they hear you. It’s nice to see the team giving players plenty of ways to explore the environment, though the opening area is perhaps slightly too constricted for racing around in your car.</p>

<p>The team tell me that there’s a later desert area, and it feels as though you’re going to get plenty of opportunity to careen across the sand dunes once you reach it, but it would be nice to let loose with the vehicle a little earlier here.</p>
<p>War Mechanic has settled on an intriguing moment in global history to craft its alternative history tale, and after our short time with the game, we’re already keen to see more.</p>
<p><em>War Mechanic is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2861090/War_Mechanic/">available to wishlist on Steam</a>, as the team build up to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chronospace/war-mechanic-explore-repair-automate">a Kickstarter crowdfunding project</a> in the near future.</em></p>

			<p>As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-full-launch-scheduled-for-may-21-devs-want-to-bring-the-entirety-of-westeros-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, Netmarble has released Game of Thrones: Kingsroad on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-e19c7c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and Windows Launcher) and mobile devices (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netmarble.got" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-kingsroad/id6483917232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>) across the world with the exception of Asia, where the game will debut later in 2025. The action/adventure roleplaying game (powered by Unreal Engine 5) had previously debuted in early access exclusively on PC. Cross-play is enabled between PC and mobile, by the way, once you've linked the accounts.</p>
<p>The launch update added the new Stormlands region, the one ruled by Stannis Baratheon. Players will find new story missions and side content, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ferocious Beast</li>
<li>Bandit Camps</li>
<li>Echoes of the Past</li>
<li>Historic Sites</li>
<li>Occupied Sites</li>
<li>Gods Haven</li>
</ul>
<p>The level cap was raised from 40 to 45. Four new Artifacts (one Legendary, one Epic, and two Uncommon) have been added. New Achievements have been added for performing feats in the Stormlands as well as defeating the Unicorn and Drogon. Moreover, an emote system was added to Game of Thrones: Kingsroad and can now be accessed by selecting the emotes icon in the lower right corner of the chat window.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uNd9WH5QmQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate the official launch, Netmarble will gift players a random reward once per day through June 5. Potential rewards include x80 Golden Dragon, x1 Ruin Runner, x2,000 Copper, x10 Iron Ore, x1 Artifact Expedition Requisition, x3 Silver Ore, and x1 Enraging Draught Bundle. To claim the rewards, players must simply visit the Web Shop daily.</p>
<p>Over time, the developer has expressed the desire to add all the remaining regions to eventually bring all of Westeros to life. Of course, being a live service game at its core, it will largely depend on the game's success. If Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is popular enough, it may happen over time; otherwise, it could be shut down way before that happens.</p>

            <p>Borderlands boss Randy Pitchford <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hey-randy-im-not-sure-if-saying-that-a-real-fan-will-figure-out-how-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-is-a-good-look">submitted an-all timer entry into the pantheon of neoliberal thirst tweets</a> earlier this week, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">telling a player concerned</a> about a potential $80 asking price for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> that "if you're a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen", before telling an anecdote about how, when he were a lad, he used to lick the fleas from unwashed goats for quarters to play Bubble Bobble, or something.</p>
<p>This went down about as well as you'd expect, prompting Pitchford to yesterday follow-up with a clip of him on a panel talking about a potential price increase in, wait for it, much more sober and considered terms. So, in the interest of not only reporting on Pitchford when he says something incredibly stupid (although, lets be real, only because it's related, I'm still muckraking here) <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1925108385625809225">here's the clip</a>.</p>

<p>When asked about the game's price, Pitchford says he doesn't know. "It's an interesting time, right? We've got a competitive marketplace. We want people to buy it so we've got the resources to make more. The people that make those choices want to sell as many units as possible, and they want to be careful about people who are price-sensitive. We want everyone who buys and plays a Gearbox game to feel certain they got the better end of the bargain."</p>
<p>"Game budgets are increasing," he continues. "There's tariffs for the retail packaging. It's getting gnarly out there. Borderlands 4 has more than twice the development budget (of 3)". Then he veers off to talk about his philosophy of entertainment, etc.</p>
<p>There's surely debates to be had about some of the points Pitchford raises although, crucially, none of it puts the onus on "fans" to be "real" enough to go lick fleas from goats for pennies. Why didn't you just say all this in the first place, Pitchford? I understand Twitter is where nuance goes to die, but don't tell me that you're above long threads now. Also, no, having a character in Borderlands 4 reference your original tweet to reframe your idiot posting as a charming foible will not absolve you of this. Although it would at least be refreshingly recent as far as Borderlands references go.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-receive-difficulty-options-in-free-update-alongside-overture-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> will receive difficulty options in a free update due alongside its forthcoming DLC, Overture.</p>
<p>As a Soulslike game, Lies of P is certainly challenging. But the new difficulty options will ensure both the base game and the DLC are more approachable for newcomers.</p>
<p>"We wanted to make sure a wider audience of players could play the game," said game director Jiwon Choi (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-is-getting-difficulty-options-to-make-the-soulslike-more-accessible/">VGC</a>), adding the team had had "a lot of feedback" from players and the game's developers.</p>

<p>"So by making development adjustments and introducing these difficulty options, we can offer the experience to different types of players. This broadens the base."</p>
<p>The default difficulty for Lies of P will be named "Legendary Stalker", while two easier modes will be added named "Butterfly's Guidance" and "Awakened Puppet".</p>
<p>If you're after even more challenge, though, the game is also receiving a Battle Memories mode where players can replay bosses through five tiers of difficulty, including ultra hard modes.</p>
<p>What's more, a Death March boss rush mode will challenge players to take down as many bosses as possible with a limited pool of health and items.</p>
<p>Both of these modes will have bespoke rewards yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Lies of P: Overture is a prequel to the base game that was initially teased in 2023 following the game's release, along with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-as-game-director-teases-dlc">confirmation a sequel is in development</a>. It was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-prequel-dlc-revealed-named-overture">officially revealed earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>As a prequel, the DLC will follow the protagonist puppet during the final days of the city of Krat. It will feature new weapons such as slashing claws, a gunblade, and a ranged bow.</p>
<p>Lies of P: Overture will be released at some point this summer.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Eurogamer spoke with Choi about FromSoftware's forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, though the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-remain-single-player-despite-refreshing-elden-ring-nightreign-says-director">Lies of P team is focused solely on creating a single-player game</a>.</p>
<p>"I've tried [Nightreign] and it was very refreshing and new," he said. "So that obviously gave me the impression that they're good developers, they always push their boundaries, their imagination and vision, and it shows. In turn, that for some reason motivated me to deliver the Overture experience as good as it could be."</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Dark Souls creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> has frequently discussed the high difficulty level of his games. Ahead of Elden Ring's release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-discusses-elden-ring-difficulty">he stated it would be more approachable than previous games</a>, and then last year said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/turning-down-elden-rings-difficulty-would-break-the-game-itself-says-miyazaki">turning down the challenge would "break the game itself"</a>.</p>
<p>Souls fans have long debated whether difficulty options should be included, but it's great to see other studios implementing what FromSoftware hasn't so far.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Did this knight eat an entire pack of bad batteries? Do batteries even exist in this world, described as "a realm in ruins…beneath a twilight sky". It's a damn hell ass bum mystery, and mystery is exactly what I want from a game that lists both Morrowind and King's Field as influences.</p>

<p>"As a spellsword gunslinger," - truly, the millionaire astronaut cowboy DJ of RPG classes  - "you'll explore ethereal landscapes shrouded in twilight, battle fearsome creatures, and uncover ancient secrets. Explore the dying Kingdom of Mortis and its different realms in first person action combat, in a world mixed with retro and vaporwave aesthetics".</p>
<p>Despite the FromSoft influence, Dreamspring is aiming to be "a less punishing type of Souls/Scrolls-like game," which I reckon is something that gets more important the bigger your world is. Otherwise, it looks to have most of the stuff you'd expect - branching dialogue, branching storyline, branching trees with branches branching toward an uncaring skyline, all the classics. It's in early access at the moment, with the "core loop" apparently done, and the main quest and world still being worked on.</p>
<p>There's no demo, although developer Billyfighter's previous game Necroslayer is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2563960/Necroslayer">roughly the price of Greggs' bake at the moment</a>. Will you feel good after playing it? I can't say. But you will likely feel better than after eating a Greggs' bake.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-rebrands-to-fellowship-entertainment/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-group-rebrands-to-fellowship-entertainment.1195950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-rebrands-to-fellowship-entertainment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Embracer Group announced a rebranding to Fellowship Entertainment.&nbsp;<span>This is a clear nod to The Lord of the Rings IP, whose rights Embracer&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-rights-embracer-low-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchased</a> around two years ago&nbsp;</span>for a relatively low sum ($395 million). Following the acquisition, COO Matthew Karch <a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-needs-to-be-turned-into-one-of-gamings-biggest-franchises-says-embracer-coo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that the group's priority should be turning The Lord of the Rings into one of gaming's biggest franchises. Karch is no longer with Embracer (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-splits-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split with Saber Interactive a while ago</a>), but the sentiment appears to have remained the same, given the brand name's choice.</p>
<p>Of course, Tolkien's beloved fantasy universe is just one of many big franchises owned by Fellowship Entertainment, such as Kingdom Come Deliverance, Metro, Dead Island, Killing Floor, Darksiders, Remnant, and Tomb Raider. The new company will house over 6K employees spread across 50 companies or so.</p>
<p>The other big news announced today is that Coffee Stain Group (Goat Simulator, Satisfactory, Deep Rock Galactic) is being spun off into a separately listed company. Lars Wingefors, co-founder and Group CEO of Embracer, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Coffee Stain Group has incredible talent, IPs and communities. To date, it has been a true recipe for success. I am confident in Anton's strategy and leadership and see a clear long-term opportunity in attracting and enabling partnerships with like-minded independent game developers and talents.</em></p>
<p>Anton Westbergh, co-founder and Group CEO of Coffee Stain, added:</p>
<p><em>We’re really proud of everything we’ve built as part of Embracer, and grateful for the support and trust we’ve received over the years. Now, as we take the step to become a separately listed company, it feels both exciting and, honestly, a little bit scary—but in a good way.</em></p>

<p>The Embracer name will live on, albeit stained after countless <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-interactive-suffers-embracers-restructuring-codemasters-also-hit-by-layoffs-at-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoffs</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/volition-games-the-studio-behind-saints-row-red-faction-has-been-shut-down-by-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closures</a>, only as the privately held holding company of Fellowship Entertainment, Coffee Stain Group, and Asmodee Group (which had been spun off earlier this year). Lars Wingefors, as the main shareholder, will remain in control.</p>
<p>The company also provided an overview of its announced release schedule. In fiscal year 2025/2026, the following titles will be launched:</p>

        <p>Here is Embracer Group’s breakdown of the transformation process:</p><blockquote><ul><li>The shares in Coffee Stain Group will be distributed to the shareholders of Embracer, and are intended to be listed on the Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market in Stockholm.</li><li>The intention is to carry out the spin-off by way of a dividend distribution of all shares, a so-called Lex ASEA dividend. The current dual share class of A and B-shares will be replicated into the new public company. Subject to approval of the general meeting of Embracer to distribute the shares of Coffee Stain Group and an approval from Nasdaq, it is anticipated that a listing of Coffee Stain Group can be completed by the end of calendar year 2025.</li><li>Fellowship Entertainment (current Embracer Group) will remain listed on Nasdaq Stockholm.</li><li>Further details, including the capital structure of both Coffee Stain Group and Fellowship Entertainment, will be provided ahead of the spin-off.</li><li>As previously communicated, the largest shareholder, Lars Wingefors AB, will, in connection with the name change to Fellowship Entertainment, establish a privately held holding company. The new company will be named Embracer AB. It will act as an active and supportive long-term shareholder of Asmodee Group, Coffee Stain Group and Fellowship Entertainment, as well as potentially other companies complementing a wider ecosystem of capabilities within gaming and connected businesses managed by leading entrepreneurs and creators.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blades-of-fire-%E2%80%93-5-things-to-know-to-enjoy-the-game-more.1195914/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/blades-of-fire-5-things-to-know-to-enjoy-the-game-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although Blades of Fire is not that different from other action-adventure games like the modern God of War games and challenging action role-playing games in the vein of FromSoftware's Souls series, playing the game developed by MercurySteam the same way as these games will result in a frustrating experience. As such, learning some of the gameplay systems' intricacies will go a long way to make the experience more enjoyable.</p>
<p>As you are starting out your quest to kill the Queen, however, you won't get many opportunities to delve deeper into some of the game's unique mechanics. Still, there are a few things to know right at the start of the adventure that can make Blades of Fire way more enjoyable.</p>
<h2>Manage your Weapons wisely</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.54.15.59-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the beginning of the game, your weapon selection will be limited, and you may end up relying on a single weapon that seems to be doing well. What you should be doing, however, is start getting used to the game's weapon mechanics, as you will soon encounter an enemy that your favorite weapon may not be able to damage. As such, you should have on hand multiple weapons that allow you to deal blunt, slashing, and piercing damage. While penetration values may not be too important at the start, you should always make sure they are as high as possible, so bringing multiple weapons that deal the same type of damage may be beneficial in the end, as it will make sure the penetration value of any specific weapon doesn't get too low to the point that you will need to sharpen your weapon, reducing durability.</p>
<h2>Make Use of Your Broken Weapons</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.55.19.67-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>No matter how good you are at weapon management in Blades of Fire, there will come a time when a weapon breaks and cannot be repaired. In the first few hours of the game, your only option will be to recycle the weapon to get back some of the materials you used to forge it, but as soon as you meet Glinda, you will have another option to use your broken weapons to get items. After meeting the character, you will unlock the Reputation system, which makes weapons become more valuable the more enemies they kill. Weapons with high enough reputation can be offered to Glinda to obtain a lot of units of any material at once, which is a big help later in the game when the rarest Steel requires a lot of materials. As such, if you need a lot of a specific material, the better option is to offer a broken weapon to Glinda. Otherwise, recycling could be the way to go if you need multiple materials.</p>
<h2>Always finish your enemies with Heavy Attacks</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.45.56.14-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides unleashing light attacks, Aran can perform powerful heavier attacks by holding down any of the four attack buttons. While these attacks are slower than the regular light attacks, they are considerably more powerful and can dismember enemies if they deplete their HP bar. This is extremely important to keep in mind against bosses with multiple health bars, as it is possible to temporarily disable some of their abilities by using heavy attacks when they are stunned, but it's something to keep in mind for regular enemies as well. Finishing enemies with a heavy attack makes the weapon earn increased Reputation, which is something you should always do to obtain large quantities of materials as outlined above. Durability heavily decreases with these attacks, however, so you should always strive to hit a balance to avoid finding yourself without any usable weapon at hand.</p>
<h2>Learn the Forging Mechanics</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.52.31.28-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The weapon forging mechanics in Blades of Fire are extremely important, and fully understanding them can really make a difference, no matter where you are in the game. While picking the right Steel or Wood is a straightforward process, as the game highlights how much the weapon changes depending on your selection, the actual forging of the weapons is not as simple. As a general rule, you want to be able to repair your weapons as much as possible, so you should be striving for the highest possible quality at all times. Resources are limited, and can take a while to farm, so you want a weapon forged with the best possible Steel to last you as long as possible.</p>
<h2>Don't be Afraid to Lower the Difficulty</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.55.34.80-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As I highlighted in my review, Blades of Fire's level design gets complex very easily, and with so many multiple paths and shortcuts, it is very easy to get lost. There's a way, however, to highlight where to go for the next story objective in the main options menu, but only if you are playing the game at the Iron or Bronze difficulties. Still, you can use this waypoint system even in Steel difficulty by lowering the difficulty, selecting the Show Objective option, and increasing it again. You will not earn a specific achievement by doing this, but it's a worthwhile tradeoff for a first playthrough, in my opinion, as exploration can really get frustrating without proper guidance, especially at the start of the adventure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/my-famicase-exhibition-2025-meteor-tokyo-japan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every year, <a href="https://super-meteor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meteor in Tokyo</a> run a cool little exhibition where artists imagine an interesting/funny video game and design a cartridge for it, even though the game itself does not exist. Yet as you're about to see, with the 2025 show now up and running, many of them are so good that you will <em>want </em>them to exist.</p><p>The exhibition, called Famicase, has been running for <em>ages</em>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/famicase-meteor-art-famicom-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is the 19th successive year I've covered it</a>, and it never fails to disappoint. Some of the games look neat, others look terrifying, others still (often my faves) are simply shining examples of video game typography.</p><p>There are actual cartridges hanging on Meteor's walls if you're lucky enough to be able to visit in person, but since most of us can't, the best we can do is<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://famicase.com/25/index.html" target="_blank">&nbsp;admire them from afar courtesy of Meteor's online showcase. You can view them all there, and definitely should</a> (you can also <a href="https://super-meteor.com/?pid=186219428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buy a book!</a>), but for now I'd also just like to highlight some of my favourites:</p><figure><figcaption>By Ena Kim | Home: "It's a warm spring day and life at the cottage is full of wonder."</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>By Trevor Bassett | RING: "RING is an ambient puzzle game that invites you to explore and uncover hidden images. Reveal a deeper meaning as a narrative slowly emerges as you find out where, or who, the rings are coming from."</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>By burisan2023 | エイシャキング・ストーリー</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>By Samuel Weeks | re-visit: "'Remember everything you lost.' High-school friends traverse a fractured timeline when photographs become portals to forgotten memories.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>By Fei Jingshan | Journey of the Animals: "A long time ago, some animals wanted to explore the true meaning of life. Like the legend of their ancestors, they embarked on a fantastic journey to the West. Through this game, you will become one of them and enjoy the unique magical story."</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>By Skyler Holt | Special Spirit: "Each thinks themselves special, but truly you are--or were. What has happened? Once radiant, the glow has now dimmed. Once mighty, but now diminished. Will you awaken from this slumber of the soul? You are needed. You are missed. Please return to us, Special Spirit."</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>By Jeff Wiggins | RE-FORM: "Forma Series 03 ̶ RE-FORM. An artmaking puzzle game where players have to reassemble fragments to create collages.
