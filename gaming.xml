            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Guerilla Games and NCSoft finally announced the Horizon-based MMORPG that <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-game-reportedly-in-the-works-supposedly-made-by-sony-and-ncsoft/">we've been hearing about for years</a> today with the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/">Horizon Steel Frontiers,</a> which is coming to PC and mobile sometime within the next couple of years. But that's not the only multiplayer Horizon game that Guerilla has on the go.</p>



<p>While previous rumors about an upcoming Horizon multiplayer game <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-multiplayer-early-footage/">seem to have been focused on the coming MMORPG</a>, Guerilla's next major release, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, is a separate multiplayer game that the company is working on.</p>



<p>"<em>Just to clear up some confusion I've seen</em>," Schreier writes in a post on Bluesky, "<em>the newly announced NCSoft Horizon MMO is different from the multiplayer Horizon game that's in development at Guerilla Games. That one is Guerilla's next big project</em>."</p>







<p>Unlike Steel Frontiers, which is coming to PC and mobile, and not PS5, this new multiplayer title from Guerilla will likely not be skipping Sony's console, though it will still likely be a multi-platform release to at least PC players.</p>



<p>Now that Steel Frontiers has had its official reveal, hopefully this other project that the studio is working on isn't too far behind. Guerilla's studio director Jan-Bart van Beek made it clear a couple of short years ago that the team is continuing with the Horizon franchise for a long while, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-developer-has-16-plans-for-the-franchise-highlights-challenges-in-creating-the-multiplayer-game/">that they have scores of ideas on where to take it, new multiplayer games being just one of those avenues</a>. </p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/820289/netflix-casual-party-game-multiplayer-tetris-pictionary</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix%E2%80%99s-new-era-of-tv-games-starts-now.1353115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Netflix’s next stab at gaming is here. Starting today you’ll be able to play a number of multiplayer party games on your TV using your phone as a controller. To start, Netflix is offering <em>Boggle Party</em>, <em>Party Crasher: Fool Your Friends</em>, <em>Lego Party</em>, <em>Pictionary: Game Night</em>, and <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>. A social deduction game based on the <em>Knives Out</em> series, <em>Dead Man’s Party: A Knives Out Game</em>, is also part of this new slate but will launch at a later time.</p><p>The streaming platform’s approach to gaming has been unfocused, with the company bouncing between being a boutique development studio while also being a platform for premium and exclusive mobile gaming experiences. Offering party games on your TV seems like a better fit — one that could allow Netflix to finally find its gaming footing.</p><div><p>TV-supported party games have been a long time coming. Netflix announced that it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23411684/netflix-cloud-gaming-studio-pc-tv">working on cloud streaming technology for games</a> back in 2022 before beta testing began in 2023. Now it’s here, rolling out with multiplayer games that the company hopes will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350690/netflix-cloud-gaming-plans-co-op-party-games">become a new version of family board game night</a>. And while it sounds a bit cheesy, it makes sense.</p></div><p>The big video game publishers have acknowledged that their competitors are not only each other but other attention-hoggers like TikTok and Instagram. Netflix, it seems, has cued in on this too. And a great way to keep people on your app — which is the whole reason Netflix began this gaming initiative — is to give people something to gather around and do.</p><p>Netflix has also shown a bit of savvy in the kind of games it’s offering. This year has seen an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/756236/content-warning-coop-games-nintendo-switch-2-lethal-company">explosion of popularity in co-op games</a> that have less urgency and more casual cooperation elements to them than a traditional multiplayer game; think <em>Peak</em>, not <em>Fortnite</em>. The games Netflix is offering are poised to take advantage of that rising trend. <em><em>Boggle Party</em></em> and <em><em>Pictionary: Game Night</em></em> are video game-ified versions of popular board games, while <em><em>Tetris Time Warp</em></em> and <em><em>Lego Party</em></em> are just good old-fashioned video games based on widely known properties made easily accessible, no console required.</p><p>Netflix’s gaming initiative has had a few fits and starts and was primarily focused on mobile gaming. Starting in 2021 it began acquiring video game studios, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699241/netflix-night-school-acquisition-oxenfree"><em>Oxenfree</em> developer Night School</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/31/23433526/netflix-spry-fox-cozy-gaming-studio-acquisition">Spry Fox</a>, makers of the <em>Cozy Grove</em> game series. It also spun up its own studio — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/17/23686693/netflix-joseph-staten-aaa-game-halo-veteran">staffed with game development veterans who worked on <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Halo</em>, and <em>God of War</em></a> — with designs of making its own AAA console game. Alongside that, Netflix was the exclusive mobile home for a number of critically acclaimed games, including <em>Monument Valley</em>, <em>Poinpy</em>, and <em>Hades</em>. With these offerings, Netflix seemed to signal that it wanted its gaming initiative to appeal to more than the casual set.</p><div><p>But then, mirroring wider trends in the gaming industry, Netflix began shutting studios down. In 2024, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">closed the AAA studio</a> before it could release or even announce the game it was working on. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">the streamer shut down another of its subsidiaries</a>, Boss Fight Entertainment, shortly after releasing <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>, a game Netflix frequently <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/squid-game-by-the-numbers-how-player-456-took-over-the-world">praised for its popularity</a>. Most of those critically acclaimed games are gone too, with Netflix <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692227/netflix-games-delisting-hades-braid-gaming-strategy">removing a number of third-party titles from its service</a>, which seemed to catch some games’ developers by surprise.</p></div><p>All these events seem to indicate Netflix’s current approach to gaming wasn’t working out. The things the streamer was throwing at the wall weren’t sticking (or at least weren’t sticking enough to justify the expense). An interview with Alain Tascan, president of Netflix games, confirmed as much. “We need to find our voice,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">he said to <em>The Verge </em>earlier this year</a>, sharing that the strategy going forward would be to “readjust and focus on fewer areas with more intention.”</p><div><p>“We need to find our voice.”</p></div><p>Tascan described four areas of focus: games for kids, narrative games tied to Netflix IP, games that have large, widespread appeal, and multiplayer party games. Netflix already has the first three, and with cloud multiplayer gaming, the final component has arrived. This refocus reflects similar moves over at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/711575/netflix-games-apple-arcade-mobile-games">Apple Arcade</a> and Amazon’s game service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789658/amazon-luna-cloud-relaunch-gamenight-social-gaming">Luna</a>, which also started out with big-name titles and ambitions before switching to more casual offerings.</p><p>Netflix clearly wants to transform its perception from a streaming service into something more. In addition to all these traditional gaming offerings, it’s also tooling around with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/820124/netflix-puzzled-daily-puzzle-game-app-ios-android-tudum-web">daily puzzle games</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/803097/netflix-games-interactive-experiences-real-time-voting-q3-2025-earnings">interactive events</a> akin to game shows — complete with cash prizes — to keep people on the Netflix wheel beyond just watching TV. With these games, Netflix is no longer where people go to watch <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> for the 57th time, but something that’s trying to be a daily fixture in its users’ lives.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/820289/netflix-casual-party-game-multiplayer-tetris-pictionary]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration-the-namco-legendary-pack</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration-the-namco-legendary-pack-switch-another-brilliant-digital-eclipse-dlc.1353091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In my review for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration_expanded_edition">Atari 50</a>’s ‘<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration_-_the_first_console_war">The First Console War</a>’ DLC, I said that Digital Eclipse had “seemingly completed its mission to present the most comprehensive interactive documentary on Atari possible”. Note the word “seemingly”! Yes, we’re back with <em>another</em> expansion – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration_-_the_namco_legendary_pack">The Namco Legendary Pack</a> – which adds a further 12 playable games to the mix along with a new documentary timeline observing the formation of Namco and its rapid ascent in Japan.</p>
<p>Once again, we have a selection of interviews, archival footage, documents, and 3D models to peruse in a timeline covering events from 1955 all the way to 1986. We get to see photos of a 29-year-old Masaya Nakamura as he founded the company that would later become Namco, while Atari founder Nolan Bushnell provides key anecdotal context as to why his company wound up selling its Atari Japan subsidiary to Namco a little over a year after its formation.</p>
<p>Tod Frye, the designer of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/pac-man">Pac-Man</a> on Atari VCS, provides a few key interviews and gives a glimpse into the game’s development process, including why the ghosts ‘flicker’. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_galaxian">Galaxian</a> designer Mark Ackerman also crops up to give wonderful context behind the creation of the game alongside Glenn Parker. That’s pretty much it in terms of interviews, but there’s a ton of commercials, posters, photos, and artwork for every game included.</p>
<p>I especially enjoyed looking at some of the unused artwork, particularly the original box art for Pac-Man on the VCS. Designed by Hiro Kimura, it depicts our hero as a shiny robot wearing a green vest top, while the ghosts are instead giant, slobbering monsters. It’s a shame this wasn’t utilised in some way, to be honest. Similarly, we’re treated to a stunning look at the original Galaxian artwork for the 5200 from artist Jim Kelly, and I mourn the fact that we just don’t get covers like this anymore.</p>
<p>In terms of playable titles, there's Pac-Man, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/dig_dug">Dig Dug</a>, Galaxian, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/galaga">Galaga</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/xevious">Xevious</a> across various Atari platforms. This is perhaps a first for Atari 50, but this DLC doesn’t include any duds – every game is well worth playing. Dig Dug would go on influence the enduring <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/mr_driller">Mr. Driller</a> series, while Xevious is responsible for laying the groundwork for countless shmups to come, including <strong>RayForce</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/twinbee">TwinBee</a>.</p>
<p>Pac-Man is the star of the expansion, mind you, with variants available on 8-Bit, 2600, and 5200. It’s fascinating to see what kind of compromises Atari had to make to bring the arcade original to the VCS, while the 8Bit and 5800 versions amped up the quality in terms of visual presentation and audio. Plus, y’know… it’s Pac-Man. I could play Pac-Man all day.</p>
<p>I’d like to say that this is a perfect way to cap off the numerous expansions for Atari 50, but who knows if this is the end. There’s still so much history that hasn’t been touched, and while license restrictions will no doubt prove a huge barrier for Atari and Digital Eclipse, I sincerely hope there’s more to come.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration-the-namco-legendary-pack]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-mobile-app-membership-tiers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/insider-gaming-announces-mobile-app-alongside-new-membership-tiers.1353082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming is officially going mobile. After months of development and plenty of requests from readers, the Insider Gaming App is <strong>now available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.insidergaming.app">Android through Google Play</a>.</strong> The <strong>iOS version will follow next week</strong> on the App Store, giving players on both platforms a faster and more personal way to stay connected to the gaming world.</p>



<p>“The Insider Gaming App is not just the next evolution of Insider Gaming, but the next logical step in gaming media.” – <strong>Tom Henderson</strong></p>



<p>The goal was to create something that felt better than using a browser on your phone. Something quicker to load, easier to navigate, and designed around the way people actually read news on mobile.</p>







<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-a-better-way-to-browse-insider-gaming">A Better Way to Browse Insider Gaming</h2>



<p>Once you open it, the app immediately feels built for everyday use. It’s simple, fast, and puts everything in one place without extra clutter. Readers will find all of Insider Gaming’s reporting and features organized in a way that makes browsing more enjoyable.</p>



<p>Here are some of the features available at launch:</p>



<h3 id="h-app-features">App Features</h3>



<ul>
<li>Free to download and use</li>



<li>Fewer ads compared to the website</li>



<li>All gaming, esports, tech news, and guides in one place</li>



<li>Push notifications for the biggest breaking stories</li>



<li>A built-in gaming calendar to track upcoming releases and events</li>



<li>Available in English or Portuguese</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the major things we wanted to focus on with the app is a better experience, and I think we can all agree that ads are horrible but are unfortunately one of the few ways media outlets have left to stay afloat. While the Insider Gaming App will have ads by default, they will be limited, but relevant to what our readers want.</p>



<h2 id="h-premium-and-premium-plus-new-ways-to-personalize-the-experience">Premium and Premium Plus: New Ways to Personalize the Experience</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the app release, Insider Gaming is also introducing Premium and Premium Plus. These memberships are available exclusively through the app and give readers new tools, personalization options, and access to exclusive content.</p>



<p>“Almost everyone in gaming media has adopted the subscription model, and instead of just a Patreon, we wanted to bring something a little different to the table. Our Premium offering takes how you get your gaming news to the next level, allowing you to personalise what you want to read about. Do you only like Xbox news? No problem. Hate leaks and only want to get official news? Easily done with a couple of clicks. For people wanting to take their support to the next level, we also have Premium+, which currently has four time-exclusive podcasts, with more to come in the future.” <strong>– Tom Henderson</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-insider-gaming-premium-3-99-month">Insider Gaming Premium – $3.99/month</h3>



<p>Premium gives subscribers more control over how they read and follow the news. It includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ad-Free Experience</li>



<li>A personalized news feed based on selected platforms and genres</li>



<li>Custom push notifications based on your interests</li>



<li>A special Discord role with access to exclusive channels</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-insider-gaming-premium-plus-6-99-month">Insider Gaming Premium Plus – $6.99/month</h3>



<p>Premium Plus includes everything in Premium, along with a lineup of exclusive podcasts created just for members.</p>



<p>These shows include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Party Chat</strong>: a guest-focused podcast featuring journalists, creators, developers, and industry voices</li>



<li><strong>Insider Access</strong>: an extended after-show for Insider Gaming Weekly</li>



<li><strong>Access Grant’ed</strong>: a one-on-one interview series hosted by Senior Editor Grant Taylor Hill</li>



<li><strong>Straw and Order</strong>: Senior Editor Mike Straw tackles one major question in gaming and delivers his final verdict</li>
</ul>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-thank-you-and-a-look-to-the-future">A Thank You And A Look To The Future</h2>



<p>The launch of the app is just the latest step in growing Insider Gaming to be the one-stop destination for all things gaming news. </p>



<p>More customization, new tools, expanded community features, and additional content formats are already in development for future updates.</p>



<p>“Launching a new website in an industry that was consolidating, turns out, wasn’t easy. But with a great team and a fantastic community, we’ve been able to build something great in just over three years. What’s more exciting is that we have a lot more to give, and I can’t wait for everyone to experience what we have been building for the past several months.” <strong>– Tom Henderson</strong></p>



<p>Lastly, the entire team at Insider Gaming wants to thank you, the community. Without your support, this isn’t possible at all. You want the best news and original reporting, and it’s our goal to bring even more of that in 2026 and beyond. Again, thank you for helping make Insider Gaming what it is today after just three years. We can’t wait to show you what else is in store.</p>



<p>The Insider Gaming App is available now on Google Play, and the iOS version will launch next week.</p>

      </div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ow0fd2/security_lockers_have_been_nerfed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a popular post on r/ArcRaiders</a>, the response appears to be positive. Most who've already unlocked the perk said that even though the Security Breach has been nerfed, they still find value in its rewards. Those who've waited to get it are happy to see a reduction in loot hoarding, while vowing to unlock it ASAP to reap the benefits.</p><p>Update 1.2.0 also fixes a handful of bugs. This includes animation glitches, audio discrepancies, map issues, and quest hang-ups. Elsewhere, the XP for looting Bastion and Bombardier ARC parts has been reduced, while the value for Launcher Ammo and Wolfpack Grenade has been increased, and various achievements should work now.</p><p>You can check out the full patch notes below.</p><h2>Arc Raiders Update 1.2.0 Patch Notes</h2><ul><li>Reduced character movement latency on the server to improve the "desync" problem where it looks like you get damaged even after being behind cover.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented players from completing quests involving multiple objectives or item collections within a single round.</li><li>Fixed various achievements not working correctly.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-far-cry-stock-announcement-delayed-2000644091</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-is-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-weirdest-delay-yet.1353061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Usually Ubisoft is delaying <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">its upcoming games</a>. Sometimes it delays <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/assassins-creed-valhallas-first-expansion-is-delayed-by-a-couple-of-weeks/">big updates to ones that are already out</a>. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen it delay its official quarterly earnings report and certainly not minutes after it was already due to be released. Did someone accidentally delete a spreadsheet or is the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> publisher getting ready to break some major news?</p> <p>Like every other publicly traded video game company, Ubisoft regularly releases quarterly updates on its financials and takes questions from investors and analysts on an earnings call. The latest round was supposed to go live today at around 12:00 p.m. ET, only it didn’t. Instead, minutes passed with no update as people prepared to join the conference call that’s traditionally helmed by CEO and cofounder Yves Guillemot.</p>

 <p>Then Ubisoft released its weirdest emergency press release ever. “Ubisoft announces the postponement of the release of its results for the first half of fiscal year 2025-26,” <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2A1sQVfdyeqe6FVBzu564u/1210887eef5e1047803696e934f993f0/Ubisoft_press_release_13_11_2025_EN_vF.pdf">it read</a>. “Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38, FR001400MA32, and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.”</p>

 <p>That’s a big last-minute change with no clear details on when things will be back to normal.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, this could imply an acquisition of sorts. Could also imply some accounting / financial issue. </p> <p>Just remember to freak the fuck out for the next few days and speculate as much as possible until they announce something.</p> <p>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1989023907932717437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Unclear why at this point but could indicate a major announcement related to the company,” wrote Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1989019828938764642">on X</a>. He noted that this could be a prelude to some big acquisition announcement, or it could signal a financial or accounting issue that requires extra time to address before accurate data can be supplied to the public.</p>

 <h2><em>The Division</em> and more could be for sale</h2> <p>It might be easier to assume the latter if not for what a weird time this is in general for Ubisoft. The long-time publisher recently entered into <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796">a $1.25 billion bailout</a> with Chinese conglomerate Tencent. It used that money to spin off a new entity run by the CEO’s son. After a slew of recent delays, there are no major new blockbuster releases for the company on the immediate horizon. The stock price is at its lowest point in over a decade.</p>

 <p>It certainly wouldn’t be shocking if Tencent, another big game company, or a “consortium” of various other investors used this opportunity to swoop in and try to buy the struggling publisher, or at least some big chunks of it. With its most lucrative franchises—<em>Assassin’s Creed</em>,<em> Far Cry</em>, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>—all snugly nestled within a new subsidiary called Vantage Studios, Ubisoft is trying to find a way to offload other big chunks to outside groups. Anybody interested in the <em>Splinter Cell</em> or <em>Prince of Persia</em> series as their remakes remain MIA?</p>

 <p>The company recently announced voluntary layoffs across its Swedish studios, which include Massive, the lead studio on the<em> Division</em> franchise. With Activision Blizzard gobbled up by Microsoft and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">EA sold to Saudi Arabia</a>, who can say what will happen next? I just hope <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744"><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></a> somehow survives.</p>

 <p><strong>Update 11/13/2025 2:36 p.m. ET:</strong> Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet sent an email, a copy of which was viewed by <em>Kotaku</em>, to rattled staff today trying to explain why he couldn’t explain what is going on:</p> <blockquote><p>Hello everyone, I wanted to let you know that we are taking extra time to finalize the closing of the semester, and as a result we will publish our first-half earnings results in the coming days instead of tonight. Due to legal regulations, we cannot share more information with you at this time.</p> <p>To limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay, we have asked Euronext to suspend the trading of our stock until the results are announced. We know this is likely to raise questions and drive media coverage. I encourage you to listen to the conference call – which will be available via the Investor section of our site – just after the results are released so that you have a more detailed view of our earnings. Thanks for your understanding.</p></blockquote> <p>The fate of thousands of Ubisoft developers is potentially up in the air as those who won’t be working on Vantage Studios projects face possible cost-cutting pressures or the uncertainty of their studios being sold to outside companies.</p>

      <p>In late October, Krafton–publisher of games like <em>PUBG</em>, <em>inZOI</em>,<em> </em>and the <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/subnautica-2/"><u>embattled</u></a> <em>Subnautica 2–</em>announced it would be going “<a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>AI first</u></a>,” an increasingly common buzzword for companies looking to get in on the AI boom before it goes bust. You’ll never believe this, but that move involves people losing their jobs.</p><p>Krafton said its pivot to AI would involve a “complete reorganization of the company's operational development system, placing AI at the center of problem solving,” according to a machine translation of its Korean announcement. The move also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-to-undergo-complete-reorganization-as-it-positions-itself-as-an-ai-first-company?ref=aftermath.site"><u>included</u></a> a $69.7 million investment in a GPU cluster, and an additional $20.8 million to support employees in “directly utilizing and applying various AI tools to their work.”&nbsp;</p><p>In early November, Krafton <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-04/gaming-pioneer-krafton-freezes-hiring-during-major-ai-push?ref=aftermath.site"><u>instituted a hiring freeze</u></a>, though this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>excluded</u></a> departments working on original IP or AI. Krafton CEO Bae Dong-geu <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-krafton-offers-voluntary-resignations-following-ai-first-investment/1100-6536185/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>said</u></a> at the time that “rather than reducing costs through AI First, individual productivity must increase at the company-wide level.” Well yeah, that makes sense; your company invests in the hot new tech that its creators keep promising will revolutionize your work, so <em>of course</em> you need to work harder to help it get there.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Business Korea</u></a> (as spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>) reported that the company has “begun offering resignation support to all employees.” Business Korea writes that the resignations would be voluntary, with severance based on years of employment.&nbsp;</p><p>A Krafton rep told Business Korea:</p><blockquote>The core purpose [of the reduction] is to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation… [T]he company plans to support members in autonomously deciding whether to continue the direction of change internally or expand externally.</blockquote><p>This is some spectacular business bullshit language. Framing those unwilling to turn their current jobs into whatever bastardized version of them would exist at an “AI first” company, or who cannot or will not bow to these increased productivity demands, as “embarking” or “expanding” on new “external” challenges is a great way to put the rug-pulling onus on employees rather than the company. And while I can appreciate buyouts as an alternative to <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-ai?ref=aftermath.site"><u>layoffs</u></a>, this “if you don’t like it, there’s the door” inherently acknowledges that Krafton is making a move it knows will be unpopular with its employees–you know, the people who did the work that <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-records-quarterly-revenue-of-krw-870-6-billion-in-q3-2025/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>gave Krafton</u></a> “record-high cumulative performance in the third quarter” of this year.</p><p>But all of this is simply how <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney/"><u>AI is manifesting in the real working world</u></a>, from <a href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-ai/"><u>Duolingo</u></a> to <a href="https://x.com/BenMullin/status/1943049108064993285?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>The Washington Post</u></a> to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/youtube-offers-voluntary-buyouts-as-company-reorganizes-around-ai.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>YouTube</u></a> and beyond. If AI doesn’t outright replace your job–or, more accurately, if your boss doesn’t decide to try to replace you with AI whether or not AI can actually do your job–then its <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-is-the-ultimate-forced-meme/"><u>inclusion</u></a> turns your job into something unrecognizable. At which point, maybe seeing yourself out is a better option, though in this current age of tech layoffs probably doesn’t feel nearly as sunny as “embarking on external challenges” makes it sound.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, we’re all still waiting on that <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity?ref=aftermath.site"><u>AI-powered utopia</u></a> Sam Altman and his ilk are promising while their software is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/us/openai-chatgpt-suicide-lawsuit-invs-vis?ref=aftermath.site"><u>convincing people</u></a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-suffering-chatgpt/"><u>kill themselves</u></a>.

		<p>The survival game Solarpunk has been delayed to 2026, developer Cyberwave has announced. The team has decided to the delay Solarpunk as more development time is needed to address improvements and stability for the multiplayer side of the game. Other improvements revolve around Solarpunk’s inventory system, the piloting of airships, and improved performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Solarpunk - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qy41Qv7Ut14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Cyberwave detailed the improvements it is working on for Solapunk and those are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Inventory management:</b>&nbsp;Players really want “craft from storage,” sorting options, and bigger stack sizes.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Airship controls:&nbsp;</b>Some found flying a bit too sensitive and wished for an autopilot option for long trips.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Early-game pacing:</b>&nbsp;Cotton grows too slowly and tools break too fast, making the early hours grindy.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Late-game goals:&nbsp;</b>Players want more content, quests, and reasons to keep exploring.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Performance:</b>&nbsp;Thunderstorms caused FPS drops and lightning bugs that sometimes hit players unfairly.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Animal systems:&nbsp;</b>Some pathfinding issues caused animals to get stuck and stop producing.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Controller support:</b>&nbsp;Needs more polish to fully support controller and Steam Deck play.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Tutorials:</b>&nbsp;Players asked for clearer explanations for systems like electricity and crop sheltering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ahead of Solarpunk’s release, there will be a multiplayer playtest in which players can work together co-operatively. Cyberwave will be gradually increasing the number of co-op players allowed into the playtest once it goes live, and a date is yet to be given for the multiplayer playtest. Following that playtest, Cyberwave will go and address other bugs and issues that get raised by players so Solarpunk can be properly polished ahead of its release. A release window is not yet confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 13/11/2025:</strong> A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cfo-internal-memo/">Insider-Gaming</a> includes an internal email from the chief financial officer at Ubisoft, Frederick Duguet, who claims that the stoppage of trading was done "<em>to limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay</em>."</p>



<p>Here's the full email, per Insider-Gaming: </p>



<p>"<em>Hello everyone</em>,</p>



<p><em>I wanted to let you know that we are taking extra time to finalize the closing of the semester, and as a result we will publish our first-half earnings results in the coming days instead of tonight.</em></p>



<p><em>Due to legal regulations, we cannot share more information with you at this time. To limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay, we have asked Euronext to suspend the trading of our stock until the results are announced. We know this is likely to raise questions and drive media coverage. I encourage you all to listen to the conference call – which will be available via the Investor section of our site — just after the results are released so that you have a more detailed view of our earnings.</em></p>



<div><p><em>Thanks for your understanding.</em></p><p><em>Fred</em>"</p></div>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Suddenly, and just 15 minutes before the financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year were meant to go live, Ubisoft not only <a href="https://live.euronext.com/en/product/equities/FR0000054470-XPAR#CompanyPressRelease-12847243">delayed the release of its results but also halted the trading of its shares and bonds</a> ahead of the market opening tomorrow on November 14, 2025.</p>



<p>There's been no comment from Ubisoft explaining the delay or why it stopped trading its shares and bonds, but such a sudden stoppage and delay don't exactly indicate that everything is smooth sailing at the company. What it does indicate is that there's likely something major going on within the company right now, potentially something as major as an acquisition.</p>



<p><em>Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38, FR001400MA32, and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days</em>," the company said in a statement. "<em>Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ubisoft just postponed its earnings report and halted the trading of its shares. Unclear why at this point but could indicate a major announcement related to the company. <a href="https://t.co/MRhTNYykIZ">pic.twitter.com/MRhTNYykIZ</a></p>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1989019828938764642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's no secret that Ubisoft has had a turbulent few years. Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">several instances</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">layoffs at the company</a>, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-producer-leaves-ubisoft-and-game-industry-after-xdefiant-servers-shut-down/">had a few </a>of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-sequel-recently-canceled-rumor-ubisoft/">big titles in recent years</a> result in <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-5-million-players-ubisoft-lower-performance/">big commercial misses</a>, with its one saving grace <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-europes-best-selling-new-game-2025/">being the success of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. </p>



<p>The new subsidiary that it opened alongside Tencent, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">officially called Vantage Studios,</a> is seemingly a result of its commercial woes, since it included a major investment from Tencent, and, specifically for the company's chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, allowed the Guillemot family to retain control of the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disgruntled-ubisoft-investor-calls-on-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-as-shares-slump">and held off calls for the company to go private</a>.</p>



<p>But those calls might not have been held off for long, since this sudden delay could very well be due to Ubisoft getting set to announce that it has been acquired, either by Tencent or by another large entity. We know that there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">discussions about a Ubisoft buyout</a> following the struggles it has had recently, and now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">EA has begun that process with the Saudi Arabia PIF and the Consortium</a> of private equity investors, it could have been that Ubisoft shareholders used EA's purchase as fuel to campaign for Ubisoft to be acquired.</p>



<p>For now, this is all just speculation, but the sudden nature of the results release being delayed and the stoppage of trading, on top of everything else that has been going on with Ubisoft in the last few years, point to a major shift in the company due to be announced within the coming days. Or it could be nothing, we'll see.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/over-200-rockstar-employees-demand-reinstatement-of-fired-staffers.1353019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More than 200 Rockstar employees have signed a letter demanding that a number of colleagues recently fired for "misconduct" be reinstated, alleging union-busting.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, the letter requests the reinstatement of over 30 Rockstar employees who were let go from the company recently. All of the employees were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" rel="nofollow">involved in union activity</a>, leading Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) organizer Fred Carter to call the dismissals an "act of union-busting unprecedented in the games industry".</p>

<p>An anonymous employee, who was one of those recently fired, told Eurogamer that the firings constitute "a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting", and that it's "heartwarming" to see colleagues supporting them and "holding management to account".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-employee-letter.jpg?itok=1sM_rcRP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-employee-letter.jpg?itok=ux2hypHU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hundreds of Rockstar employees have demanded the reinstatement of several recently-fired colleagues.</figcaption></figure><p>Rockstar and parent company Take-Two's side of things is that the employees were fired for "misconduct"; the two studios suggest that the employees in question were involved in leaking key information about the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" rel="nofollow">recently-delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, a claim that the IWGB disputes enough to hit Rockstar <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-issues-legal-claims-against-rockstar-over-unfair-dismissal-of-staff/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">with a legal complaint</a>.</p>

<p>The news comes after the aforementioned delay to&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>, which is the second time the game has been pushed back; it was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">slated for a May release</a>, but was delayed in order to give Rockstar more time to work on it.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>does eventually launch, it's likely to break sales records across the industry; Take-Two says the game will constitute an "unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience", and some investors are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-will-clear-7-6-billion-in-first-60-days-investment-firm-predicts/1100-6533204/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">predicting</a> revenues upwards of $7 billion within the first two months of release.</p>

<p>Whether that figure is accurate or not, it's likely that&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>will surpass its predecessor in sales and revenue terms, and since&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-will-clear-7-6-billion-in-first-60-days-investment-firm-predicts/1100-6533204/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earned</a> $800 million in its first day,&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>is going to be massive.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see what comes of these Rockstar employees' demands. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>Many Nintendo Switch 2 owners who use third-party docks were in for a rude surprise after updating their consoles earlier this week to the latest firmware. It seems the Switch 2 is no longer compatible with these devices, leaving many players frustrated and fearful of the future.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-system-update-2100-available-here-are-the-patch-notes">On November 11, Nintendo released Switch 2 update 21.0.0</a>, which added some nice quality-of-life features, including the ability to turn off autoplaying videos in the eShop and some helpful tweaks to GameChat and new icons that indicate if a game is digital or physical. All good stuff. However, not long after the patch, players began reporting that many third-party docks were no longer working with the updated Switch 2.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1ouoalk/some_third_party_switch_2_docks_stopped_working/">On Reddit,</a> <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/507478-nintendo-switch-2/81068963">GameFAQs</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/160110789401691/posts/1089183309827763/">other places online</a>, you can find many, <em>many&nbsp;</em>Switch 2 owners complaining that after the new update, their third-party docks no longer transmit video to their TVs or are now far more finicky and require restarts to function again. “Can confirm my 2nd (3rd party) dock in our living room just stopped working as well right after today’s update. A full power cycle did not fix it for me,” posted one Reddit user. “I finally got around to ordering a dock cable for travel, it arrived today. Plugged it in, happy it worked right out of the box. Launched a game, update alert, update, cable’s borked,” said another Reddit poster. “I’m using the GuileKeys folding dock, and the new update broke compatibility with it. I am not sure if this dock can be updated. I have messaged the seller,” claimed another Redditor.</p>

 <p>YouTuber AustinJohnPlays <a href="https://youtu.be/QrBCQTmb9SU">tested out two different Switch 2 dock dongles</a> and found that once he updated Nintendo’s console, both stopped working.</p>  <p>So it seems clear that this new Switch 2 update did <em>something</em>, and now a ton of third-party docks that worked before are no longer compatible. We’ve known since the Switch 2 launched earlier this year that Nintendo was going to be more restrictive with the Switch 2’s USB-C connection, with <a href="https://nsaneforums.com/news/technology-news/how-nintendo-locked-down-the-switch-2%E2%80%99s-usb-c-port-and-broke-third-party-docking-r30020/">testing showing that it isn’t quite as open and universal as you’d expect</a> from a USB connection. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">This caused headaches for third-party manufacturers</a>, but they did eventually figure out how to get their docks working with Switch 2’s odd USB-C restrictions. But it now seems like Nintendo has, intentionally or by accident, changed something and, in the process, broken many of these devices.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Nintendo about the Switch 2 update.</p> <p>Regardless of intent, for many Switch 2 users who relied on a third-party dock for various reasons or who liked having one set up on a second TV, this situation has made them nervous to buy another dock. It also means that if your Switch 2 dock breaks, you have to rely on Nintendo for a new one. Sure, your existing third-party dock might work for a bit, but there’s no telling how long it will be before another Nintendo update bricks it. And in the end, it works out for Nintendo as it means people are forced to buy their dock. That’s not a huge problem in 2025. But in 10 years or so, it could become a hassle.</p>

                <p>You can now beam <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-survivors/" data-ref-id="5000-544864">Vampire Survivors</a> directly into your eyeballs, as developer Poncle's indie-bullet-hell sensation is out now on a new platform: VR.</p><p dir="ltr">More specifically, it's available for the Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest 3S, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 2, with a new trailer inviting players to "be the bullet hell, on your face."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDAAEYBvq3E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KDAAEYBvq3E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This version of Vampire Survivors will come with two of the game's DLC expansions, Legacy of the Moonspell and Tides of the Foscari, built in. Both expansions add additional stages, characters, weapons, and enemies for players to experiment with. <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/vampire-survivors-vr/7991347610955592/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vampire Survivors VR</a>, as a result, sports a slightly higher price tag of $10, compared to $5 on platforms like Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">Other than that, Vampire Survivors VR looks to be exactly the game players have come to know and love. Equip multiple weapons, level up, collect gold, purchase upgrades, and see how long you can last against the vampiric hordes. It's an appealing formula for a reason, and one that has been copied by numerous other games since Vampire Survivors first released in 2021 but doesn't make the original any less special.</p><p dir="ltr">For those looking for their next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-games-like-vampire-survivors/2900-7118/" data-ref-id="2900-7118">Survivors-style game</a>, Poncle is working alongside developer Auroch Digital on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-survivors-announced-and-its-basically-grimdark-vampire-survivors/1100-6535908/" data-ref-id="1100-6535908">Warhammer Survivors</a>. The game will use the Vampire Survivors engine but feature enemies, weapons, and worlds from both the Warhammer fantasy and Warhammer: 40,000 sci-fi universes. Warhammer Survivors is slated to release in 2026 on PC.</p>

                <p>Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene, best known for creating the landmark battle royale game PUBG, outlined an ambitious plan for his development studio to produce three ambitious titles, including one that aims to support 100v100-player multiplayer matches.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-creator-brendan-playerunknown-greene-is-planning-a-new-multiplayer-fps" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Greene detailed the roughly 10-year plan for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creators-new-game-sort-of-revealed-at-the-gam/1100-6472202/" data-ref-id="1100-6472202">his studio, which was established in 2019</a> and is simply called PlayerUnknown Productions. The first game from the development team is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creators-three-game-plan-starts-with-a-survival-game-with-millions-of-maps/1100-6528255/" data-ref-id="1100-6528255">Prologue: Go Wayback, a single-player survival roguelike</a> that tasks you with navigating worlds generated through machine-learning technology. It'll be available in early access starting November 20. Greene has stated in the past that he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-thinks-players-will-initially-hate-his-next-game/1100-6529642/" data-ref-id="1100-6529642">expects players to hate the game at first</a>.</p><p>The second planned game from the studio "aims to test limited multiplayer, maybe up to 100 versus 100 players," Greene told Eurogamer. Describing the untitled project as "more of an FPS/RTS mix," the game would test terrain generation, NPC interactions, and network protocols on large scales.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuQvsF_qovw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zuQvsF_qovw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Then, the studio's third game would be a more creative title, taking concepts from the first two games and allowing players to "create their own planets" for various uses, like a player-created FPS game, for example.</p><p>At this time, the second game exists as "general high-level plans," but it will use PlayerUnknown Productions' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_CkGSUzBOE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proprietary engine Melba</a>, which uses machine-learning tools (otherwise known as AI) to create Earth-like planets in real time.</p><p>According to Greene, the studio has "a general idea of how long it will take to get to Game Two" with the expectation of working on it for "another two, three, four years, maybe longer." Greene described the larger three-game project as a 10-year plan.</p><p>Greene has been far removed from PUBG: Battlegrounds for some time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-brendan-greene-leaves-krafton-to-form-new-studio/1100-6495802/" data-ref-id="1100-6495802">leaving PUBG developer Krafton in 2021</a> to focus on his new projects.</p><p>Large-scale multiplayer projects like Greene's proposed title are a rarity these days; battle royales generally have 60 to 120 players on the same map, while modern shooters like Battlefield 6 only support up to 64 players max in a match. Old-school PlayStation 3 players might remember MAG, which supported 128v128 matches, but PlayerUnknown Productions' game certainly has different technical ambitions with its world generation.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft is currently holding a call with its investors, and 15 minutes before the call began, the French company issued a rare delay to the release of its quarterly earnings release and halted trading on its shares, a fairly alarming move that has got some people online wondering what's going on at the publisher.</p>
<p>According to an unexpected November 13 press release, the company has decided to postpone sharing its earnings "until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results." Ubisoft requests that Euronext (a European exchange market) to halt trading until further notice.</p>
<p>The publisher's statement reads:</p>
<blockquote>Ubisoft announces the postponement of the release of its results for the first half of fiscal year 2025-26. Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38, FR001400MA32, and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.</blockquote>
<p>The suspension will remain in place until the company publishes the delayed results "in the coming days", Ubisoft announced in said in a statement shared with both <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/ubisoft-delays-half-year-results-requests-trading-suspension-2025-11-13/">Reuters</a> and posted online to various social media channels.</p>
<p>The motives for why the company has made this move are currently unclear. Well-known analyst for Nico Partners and online personality, Daniel Ahmad, notes that "this could imply an acquisition of sorts", or "could [...] imply some accounting / financial issue." </p><p>If you're wondering if Ubisoft is doing this because of broader market conditions, it's worth noting that whilst markets are in a downward trend today, it's only by about 1% in tech/financials markets (at time of writing, 6pm on 13th October). The most simple answer? Today’s earnings report is going to be spicy, and is liable to cause a big swing in the price of Ubisoft shares. In the current call, it's possible investors will discover additional info that will have an impact on business decsions they'll want to make.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on this story, and update you when more information reveals itself.</p>

<p>One such event is the <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/">Indie Game Awards</a>, a developer-focused awards show centred on — you guessed it — indie games, which has today revealed its final award nominees across 18 different categories.</p>
<p>The categories cover everything from 'Achievement in Accessibility', to 'Bite-Sized Game', 'Community Management', to 'Emotional Impact'. The granddaddy of them all, as you might expect, is 'Game of the Year', and this year's nominee list is practically bursting with wonderful entries that you can try on Switch right now.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zpyvkn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

There are also some tasty titles that we'd <em>love</em> to see come to Switch 2 in the future, like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/">Consume Me</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2756920/Keep_Driving/">Keep Driving</a>, or indie darlings <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a>.</p>

On December 2nd you’ll be able to play <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> and it’s zombified standalone DLC <em>Undead Nightmare </em>for free as long as you have a Netflix subscription. The news broke when prolific video game news hound <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m5jkjanx6k2r">Wario64 found listings</a> for the game on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/red-dead-redemption-netflix/id6743944297">iOS</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.netflix.NGP.Kamo%26pli%3D1" rel="sponsored">Android</a> store.</p><p>And it seems like Netflix isn’t the only one that’ll let you ride horses with John Marsten. Wario64 also found that <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> has appeared on the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/">ESRB website</a> with ratings for the PS5, Xbox Series, and the Switch 2.

<p>This DLC was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-is-pining-for-the-fjords-with-a-nordic-expansion">back in January 2024</a>, and as it shuffles out of SCS Software's ever-busy DLC pipeline, it'll leave some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-years-after-teasing-buses-were-coming-to-euro-truck-simulator-2-they-finally-arrive">coaches</a> and a recently revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-is-motoring-off-to-ireland-with-an-expansion-being-worked-on-alongside-a-uk-revamp">trip to Ireland</a> waiting in the traffic queue.

<p>"We can't wait for you to put your truck to work in the breathtaking lands of northern Scandinavia! Dozens of beautifully recreated cities and towns across Norway, Sweden, and Finland are ready to welcome you, with hundreds of depots prepared to receive your deliveries and load your trailer - setting you off on your next unforgettable journey," SCS wrote in their <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/11/nordic-horizons-release-date-video.html">release date announcement blog</a>.</p><p>There are a couple of existing preview videos they've put out if you want a driver's seat view of what to expect from Nordic Horizons' trips. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gILr7wP-2gg">One</a> trucks from a lay-by near the Norwegian city of Tromsø through to the Swedish town of Karesuando, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qatq90rjQM">the other</a> heads across Norway from Andenes right at the northern tip to Svolvær in the west.</p>
<p>So, there you go. Huge news for fans of the northern lights and big lorries that love chugging along scenic routes on brisk wintery mornings. If you've not already, you can wishlist the DLC on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2780810/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2__Nordic_Horizons/#game_area_purchase">Steam</a> to drop in as soon as it drops. I'll certainly be adding it to my list of things to give a go when I've got some open road.</p>

            <p>Lies Of P publishers Neowiz – gosh, perilously close to writing Lies Of Publishers, there! - have revealed that they have seven PC games in development, including their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/of-course-lies-of-p-is-getting-a-sequel-after-selling-a-million-copies">already announced Lies of P sequel</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>As shared in <a href="https://cdn.neowiz.com/neowiz-site/assets/ir-library/3Q25_NWZ-IR-PPT_EN-itjp3znq.pdf">their latest investor presentation</a>, Neowiz have several PC and console projects listed on a slide intimidatingly labelled “global expansion”. These include a new life sim, a “survival action adventure”, a new soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Kay Lee, creative director of free-to-play MMORPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vindictus">Vindictus</a>, and a narrative-based RPG from Seungho Jin, director for audition show mystery Buried Stars.
</p>
<p>That’s in addition to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfeyes-new-first-person-rpg-is-an-evolution-of-prey-and-dishonored-featuring-mechs-magnets-and-a-continuous-world">the new immersive sim from Weird West developers Wolfeye</a>, and a “noir west CRPG” from Warsaw-based Zakazane Studios. All this plus Lies Of P 2, or whatever they eventually call it. I feel it would have worked out more elegantly if they’d called the first one Lie of P? 
</p>
<p>If you’ve had it up to here with lying peas, and you’re not wowed by any of the strictly hush-hush endeavours above, you might prefer to read about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-game-from-the-lies-of-p-studio-sounds-like-it-might-just-fill-a-dead-space-shaped-hole-in-my-heart">Round 8’s new sci-fi survival horror game</a>. We know nuffink about it, but the thought of the crew behind Git Gud Pinocchio doing a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> seems appetising.
