<p>The sequel to the incredibly popular deck-building roguelike Slay The Spire was officially announced back in April, 2024, and now almost two years later, its release date has officially been announced. </p>







<p>However, that comes with a major caveat: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a> is first releasing in Early Access, with an official full release date still unconfirmed. But if you’re eager to tackle the mysteries of the Spire, then you won’t have to wait long, as Early Access is right around the corner.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date">What Is The Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will you play as? Image by Mega Crit.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mega Crit announced that Slay The Spire 2 will enter Early Access on March 5, 2026, though the full release date remains unknown. </strong></p>



<p>Whilst it might sound confusing to some, the original Slay The Spire was actually released in the same way. It arrived in Early Access, and after almost two years’ worth of community-led finetuning and balancing, the game was officially released as the complete package.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>Mega Crit mentioned on Slay The Spire 2’s Steam page that they expect to follow a similar schedule with the sequel. So, if all goes according to plan, Slay The Spire 2 should ideally officially launch as a complete package by late 2027 or early 2028. Of course, these dates are speculation, so don’t put too much trust in them, but fingers crossed that it arrives sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><strong>You’ll want to be up and ready in the morning, as Slay The Spire 2 will be launching in Early Access on Steam at 10 AM PT on March 5.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>Of course, not everyone diving into Slay The Spire 2’s Early Access will be native to the PT time zone, so for everybody else, Insider Gaming has adjusted the release time for your convenience. If you don’t see your time zone, let a staff member know, and it’ll be added! </p>

Reflecting its core themes, it's everything a sequel should be: respectful of its legendary lineage, but not afraid to take it to exciting new places.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Couldn’t have put it better myself, and now’s a great time to jump on board ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-trilogy-remake"><u>the remake of the Ghost of Sparta’s earliest adventures,</u></a> which were recently confirmed to be in development (but are likely some ways off yet). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kratos isn’t alone, either.

            <p>The vibes are rotten out there if you work anywhere near video games. 2026 is yet another year off to a terrible start when it comes to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-laying-off-40-devs-at-studio-working-on-splinter-cell-remake-but-confirms-the-game-is-still-in-production">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">project cancellations</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-closes-acclaimed-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-despite-acknowledging-it-had-delivered-exceptional-experiences-for-the-playstation-community">studio closures that often don't make a lick of sense</a>. Despite all this, though, US consumer spending on video games has gone up year-on-year.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/us-video-game-spending-rose-3-in-january-driven-by-596m-from-subscription-services-us-monthly-charts">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, we've gotten a quick look at Circana's latest data on console and PC content spending during January 2026. The year-on-year rise was of 3% (getting it to $4.3 billion by last month). "This growth was driven by a 23% increase in non-mobile subscription services, generating $596 million in revenue." We'd been hearing for a while that, even after price increases across the board, premium subscription services were driving a lot of growth these days, and the data continues to back those assessments up.</p>
<p>"Hardware spend reached $248 million, up 16% compared to January 2025" despite PS5 (down 17%), Xbox Series X/S (down 27%), and Nintendo Switch (down 79%) all seeing substantial year-on-year declines. It's all explained by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>'s strong launch period and hold despite a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">slower-than-desirable Christmas season</a>. PS5 continued to be leading in the US market, though.</p>
<p>Perhaps more shocking (at least to disgruntled Call of Duty fans and outsiders) is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a> has been topping the charts during the January 2026 period. Its initial launch was well below Microsoft and Xbox's high expectations, but we're talking about CoD here, and the IP continues to be <em>the</em> rival to beat in the FPS space. It was followed by NBA 2K26, Madden NFL 26, and Minecraft. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Battlefield 6</a> dropped from No. 3 to No. 5" but continues to perform strongly after its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-sold-record-shattering-7-million-copies-in-3-days-giving-eas-shooter-franchise-its-best-ever-launch">killer launch</a> back in October.</p><p>Other highlights include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> sneaking into the Top 10 (from way down at No. 255!) after the release of its fantastic Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S ports. Shocking few gamers, "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> just made it into the Top 20, rising from No.68 after the second season of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-showrunner-teases-ron-perlman-role-in-future-seasons">Prime Video's adaptation</a>." Chances are the modern RPG classic will get another boost after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">Switch 2 port</a> arrives tomorrow, 24th February.</p>

            <p>Microsoft's new gaming CEO Asha Sharma has responded to concerns surrounding her background in AI, as well as her lack of previous gaming-related roles.</p>
<p>Sharma was announced to be taking over from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> following Friday's shock news that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox head would be retiring from Microsoft after nearly 40 years with the company</a>. Sarah Bond, who many had presumed would eventually succeed Spencer, also announced she would be leaving Xbox at this same time.</p>
<p>When word came out that Sharma would be taking over as Xbox's head of gaming, many raised concerns about her background in AI (Sharma was previously Microsoft's president of CoreAI). However, Sharma has now seeked to calm these concerns, stating to <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-xbox-games-ai-1236668829/">Variety</a> she has "no tolerance" for what she classifies as "bad" AI.</p>
<p>"AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be," Sharma told the publication, stating that industry needs new "growth engines". That said, the new Xbox head added "great stories are created by humans", and not by machines.</p><p>As for her lack of professional roles within the gaming sector specifically, on the announcement of her new position Sharma made "three commitments" to the Xbox community: "Great games", the "return of Xbox", and the "future of play". She has since affirmed that she wants Xbox to tell stories that make people "feel something" when they play, complete with "deep emotional resonance" and a "distinct point of view". Sharma cited Campo Santo's 2016 first-person mystery <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a> as a game that had this kind of impact on her.</p>
<p>Sharma admitted she had "a lot to learn" in her new role within the gaming industry, however she is committed to "being grounded in what the community is telling" Xbox. "I'm coming into gaming as a platform builder," she said, with her goal to "earn the right to be trusted by players and developers". She will do this by demonstrating "consistency" over time, Sharma added.</p>
<p>We can expect to hear more about what Xbox has in store next month, during the annual GDC conference, Sharma said, before teasing some bigger announcements to come during an Xbox Games Showcase this spring.</p>
<p>For more, over the weekend <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-president-sarah-bond-bids-farewell-to-xbox-staff">Sarah Bond shared her farewell to Xbox staff</a>, where said she will "remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition," but stressed, "this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally".</p>

            <p>Make sure the dildos are flying at half mast. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saints-row">Saints Row</a> 1 design director Chris Stockman has said he believes the series is "dead", following conversations with Embracer Group about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saints-rows-original-design-director-is-pitching-a-grounded-70s-open-world-prequel-with-absolutely-no-dildobats">his pitch for a prequel</a>. According to the developer, who currently heads VR studio Bit Planet Games, that chatter about a potential Saints Rowssurection post <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-close-volition-developer-of-red-faction-and-saints-row">Embracer's closing of Volition</a> has ended in the publishers ghosting Stockman.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Stockman's pitch for a Saints Row comeback - revolving around a trip back to the 70s to unearth how the series' gangs came to be via an adventure with a similar tone to the series first couple of entries - gained traction online late last year. The developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1ok2dh3/comment/nm7n1xa/">subsequently revealed</a> current series owners Embracer had expressed interest in hearing him out on it.</p>
<p>Sadly, the latest updates Stockman's offered in chats on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/598114267744698370/1450558651399147620/1461431635680559260">Bit Planet's Discord server</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-think-the-franchise-is-dead-says-saints-row-design-director">Europeanvideogamer</a>) don't paint a very rosy picture in terms of how his resuscitation efforts are working out. "I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately," he told one user during a January exchange. "I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it. I wish things were different. I tried my best to offer a path forward but they've ghosted me."</p>
<p>Also, in case you were wondering, Stockman isn't sure whether Saints Row newslady Jane Valderamma was based on Family Guy newslady Tricia Takanawa. I didn't need to tell you that, but it was the subject of that January Discord chat immediately prior to Stockman dropping the bombshell that he thinks Saints Row's gone the way of the dodo. Boy, sometimes things escalate quickly.</p><p>For what it's worth, the developer's subsequently emphasised in a comment on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/598114267744698370/1450558651399147620/1473450909504766115">February 17th</a> that the ball is still very much in Embracer's court if they want to license or contract the Saints Row series out to his studio. However, he says he's "done all I can do to try and make that happen".</p>
<p>So, things are looking bleak if you're holding out for a dildo-batless revival for Saints Row headed up by some series veterans.</p>

            <p>Grok, the generative AI chatbot on X (formerly Twitter), reportedly had an update delay because it wasn't a good enough expert on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. This came from its owner Elon Musk, who apparently was dissatisfied with his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8gz8g2qnlo">non-consentual nude creating</a>, formerly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g8r34nxeno">Hitler-praising</a>, tool.</p>
<p>This report comes from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-leadership-style-big-year-grok-ipo-spacex-2026-2">Business Insider</a>, which published a report into xAI following Musk's shift from head of the US Government's Department of Government Efficiency back to his prior role as CEO at various tech-based companies.</p>
<p>Business Insider wrote: "a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>,' according to people familiar with the matter."</p>
<p>Sources also told Business Insider that Musk had requested Grok learning about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> - one of his favourite games - a priority. To achieve this, Musk brought together a group of staff into a "war room", as Business Insider claims he does whenever there's a problem he deems urgent. One of these war room groups was dedicated to getting the impressionable AI chatbot to play perhaps the most toxic game of all time.</p><p>What is the purpose of having an generative AI chatbot play a game for you, who knows? Years ago, before the generative AI boom, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172612-ai-trained-on-3500-years-of-games-finally-beats-humans-at-dota-2/">one program was able to beat Dota 2 players after training on 3,500 hours of gameplay</a>. So it's not like this idea is particularly novel either.</p>
<p>If you're in the UK, your parliament recently <a href="https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/65027/grok-ai-generation-and-dissemination-of-sexually-explicit-and-nonconsensual-images-of-women-and-children-on-x">discussed the dissemination of sexually explicit and non-consensual images due to Grok's recent behavior</a>. This may lead to expansions of the Online Safety Act, so that it covers the output of AI chat bots.</p>

            <p>It's been a while since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unmade-bioshock-movie-had-two-game-endings-says-director">BioShock movie</a> was revived... only be stuck in limbo again. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-expect-that-netflix-bioshock-movie-any-time-soon-three-years-on-it-still-doesnt-have-a-finished-script">Slow progress is being made on a script</a>, however, and like many suspected, it seems that director Francis Lawrence's busy agenda has been the main thing preventing it from happening.</p>
<p>Since Netflix's take on the cursed project <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/netflix-bioshock-movie-announcement/">was announced</a> in February 2022, Lawrence has been busy working on two different Hunger Games prequels, The Long Walk, and even the tentative sequels to I Am Legend and Constantine. Now, via <a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/">Collider</a>, producer Roy Lee has teased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> <em>could</em> be the filmmaker's next big project after he's done with The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping's post-production later this year.</p>
<p>"We would have gotten it made a few years back, but then other movies got in the way, with one being The Long Walk and the other being The Hunger Games prequel, which comes out this December. We're just waiting for him to finish post-production, because he's going to be working on it through at least September, and then jump back into it," Lee openly admitted during a chat with Collider's Steve Weintraub. Many cinephiles and video game fans figured this could be the case, especially with the I Am Legend and Constantine sequels being far from locked, but it's reassuring to get a proper update from BioShock's producer.</p>
<p>Netflix and rights-holder Take-Two might also be pushing hard to get the ball rolling on the long-in-the-works adaptation pronto, as the fourth game in the series might get a nice boost after former Gears of War and Diablo head <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-studio-cloud-chamber-undergoes-layoffs-appoints-rod-fergusson-new-bioshock-head">Rod Fergusson joined Cloud Chamber</a> last year to rework and fast-track its troubled development. Fergusson is no stranger to coming in hot to fix and finally release troublesome games, and it seems the powers that be are betting on the game being ready in the coming years, which is why the movie needs to get going soon: "I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game," Lee added.</p><p>After last year's creative shakeup at 2K and Cloud Chamber, we also learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-fails-to-impress-at-internal-2k-review-resulting-in-leadership-shake-up-and-revamped-narrartive">a remake of the original BioShock was in development</a> and ultimately binned according to reports. That would've been the perfect thing to release alongside a live-action movie, but now all eyes are on the all-new fourth BioShock... even if we don't know anything about its nature yet.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft’s CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed that they are making a bunch of new Assassin’s Creed and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> games, together with some unannounced original projects, in a wide-ranging albeit very rehearsed-sounding chinwag with Variety. 
</p>
<p>
In the interview, Guillemot also talked more about Ubisoft’s plan to cut fixed costs by €200 million, as the publishers continue their transformation into a set of “creative houses” grouped around particular games and genres. The transformation has already led to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">the cancellation of several games</a> and the closure of two studios, and it sounds like there could be more layoffs on the way.
</p>
<p>
“As we announced, the €200 million in additional cost reductions will include selective restructuring across the company,” Guilemot <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">told the site</a>. “That said, our primary focus for aligning the organization with our long-term goals remains disciplined workforce management, meaning prioritizing voluntary departures while carefully controlling recruitment for replacements and new roles.
</p>
<p>
“We are also taking a range of measures to optimize the business: reducing certain expenses, adjusting or stopping projects where necessary, improving production processes, and making more effective use of our tools,” he went on.
</p>
<p>
“Following the post-Covid period, the industry grew very quickly, anticipating sustained demand that didn’t fully materialize. On our part, this led to too many projects and increased complexity. Our priority today is to build a more focused, agile company, with stronger teams that strike the right balance between senior expertise and young talent and who are well positioned to deliver the highest quality games.”
</p><p>
The talk of “disciplined workforce management” might seem a bit risible when you consider that Yves has just appointed his son, Charlie, as co-CEO of Vantage Studios, the creative house that will handle potential “billionaire brands” like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six.  
</p>
<p>
Charlie Guillemot has a few years under his belt in executive positions, but doesn’t strike me as anybody’s first choice for the role of Assassin’s Cry Rainbows tsar. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-new-assassins-creed-and-far-cry-games-are-coming-denies-that-putting-his-son-in-charge-of-them-was-nepotism/">PCGamer</a> note, he’s otherwise known for running free-to-play specialists Owlient, creators of an infamous Tom Clancy mobile spin-off that shut down a year after launch, and co-founding AI, web3 and blockchain studio <a href="https://www.unagi.games/#web3">Unagi</a>. Charlie Guillemot doesn’t have any public credits on any of Ubisoft’s would-be “billionaire brands”.</p>
<p>Vantage’s other co-CEO, Christophe Derennes, looks like a stronger fit: he’s the <a href="https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/christophe-derennes-30-years-in-a-booming-industry/">former general manager</a> of Ubisoft Montréal, developers of the original Assassin’s Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-2">Far Cry 2</a> and several Rainbow Six games.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft – founded by the Guillemot brothers in 1986 - have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed">batted away allegations of nepotism</a> in the past. Asked by Variety to comment on the subject yet again, Guillemot replied that “Ubisoft was created as a family company, and our strong heritage helps us take a long-term view, prioritizing sustainable growth, creative ambition, and continuity over short-term cycles. This perspective guides our decisions and helps us build franchises, teams, and strategies that endure for decades.” 
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure the argument that keeping it in the family helps Ubi avoid short-termism really gels with the previous answer about over-expansion during the Covid boom, or with Ubisoft’s repeated investments in NFTs and other flavours of snakeoil.
</p>
<p>
“I strongly believe that Christophe Derennes and Charlie are the right leaders as Co-CEOs of Vantage Studios,” Guillemot went on. “They bring complementary strengths and experience that make them well-suited for the role. Their appointment was based on their skills, track record, and fit for the role.” 
</p><p>
Ubisoft’s creative houses “will operate like dedicated business units with clear accountability for performance and genuine creative autonomy,” the exec explained. Vantage specifically have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">funding from Tencent</a>, but according to Guillemot, the latter “respect our operational autonomy and are not involved in our governance or day-to-day management”. 
</p>
<p>
Whether investors trust the Guillemots to run Ubisoft any longer is somewhat in doubt: the company has weathered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">shareholder revolts</a> over <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=UBI:PAR">the falling stock price</a>. The Guillemots have also been accused of failing to curb a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/three-former-ubisoft-execs-found-guilty-of-sexual-and-psychological-harassment">"boy's club" workplace culture</a> that has led to several criminal convictions. I get the sense that decentralising the founding fathers and detoxifying the Ubisoft brand is part of the thinking behind positioning the creative houses as autonomous. Or at least, that was my reasoning before the big boss appointed his son to co-run three of Ubisoft’s most successful series. 
</p>
<p>
They’ll have to do more than that to convince the Ubisoft rank-and-file: around 1200 French Ubisoft workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1200-ubisoft-staff-go-on-strike-against-assassins-creed-companys-massive-cutbacks">went on strike</a> earlier this month in response to the changes of direction and an associated return-to-office policy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 23, 2026, Quordle is the #1491 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>

<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>

<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-quordle-daily-game">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 24</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

The developer said it believed the "large number of gameplay videos" now floating around the internet — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-faces-uphill-battle-to-stop-resident-evil-requiem-leaks-as-ending-spoilers-and-videos-appear-online"><u>some of which contain huge spoilers and clips of the game's finale</u></a>, which IGN verified as legitimate — originated from copies obtained "through illegal means."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in a <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/2025040184614728119" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>message</u></a> posted to Twitter/X and translated by machine (which means there may be some inaccuracies or missing nuance), Kamiya reflected on how spoilers also impacted the release of Resident Evil 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm sure the final developments of [Resident Evil 2] were also exposed in a weekly photo magazine…" he wrote. "For your own selfish satisfaction, you trample on the feelings of the users who were looking forward to the game, as well as the feelings of the creators who put all their effort into making it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a despicable act that destroys the happiness of everyone, and deserves a thousand deaths... May you be cursed to never be able to play games again..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom stressed the posting of these videos constitutes copyright infringement, as well as generally being "an act that offends other customers." However, the publisher seems somewhat limited in what it can actually do in response, suggesting it will simply delete the videos or issue "warnings."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, we don't have long to wait now, as Resident Evil Requiem's February 27 release date is but a few short days away. "After getting hands-on with a total of about four hours of Resident Evil 9 Requiem at this point, and sharing that experience with colleagues, I’m more excited for the series than I have been in recent memory," IGN wrote after going <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-second-take-preview"><u>hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem</u></a> recently. "It’s the old mixed with the new, but all in a modern package with two protagonists I already like a lot."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <p>Tencent have reportedly shut down their TiMi Montreal studio, set up back in 2021 with the goal of creating multi-platform open world games. In those five years, the studio haven't shipped any games, but had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fired-ubisoft-director-ashraf-ismail-now-working-for-tencent">brought on</a> former Assassin’s Creed creative director Ashraf Ismail. Ismail was reportedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-creative-director-fired-from-ubisoft-f-1844724819">fired by Ubisoft</a> following an investigation into misconduct, with the developer having been accused of taking advantage of his status to engage in extramarital relationships.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed">Game File</a> first reported TiMi Montreal's closure, citing a LinkedIn post from a programmer at the studio. According to the publication, this post asserted that staff had been aware of the impeding closure "for some time" and addded "I am genuinely heartbroken that the public will never get to experience what this team was capable of producing." <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernandezluzuriaga_today-timi-montreal-is-officially-closing-share-7430638121156784128-RAMk/">Links</a> to the post now load to a message which reads "this post cannot be displayed".</p>
<p>I've contacted Tencent for comment. Ashraf Ismail, whose <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashraf-ismail-5b1919a/">LinkedIn profile</a> lists him as having been a creative director at Timi Montreal since March 2021, contains no references to the studio being closed as of writing.</p>
<p>While the wider Tencent-backed TiMi Studio Group which this Montreal studio was part of has had a large focus on mobile games - such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/age-of-empires">Age of Empires</a> Mobile, Pokémon Unite, and Call of Duty: Mobile - the Montreal studio was <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/TiMi-Studio-Group-Opening-Game-Development-Studio-in-Montreal">launched with the specific goal</a> of creating an original "AAA open world, service-focused video game for players to explore across multiple platforms". PC and consoles were first on the list of places for said game to hit, though TiMi Montreal hadn't announced any such game. Meanwhile, TiMi Studio Group have at least published a fairly high-profile shooter on PC in the past couple of years, in the form of Team Jade's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/delta-forces-free-black-hawk-down-shooter-campaign-mode-is-out-now">Delta Force</a>.</p>
<p>TiMi Montreal's closure comes as we've seen Chinese giants cut back the substantial efforts they made at Western expansion around the Covid pandemic, with Tencent rival NetEase having <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts">made headlines for doing so</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last week gave us the announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-releasing-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-on-switch-consoles-but-youll-have-to-buy-them-as-they-are-skipping-nintendo-switch-online">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen coming to the Switch</a> systems. This would've been celebrated under normal circumstances, but Nintendo and The Pokémon Company chose to skip the Nintendo Switch Online service in favour of a paid re-release of the original games at £16.99 (or $20) each. A silver lining was mention of support for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-home">Pokémon Home</a> service, but now that's up in the air.</p>
<p>From the get-go, the official return of FireRed and LeafGreen to celebrate the franchise's 30th anniversary felt a bit barebones. With no new content or graphical upgrades to speak of or online play/trading (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-get-nintendo-switch-launch-next-week-priced-at-20-each">only local wireless</a>), the only thing that was half-justifying putting down the cash many would rather spend on an indie was the Home functionality, which allows players to freely transfer Pokémon between games, even those of different generations.</p>
<p>Now, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/">pointed out by fans</a> shortly after the announcement, mentions of such a feature have been scrubbed from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pokemon-LeafGreen-Version-3031289.html">eShop listings</a> for both versions of the game. Maybe that simply wasn't meant to be announced before <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/watch-the-new-pokemon-presents-this-pokemon-day-on-february-27-2026">this week's Pokémon Presents stream</a>, or maybe it's only planned to arrive post-launch and the powers that be aren't ready to fully commit yet in case development hiccups happen. As it stands, a potential Pokémon Home integration would be the only new feature being added to the FireRed and LeafGreen ports, so the information could've broken containment earlier than planned.</p>
<p>In any case, it's worth underlining that, at the time of writing, Pokémon Home isn't officially locked for this re-release of the GBA classics, which are priced at £16.99 each and only include a single language per purchase (pick yours carefully if you're biting the bullet). All this hasn't stopped FireRed and LeafGreen from climbing to the top of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-eShop/Charts/Nintendo-eShop-charts-1396788.html">eShop's charts</a> ahead of their launch on 27th February though.</p>

<p>Capcom itself has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/please-dont-post-or-share-pre-release-leaks-and-spoilers-capcom-sets-its-sights-on-resident-evil-requiem-leakers">already posted a message</a> on social media urging fans to refrain from sharing any potential spoilers, but now game developer Hideki Kamiya has also <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/2025040184614728119">offered his own two cents</a> on the matter. Kamiya, as you'll no doubt know, served as director on the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/resident_evil_2">Resident Evil 2</a> back in the day, and so knows a thing or two about having his work leak ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>His message is, shall we say, quite extreme. There may well be some inaccuracies with the machine translation here, but the general sentiment is that he wishes "a thousand deaths" upon those who purposefully leak games.</p><div><figure data-videoid="53peCvnRDq8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt53peCvnRDq8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938a0swzimr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I'm sure the final developments of Resident Evil 2 were also exposed in a weekly photo magazine... For your own selfish satisfaction, you trampled on the feelings of the users who were looking forward to the game, as well as the feelings of the creators who put all their effort into making it.</p>
<p>"It's a despicable act that destroys the happiness of everyone, and deserves a thousand deaths... May you be cursed to never be able to play games again..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're not going to support the idea that leakers deserve death, but this is a clear indication of the frustration that developers feel when their work is maliciously put out into the world before the planned release date, potentially ruining the experience for players excited to dive in.</p>
<p>Needless to say, be careful out there, folks. Requiem is mere days away at this point, so be sure to mute any appropriate words on social media and perhaps even adjust your YouTube settings to only show your subscriptions. It's the wild west out there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>On Saturday, <strong>Microsoft</strong> surprised <strong>Xbox</strong> fans with a brief but visually impressive in-engine trailer for <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong> that showcased the game's various biomes. The footage demonstrated the excellent level of detail provided by the latest iteration of the <strong>ForzaTech</strong> proprietary engine technology, while also offering a glimpse of the variety of environments players will be able to explore from the cockpit of their cars once the game ships in less than three months. We can see beaches, small villages, forests, the countryside, and snowy, mountainous regions, among others.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Forza Horizon 6 - Discover Japan | Biomes Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JgK8bneoBFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Originally announced at Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, Forza Horizon 6 is the direct successor to 2021's award-winning <strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong>, which was <strong>the biggest-ever launch for an Xbox Studios game</strong> and kept millions of players engaged for years, even adding a lot more racing fans to the community <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when it debuted on Sony's PlayStation 5 console last year</a></strong>.</p>



<p>It won't be easy for the new game to match or exceed its success, but developer Playground is certainly trying. <strong>The map is the franchise's largest to date</strong>, with Tokyo confirmed as <strong>its most complex and intricate drivable space, being five times larger than any previous Horizon city</strong>. Tokyo's rendition in Forza Horizon 6 features multiple districts, each with its own distinct identity, from suburbs and downtown areas to docks and industrial zones. Beyond the city, Mount Fuji and several other regions of Japan have been confirmed, spanning the Kantō, Chūbu, and Kansai areas. As usual with Forza Horizon games, these regions will be compressed into a fictional map rather than reflecting real-life distances.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 will feature <strong>over 550 cars</strong> at launch, more than its predecessor but fewer than Forza Horizon 4, which had over 750 when it debuted in 2018. Similar to Forza Horizon 4 and 5, <strong>dynamic seasons return</strong>, with the team building a system that genuinely shifts the world's tone, activity, and ambient sound as seasons change. Japan's famous cherry blossoms, vivid autumn foliage, and snow-capped winter mountains should make the seasonal cycle particularly spectacular in this setting. Game developer Playground Games also brought on cultural consultant <strong>Kyoko Yamashita</strong> to ensure the game's depiction of Japan feels authentic in every respect.</p>



<p>The most notable gameplay departure from previous entries that we know of will be found in campaign progression. Rather than entering the Horizon Festival as an established racer, <strong>players begin as a mere tourist</strong> who must earn their way into the festival and work up through its escalating ranks. </p>



<p>More gameplay information on Forza Horizon 6 is expected to be released in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for more. The game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-leak-reveals-may-19-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on May 19, 2026</a></strong> for PC and Xbox Series S|X, as per a leak, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-gameplay-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a PlayStation 5 version coming later</a>. </p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<li>Thing</li>



<li>Person</li>



<li>Place</li>



<li>Animal</li>



<li>Work</li>



<li>Nature</li>



<li>Game</li>



<li>Concept</li>



<li>Idea</li>



<li>Food</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-23-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 23, 2026</h2>



<p>Without giving away today’s Contexto answer, here are a few helpful hints to get you thinking in the right direction:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hint 1:</strong>&nbsp;Animal</li>



<li><strong>Hint 2:</strong>&nbsp;Reptile</li>



<li><strong>Hint 3:</strong>&nbsp;Protective shell</li>
</ul>



<p>If they don’t help, then here are the nine closest words, going from tenth to second:</p>



<ul>
<li>Rabbit</li>



<li>Snake</li>



<li>Frog</li>



<li>Snail</li>



<li>Gecko</li>



<li>Reptile</li>



<li>Lizard</li>



<li>Iguana</li>



<li>Turtle</li>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-today-s-contexto-answer-for-game-1254-on-february-23-2026">Today’s Contexto Answer For Game #1254 On February 23, 2026</h2>



<p>If you’ve tried everything, and still can’t figure out today’s Contexto answer, then you can find it down below:</p>



<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Tortoise</p>



<p>A Tortoise is a slow-moving, herbivorous land reptile native to warm climates which is enclosed in a scaly, domed shell.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-contexto-game-after-1254">When Is The Next Contexto Game After #1254?</h2>



<p><strong>Contexto is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone, meaning the next game will start on February 24</strong></p>



<p>The Contexto schedule is very consistent, with a new game releasing at the same time every day.</p>

		<p>His many personal faults notwithstanding, H.P. Lovecraft’s writings continue to cast a profound shadow over the horror genre. While his own views were reprehensible (even by the standard of his time) the continuing fascination with cosmic horror can be seen across many media. Big Bad Wolf are the latest developers to take influence from this mythos in their upcoming horror adventure game Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, but have moved away from the beaches of Innsmouth and out to sea to take advantage of the thalassophobia (fear of deep water) that underlines much of Lovecraft’s work.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss | Investigation Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iyYlAQ1b74o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss begins in 2053 with you playing as Noah, an investigator charged with following the trail of a missing colleague who finds that an occult cosmic threat is spreading across the world. His investigations lead him to a mining facility located deep within the Pacific Ocean wherein he discovers that the missing miners have stumbled upon a passage to R’lyeh. So far, so Lovecraftian, and I was impressed by how well the content I played in the preview build slotted into the wider Mythos whilst also maintaining an identity of its own.</p>


<p>The Cosmic Abyss is played out through a first-person perspective, but this is no action shooter and combat plays no real role in this game. There were no direct engagements with enemies during the section I got to play, though there was still plenty of threat and dread. The full version promises some confrontations with unknown horrors that will require quickness of thought rather than trigger finger to survive. This fits perfectly with cosmic horror as no small part of the terror comes from your insignificance in the face of the unknowable.</p>


<p>With no combat to speak of, the gameplay mechanics instead revolve around investigation and puzzle solving, with a focus on a mind palace method of connecting clues that is reminiscent of Frogwares’ Sherlock Holmes games. In order to interact with the environment you can call on your AI companion, Key, who can scan, assess, and record the information that you acquire. This digital compendium can be called up in order to make connections between clues and objects that you scan, reveal deeper insights and even give you the direct solution to riddles.</p>
<p>The Unreal Engine 5 powered graphics are breathtaking at times, with the scale of the underwater environment being overwhelming. Relatively early on you have to venture outside of the submersed facility to explore a mysterious labyrinth and even though there was no pressure of oxygen limits in place I found the whole section almost unbearably tense. This wasn’t helped by my stubbornness in trying to brute force my way through when a more direct route via further investigations was the more efficient solution.</p>

<p>Major puzzles and obstacles in the world of The Cosmic Abyss will often have more than one solution with the main division between each being the effect they have on your sanity. Leaning into the world of R’lyeh for answers will drive you further into madness whereas presumably more rational and scientific solutions will help keep you sane. This mechanic was hinted at in the preview but I look forward to seeing its full effects in the full game.</p>
<p>As is often the case with early preview builds, there were a few small bugs and glitches, but these were refreshingly infrequent with the game just a couple months from release in April. One that took me a while to work out was that the controls would occasionally revert to AZERTY (to match the Big Bad Wolf’s keyboards as a French studio) so I couldn’t move forward. For a while I thought this was a deliberate effect in keeping with the classic Eternal Darkness’ manipulation of your controls, but checking with the team, it became clear that this was just a bug. Rebranding it as a feature wouldn’t be the worst idea, though!</p>

<p>The world of Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss has certainly got its claws into me and I’m eagerly awaiting getting stuck into the full version when it launches in April. What I’ve seen so far promises a twisting and tense narrative that will challenge the grey cells rather than the trigger fingers and, as such, should be a truly cosmic horror experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>turbulence at Microsoft's Xbox division</strong> continued on Friday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when the company suddenly announced</a> that long-time CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> and current president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> were both <strong>leaving</strong> (the former is retiring, while the latter is pursuing other career opportunities outside Microsoft).</p>



<p>The new CEO of Microsoft Gaming is <strong>Asha Sharma</strong>, whose appointment is, however, already being questioned by gamers. The 36-year-old executive <strong>has no prior experience in the gaming industry</strong>; browsing her career, this is actually the second time she's been at Microsoft. She first joined Microsoft in 2011 and worked in the Marketing department for two years, then left to become COO of <strong>Porch Group</strong> (an insurance platform for homes), then returned to the tech industry by joining <strong>Meta</strong> as Head of Product across Messenger + Instagram Direct and GM of calling, video, and kids experiences. </p>



<p>In 2021, she changed companies again, joining the leading grocery technology company <strong>Instacart</strong> as its COO. After three years, she returned to Microsoft as president of the <strong>CoreAI</strong> product, leading the portfolio of AI models, apps, agents, responsible AI, and developer tools for customers.</p>



<p>It's not so much her lack of industry experience that worries gamers, but rather <strong>her previous work in Microsoft's AI division</strong>. Probably aware of this in advance, Sharma included this reassuring bit in her prepared statement:</p>



<p><em>We will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop.</em></p>



<p>However, she didn't quite get off to the right start with that. Throughout the weekend, her X account replied to several gamers in an attempt to connect with the Xbox community, but <strong>fans are already pointing out that her answers might actually be crafted by an AI bot</strong>. <a href="https://x.com/asha_shar/status/2025271504515285467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's an example</a>:</p>



<p><em>Great list. I did my top 3 in another reply. Halo, Valheim, 007. It's been a long time since I played Chrono Trigger. Have you done every ending? Thanks for all the detail. I appreciate it a ton.</em></p>



<p>Furthermore, the new Xbox CEO has shared her Gamertag publicly, and fans quickly noticed a couple of things: it was created last month and already has quite a bit of playtime. She later <a href="https://x.com/asha_shar/status/2025262170339168355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed in a tweet</a> that she's "<strong>no Phil Spencer</strong>", hinting at the previous CEO's renowned gaming habits.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not mandatory for a gaming executive to be a gamer. However, between that, her lack of experience in the industry, and the aforementioned AI skepticism, <strong>Asha Sharma might already have a bit of an uphill battle when it comes to winning over the already downbeat Xbox fans</strong>. </p>



<p>Ultimately, as they say, the proof is in the pudding. If Xbox can output great hardware and software, all this stuff will be quickly forgotten. The lineup for this year (which marks the 25th anniversary of Xbox) is very solid: <strong>Fable</strong>, <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, <strong>Halo: Campaign Evolved</strong>, <strong>Gears of War: E-Day</strong>, though of course, it was inherited from the previous leadership. </p>

		<p>Hilltop Studios, the team behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lil-guardsman">Lil’ Guardsman</a>, have announced their next title, and it is a vast departure from the cute cartoony aesthetic of their breakthrough game. Curse of Resthaven is billed as an Eldritch time loop adventure and takes the form of a single–player narrative roguelite in which you must govern a cursed colony and decide who (or what) to trust.</p>
<p><iframe title="Curse of Resthaven | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1JyiYqmQLt8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The gaming loop involves a seven day structure, at the end of which the island is destroyed, only for a goddess to send you back to the beginning again. During each week loop you’ll need to carry out a range of activities to try and break the curse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uncover the truth: Interrogate the townspeople, earn their trust, and discover their secrets. Question them wisely, and exploit your knowledge to gain new leverage.</li>
<li>Master the art of trade: Strike a deal with every merchant that visits Resthaven to gather resources and upgrade the colony, improving the lives of those you serve.</li>
<li>Explore a cursed island: Venture beyond the colony walls on branching, card-driven expeditions into the wilds. Build a deck of resource and companion cards to survive unpredictable encounters and confront eldritch horrors.</li>
<li>Trapped in a time loop: Each week-long cycle unlocks new advantages, new story paths, and deeper truths. Use what you have learned to discover Resthaven’s darkest secrets.</li>
<li>A hand-drawn world: Every character and environment is rendered in a unique graphic novel style, blending gothic intrigue with cosmic dread</li>
<li>The sound of mystery: Features more than 25 fully voiced characters and an original score from the composer of Lil’ Guardsman’s award-winning soundtrack.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Despite being a radical shift from the cartoon world of Lil’ Guardsman, Curse of Resthaven builds on everything we learned making that game,” said Scott Christian, Studio Director at Hilltop Studios. “It’s evocative, story-rich gothic horror, like if Twin Peaks and Lost had an eldritch baby raised by Edgar Allen Poe. We want it to move people, spook them, and be a lot of fun to play.”</p>
<p>You can now add Curse of Resthaven to your wishlist on Steam.</p>
