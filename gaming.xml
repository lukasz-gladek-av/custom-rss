<p>It's been a whirlwind journey of stops and starts, but <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/07/05/apple-green-lights-epic-games-store-in-rapid-reversal">AppleInsider reports</a> the Epic Game Store for iOS in the European Union has passed Apple's notarization process.</p>
<p>This paves the way for Epic CEO Tim Sweeney to realize his long-stated goal of launching an alternative game store on Apple's closed platform—at least in Europe.</p>
<p>Apple announced plans to allow third-party app stores on iOS in the region earlier this year, complying with the letter of the law (though some say not the spirit) as required by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which was enacted in hopes of making platforms more open and competitive.</p>
<p>Apple's new policies allow for alternative app marketplaces but with some big caveats regarding the deal that app developers agree to. We discussed it in some detail <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/apple-announces-sweeping-eu-app-store-policy-changes-including-sideloading/">earlier this year</a>.
</p><p>The change followed years of contentious PR campaigns and court battles around the world between Epic and Apple, with Sweeney proclaiming that Apple's app approval processes are anti-competitive and that its 30 percent cut of app revenues is unfair.</p>
<p>Even after the shift, Apple is said to have rejected the Epic Games Store app twice. The rejections were over specific rules about the copy and shape of buttons within the app, though not about its primary function.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>With the rejections, Apple told Epic that some buttons within the app were too similar in both appearance and copy to Apple's own buttons—including the "Install" button and the "in-app purchases" copy. Apple felt that this violated rules it had set out in its guidelines to prevent developers from mimicking Apple app designs too closely, ostensibly confusing users.</p>
<p>After those rejections, <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1809179985682325649">Epic took to X</a> to accuse Apple of rejecting the app in a way that was "arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the DMA." Epic claimed it followed Apple's suggested design conventions for the buttons and noted that the copy matched language it has been using in its store on other platforms for a long time.</p>
<p>Not long after, Apple went ahead and approved the app despite the disagreement over the copy and button designs. However, AppleInsider reported that Apple will still require Epic to change the copy and buttons later. Epic <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1809658856466698515">disputed that on X</a>, and Sweeney offered <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1809336745613287445">his own take</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple’s DMA saga has taken a turn towards the absurd.</p>
<p>Apple is now telling reporters that this approval is temporary and are demanding we change the buttons in the next version - which would make our store less standard and harder to use.</p>
<p>We’ll fight this.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the matter remains contentious, it looks like the Epic Game Store will soon reach iPhone and iPad users in the European Union. Epic still has to build some key parts of the new storefront, such as its mobile payment system for the platform.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/goodbye-kotaku-australia-you-were-a-very-good-website.922137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-closed-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kotaku was launched in New York in 2004, and it didn't take long for readers (and advertisers) to realise it was a good website. So in 2008 the publication's owner at the time, Gawker Media, made a deal that saw the Kotaku brand licensed out to an Australian media company. And so Kotaku AU was born.</p><p>Based in Sydney and paying a fee to Gawker for the name and content, Kotaku Australia (and its stablemates Gizmodo AU and Lifehacker AU) served two masters. First, it handled the republication of the American site's content on a local masthead, where it could attract whole new ad deals. But it also hired Australian writers, who could publish their own criticism and do their own reporting.</p><p>This lent the site a voice of its own, an identity distinct from the American mothership, shaped by a succession of local (or at least locally-based) editors who were able to provide a softer tone and cultivate a community that, I'll be honest, was often the envy of the US site.</p><p>Kotaku AU was able to perform miracles relative to its headcount and budget, providing a constant stream of original reporting that held the local industry to account when needed, but could champion Australian games development and its community at the same time.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I’m tired of this heartless corpo bullshit. Fuck these dogs.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Anyway, you've read the headline already (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-weekend-essay/is-the-media-prepared-for-an-extinction-level-event" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and are living through 2024 and the media apocalypse</a>) so you know why we're here writing these words in this tone: yesterday the owners of Kotaku AU--<a href="https://www.mi-3.com.au/08-07-2024/matt-rowley-exit-pedestrian-group-drops-vice-refinery29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the embattled Pedestrian Group</a>, part of <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-28/nine-entertainment-job-cuts-commercial-media-slowing-economy/104036502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the even more embattled Nine Network</a>--<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/jul/08/vice-kotaku-gizmodo-job-cuts-australia-channel-nine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down the sites and laid everyone off</a>. Writers weren't even allowed to access their CMS to say goodbye, leaving the site's last posts (at time of publishing) to be a report on <em>LA Noire</em> weirdness and a <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> tip.</p><p>Denied even that last dignified act--and disclosure time, because I've worked closely with many of these people and think they're all amazing--I've turned Aftermath over for one blog to former editors and writers of Kotaku Australia, so that they can share their thoughts and say their goodbyes.&nbsp;</p><p>First up is <strong>David Wildgoose</strong>, an elder statesman of Australian games media and the second Editor of Kotaku Australia:</p><blockquote><p>Perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised that the Pedestrian Group would slow-walk to death a formerly vital hub of Australia's games community. Perhaps, as we survey the wreckage of the games media landscape over the past five years, the surprise is that Kotaku AU survived as long as it did. Regardless, the masthead and remaining editorial staff deserved a kinder fate than to be chewed up and spat out by an uncaring corporate machine.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Next up is the site's third Editor, the <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2017/07/fairy-bread-is-an-abomination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decidedly un-Australian <strong>Mark Serrels</strong></a>, whose eight-year tenure perhaps marked the site's high-water mark, at least <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/08/i-spent-an-entire-day-wearing-a-sleeping-bag-because-i-like-playing-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in terms of the resources allocated to it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>News that the Australian edition of Kotaku has come to an end has been sitting heavy on me all day. It almost feels like the death of a distant, beloved relative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of eight years I published 11,000 posts on Kotaku Australia. The happiest times of my professional life were spent working on the site, publishing everything from news, reviews to unhinged shitposts. Every now and then I’d also post stuff that felt important. Those days were the best.</p><p>I’ve worked at a number of places – and loved it – but I don’t think I ever feel as aligned with a website’s purpose like I did at Kotaku Australia. At the time it was simply tailor-made for me and the way I wanted to write. I could do pretty much anything I wanted. I walked around Sydney wearing a sleeping bag all day. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/features/the-time-i-tried-polyphasic-sleep-and-started-hallucinating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I did a completely cooked polyphasic sleep experiment</a> so I could play more video games. It was a wild time and I’ve tried to replicate that energy to every place I’ve worked since.&nbsp;</p><p>Kotaku Australia had its own unique identity, and a truly powerful community. They welcomed me with open arms and those first couple of years were magic. The TAYbies as they called themselves (it’s a long story) were endlessly supportive of the work I wanted to do and drowned out the gross mess of gaming discourse during dark times. In the depths of Gamergate that community got me through some truly challenging days. I met lifelong friends through Kotaku Australia. In fact, I just caught up with one of them at the pub last weekend. (Hi Ruffleberg!)</p><div><p>It was also a wicked conveyor belt for talent. I hired Jackson Ryan not once but twice and first met him through the Kotaku community (he once won a competition for writing a story about pissing himself while playing <em>Super Mario World</em>). I met Dan Crowd, who now looks after gaming content at the ABC, at a Kotaku meet-up. Zorine Te, who went to Gamespot and became an esports superstar, used to be a community mainstay as well! And hey – did you know that my old Dep Ed Tracey Lien is now a famous best-selling author?</p><p>That’s not to mention all the incredible people I worked with across all three sites. I hesitate to name names because I’m a moron and I’ll miss someone important, but almost all of the best games and tech journalists in Australia had a stint on these sites at one time and we all learned something important from one another. It was a melting pot for “good shit” before I arrived and it was a melting pot for “good shit” long after I left.</p><p>And on that note, a special shout out to the folks who steered Kotaku in its final days. David Smith, Emily Spindler, Courtney Borret, Lauren Rouse and Chris Neill among others were killing it. It absolutely sucks they’ve been cut off at the peak of their powers.</p><p>I’m gutted, absolutely gutted.&nbsp;</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><blockquote><p>...the masthead and remaining editorial staff deserved a kinder fate than to be chewed up and spat out by an uncaring corporate machine...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Tegan Jones</strong>, an award-winning tech journo who worked across all three Gawker-down-under sites (and was Editor of Gizmodo Australia) says:</p><blockquote><div><p>I’m beyond heartbroken over the demise of Gizmodo, Kotaku &amp; Lifehacker Australia. </p><p>The people working across these publications - some of the last bastions of paid, niche tech journalism in this country - were powerhouses who deserved better. </p><p>I’m so sorry for them all. </p><p>Gizmodo was my life for so long. Being its editor was something I took very seriously. It was my dream job. I wore the title proudly. For better or worse, it was my entire identity for a while there. Perhaps that’s a good lesson in the importance of divorcing one’s sense of self from the thing that pays their rent. </p><p>Because in this business, one day, it probably won’t.</p><p>Still, I’m not the only former editor to express such sentiments about Giz. There’s gotta be a reason for that. I will always love it for changing my life and the part it has always played in local tech journalism under so many wonderful and talented editors. </p><p>The same goes for Kotaku and Lifehacker. </p><p>Just look at the public lamentations of all former editors and writers across these publications - some of whom haven’t worked there in years. They weren't just jobs or websites for us. Gracing the digital pages of these sites will always be career highlights. Life highlights even.</p><p>For many of us, they gave us our first big breaks. They were our homes. For Alex [Ed's note: former Kotaku AU Editor Alex Walker] and myself in particular, they were the catalyst for our nine year relationship. Kotaku is the reason we met - at a local <em>Need For Speed </em>preview, which is eternally hilarious. </p><p>Looking at the toxic flames engulfing the local tech media landscape, I honestly don’t see a way forward. Perhaps that’s the sadness of the day speaking, but considering the dire state even mainstream journalism is in, I’m afraid I may be the right amount of jaded. </p><p>Regardless of what the future may hold, I think we can all agree that the industry will be worse off without these publications. It’s a dark day for Australian journalism and tech media globally - something that is becoming alarmingly common.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><strong>Ruby Innes</strong> was a great writer and an even better illustrator for Kotaku AU. Few things brought me more joy over the site's 16-year history than <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2023/06/how-to-be-a-gamer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeing some weird little guy she'd drawn at the top of a very good post</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>I started at Kotaku AU in November 2021 and finished up in July 2023. Yeah, I wasn’t there for yonks, but I like to think I made myself known in a way. Not a smart or intellectual way, but definitely A Way.</p><p>Thanks to my wonderful editor David Smith, I was allowed to go turbo. I wrote some bonkers shit, some bonkers shit disguised as real shit, and some very personal shit too. I got to draw all sorts of silly drawings to go along with my insane ‘illustrated guides’ too, and that was a treat. But most importantly, I got to talk to so many cool people both in and out of the games industry, and shine a spotlight on Australia’s local games industry. Writing for Kotaku AU opened my eyes to a world of local game dev talent that I hadn’t seen before, and boosted my love for games in a way I’m very thankful for.</p><p>Kotaku AU has been a beacon for writing about games in Australia in a unique way. So many talented writers, artists, game devs, and so on have had their work published on Kotaku AU. Sure, it came with baggage, but Kotaku AU very much stood on its own two feet as an Australian games publication that gave a shit about the local industry. And wasn’t afraid to dig deep or have a chuckle.</p><p>The loss of Kotaku AU is fucked. The games journalism world is fucking cooked right now, and to see one of the biggest platforms that Australia has in games journalism disappear in one fell swoop alongside other great titles is sickening. I’m tired of this heartless corpo bullshit. Fuck these dogs. Love to Kotaku AU and everybody that played a part in making it what it was.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><strong>Amanda Yeo</strong>, one of the smartest writers and critics I have ever worked with,  says:</p><blockquote><div><p>My early years at Kotaku Australia were some of the happiest of my career. Kotaku AU gave me my start in games journalism, enthusiastically encouraged by then-editor Mark Serrels (to whom I will always be grateful). I loved my time there, and in another universe where things went differently, I can picture myself having chosen to stay.</p><p>Unfortunately, one of the many lessons I learned there was that good things rarely last. I had hoped Kotaku AU would always continue on, enduring the ups, downs, and many challenges to remain a constant stalwart. In my more optimistic musings, I even imagined Kotaku AU growing beyond what it was in my nostalgic memories, likely while I watched enviously from the sidelines.</p><p>I simply couldn't picture an Australian games journalism scene without Kotaku AU. Even with it now a sombre reality, I still struggle to comprehend it.</p><p>Being a full-time games journalist was barely feasible when I began in this industry, and it's only gotten worse in the years since. Kotaku AU was a bastion for Australian games journalism, offering not only entertaining, informative, and heartfelt content, but also some of the few opportunities in the country for writers covering this beat. It's devastating to think of those opportunities now being turned to dust, leaving budding writers with one less buoy to cling to in increasingly rough seas. Without Kotaku AU and its sister sites Gizmodo AU and Lifehacker AU, my life would have been very different. Now even fewer people will get a similar chance.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><blockquote><p>I wrote some bonkers shit, some bonkers shit disguised as real shit, and some very personal shit too</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Alex Walker</strong>, who joined Kotaku AU as a journalist in 2015 before spending five years as its Editor, says:</p><blockquote><p>I loved writing for everyone on Kotaku Australia. Everyone I worked with did the same, and that applied to the other local wings just as much. And as we go full steam ahead into the AI-generated shitstain of a content world that is already upon us, I believe more than ever that human beings want that reverence, that love, that deep personal passion for the same things they love and share.</p><p>The question is, who pays for it? I haven’t figured out that part yet. But if they can, I know there’s a legion of folks who will go to the wire to bring that content to life. I just hope that this time they’ll be greeted with an owner and managers with a vision and a belief that lasts longer than a quarter.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>I've left the last word to <strong>David Smith</strong>, Kotaku Australia's final steward, who performed Herculean tasks to the end despite an ever-dwindling budget and precarious ownership:</p><blockquote><p>Long before I worked there, I revered Kotaku Australia as the gold standard for Australian games coverage. Its features were the best. Its headlines were the best. Its writers were the best. I never thought I'd get to write for Kotaku AU, much less run it. But for two and a half years, I got to do just that.</p><p>I took that custodianship seriously and gave it everything. Its coverage of Australian games development was second to none. Serrels' stories about working conditions at EB Games still send shivers down the spines of those who worked there at the time. Alex's understanding of byzantine government process made it a leader in policy reporting around the games industry. Carrying that standard consumed my life, dramatically worsened my personal health, and required a considerable and surprising amount of my own money to get us to events or ensure our writers had review code due to being tarred with the US' many blacklists. I was up at 6am every day to get stories on the page for the morning commuters and I rarely logged off before 9 at night.</p><p>And I loved it. There were days I hated it, but I loved it.</p><p>KotAU was different to the US flagship in many ways, and it won us dedicated readers. Not just for our local coverage, but our tone too. We weren't as acidic as the US site could be, our takes considered more even-handed or good-natured. We still called a spade a spade and got ourselves in trouble with publishers as often as the US site, so I still feel we did our bit for the brand.</p><p>It was never easy, and often frustrating. Pedestrian Group never really understood Kotaku AU or how to get the most out of the brand commercially. Truthfully, it wasn't ever a good fit there, the PGroup voice and that of Kotaku AU couldn't have been more different. However, that lack of understanding had its benefits. Because they weren't really paying attention to us, we were able to publish a ton of cool shit. Sure, by the end, Google Discover plays were the only way to keep the SEO traffic hose flowing, but we fought to keep great stories coming. We even founded a TikTok (something the US site still hasn't done) and amassed a dedicated audience there by doing what we'd always done -- cutting the shit and talking to the audience like people, not consumers.</p><p>I'm still shellshocked that it's over. I don't know what's next. The shadow Kotaku AU cast is long and irreplaceable. I leave knowing I did everything I could to save and preserve it. I hope that, for the people who loved the site as much as I did, that will be enough.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/08/gothic-elex-developer-pirahna-bytes-has-reportedly-shut-down<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Piranha Bytes, the developer of series such as Elex, Gothic, and Risen, has been shut down. The studio was owned by Embracer, which had been seeking a buyer for the German developer as part of its ongoing cost-cutting restructuring following failed $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was reported that Pirahna Bytes was looking for a new publisher following job cuts last year. In January, following a period of radio silence and inactivity from the studio, CEO Micahel Rüve <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/22/gothic-elex-ii-dev-piranha-bytes-addresses-studio-closure-rumors-dont-write-us-off">addressed reports</a> of an impending closure by stating the company was in a “difficult situation” while expressing optimism about finding a partner by saying, “Don’t write us off yet!”&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, German website <em><a href="https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/piranha-bytes-zukunft-bjoern-pankratz-pithead-studio,3416007.html">GameStar</a></em> (as surfaced by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-owned-gothic-risen-and-elex-developer-piranha-bytes-closes"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>) published a story reporting the studio was officially shut down in late June. Despite this report, there still has not been an official&nbsp; announcement of closure from Embracer or Pirahna (the studio's <a href="https://www.piranha-bytes.com/">website</a> remains inactive, however), and details about what exactly happened are scarce. <em>Game Informer</em> has contacted Pirahna's publisher THQ Nordic for comment and will update this story with a response should we receive one.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3125c744-7314-4cf1-9cfd-4389c6608691" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>However, earlier today, Pirahna leaders Björn Pankratz and Jenny Pankratz&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/PitheadStudio/status/1810222288484389201">announced</a> the formation of Pithead Studio, a new indie studio. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCOIsrbctNM&amp;t=7s">announcement video</a>, the pair acknowledges Pirahna's silence over the past few months and says they plan to answer questions about Pithead's founding on their YouTube channel starting each Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Piranha Bytes was founded in 1997 and is perhaps best known for creating the Gothic series. The studio also developed the three Risen titles and the Elex series; its final release was Elex II in 2022. A remake of Gothic 1 is currently in development by a different studio,&nbsp;Alkimia Interactive. Piranha Bytes was acquired by THQ Nordic in 2019, itself a publishing subsidiary of Embracer Group.</p>

<p>If true, this news would represent the latest Embracer casualty following the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/17/embracer-shuts-down-developer-of-the-new-alone-in-the-dark">closure of Alone in the Dark developer Pieces Interactive</a> last month. After months of layoffs, studio closures (including Saints Row developer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/08/31/saints-row-developer-volition-games-has-been-shut-down">Volition Games</a> and Timesplitters developer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/12/embracer-reportedly-might-close-free-radical-design-its-reformed-timesplitters-team">Free Radical</a>), and selling off its properties, Embracer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/22/embracer-group-to-split-into-three-companies-including-one-called-middle-earth">split itself into three companies</a>&nbsp;in April: Middle-earth &amp; Friends, Coffee Stain &amp; Friends, and Asmodee.&nbsp;</p>

The post outlines a litany of fundamental changes to how rewards are earned, with the team saying that its goal is to “improve your experience and progression goals.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Starting with Season 22, we’re evolving the Apex Legends Battle Pass to improve your experience and progression goals.</p><p>Read on to learn everything to know about the upcoming changes or check out the infographic below to learn more. </p><p>📃: <a href="https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq</a> <a href="https://t.co/i516ktP9ma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/i516ktP9ma</a></p></div>— Apex Legends (@PlayApex) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Where players will find the biggest changes are the length of the Battle Pass and how future passes will be purchased. Up to this point, Battle Passes have required players to complete 110 levels to acquire all rewards, including one Reactive Weapon and a Reactive Weapon Variant. But Season 22 will deliver two passes – one for the first half and one for the second – with 60 levels to complete each. Both halves include one Reactive Weapon each.</p><p>"The impact of this change is twofold," the post says. "It allows us to align seasonal progression more closely with Ranked while also increasing the value for your time."</p><p>EA and Respawn claim that the new structure will result in twice the seasonal rewards for Apex Legends players who use the free version of the battle pass. However, each half-season Premium pass will now cost $10, and the option to purchase passes with Apex Coins is being removed. Players have previously been able to earn 200 coins with the free version of the pass and 1300 coins through the Premium version of the pass, which costs 950 coins. </p><p>Each pass will offer the same number of coins for free and Premium players, which means double the amount of earnable Apex Coins per season, but those who have been saving up their coins will no longer be able to use them for future passes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>15 Best Free-to-Play Games on Xbox</h3></div></output><p>Other tweaks to the Premium Apex Legends formula increase the number of Apex and Legend-Themed packs while doubling the amount of crafting materials in the Premium pass. The Premium Bundle, which was previously purchasable for 2800 Apex Coins, is now called Premium+ and costs $19.99. It includes only 10 level skips while offering more Exotic Shards, two Premium+ Legendary Character Skin Variants and the ability to play all Legends for the duration of the battle pass. </p><p>All of the changes will go into effect with Season 22, which is expected to launch next month.</p><p>"The decision to move from AC to real world currency is not one that we made lightly, but it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community," Respawn's post says. "The new Premium+ Battle Pass comes in at $19.99 USD* and offers additional value; a cost difference of ~29% when compared to the discontinued Premium Battle Pass Bundle at 2800 AC."</p><h2>Apex Legends fans react to the new Battle Pass</h2><p>So far, Apex Legends players aren’t too happy with the changes.</p><p>“So basically pay 10 dollars twice a season instead of being able to continue buying battle passes every season with a one time purchase,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1dyblr3/comment/lc7d10m/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a>. “In what world is this better for players?”</p><p>“The advantage of gathering enough coins to buy the next BP via gameplay was that I was basically stuck with playing your product for dozens of hours on end, so engagement was high,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1dyblr3/comment/lc7d105/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user added</u></a>. “If you're gonna make me pay every time and THEN grind my ass off then that's it brother.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m glad apex legends in season 22 otherwise known as shockwave is finally changing the battlepass. At least a little bit. Only problem is they are charging double and introduced splits to the battlepass. I hate EA. Thoughts? <a href="https://t.co/Tj29js2Nk5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Tj29js2Nk5</a></p>— Thordan Smash (@Thordansmash) <a href="https://twitter.com/Thordansmash/status/1810334711333454068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm confused. So if we pay the $10, we have access to both splits? Because that's not very clear. I'm not giving anymore than that because that's how it's been for over 5 years... also, if I can't use already earned coins to help pay for the Battle Pass, I won't support it at all</p>— Corey Cooper (@MetroidFREAK21) <a href="https://twitter.com/MetroidFREAK21/status/1810331483174797356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">$40 + tax every season for the full battle pass 🥸</p>— Esidi (@esidixo) <a href="https://twitter.com/esidixo/status/1810330636567159048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Apex Legends was released in 2019 and has continued to evolve in the half-decade since its launch with more playable Legends, weapons, abilities, maps, and game modes. Though the ability to purchase battle passes with coins is on the way out, players can still use them on Legends, Apex Packs, and more in the in-game store.</p><p>EA adds that players will be able to unlock the first half of Season 22’s premium battle pass offerings by completing “a set of challenges” within the first two weeks of launch. It’s currently unclear what these challenges entail or if this method will be available in future seasons.

Using a hybrid noise-canceling system with four mics, you can drown out the neighbor's dog yapping or the low hum of an air conditioner. Though the ANC isn't as good as some of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-noise-canceling-headphones">best noise-canceling headphones</a>, it keeps you focused on the game rather than the distractions around you. </p><p>There’s also some fantastic spatial audio onboard, so it's easy to hear enemies lurking in the bushes or helicopters flying overhead.

The Arctis Nova Pro Wireless now totes telescoping arms on it's adjustable headband so it better accommodates larger head sizes. The earcups are also slimmer and sleeker, giving off less of a gaming headset vibe and more of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-bluetooth-headphones"><u>wireless headphones</u></a> look. And one of our favorite features remains intact with a few upgrades, the hot-swappable rechargeable battery system. This means that when the battery runs low during a heated moment in a game, you just quickly change it out, barely missing a second of the action.

As far as connectivity goes, there’s Bluetooth 5.0 and a 2.4GHz wireless dongle for a virtually lag-free experience. It doesn’t stop there, though, as you can simultaneously listen to your game's action on the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-review"><u>PS5</u></a> or a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-pc"><u>gaming PC</u></a> via that dongle while also playing music or chatting over discord with another device through Bluetooth.

There are some other convenient extras as well, such as improved 38-hour battery life, a noise-canceling mic, and on headset controls for ChatMix, volume, Bluetooth pairing, and more.

QuantumSPHERE 360 is a bit more involved, and actually takes into account the position of your head, so you can turn your head in the real life and all the sounds around you will shift to maintain their relative position.</p><p>It's not just nifty surround sound, but also precise, as the Hi-Res certified 50mm drivers offer excellent sound and a 20Hz-40kHz frequency response range. The JBL Quantum One also offer great flexibility, with options for both a USB and a 3.5mm connection available (though the latter will limit its capabilities). The JBL Quantum One even includes active noise cancelling to help you focus on only the sounds you want to hear. And, to top things off, there's customizable RGB lighting on each ear cup.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>SteelSeries Arctis Prime</h3></div></output><h2 id="steelseriesarctisprime">9.

Razer has you covered with the Razer Hammerhead Pro HyperSpeed earbuds, a slightly suped-up version of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/razer-hammerhead-hyperspeed-earbuds-review"><u>Razer Hammerhead Hyperspeed</u></a>. These <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-earbuds">gaming earbuds</a> are compact, lightweight, and secure in-ear but still deliver impactful sound and even active noise cancellation to keep you focused on the action. You also get directional audio, customizable EQ settings, and remappable touch controls—all features of higher-end headsets. </p><p>One of the most limiting factors of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a> is lag, and Razer has you covered, offering a low latency 2.4 GHz dongle that connects seamlessly with your PlayStation 5, PC, Switch and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-android-phone">Andrioid phone</a>. If you’re looking to listen on other devices, there’s Bluetooth. Given these headphones are only wireless, battery life is a concern, but you can get up to 6.5 hours of use plus additional 24 hours in the case. However, when you turn on features like RGB lighting—the earbud’s Razer logo lights up—its battery life drops. </p><h2>Gaming Headset FAQ</h2><h3>What Type of Headset is Best For Gaming?</h3><p>Similar to other peripherals, like a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-mouse"><u>gaming mouse</u></a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-keyboard"><u>gaming keyboard</u></a>, it’s always up for debate whether you should go for a wired or wireless headset. Wired always seemed to be the most reliable option, given the plug-and-play, direct connection to the device ensures latency isn’t a problem. But wireless headsets have almost conquered this issue in recent years thanks to the easy-to-use 2.4GHz dongle that slots into your console or PC, providing almost completely lossless audio. Though, there’s always the possibility of signal interference. </p><p>Battery life should also come into consideration. Of course, it’s a nonissue on wired headsets, while many wireless headsets offer a decent battery life, lasting 25+ hours, making recharging less of a chore. </p><p>Extra time and money are often spent on adding wireless functionality to headsets. That means you may sacrifice sound quality and features on cheaper wireless offerings. Budget wired headsets often don’t fall victim to those same problems. </p><p>Though that cable seems to give wired headsets a slight advantage over wireless, it does mean you’re tethered to your gaming device. If you like to move around or get overly excited during a match, there’s a chance of yanking it right out of the console. Wireless headsets give you much more freedom to move around and even offer features that let you connect to multiple devices, so you can listen to music while still hearing all the action on screen. Luckily, many headsets these days offer both wired and wireless connection options. </p><h3>Are Headsets Good for Streaming? </h3><p>Gaming headsets are a viable option for streaming. You just need to be sure you’ve got one with a quality microphone. Many gaming headsets come with boom mics, which place a microphone just below your mouth, making it easier to pick up your voice for a clear line of communication while keeping your hands free. There’s also often technology that ensures only your voice is picked up and not distracting sounds in your environment. You can even play around with mic sound settings on many headsets using companion apps to get the best sound for your broadcast.</p><p>However, the sound quality of a headset’s built-in mic will still pale in comparison to stand-alone <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-microphone"><u>streaming microphones</u></a> with their wide frequency response, high sample rate, bit-depth, and extensive software. But these microphones do require a more involved setup, including finding the proper placement for the best sound during a stream. You may even need to purchase a separate boom arm to hold the mic in an ideal position. Gaming headsets are a much easier-to-use plug-and-stream option that requires a slight sacrifice to audio quality. </p><h3>Do You Need a Bluetooth Adapter for Wireless Gaming Headsets? </h3><p>Many wireless gaming headsets offer two wireless connectivity options: a 2.4 GHz dongle that you slot into your PC or console and Bluetooth. A wireless dongle is often the ideal choice when gaming, as it has less latency than Bluetooth. But in some cases, Bluetooth may be your only option. </p><p>Luckily, most pre-built gaming PCs and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-laptop"><u>gaming laptops</u></a> have Bluetooth support baked-in, making it easy to connect your gaming headset. However, if your PC's motherboard lacks a Bluetooth card or its current Bluetooth version is dated and doesn’t offer a reliable connection, grabbing one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-bluetooth-adapters-for-pc"><u>best Bluetooth adapters for PC</u></a> is a simple solution to quickly and wirelessly pair your headset, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-controller"><u>PC controller</u></a>, and other peripherals. </p><h2 id="ukgamingheadset">Where to Get the Best Gaming Headset in the UK</h2><p>You definitely need a quality gaming headset if you're looking to take your favourite hobby even remotely seriously.

So, when you're shopping for a gaming headset there are a few key specs you should look out for.</p><p>The first is the size of the drivers, which follows the rule of bigger is better. Drivers are the internal mechanism inside headsets and headphones (or really any speaker) that ultimately create the soundwaves you hear by vibrating back and forth in response to an electrical current.</p><p>The larger the driver, the more air they can move to not only to make louder sounds, but it also allows them to produce a wider, more nuanced range of frequencies—which happens to take us to our next specification.</p><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/06/DSCF5079-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Frequency response is another important spec, and it's the range of frequencies the headset can reproduce. On the low-end, most gaming headsets hit a minimum of 20Hz and a maximum of 20,000Hz. As you go from the bottom of the range to the top, sounds go from a low thud to a warm, steady hum and finally a piercing screech.</p><p>While on the hunt for a gaming headset, you'll likely find more than a few promising 5.1 or 7.1 channel surround sound, which are both designed to give users a more immersive audio experience. 5.1 surround places speakers directly in front of you, front right, front left, back right, back left and adds a subwoofer to relay bass. 7.1 surround gives you the same setup as 5.1 surrounds, but it adds two more speakers to your immediate right and left.</p><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/06/DSCF5242-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Dolby Atmos and DTS Headphone:X (2.0) are two specially branded types of surround sound you'll also likely encounter. They both essentially do the same thing of adding positional audio for effects for objects like say a plane flying over or a bomb falling from the sky above you.</p><p>Now while surround sound on a headset is cool, it's not exactly the same as having a real multi-speaker system, like some of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-soundbar">best soundbars</a> offer. In fact, the majority of gaming headsets employ virtual surround sound—which is to say they're faking it with mathematical algorithms. </p><p>But just because the surround sound you hear on a gaming headset is fake, doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy it or doubt its ability to create an immersive environment.</p><p>The fact that surround sound can be virtualized also means you can get it on any gaming headset even if it only has two channels. On Windows 10 you can download the Windows Sonic for Headphones app and get 3D spatial audio from even the most basic set of stereo headphones.</p><h2>Gaming Headsets vs. Headphones</h2><p>The line between gaming headsets and headphones has blurred significantly in recent years. There are still distinct differences between the peripherals that make one better for gaming and the other ideal for listening to audio. We discuss those below. </p><p><strong>Connectivity: </strong>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-gaming-headset"><u>best wireless gaming headsets</u></a> offer a 2.4GHz dongle that’ll slot into your PC or gaming console, delivering a latency-free connection to ensure you never miss audio cues in a game. Beyond the dongle, you’ll also often get Bluetooth to listen on other devices, and many offer a wired lag-free connection, too. As for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-bluetooth-headphones"><u>wireless headphones</u></a>, you’re usually just limited to Bluetooth, and there’s always a bit of latency that comes with it, which could make or break you in a gaming setting. However, some higher-end headphones do offer a wired connection to devices, making lag less of an issue, but you’ll be tethered to the device. </p><p><strong>Audio: </strong>Headphones, for the most part, deliver a neutral, well-balanced sound, so a high-end pair of headphones is what most audiophiles will grab for listening to music or movies. Gaming headsets often offer a punchy, brighter listening experience, but with cheaper headsets, this can lead to a muddy sound, which isn’t as much of a problem on budget headphones. Where gaming headsets take the cake is spatial audio support, often having some form of it baked in, making it easier to place enemies in a game based on sound cues for an edge over the competition. </p><p><strong>Microphones:</strong> Many gaming headsets come with boom mics that help keep a clear line of communication between you and your teammates, thanks to an arm placed just below your mouth. This extension is often removable or can at least fold out of the way when not in use. Headphones typically use beamforming mics, which hide the microphones away in the earcups and use processing technology to pick up your voice over the sounds in your environment. Gaming headsets have a leg up in this category, but neither compare to a standalone microphone. </p><p><strong>Design:</strong> If you want audio controls on your earcups, gaming headsets are the way to go. You’ll often find buttons for mute, game-chat mix, audio presets, and a volume dial on higher-end sets for easy adjustments in the heat of the action. However, they are often bulky and give off major gamer vibes, especially with a boom mic attached, making them less practical for use outside the battle station. Headphones, on the other hand, look sleeker and have more simplified controls. A premium pair of headphones will also last longer than most gaming headsets, as headsets are usually less expensive with more features that can fail over time.  </p><p><em>Danielle Abraham is a freelance writer who loves all things tech with a special passion for sound.

                <p dir="ltr">The asymmetrical horror genre has exploded in recent years. Formerly a space inhabited by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-by-daylight/" data-ref-id="5000-452548">Dead By Daylight</a> (DBD) almost exclusively, it now includes several major counterparts, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre/" data-ref-id="5000-547380">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-570897">Killer Klowns From Outer Space</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hunt-showdown/" data-ref-id="5000-283965">Hunt: Showdown</a>. Go a level deeper, and many horror-adjacent games, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/predator-hunting-grounds/" data-ref-id="5000-496361">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-561168">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a>, capture similar gameplay mechanics in less spooky settings. The genre is old enough now that a number of competitors have come and gone already, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/friday-the-13th-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-350279">Friday The 13th</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/evil-dead-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-523752">Evil Dead</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">One name dedicated players may recall is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/last-year-the-nightmare/" data-ref-id="5000-485614">Last Year: The Nightmare</a>. Originally, the 5v1 horror game was developed around the same time as Dead By Daylight, with crowdfunding kicking off way back in 2014. In some alternate universe, it might today be DBD's biggest competitor. But a slew of unfortunate circumstances led to the game never quite establishing a solid foundation.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Forest Hills: The Last Year - Official Teaser #3 | Fear Never Dies</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Launching in 2018 exclusively on Discord during the brief period in which the messaging app tried (and failed) to take on Steam as a PC gaming marketplace made community-building highly improbable. Players rejected the Steam alternative, as they tend to with seemingly all others, which, for a multiplayer game like Last Year: The Nightmare, was a death knell. In 2019, a move to reinvent the game for Steam with a new name, Last Year: Afterdark, also wasn't able to capture the attention of more than a small, albeit passionate, group of players. In 2020, the pandemic led to a prospective publishing deal collapsing at the eleventh hour, which tore up the game's content roadmap. Combined, these unfortunate missteps ultimately killed the studio, Elastic Games.</p><p dir="ltr">But from its ashes has risen Undaunted Games, a studio composed of about 20 people, some of whom worked on earlier games in the franchise. Together, they're making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forest-hills-the-last-year/" data-ref-id="5000-622860">Forest Hills: The Last Year</a>, technically the third attempt to turn this franchise into a hit, only this time without the baggage of its predecessors. The name, Undaunted, comes from the team's refusal to quit on this particular IP, studio head Matthew Itovitch told me in a recent conversation. This is emblematic of the team's wider and unwavering intent to get its asymmetrical horror game into the pantheon with the genre's titans.</p><p dir="ltr">"The reason we originally picked up the [intellectual] property is that we've always had faith in The Last Year," Itovitch told me, adding that Undaunted feels the game at the core of this years-long saga still "has really good bones." Forest Hills: The Last Year is made under the assumption that such a future is still possible. Thus, keeping the original name in the game's title is a nod to the core of players who saw similar potential in earlier iterations. The team isn't running from the name.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're still paying homage to the original content that was there that people grew to love as they were playing it," brand coordinator Brooke Eyler told me. "But in addition to that, it's <em>Forest Hills</em>: The Last Year. We are expanding; it's not just a school anymore. It's a town. There are multiple locations you can explore. It's not just a singular instance of play. It's an entire world now."</p><p dir="ltr">Forest Hills takes advantage of Unreal Engine 5, including some of its most dazzling features like Lumen lighting, which Eyler said should make the game "more immersive" than the past versions. The game will forego an early-access period and launch directly into 1.0 on Steam this October, with seven maps, six Fiends (killers), seven Displaced (survivors), and more new features never before seen in the franchise.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330007-belltower-teamfightvsgiant.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330007" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330007-belltower-teamfightvsgiant.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330007"></a><figcaption>Typical high school problems include homework, SATs, dating, and fending off relentless monsters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330007-belltower-teamfightvsgiant.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The team has already laid out a content roadmap that is "pretty much planned all the way to 2026," Eyler revealed. Ramping up with better tech, as well as more maps, heroes, and monsters, seems like the right idea, especially since Forest Hills will debut in a genre much more crowded than it was when the franchise first tried to plant its flag. "The space is very crowded," Eyler said, "but I think it's important to recognize how different all of these games are." In terms of mechanics, atmosphere, and objectives, there really is a lot of variety.</p><p dir="ltr">So what sets Forest Hills apart? "You think of cult classics, you think of '90s slashers, how they have these cult followings of people who are so invested in them and think of them so fondly," she said. "We're leaning into the camp of '90s horror, and we're leaning into fostering those communities within our own personal space so that you can hop on the game, you can play with your friends, and you can feel not only like you're involved in this horror setting, but also like you can laugh about it alongside your friends as well."</p><p dir="ltr">Eyler didn't cite specifics, but seasoned players are likely familiar with toxicity in the genre. Dead By Daylight's community has a reputation for being hostile and "sweaty." I recently went back to it myself after some time away and received hate-mail immediately after my first match, which I found to be a bit too on-the-nose.</p><p dir="ltr">I wondered what causes these PvP horror games to get that way sometimes--DBD isn't alone; it's just the most notorious--and what, if anything, Forest Hills might do to prevent hostility in its community now that it finally has a chance to properly build one. "We're leaning into that humor [and] levity. And hopefully, the levity is able to buoy it above any kind of toxicity that might be laying underneath," Eyler told me.</p><p dir="ltr">In Forest Hills, survivors can work together to craft things in the game such as weapons and support items, and they can even fight back to take down the killer, which isn't often an option in games like this. The team hopes these mechanics may also lend themselves to fostering a healthier, happier community of horror fans.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330008-library-strangler-stalking.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330008" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330008-library-strangler-stalking.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330008"></a><figcaption>The Fiend will oppose a team of five players, but they'll have special abilities and AI allies on their side.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330008-library-strangler-stalking.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We're trying to encourage people to work together, "she continued. "Whereas maybe in other games, it's very killer-versus-this and if I'm bad as the killer, it means I'm bad. If I'm not killing them, it means I'm bad. So I have to do whatever it takes to tear them down. And this isn't about tearing people down. This is about having fun. It's about helping not only yourself, but helping your team to get out because you're not helpless. In Forest Hills, you can fight back, and I think that does lend itself to a bit more cooperation, and a competitive spirit that might be a bit more fun because the killer doesn't feel overbearingly powerful."</p><p dir="ltr">That crafting system is uncommon in this genre, and it's joined by other uncommon or unique mechanics. For players controlling the villain, they'll be able to swap among a few different killers mid-round. This allows for greater gameplay variety, as the ghostly warlock offers different strengths and weaknesses than the venomous spider or the relentless slasher, each of which can counter or be countered by the opposing team on the fly. It reminds me of moments in a hero shooter when a particular character or team composition isn't cutting it, so you switch it up to approach the bout from a new angle.</p><p dir="ltr">Even those surviving teens, each of them playing off of high-school tropes like the jock, the nerd, and the popular girl, are decoupled from specific builds, so two versions of the same character may play quite differently, which should even the playing field when the monster on the other side thinks they know who they're getting in any given round.</p><p dir="ltr">With several misfortunes in its past, Forest Hills clearly has the franchise's best shot to date to make a name for itself. Despite the franchise's "good bones," The Last Year is a name previously associated with false starts and failed do-overs. Now, however, on a new engine, on the right platform, fostering a good-natured community, and offering a lot more content out of the gate, Forest Hills: The Last Year could embody the spirit of an unkillable slasher. Just when you think it's dead and gone, it's resurrected and bloodthirsty once more.</p><p dir="ltr">Forest Hills: The Last Year is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864310/Forest_Hills_The_Last_Year/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">coming to Steam</a> on October 22, with a console launch planned for 2025.</p>

The other nice thing about the Quest 3 is that the controllers don't have tracking rings around them, making them easier to grip and use for play sessions.</p><p>You might want to consider picking up a Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap as well, just for extra comfort, or if you feel like upgrading the headset, the Elite Strap with battery add-on is a very good investment for long VR sessions.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-3-Elite-Strap/dp/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap</a> -- $64 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-3-Elite-Strap-Battery/dp/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="nofollow ">Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap and battery (Amazon)</a> -- $130</li></ul><p>We're seeing a lot of other great gaming deals right at Walmart, like the premium <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PS5-DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller%2F1707140316%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3-vr-headset-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet-at-walmart%2F1100-6524762%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DualSense Edge controller for $175</a> and several Nintendo Switch games--<a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FThe-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch%2F55432568%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3-vr-headset-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet-at-walmart%2F1100-6524762%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FSuper-Mario-Maker-2%252F367896025%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3-vr-headset-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet-at-walmart%2F1100-6524762%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Maker 2</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FMario-Kart-8-Deluxe-Nintendo-Switch-U-S-Version%252F55432571%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3-vr-headset-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet-at-walmart%2F1100-6524762%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>--for just $30 each.

You can set up custom profiles, adjust trigger sensitivity, and program dead zones for the analog sticks. You also get all of the neat features found in the regular DualSense controller, such as adaptive triggers and haptic feedback.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4329921-dualsenseedgedeal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329921" data-ratio="0.4" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4329921-dualsenseedgedeal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329921"></a><figcaption>DualSense Edge controller for PS5 and PC</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4329921-dualsenseedgedeal.jpg"></figure><p>"The DualSense Edge incorporates years of learnings from its competitors to present something that ticks all the right boxes for a good high-end video game controller and even improves the user experience in some key ways," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-dualsense-edge-review-go-pro/1100-6510867/" data-ref-id="1100-6510867">DualSense Edge review</a>.

                <p>Nintendo has revealed that Nintendo Switch Sports is getting a basketball update on Tuesday, June 9. While the free update was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-sports-adds-basketball-soon/1100-6524354/" data-ref-id="1100-6524354">announced last month</a>, a release date wasn't mentioned until now.</p><p>The basketball minigame is straightforward, where players can use motion controls to score as many baskets as they can in the three-point challenge. Four players can also compete against each other in a five-streak battle or three-point-contest, as well as play two-on-two matches.</p><p>Nintendo Switch Sports included six sports at launch, which were volleyball, badminton, bowling, soccer, chambara, and tennis. After launch, Nintendo added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-sports-update-adding-full-soccer-motion-controls-and-more-new-features/1100-6505760/" data-ref-id="1100-6505760">full soccer motion controls </a>as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-sports-free-golf-update-arrives-on-november-28/1100-6509377/" data-ref-id="1100-6509377">golf</a>. Now, more than two years since its release, it's finally getting basketball.</p><p>To put that in perspective, Nintendo Switch Sports is getting new content even further after launch than Animal Crossing: New Horizons did. That may come as a surprise, given that Nintendo Switch Sports sold 13.11 million copies as of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240507_3e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">March 31, 2024</a>, compared to Animal Crossing New Horizon's 45.3 million sales figure.</p><p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons launched in April 2020 and stopped receiving any further content after November 2021 with the Happy Home Paradise update, and has since been only getting patches to fix bugs.</p><p>Nintendo Switch Sports launched in April 2022. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-sports-review-better-together/1900-6417867/" data-ref-id="1900-6417867">Nintendo Switch Sports review</a>, we said, "Nintendo's latest motion-controlled sports game resparks the magic of playing with others, but not without a few fumbles along the way."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-2024-monk-gets-major-buffs-and-reworks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has previewed another reworked class coming to <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">D&amp;D</a> 2024</em>. The latest preview for the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG is the <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Monk. Thanks to player feedback and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-player-handbook-playtest-8-reworks-monk-druid-and-barbarian" rel="noopener" target="_blank">playtesting</a>, this master of martial arts has received several quality-of-life improvements</p>
<h2>The <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Monk Preview</h2>
<p>In an official post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1758-2024-monk-vs-2014-monk-whats-new">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast went into detail on the <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Monk. Much like the other classes previewed so far, the core fantasy of the class is mostly unchanged from <em>D&amp;D Fifth Edition</em>. Monks are still balletic martial artists fighting alongside spellcasters and dragons.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-monk-dragonborn-with-lantern.jpg?itok=MYSREIAD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-monk-dragonborn-with-lantern.jpg?itok=OIVNwff9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No chance of being eaten by a grue here.</figcaption></figure><p>But, as the player base has expressed, the Monk is underpowered in several areas. The <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Monk rework addresses some of these criticisms. The Monk's Martial Arts damage dice start at d6 and cap at d12. Patient Defense and Step of the Wind no longer cost Ki Points. Also, Ki Points have been renamed Focus Points.</p>
<p>The buffs continue with some reworked class features. Deflect Missiles has been changed to Deflect Attacks, letting Monks stop any source of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. Stunning Strike can only be used once per turn now, but the saving throw effects have changed so the target is debuffed on a success.</p>
<p>In addition, the <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Monk has received several new class features. Uncanny Metabolism lets you regain all Focus Points when you roll for Initiative once per Long Rest. Self-Restoration lets you end the Charmed, Frightened, or Poisoned condition at the end of your turn. And Heightened Focus improves Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind.</p>

Enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the preview showcases changes to the <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Monk subclasses. The Warrior of Mercy and Warrior of the Open Palm are mostly unchanged. The latter's Quivering Palm has been nerfed slightly. Instead of instantly dropping a target to 0 hp, it inflicts 10d12 Force Damage.</p>
<p>The subclass with the most changes is the Warrior of the Elements. One of the weakest Fifth Edition subclasses has received a glow-up, providing extended reach on martial arts attacks and the ability to deal fire, cold, acid, lightning, or thunder damage with each hit. They also receive a new cantrip, Elementalism, which creates elemental AoE bursts and provides damage resistance.</p>
<p>The <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Core Rulebooks are available for pre-order right now.</p>

While many enjoyed the ship-building and improved combat over past Bethesda RPGs, the game’s empty planets, boring quests, and lackluster space exploration disappointed players looking for the next <em>Skyrim </em>or <em>Fallout 4</em>. Thankfully, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-pc-mods-steam-temples-skip-starborn-powers-1850916181&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-pc-mods-steam-temples-skip-starborn-powers-1850916181">PC mods followed quickly after launch</a></span> and let people improve the game.

(It works similarly for the other mods, too.) </p><p>Adding <em>Star Wars </em>content to <em>Starfield </em>via mods has become very popular over the last few months. We recently saw <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-star-wars-mandalorian-mods-1851488038&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-star-wars-mandalorian-mods-1851488038">one content creator use over 100 mods</a></span> to basically turn Bethesda’s space RPG into a <em>Mandalorian </em>game. And if you peruse Bethesda’s official mods launcher you can find a ton of other <em>Star Wars-</em>themed mods that are now available on console, including lightsabers. </p><p>Now that I can wield a lightsaber and fly around in my favorite spaceship—the N1-Naboo Starfighter—I might finally have a good reason to play more <em>Starfield</em> on my Xbox Series X. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That's 13% off the $200 MSRP, which might not sound like too much, but the DualSense Edge is almost never discounted. Walmart+ members have early access to this deal until 5pm EST. This is part of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-deals-sale-is-live-prime-day-competition-heats-up">Walmart's larger sale</a> that competes with Amazon Prime Day. We don't expect to find a better deal during Prime Day. In fact, we doubt that Amazon will offer a deal on this controller at all.

You can swap out the standard analog stick tops with convex replacements that come in two different heights. You have two different options for the back buttons: levers like in the Xbox Elite Series 2 or smaller nubs. One of the most important features of any pro controller are the triggers, and they’ve gotten attention in the DualSense Edge as well. Next to each trigger is a stop slider that lets you adjust how far you have to press the trigger down to make it register. You can choose standard, medium, or short travel distances, the better to get off quick shots in competitive shooters.</p><p>All this tech is housed in a hard shell case for easy storage and transport. The case even has a flap that lets you charge the controller while it’s in the case. A 9-foot USB-C charging cable is also included.

                <p>Back in June, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-coming-to-amazon-tvs/1100-6524554/" data-ref-id="1100-6524554">announced a deal with Amazon</a> to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to Fire TV devices, and today, July 8, that functionality has gone live. What this means is the Xbox experience is now available in yet another place, and people do not need to buy an Xbox console to play.</p><p>As a <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">takeover ad on the Xbox website</a> reminds us, anyone with an Amazon Fire TV stick can now play games from within the Game Pass catalog. Beyond a Fire TV stick, you'll need some kind of controller. Xbox controllers are supported, of course, but a PlayStation controller works as well (<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/cloud-gaming/connect-controller-smart-tv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here is the full list of supported controllers</a>).</p><p>You'll need to be a subscriber to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to get access to cloud gaming as well, and of course, you'll want to have a fast and consistent internet connection. Microsoft recommends a wired connection for the best experience, or a 5Ghz wifi connection with 20 Mbps down.</p><p>Most games from the Game Pass catalog are available to stream over the cloud, but not all of them. You can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games#cloud" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit the Xbox website and use the "cloud" filter</a> to see a full list of supported games.</p><p>Xbox cloud gaming is supported in more than 25 countries around the world. You can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/regions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit the Xbox cloud gaming website </a>and search for your home country to see if you can stream games where you live.</p><p>The rollout of Xbox cloud gaming for Fire TV devices follows the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-samsung-xbox-tv-app-works-great-but-who-is-it-for/1100-6504321/" data-ref-id="1100-6504321">2022 launch of Xbox cloud gaming on some Samsung smart TVs</a>. Users also need to download the Xbox app for the Fire TV stick or Samsung smart TV.</p><p>Microsoft offers Xbox cloud gaming as an option for people who don't own an Xbox but still want to play Xbox games. The least expensive Xbox out there is the $300 Xbox Series S, after all. The company has always said it does not expect cloud gaming to overtake or replace the traditional hardware-based model, and to that end, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-talks-the-future-of-its-hardware-and-the-importance-of-backward-compatibility/1100-6523373/" data-ref-id="1100-6523373">Microsoft is cooking up a new Xbox device now.</a></p><p>Microsoft itself at one point was thinking about creating its own streaming-focused Xbox device of some type, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-why-the-xbox-streaming-console-isnt-ready-yet/1100-6509207/" data-ref-id="1100-6509207">Microsoft's R&amp;D teams couldn't get its components price down low enough for it to make sense as a commercial product.</a> So instead, Microsoft is working with companies like Amazon and Samsung to help expand Xbox's footprint in the streaming space.</p><p>Whereas Microsoft used to spend a lot of time, money, and attention on trying to convince people to buy new Xbox hardware, that isn't the company's sole focus any longer. The wider goal, it seems, is to expand the Xbox ecosystem to as many people as possible, and to convince them to sign up for Game Pass.</p><p>Circana reported on Monday, July 8 that Xbox Series X|S sales are down by 13% and also remain slightly behind Xbox 360 figures after the first 43 months in market. For comparison, PS5 unit sales are up 8% over PS4's sales over the same period of time. </p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/25/23423668/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-20-million-people-streamed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">More than 20 million</a> people have already used Xbox cloud gaming, and that figure no doubt stands to grow bigger still in the months and years to come.</p>

			<p>Dutch independent developer KeokeN Interactive, founded by brothers Koen Deetman and Paul Deetman, is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keoken/deliver-us-home?ref=discovery_category" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back on Kickstarter</a> for Deliver Us Home. KeokeN had to let go of almost all its employees not long ago, and now it's just the two brothers again (plus a couple of collaborators), making the crowdfunding proposition a necessity.</p>
<p>I spoke with Koen Deetman at length about what that means for this third entry in the sci-fi franchise, how they're coping as a small indie team, and much more. As a reminder, the Kickstarter campaign is active for three more days, with KeokeN looking to raise another €12K to fund the project.</p>

<p><strong>The last time we <a href="https://wccftech.com/deliver-us-the-moon-next-gen-and-deliver-us-mars-qa-with-keoken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> was ahead of the launch of the Deliver Us Mars. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/deliver-us-mars-the-fate-of-a-father/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In our review</a>, we called the sequel an improvement over the first one. But you had some issues in the studio, right? You also had to let go of most employees. What happened there? Was it an issue with low sales or was it something else?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We had a great development on Deliver Us Mars. It was absolutely a step up. I would like to think that that moment of crafting Deliver Us Mars was also very much part of our ambition in the studio. Besides trying to, of course, get into the same success rate as Deliver Us the Moon, we also tried to do new things and to show a little bit where our ambition was headed.</p>
<p>When we released in February 2023, which is when a lot of games were released, I don't think that the moment of release helped its performance. However, its sales were almost five times quicker than its predecessor. That was definitely not the problem. But when you saw the whole landscape of game publishing change every year, you saw that most of those deals relied on publishers recouping their budget. Once you understand what your landscape looks like, you cannot really sign anything else.</p>
<p>We were very open to our team and said that we had to fight for it in order to land a deal. But if the landscape changes this much, then yeah, connecting another project, was just really, really hard. As much as we tried, and we tried a multitude of things to make that a reality. But in the end, we just didn't make it with our core team intact.</p>
<p><strong>I guess one of the main issues in the industry is that it's harder to get funding. That's also what you're seeing, I imagine.</strong></p>
<p>Right. It's more or less where risks are just not being taken in the same way. Of course, interest rates have gone up. I think it's the publishers who are just not connecting to their investors anymore as much or getting enough resources available to them. They are in a position where they just have to take a bet on something that is far more guaranteed, in a way. That makes the whole landscape a lot harder or a lot more competitive to the midsection towards indie.</p>
<p><strong>Basically, there is no more space unless you are a really, really low-cost indie team or a big AAA developer.</strong></p>
<p>That's essentially the case. You can see that. It seems like the big AAA companies can safeguard themselves in time, and then there's a huge gap where safety only begins if you are an indie developer of, say, three or four or five people.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Risks are just not being taken in the same way in funding games.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>With Deliver Us Home, you're returning to Kickstarter after using the platform for the first game. For a few years, crowdfunding seemed to fall out of fashion, but with all these issues in the game industry, maybe developers are rediscovering this tool as a means to fund their projects.</strong></p>
<p>It's interesting that you say that. It's where it all started. Paul and I were just discussing that we were very much on time to try and pitch a new project. This was in 2020/2021. Throughout those years, we had amazing discussions with several partners. I think that we talked to around fifty publishers. What was eventually the case is that if you have your own IP or a new IP, the risk is more in whether this IP is going to land a big audience or is going to return its investment. But if it's a known IP, then it's more or less, is it something that is lucrative in that business?</p>
<p>After pitching almost 200 times, we always seemed to have been bounced back and forth about something in the end. It was either too expensive or too cheap, or we had something with the game that was not particularly to their liking. Maybe we were too niche, or for someone else, too commercial. It was always about listening to what they wanted.</p>
<p>But we were like, can we go back to what we want? After we had to make this tough decision, and we had something like, ok, so what brought us success in the first place? Then we saw that crowdfunding is not particularly in the same area as back in 2016 because it was different back then.</p>
<p>We felt like, what if we would develop the game closer? We saw that the prototype project that we opened up in a small video was something that was actually very applauded. So we were like, what if that can help maybe develop a better sequel in the series. Right now, it does show potential from a different perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Definitely, if you want to make a specific game that publishers don't want to fund, maybe Kickstarter or crowdfunding in general is the best way forward. Will you be working with the community on certain aspects of the game? How open are you to feedback?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I have to say that working with a, let's say, 45+ team as we've done for Deliver Us Mars at the peak and now being back to just us two ( plus two very, very nice people who are still with us trying to help out where they can)&nbsp;brought this challenge in front of us. We had all these hard decisions made by getting the company scaled down to zero. But then we were also tasked with creating a demo that is engaging and interesting enough for the Kickstarter campaign, plus the trailer in time to release it literally the month after. So we had this at the start of May and released the Kickstarter campaign in June.</p>
<p>As much as that is a crazy endeavor, this was great. For Deliver Us Mars, I've been running the project as a game director and now here I was creating holograms and parts of the level myself again. Also, it's shown us what we were capable of doing in our series creatively that we didn't necessarily - well, if I look at what the people who played our demo are saying, it doesn't necessarily detract from any expectancy they have. It might actually be more mysterious, something that they really like from the series. So, it's not necessarily a bad thing. That's something we've come to learn now that we are almost through the Kickstarter campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any plans to release the demo of Deliver Us Home at some point on Steam?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, anyone who backs us right now for the game already gets the demo and we are actually developing it now closer to the community. We got a lot of feedback, actually, in great directions. If you look at Steam Next Fest, we explicitly didn't put it in there because we thought we were not really showing a demo of a product that was about to be released. We were like, maybe that's not the place right now, but now that it's forming, we do have ideas on that. We're not sure yet, but it seems to be interesting to try it out, maybe even to get some wish listing interest or to get some eyes on the demo as it really develops in a great state. It is still a prototype demo, but far more finished and interesting to show there. We'll definitely talk about it.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Deliver Us Home will be more in the player's control.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You talked about the studio being much smaller than it was with Mars, right? Can you speak to how this changes what you're able to do with this new game? Should fans expect Deliver Us Home to be a smaller game in content and scope?</strong></p>
<p>Deliver Us The Moon was the debut. We set the tone there; that was the game people take as a basis. Then we got to Mars, which was more about the ambition as a studio and the level of quality we would like to reach.</p>
<p>Of course, now we have scaled back to being this very lean, tiny indie team again. We are super open to first honoring the series' strength. That push to drive forward is something that we want to kind of return to. That goes hand in hand with player agency. Mars was more on rails, so we really want to loosen up that grip. In that sense, Deliver Us Home will be more in the player's control.</p>
<p>Over the years, we didn't want to create an open world, but we did want wide linearity, where the player still needs to rely on their senses and figure out what's going on in the environment. If you combine that with some customizations, you can have more control over your astronaut suit. There's something you can build up to or maybe track towards or collect towards. We added as much as we could do realistically with four people in a month.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of gameplay, what are the main changes players will notice compared to the previous titles?</strong></p>
<p>The platforming aspect in Deliver Us The Moon was nearly non-existent. In Deliver Us Mars, we really took a huge bet on platforming in general. Some of those things were a hit and some of those were a miss. The climbing was something we really like to add a bit of danger, but it was maybe found a little bit hard at times by some players. So instead, we upgraded climbing to be more traditional.</p>
<p>We also thought that you could upgrade your suit, for example, with something like a jet pack part that could give you that double jump to reach other locations. That could give you interesting ways to explore your areas. We're looking into those things.</p>
<p>In the demo, you don't really know where you are. It's almost like an Earth-like planet or something. We also thought, what if you encountered something in your environment that could be a danger to you as a character? In the demo, we toy around with something like a bear. The pressure of that is very interesting and feeds into this element of mystery and unknown. Why is it there? Is it actually there? Where is it? And I think that those elements give you a bit of a thrill while you are finding out more about our story and what happened there.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, that gives that sort of a feel back, especially from Deliver Us The Moon, but even one-offs, such as a Morse code puzzle game where you literally have to listen to the radio and hear some sort of Morse code come through. That code translates to something that you find that you can actually open a door in.</p>
<p>What I like in that Morse code tidbit is that the frequency is always different. If anyone wants to try to find this place, then they cannot look it up on the Internet because you actually have to learn and listen to what the code is. So there's nobody that's going to say what the code is because it's always changing.</p>
<p><strong>From a story standpoint, can you at least give us a hint as to where there is a connection with the previous stories and protagonists from previous games?</strong></p>
<p>When we started Deliver Us The Moon, we always envisioned this as a series, although we were not really sure how long yet. At the very least, we knew there could be a couple of games. Moon and Mars are set up as standalone games, just like Deliver Us Home, but we always try to find something of the backstory or something else that combines all these games together.</p>
<p>Without spoiling the whole surprise with the ideas we had for this new one, it is going to be about an astronaut now fighting to secure a home for humanity. But yeah, players can be assured they will find traces from the previous games. Also, if there is unfinished business in the previous games, we will absolutely make sure that we find creative ways to either answer them or build upon them.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using Unreal Engine 5, or is this still made with UE4?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, to kind of win speed, because we're just a few people now coming from a bigger team, we use UE4. That was the quickest way for us to craft something that could be convincing enough to bring over our ideas.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a huge urge, especially now that we're smaller, to upgrade to UE5, which is, in multiple ways, maybe even better than UE4 for a smaller team. This is one of our wishes. It's part of the plan. Also, we're all aware of ray tracing and all that stuff. We at least want the game to support it, but we're unsure if it's sensible to do that right away. So we are not guaranteeing it. However, we always try to be in tune with what the series is expecting.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We would like to upgrade to Unreal Engine 5.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I remember the first game <a href="https://wccftech.com/raytracing-and-nvidia-dlss-added-to-deliver-us-the-moon-nvidia-points-out-dlss-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was one of the first to add ray tracing</a>. Now, some games have gone full path tracing.</strong></p>
<p>By the time we're in a close-to-released version, then absolutely, we have the neck to be upfront with those technologies and try to figure out if that's possible for us. That's why we love Unreal 5 and would like to upgrade. The latest version of Unreal Engine has always helped our environments come to life.</p>
<p><strong>You will soon launch Deliver Us The Moon on Nintendo Switch. Would you be interested in launching the rest of the franchise on Nintendo platforms, too, possibly the next console due in 2025?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Interesting question. The reality is we went from a 20-man team to 0. There's nothing we can actually promise anymore on those ports;&nbsp;however, there's always an intent. What we really like about Deliver Us The Moon is that even though it was released sporadically over the course of years, looking back at that cadence, it didn't really seem to have hurt our game.</p>
<p>Maybe the beginning could have been better, but you can see that as a smaller indie fighting for attention, some of those console releases can actually help. They become something of a moment and a part of the campaign or into the lifetime of the game where there's a little bit of attention to it.</p>
<p>So the fact that Deliver Us The Moon came out even on Stadia and old generation consoles, all in due time... Deliver Us The Moon was ported by another company. They said it was just not possible on the Switch. Now, though, they called me back and said they changed their mind. I was like, really? In a month's time, they kind of convinced me, showing that it was playable and I was like, well, maybe it is actually worth looking into. Eventually, we finished the game on Switch, and now it is coming out.</p>
<p>Realistically, though, we cannot promise or investigate these things right now. If we see an opportunity, we would love to bring it to more places, but it only depends on the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Soon, you'll be able to estimate the interest of Nintendo fans in the&nbsp;franchise.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. For me, it's also something of a breakthrough that we finally got something released on Nintendo. That's just really cool.</p>
<p><strong>They also have a really big install base.</strong></p>
<p>Indeed. It would be helpful if the game picked up at a great pace, but we are also realistic. I mean, it's an older game, but it looks quite great on Switch. I wasn't expecting it to be running like this, but I do recognize the game, and it's still a great experience. We're very excited that we made that happen.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Game Pass is absolutely something that we think about as a possibility.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Speaking of new technologies, how do you feel about the use of generative AI in games, such as with NPCs?</strong></p>
<p>Paul and I have had a lot of discussions about this. There's two things we recognize. This industry just keeps evolving. If we look back to where the games industry started 40 years ago, it is impressive how fast that change came about.</p>
<p>I do have sympathy for an artist, for example, who says, hey, it's also something I love to do and I don't want it to be replaced by something that's artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>However, I see it a little differently. If you were working in a shop like a factory and you were flipping pieces of, I don't know, maybe a car. That wasn't necessarily a great job, but at the very least it was making a living for some people, but at some point, that changed for robotic arms.</p>
<p>Now that worker is actually more in a control center, he controls the whole chain. I kind of see it a little bit like this as well. Instead of being very pessimistic about it, let's try to make use of it. Like, how are you able as a creative to control or work with it? As much as you are against it, I think it's inevitable. This is going to be a change of pace. It's gonna significantly decrease budgets in a way that can help evolve your game or your production. Then again, we need to be sensible because we also understand that it might take jobs that people would love to do rather than being happy that they are replaced.</p>
<p><strong>That's certainly the biggest problem in the industry, with some AAA games costing as much as $300 million to make. But generative AI can help indie teams like KeokeN, too, in doing a better game even with just a handful of people.</strong></p>
<p>True. For example, I remember that concept artists were used to create a sense of idea. But now, we don't necessarily replace them because even if you generate something, it doesn't really come down to something that you exactly want.</p>
<p>But helping the artist teams speed up the process of crafting an idea or crafting a certain concept was already—we don't necessarily use it in a final game, but it does help set an idea, set what people want to explain or try out in the game. That's something quite powerful, actually, as it helps rather speed up the understanding.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about potentially adding your games to a subscription service like Game Pass or something similar? Would that help reduce the risk in a situation like yours?</strong></p>
<p>In the past, we've seen Deliver Us The Moon launch on Game Pass. With all our previous games, there was a publisher with us that was either negotiating this or dealing with it eventually.</p>
<p>I can see how a deal like that can help an independent company. It is absolutely something we think of as a possibility. Then again, there's no guarantees to that. We know there are lines and lines of developers lining up to get there.</p>
<p>I think because the landscape has changed so much, for us, it turned more into that we had to deal with how to get our people to a safe place or get them new jobs.</p>
<p>Of course, we were trying to set things up, but it was not really realistic at that point. Right now, we could actually think of it and how that would change our course of development, especially because we're now so lean in that sense that those deals could be very feasible. But like I said, we're not having any guarantees yet for that&nbsp;or any conversation, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>I asked because some developers are openly pro subscription services, while others are vehemently against them.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe a good thing to say about Game Pass is I am not so sure what the impact on your overall success in sales figures is particularly, but I do know that Game Pass is a great discovery tool for an indie.</p>
<p>We saw a lot of change in pace when we were on Game Pass. People just knew the game. Even the sentiment around it, I think there were over a million plays for Deliver Us The Moon on Game Pass. A lot of people know our game because of it. That is absolutely valuable. In the end, of course, as this is a business, you also need to make sure that you can survive on it.</p>
<p>There needs to be a great middle ground in some way where it is something that you can live from, something that generates enough eyes and commercial value that your game gets discovered.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Scoping down doesn't necessarily mean that the game is going to be less fun to play.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>On that note, did you ever think about whether your games would be successful on mobile? More and more developers are porting their titles. CAPCOM, for instance, has recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-7-biohazard-coming-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-on-july/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ported</a> Resident Evil games to iPhone and iPad. The Deliver Us franchise may be even better suited since it's more adventure than action.</strong></p>
<p>It has passed our minds. This is maybe a little bit strange because I'm from a generation that was very used to gaming on a PC or console, but I can see with my kids nowadays that the phone or the tablet is probably the first thing that they're going to say that they played a game on.</p>
<p>We haven't really made solid plans for it, but I remember we had some research done on what it would take to bring Deliver Us The Moon to a mobile device. Nothing really came out of it because the fires that we have been fighting were more pressing, but our minds have been there.</p>
<p>Your way of saying it might spark me to check back into this because you're right. It's potentially something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>I believe it could do well. Also, nowadays, phones are powerful enough to run it. Anyway,</strong> <strong>I don't know if you have anything else you'd like to say about Deliver Us Home that we haven't already touched upon.</strong></p>
<p>We are going, to some extent, back to our roots. We always fight to get this game out there because we also see that the community's sentiment is absolutely there and fighting for it with us. That's&nbsp;something that's extremely nice to see.</p>
<p>Maybe not super surprising, but a little bit surprisingly, it gets to a better state, maybe a more unique and surprising state of the game than we initially thought. Scoping down doesn't necessarily mean that the game is going to be less fun to play.</p>
<p>We have a lot of things invested in the series already, and we can creatively use a lot of cool things that result in an exciting third game. We are on Kickstarter until the 11th of July. That's where we pick it off and see where we go up next.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-tsushima-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-in-may-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest gaming sales data</a> has been released for May 2024, and with it comes the most recent numbers regarding overall current-generation console sales. Both the PlayStation 5 (PS5) and Xbox Series X|S were released the same week back in 2020, but both have had different sales journeys.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810379504218681666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, the PS5 is outselling the PS4 by 8% through its first 43 months. On the other side of things, however, the Xbox Series consoles are behind the Xbox One in sales during the same timespan by 13%. They also sit behind the Xbox 360 during that same period.</p>



<p>Though percentages were given, the Circana data didn’t give specifically unit totals for the PS5 and Xbox Series. That said, <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a> says that, as of June 1, the PS5 has sold 58.78 million units while the Xbox Series has sold 28.74 million. </p>



<p>For the month of May 2024, specifically, the PS5 led the way in hardware sales in both units sold and dollars. The Xbox Series came in 3rd in total units behind the Switch but 2nd in dollars. As a whole, however, year-on-year sales numbers have declined by a <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810379249922331004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“double-digit percentage”. </a></p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch had the “most significant” fall year-on-year.  Overall, sales are 30% lower year-to-date than in 2023.</p>

            <p>
Respawn Entertainment has announced Apex Legends' upcoming Season 22 will make significant changes to the free-to-play shooter's Battle Pass "experience", by releasing two Battle Passes per season instead of one, and then charging full price for each.
</p>
<p>
As of Season 22, Apex Legends will ditch its current season-long Battle Pass in favour of two half-season Battle Passes - one launching at a season's start and another at its mid-point "split" - each featuring 60 levels of rewards, compared to the previous version's 110.
</p>
<p>
Despite the truncated number of progression levels, each new half-season premium Battle Pass costs approximately the same as the older season-long version. Previously, a premium Battle Pass cost 950 Apex Coins (a 1000-coin bundle is priced at $9.99 USD), and Respawn's new half-season Battle Passes cost $9.99 each. A new Premium+ tier (replacing the existing Premium Bundle) is $19.99 every half-season, and a free tier remains available.

<p>
Additionally, the overhauled Battle Pass will no longer be purchasable using Apex Coins (previously,  coins earned in one Battle Pass could be spent on the next) and is only available by spending real money. "The decision to move from [premium currency] is not one that we made lightly," Respawns writes in its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update">announcement post</a>, "but it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community."
</p>
<p>It also insists the Battle Pass changes are required to make the system "more approachable and realistic for our global player community", and that the "updated aspects... make the Battle Pass more attainable and valuable for your time and money".
</p>
<p>
Respawn's "value" argument more specifically relates to the reward "refresh" it's making across all three tiers of its Battle Passes. These adjustments have seen the removal of lesser-used rewards, twice as many Crafting Materials now being awarded across a season, three more Legendary/Epic Apex Packs per Battle Pass, plus additional rewards for the Premium+ tier as per the infographic below. Respawn claims these changes amount to "double the Battle Pass rewards across the entire season".

<p>
Unsurprisingly, the community response to Respawn's Battle Pass changes has been far from positive, with comments over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1dyblr3/apex_legends_battle_pass_updates_season_22/">Apex Legends' subreddit</a> calling the move everything from an "abysmal decision" and "a truly embarrassing money grab" to "the worst fucking shit I've ever seen". The <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515">announcement on Twitter/X</a> has over 2.9K replies at the time of writing, and the general sentiment is overwhelmingly negative.
</p>
<p>
Will the community outcry be enough to convince Respawn and publisher EA to reverse the decision? Time will tell, but for now, Respawn is hoping to reel players into the new system by giving away Apex Legends' first half-season Battle Pass for free when it launches alongside Season 22 later this year - but it'll only be free for those players who log in and complete a set of challenges within the first two weeks of its release.
</p>
<p>
Apex Legends' 21st season, Upheaval, started in May and is due to conclude in August.
