            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Former President of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, indie game and PS Vita champion, and much-missed industry star Shuhei Yoshida has appeared on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Perfect Console with Simon Parkin</a> podcast and revealed his top five games.</p>
<p>Before we get into those, can I recommend you check out the full podcast at some point, it’s a really great listen with lots of wonderful stories about PlayStation and game development. You can find the podcast on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/my-perfect-console-with-simon-parkin/id1665581266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6PzHHkwpOs8YFgzqoKRXAi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify</a> and all the usual places.</p>


<p>On to his game choices and the first title he picked was PlayStation 3 and Vita classic,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/journey/"> <strong>Journey</strong></a></p>
<p>“The impact the game had to human emotions was so powerful,&nbsp;I don’t remember any other game (doing that) before Journey,” said Shu. “People played the game and had tears in their eyes, so that shows the power of the medium and at the same time power of indie games.”</p>
<p><iframe title="JOURNEY | 10 Year Anniversary Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FZkTXs3Td8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Next up was another PS Vita game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sound-shapes/"><strong>Sound Shapes.</strong></a></p>

<p>“What was brilliant about the game was it allowed ou to create your own levels. As you play the game, you gain these objects and you are free to lay out and draw things. That was such a creative game,&nbsp;especially when you play on PS Vita. (PS Vita) has touch, so it is very easy to lay out your level and because you play with headphones and the music, it’s really kind of perfect on PS Vita.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Sound Shapes™Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zfPbJE6XDxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>His third choice is<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/inscryption/"> <strong>Inscryption</strong></a>, a PC game published by Devolver Digital that eventually made it to PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>“It’s very hard to talk about the game because I don’t want to create a spoiler,” said Shu. “I really want people to try this game without any knowledge. This is one of the games that makes me want to erase my memory so I can replay the game.”</p>
<p>“I played through the game twice because I really, really loved it, but the first time I played, I went, “What?”, you know, “What’s going on?” It’s such an amazing creative work by this, you know, young individual Daniel Mullins, and it was really fun.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Inscryption | Accolades Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aneRbQGRIMc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The fourth game is another indie title, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/before-your-eyes/"><strong>Before Your Eyes</strong></a>. The game is the story of a young boy and it has a unique method of control, the game advances when you blink. Shu explained how he convinced the young developers to bring the game to PS VR2.</p>
<p>“I met them at a BAFTA pre-event gala. Everybody is dressed up and there are these two youngsters who looked like the didn’t know what to do, and so I talked to them! Because PSVR 2 has the eye tracking it’s the best way to play Before Your Eyes because you are put in exactly the position of the boy and you’re able to see the scene from boy’s perspective. I want every single human being to try this game because this game’s amazing.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Before Your Eyes - Launch Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9OhfCk51Mo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Finally is a PC and console game from last year, <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nine-sols/">Nine Sols.</a></strong></p>
<p>“It was my Game of the Year game last year,” said Shu. “There are many Souls-like games and Metroidvania game but they came up with unique, secular-like, 2D action game with beautiful graphics and really interesting stories and amazing, amazing gameplay.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NineSols - Console Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NYJLa2HOQhI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Shu also revealed that his degree in Economics is probably not worth the paper it is written on.</p>
<p>“I majored in economics,” he explains. “Not that I was interested in economcs, but I knew that it’s so easy to graduate from university if I major in economics. Especially at Kyoto University, it was notorious that they just let people graduate. I didn’t even have to attend the classes.”</p>
<p>“There’s only one exam per year for each class and it was pre-announced so people who attended the classes created the ideal answers, and that was distributed. We just copied that into our paper and submit it!”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>In the last year or two, Microsoft has been very vocal about its desire to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/xbox-reiterates-its-support-for-switch-2">support Switch and Switch 2</a>. We've seen a couple of examples of this on the new hardware with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> and the soon-to-come <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, but where's the <strong>Gears</strong>? Where's the <strong>Call of Duty</strong>? Where's the <strong>Halo?</strong> As it turns out, we're not the only ones who are a little surprised by the lack of support so far.</p>
<p>Reggie Fils-Aimé recently took a break from playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a> on his Nintendo 3DS to sit down with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">The Game Business</a>' Christopher Dring and talk all things Switch 2. Microsoft's pledged support was one of the topics that cropped up in conversation, and the former NoA president confessed that he'd expected to see more.</p>
<p>"I'm surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective," Reggie said, "Certainly some games could easily be ported over to the Switch 2". He even went more specific with his predictions, stating, "I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday. All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement. And I'm surprised it hasn't happened."</p>
<p>Recent months have seen <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gears_of_war_reloaded">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> blast onto PS5, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/halo_campaign_evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> will be making a similar leap at some point next year. Phil Spencer has said, time and again, how keen he is to support Nintendo systems, so it makes sense that Reggie might have been expecting more, particularly with two of the studio's biggest franchises already venturing to pastures new.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that Mr. Fils-Aimé has necessarily been disappointed with the Switch 2's software slate so far, though he admits that he's found Nintendo's output a little confusing: "From a business perspective, when I first saw that lineup, I scratched my head a little bit" — come on, who honestly had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> on their launch year bingo card?</p>
<p>"What I underestimated was the enhanced Nintendo Switch 1 content, which I think has been compelling," he continued. "The stuff that you get for free as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I think that has helped drive some of the momentum. And then certainly, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> was a key driver for them.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Reggie discusses the console war, Switch 2's meaty sales numbers and what the future of the industry might look like. You'll find a video version at the top of this article, or you can check it out in writing over on <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">The Game Business</a> website.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-pokopia-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-2-in-march-2026-seems-to-be-another-game-key-card-release.1350073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The cozy farming Pokémon spin-off game from Koei Tecmo, Pokémon Pokopia, finally has a release date after being <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-pokopia-pokemon-spin-off-cozy-farming-game-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">announced this past September during a Nintendo Direct event</a>. At the time, it was slated to arrive sometime in 2026, though now we know it'll arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 on March 5, 2026, and that it appears to be a game-key card release.</p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia, if you need the reminder, is the game where you play as a Ditto that transforms itself into an imitation of a human, who then begins to operate a Pokémon farm and create a paradise for its fellow Pokémon, while those Pokémon help plant, water, maintain crops, and carve out a peaceful life.</p>



<p>Nintendo did not initially clarify that Pokémon Pokopia would be a game-key card release, but in a new video published today showcasing how game-key cards work, it was featured as one of the examples. If it is a game-key card release, then, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-pokopia-appears-to-be-the-first-nintendo-published-switch-2-game-to-be-on-a-game-key-card/">VGC</a>, this would mark the first Nintendo-published title to be a game-key card version.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though game developers have spoken out about <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-forced-choice/">game-key cards as a means of overcoming the limits that come with using cartridges</a>, that hasn't stopped the feature from being controversial among players, with many decrying game-key card releases on the grounds of game preservation, since they are physical cartridges that do not contain any actual game data.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Nintendo has claimed its first-party titles, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-nintendo-switch-2-mario-and-zelda-games-wont-be-game-key-card-versions-nintendo-says/">Mario and Zelda games, would not be game-key card releases</a>, but the distinction of what will be released as a game-key card and what won't be now seems to be between Nintendo first-party developed titles and titles Nintendo is simply publishing. Pokémon Pokopia is developed by Game Freak and Koei Tecmo, with The Pokémon Company publishing it in Japan, and Nintendo publishing it globally.</p>

            <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-game-awards-confirms-its-future-class-program-will-remain-on-ice">Game Developer</a> reported that the organisers of Geoff Keighley-fronted industry awards show/advertising extravaganza The Game Awards had revealed that they've got no plans to do anything with their Future Class initiative this year. That's left the programme, founded in 2020 with the goal of highlighting up and coming talents in and around game development, facing a black hole of a future. Even worse, those featured by the initiative during the years it did run have been left feeling frustrated and unable to access the webpage which confirms they were ever part of the programme.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A number of developers featured by the Future Class initiative and who remain part of its dedicated Discord server have now spoken to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/11/future-class-gamings-oscars-game-awards">The Guardian</a> about how the programme's fate's left them feeling. They've also documented some back-and-forths between themselves and The Game Awards' organisers, including face of the games man Geoff Keighley, over improvements the members wished to see made to the programme and a desire for the 2023 edition of the show to acknowledge <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8641wv0n4go">Israel's ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza</a>.</p>
<p>The former push was reportedly rooted in negative experiences nominees in the early years of the Future Class had when attending the show. "We were effectively props," game producer and 2020 class member Dianna Lora said, with examples like a Starbucks meetup which the members felt sidelined them, seats for the main show being camped behind camera risers that obstructed views, and mentorship programmes over the following year being limited to brief Zoom chats with industry figures.</p>
<p>While that advocacy has resulted in generally more positive experiences for more recent nominees according to the report, members' efforts to convince Keighley and co to read out a statement during 2023's Game Awards expressing support for Palestine and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza resulted in their <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-game-awards-israel-palestine-open-letter-future-class/">open letter</a> being ignored. Keighley, who didn't respond to The Guardian's request for comment (I've also reached out), is alleged by one of the members to have sat looking "incensed" during a subsequent call in which some members recommended the awards ceremony feature the likes of more female presenters and acknowledge that year's mass developer layoffs.</p><p>Many members have been left frustrated, especially after the Future Class archive of inductees was removed from The Game Awards' site, while some have also been left questioning whether their efforts to advocate for improvements to the programme and acknowledgement of key issues might have contributed to the initiative being left in limbo. "Ever since [we pushed back] it was like, ‘This is too much trouble, might as well peace out’," Lora said, while community manager Natalie Checo added: "As a result of advocating for ourselves (the very thing that we were inducted for), we were punished for doing the same thing that they ostensibly celebrated us for."</p>
<p>A silver lining to the situation is that the members have apparently stuck together as a Discord community and continue to do so. So, as flawed and cynical as The Game Awards' Future Class has reportedly been, at least it's seemingly helped bring some like-minded folks with noble goals together.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-shiny-hunting-ebay-black-market-2000642982</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It is exhausting seeing how many aspects of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>experience people try to exploit as part of some money-making scheme. The cards are obviously the most prominent example of this, as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers and the content creation mill</span></a><span> have turned the act of buying and selling packs into a lucrative business at the expense of players being able to derive </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658"><span>any joy from the hobby</span></a><span>. But people selling </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>-related stuff</span> <span>for a profit isn’t limited to physical goods. Nowadays, you can find someone asking for real-world cash for a Shiny Pokémon in games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142"><span>how much easier </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>makes it</span></a><span> to find the rare, alternate-colored ‘mons in Lumiose City, some folks would rather just fork over some of their hard-earned money to save themselves a few hours of grinding to make one of them spawn. At least, that’s what some sellers on places like eBay are banking on. If you search for Shiny Pokémon on the site, you’ll find dozens of listings, some selling specific creatures and others letting people specify the Shiny they’re seeking. One of the most expensive offerings includes a </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/167871843921?_skw=pokemon+legends+z-a+shiny&amp;itmmeta=01K9SS6250KZXESVT648WYM062&amp;hash=item2715f10e51:g:qrYAAeSwNkRo-Pgk&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1cmZMWT%2BJmOrrmcpCm9OPCOq%2F6C5X%2FOvRyhCN6Xbr3piM4Xf0yos%2Bgp99jZhgqUClMlqLGYsp%2Fijcj6Fn92F5x8KzHOf%2BYl6iTUbSbF67RqNNpK2soagMaN3RJ3fd%2BLuzrXiris2fOv5f9FwaYiG4IUgsCYY35bTh354GI2XLjyRcZnn%2BC6VAfT1oLyhUq%2Bt2gyS9DOMuwqTv8AVsDe8gKXlah20yBDsXzsouFU%2FpRLVXX4XcR7e7D%2FrHAT4dZZFEfjtuW1nAo3YDWCSnNJj59y%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR9SimLnOZg"><span>full “Living Dex” of every Shiny Pokémon in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> for $300</span></a><span>. There’s also a cheaper (but still very expensive) </span><a href="https://ebay.us/m/kYPhJ1"><span>$80 listing for every Shiny Mega Evolution Pokémon</span></a><span> in the game thus far. That’s more than it costs to buy the game itself.</span></p> <p><span>I understand that for a lot of people, the joy of shinies is not in the exhausting hunt and they just want to put these rare creatures in their party or in a box so they can say they have them. But man, I can’t imagine being that devoted to Shiny Pokémon that you’d be willing to fork over real-world money for one, especially when they aren’t limited-time offerings. I wasn’t surprised when scalpers were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-koraidon-miraidon-gamestop-codes-scalper-2000629926"><span>selling free Shiny Miraidon and Koraidon codes</span></a><span> because GameStop had made that an issue of false scarcity. But people are often willing to spend money to save themselves time. So I guess this isn’t that different from spending money on microtransactions to skip through a waiting period in an app. But at least with those, you don’t have to haggle and negotiate on something that was never meant to have a real-world monetary value. Go with Arceus, friends. Make responsible decisions.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>10 years ago this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-fallout-4-switch-2-2026-anniversary-edition-trailer-xbox-ps5-2000638638"><em>Fallout 4</em></a> launched across console and PC. It’s a big milestone for the open-world RPG. And Bethesda has decided to celebrate it by pushing out a new update that seemingly breaks the game for a lot of people and releasing some overpriced and confusing DLC. Yay?</p>

 <p>First announced in October, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/377160/announcements/detail/814714767715337534">the <em>Fallout 4</em> Anniversary Update</a> is now live across all platforms. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-anniversary-bethesda-update-mods-creation-2000641340">This update fixes an old issue in VATS</a>, makes a few other tweaks, and, more importantly, adds Creations to<em> Fallout 4</em>. This is Bethesda’s cross-platform mod solution that is already present in <em>Skyrim</em> and <em>Starfield</em>. It lets people create content for<em> Fallout 4</em> that can then be downloaded on consoles and PC. Some of this content costs money, but a lot of it is free. It’s a fine system, but when the<em> Fallout 4</em> update launched on Monday, it was completely broken.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1ou1p8a/thanks_todd_i_really_hate_you_now/">Over on Reddit,</a> players began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1otjmcr/already_off_to_a_great_start/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sharing screenshots of the Creations menu in <em>Fallout 4</em> failing to load anything</a> or just spitting out error messages. This is a problem for content that costs money, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1otx4yt/8_pipboy_skin_no_preview_image/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">like an $8 Pipboy skin</a> that had a broken preview window, making it impossible to actually see what it looked like before buying. Not great! Thankfully, Bethesda seems to be aware of the issues with the Creations menu and has reportedly fixed things, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1otkr3p/official_discord_statement_on_dropped_ball_for/">according to an official comment from the publisher on Discord</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1oubg15/all_my_dlcs_got_deleted_and_the_option_to_install/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">However,</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1otn1cw/fallout_4_anniversary_update_breaks_game_and_adds/">the update itself is still causing lots of players headaches</a>. People are reporting that<em> Fallout 4</em> save games are being destroyed. Others are reporting that after the update, they can’t play because <em>Fallout 4</em> requires the installation of previously purchased DLC, even though it’s already installed. My brother had this happen to him when booting up<em> Fallout 4</em> on Steam and gave up trying to play. Others are dealing with new bugs, glitchy menus, and more. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1ou1p8a/thanks_todd_i_really_hate_you_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">And these problems exist on both PC and console.</a></p>

 <h2><em>Fallout 4</em>‘s new DLC is being trashed by Steam users</h2> <p>Beyond the bugs, the<em> Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</em> is also causing some confusion. There are now three versions of <em>Fallout 4</em> that you can buy: The base original game, a<em> Game of the Year Edition</em>, and now the<em>&nbsp;Anniversary Edition.</em> But, despite the name of that last edition, you don’t need to buy it to access the new Anniversary update, which is free to all <em>Fallout 4</em> players. And confusingly, there’s an Anniversary Edition upgrade for people who already own <em>Fallout 4 a</em>nd its DLC. But you can also just buy the newly released <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1oti07g/fyi_for_steam_users_the_anniversary_edition/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">$20 Fallout 4 Creations Bundle separately</a> from all of this and gain access to the new content included in the <em>Anniversary Edition.</em> Does any of this make sense to you?</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642968" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642968"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642968">©</figcaption></figure> <p>Yeah, somehow, Bethesda has made buying a 10-year-old video game a complicated and confusing mess that now requires research and a fucking chart. And even if you figure it all out, some players are reporting that <em>Fallout 4</em> might not even load the new bundle properly due to various bugs.</p>

 <p>This all likely explains why <em>Fallout 4</em> on Steam has seen an influx of negative reviews. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3868650/Fallout_4__Creations_Bundle/">Meanwhile, the Creations Bundle on Steam has a completely negative review status,</a> with people furious over the price tag, how broken everything is, the fact that the new update broke many mods, and the confusion around all of this.</p>

 <p>“Hot garbage. My advice is to avoid buying this out of spite. Not only is this going to break your game, but the content itself is broken,” says one negative Steam review.</p> <p>And making all of this more frustrating is that just last year, Bethesda broke<em> Fallout 4</em> in a whole bunch of <em>different</em> but similarly annoying ways with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-ps5-ps-plus-steam-mods-game-pass-bugs-1851438302">controversial “next-gen update.</a>” At this point, I think Bethesda needs to just fix <em>Fallout 4</em>‘s current mess, say sorry, and never, ever, ever update the game again. Just move on. Let it be.</p>

<p>You can purchase and wear the Exoskeleton from Death Stranding 2 starting in December 2025; however, limited stock is available. </p>



<p>As players wait for Death Stranding to reach new mediums, with A24 set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-a24-original-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tell an original story</a>, and another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-animated-movie-brings-on-raised-by-wolves-screenwriter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animated film</a> in the works as well, players can look forward to something tangible in the coming months. Kojima Productions has partnered with Dnsys to bring a co-branded DS2 Exoskeleton, and here’s all you need to know about it. </p>







<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-exoskeleton-works-similar-to-the-ones-in-the-game">Death Stranding 2 Exoskeleton Works Similar to the Ones in the Game</h2>



<p>The collaboration between Kojima Productions and Dnsys for the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach limited edition exoskeleton was revealed through an official post on <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1987884067178852705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter).

<p>The exoskeleton will provide knee pressure relief, with users able to offload “up to 200%” of their body weight from the knees, and it also helps.

The device will provide “AI gait control across rugged trails, stairs, and slopes,” and users can look forward to “4+ hours of continuous support, with quick-swap batteries.” </p>

                <p>Sony has shared its latest update for investors, and it's largely good news for PlayStation 5. According to Sony, an additional 3.9 million PS5 consoles were sold in the last quarter, bringing its lifetime total to 84.2 million consoles sold since the system launched in 2020. That puts the PS5 into a virtual dead heat with its predecessor, PlayStation 4, at the same point in its life cycle.</p><p>The complete breakdown of Sony's latest fiscal quarter is <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">now online</a>, and its sales chart shows the remarkably similar trajectory of the PS4 and PS5 sales. However, Sony noted that it only projects 15 million additional PS5 console sales during its current fiscal year, which runs through March 31, 2025. If so, that would potentially allow PS4 to retain its crown as Sony's second best-selling console, because it sold 17.8 million systems at that point in its life.</p><p>Regardless, Sony CFO Lin Tao suggested that the PS5 may have a longer lifespan than the traditional seven-year cycle.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1988200080101569014" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Sony CFO Lin Tao says the PS5 is only in the middle of its lifecycle and they want to expand the lifecycle even further!<br>"Our view is that compared to conventional console lifecycles.

"Sony is now clearly dominating the high fidelity console gaming space, and just watch what happens to their numbers once GTA 6 is out."</p><p>Sony's report also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a> has sold 3.3 million copies since its debut just over a month ago.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Happy Bloodborne remake day! Wait let's not get ahead of ourselves. Sony's delivering a State of Play broadcast this evening from 10pm UK time and we'll be covering all of the announcements, as they happen, right here in this article. It's like magic and it's very handy for if you're out but don't want to miss out.</p>
<p>What's more - and as if you needed any encouragement - you can chat along with us. Tell us what you think and how you think the show is going. Give it a rating out of 10 if you like. You don't even have to use a star system.</p>
<p>So what's Sony's plan for the evening? The show will be 40 minutes long and focus on PS5 games made in Japan and Asia, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow">Sony said yesterday</a>, "alongside a few other exciting updates". The PS5 is just turning five years old, incidentally, which could provide Sony with a moment for a meaningful announcement.</p>
<p>And what more meaningful announcement is there to make, you say, than a Bloodborne remake? What indeed, fair reader, what indeed! After all, wasn't Bloodborne made in Japan? The stars are aligning. The stage is set. Do it, Sony, you cowards - do it!</p>
<p><em>Ahem.</em></p>
<p>PlayStation at 10pm, then. Join us (or risk missing a piece of history!).</p>

<p>There's not a whole lot to go on for now, but it seems to indicate that we'll be getting some sort of incarnation of Ganon. The shadow rising up from the bottom of the screen to confront Lego Link appears to be pretty large and takes the rough shape of the pig-like villain. We wouldn't be surprised to see Ganondorf either, though.</p>
<p>It's likely that the new set will be based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rumour-new-zelda-lego-set-rumour-links-it-to-fan-favourite-entry">previous rumour pointing to a potential release in March 2026.</a> The video also showcases what looks to be Navi floating beside Link, and we can also see Zelda herself in the background.</p>

<p>Lego fans can already get their hands on the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set, which originally launched in 2024. We gave it a score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/lego-the-legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-2-in-1-a-superb-debut-with-one-minor-irritation">8/10 in our review</a> and said that while "details and nods to the games are plentiful, but with no easy way to convert one to the other, you’re going to have your work cut out for you if you want to get the most out of this one".</p>
<p>We'll be sure to keep an eye out for a proper reveal in the days and weeks to come, but for now, colour us excited!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lumines-arise-review-kraft-und-licht</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lumines-arise-review-kraft-und-licht.1350034/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We need more puzzle games in the hands of the people. Forget the daily Wordle, or those insipid color sort games, you gotta say to yourself that "the day doesn’t start until I complete this <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baba-is-you" rel="nofollow"><em>Baba is You</em></a> level", or until you figure out what gets wetter as it dries. Thank goodness Enhance have got this in mind also, as <em>Lumines Arise</em> has, well, risen.</p>

<p>This is the latest game from Enhance Games, the Japan-based studio fronted by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who was also the director of the original <em>Lumines </em>in 2004. With Enhance, Mizuguchi and co. have been refining a certain transcendental experience that collides with almost menial puzzle gameplay, whether it’s <em>Rez Infinite</em>, the widely revered <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tetris-effect" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a>, or the bustling nature of <em>Humanity</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> sees itself neck-and-neck with the likes of <em>Tetris Effect</em>, not just because of its block-based gameplay, but the way it presents itself; almost hoity-toity in fashion. Let it be stated for the record that I personally don’t see what the gift is in <em>Tetris Effect</em>, as its aesthetic clashed way too much mechanically with what <em>Tetris </em>is, and indeed became. What was once 5 minutes on the john with a Game Boy was now lampooning as an artistic endeavor, embarrassed to provide flow.</p>



<p>By contrast, the gameplay of <em>Lumines </em>is simplistic to the point of oversight. You are given two different tones of blocks that always come in the shape of 2x2, and it’s your job to create other 2x2 squares of one tone or the other. Sometimes they spawn in as such, a free point bonus if you will, but you also have to time your drops to the beat of the song playing. It's a very delicate dance, one that surprisingly punishes brute force quite often.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, there is a lifeline in the form of a “linker”. Say you have a long 1x1 line of one tone that snakes across your messy board, and a linker of that tone is able to connect to it? That entire line is completely erased, leading to a major reset of the board's opportunities. Despite a much more stilted execution of combos, it's very similar to<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/puyo-puyo-tetris-2" rel="nofollow">Puyo Puyo</a></em> in that regard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also a new power-up similar to the “Zone” bonus in <em>Tetris Effect</em>, in the form of “Burst”. Like with Zone, a square of one tone will form and expand, with each single 1x1 square added with the same tone, making it grow and eat any other squares. With that monstrous square formed, a new one spawns of the other tone, and boom, another major reset.</p>



<p>It’s an exceptionally powerful ability, one which seems almost negligible since the linkers work to the same effect, but it works with the visual design brilliantly. Each board blossoms with the progression, and with much broader strokes than the underspoken developments of <em>Tetris Effect</em>’s backgrounds and songs. Still, with time, <em>Lumines Arise</em> effectively evolves into something very different.</p>

<p>While the painting of <em>Arise </em>is similar to <em>Effect</em>, the painter in question is one much more indebted to how <em>Lumines </em>came to existence to begin with. This was always meant to be “transcendental”, to instill a purity through new-age affirmations, even back in 2004, when Mizuguchi’s Sega experience influenced every part of <em>Lumines</em>’ Y2K aesthetic. As it stands, <em>Lumines Arise</em> IS the game that should define Enhance as a studio.</p>

<p>The end result is absolutely magical. From the moment you begin to see yourself in the same shoes of holistic block-based puzzle gameplay, you begin to notice the songs are providing more influence on the board. It's not just that the background is thumping behind the actual action, but the blocks transform, they intertwine with those elements until it becomes what <em>Lumines </em>wanted to be from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll notice in the corner of gameplay that there’s a little individual reacting to your gameplay, and that’s your Loomii; a customizable avatar who adds a surprising amount of personality to proceedings. They’ll meditate, they’ll rave, they’ll float and interact with other Loomii’s you come across, and it’s nice to see that be the blueprint for <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s general connectivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with any <em>Lumines </em>game, the songs are a huge part of the core experience, and here, they're all earworms. The ones that are purely instrumental are the heaviest hitters, with legitimate structure throughout, and the right amount of dynamic co-operation with each square clear and combo chain. It's a huge upgrade on the underspoken and otherwise one-note house music that <em>Lumines </em>tended to pair itself with.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> also tries to expand how it plays with mission modes, which tries to extract the same amount of variety that <em>Tetris Effect</em> does with what it can do with its gameplay. In <em>Arise</em>’s case, it isn’t nearly to the same effect, largely choosing to test the player on timing, as opposed to gimmickry, but when it does provide a unique angle, <em>Lumines </em>Arise runs with it. The “Egg” challenge in particular is both humorous and invigorating to plow through.</p>



<p>With each level clear, you’re also subject to achieving points that can be used on the “Loomi-Pon”, a pseudo-gacha machine which can generate unlockables for your Loomii. These range from cosmetic heads and decorations for their body to different adjectives and titles for your profile. There’s a LOT to unlock, in what is <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s biggest problem, which is with general UX.</p>

<p>For something so welcoming and desperate, it’s surprising to see the GUI of <em>Lumines Arise</em> be an absolute nightmare to navigate. Trying to customize your Loomii with new items is an excruciating effort of trying to find the one item that doesn’t have a tiny lock symbol next to it, and the titles? Forget about it, sifting through hundreds of words on each side? Just grating to get through.</p>

<p>Still, this is <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s only true blemish, as the rest is a beautiful cacophony of particle effects of genuine awe-struck talent. Similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/once-upon-katamari-review-ureshii-matsuri" rel="nofollow"><em>Katamari</em></a>’s blissful exercises of saccharine joy, Mizuguchi’s baby has grown into something that looks back on its history, the way it communicated to players, and now we have a statement of pure intent. That statement? Enjoy yourself.</p>

<h2><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>Despite a heinous UX, <em>Lumines Arise</em> genuinely finds itself leaps and bounds above Enhance’s previous titles, in what should become a mainstay title. The gameplay of <em>Lumines </em>is the pinnacle of the phrase “easy to learn, hard to master”, and nowhere is it better showcased than here. A beautiful sprawling entity of brilliant music, fantastic visual design, and worthwhile vibes.</p>

            <p>New browser game <a href="https://cxmi.itch.io/too-high">Too High</a> is about trying to form credible, humanlike sentences while absolutely whazzed on happy eggs at a party, but I think it also performs pretty well as a send-up of social anxiety at large.</p>
<p>Created by Christine Mi for the “Worst Nightmare” week of Itch gamejam <a href="https://itch.io/jam/prototype-studio-2025-week-9">Prototype Studio 2025</a>, it sees you ushering the words of a greeting together with your mouse, only for them to be knocked out of formation by other, rising and falling phrases such as “am I going to die” and “what did they just say”.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You’ve got to herd those kittenish letters into coherence before your “Awkwardness” bar fills up. I was too frightened to learn what happens when your “Awkwardness” bar fills up, so I’ve got the game paused at about 90%, having successfully completed the utterance “I’m Christine super”. I’ve certainly said worse things at parties. Oh no, now I’m remembering things I have said at parties. Get ye behind me, New Year 2015.</p>
<p>I can well imagine an audio-based version of this game, with players fumbling towards the echo of a "hello" or a "hey", against a screenful of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iABq4JdaRIs">context-free Bocchi the Rock scenes</a>. Please don’t make that game, Christine. You have done enough. Perhaps even less pleasantly, I'd love somebody to mod this into a first-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that simulates either woozy incapacity or just the mortal fear of being asked your name and job title. Socially anxious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, now there's a concept.</p>

              <p>Back in the day when I used to main <i>Call of Duty</i>’s extraction mode, DMZ, any time my plans to play sniper boss on a tall tower went awry and I had to skedaddle, I’d just leap off of a building and, without much thought or concern, hit the ground and run and hide somewhere. It was cheap. But also, there was an infinite parachute on my back. It was a part of the game. Am I supposed to not use it?</p>

 <p>Well, as we’ve now seen for a little bit, you can kinda sorta do the same thing in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. But instead of an infinite parachute, you can exploit how the game handles characters grabbing onto ledges to fall from incredible heights with basically no harm to your character. It’s not right. I don’t agree with it. You should stop doing it. Camp the extraction point? Fine. But if I see you do this ledge thing from somewhere ridiculous like the skyscraper-sized launch tower in Spaceport, I don’t care if you’re fighting a Leaper or are running from a Rocketeer. I’m hopping on the mic to have a conversation with you about unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The Sickest, Silliest, And Most Spectacular Moments From The Game So Far</a></p> <p>I first caught sight of this little exploit back when I wrote up a montage of all the hijinks that <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905">unfolded during <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first weekend</a>. I’d hoped that, amusing as it was to watch, it would be a little too tricky to pull off reliably. Well, no. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-players-crack-its-movement-tech-wide-open-by-mastering-the-ledge-grab/">Morgan Park over at <i>PC Gamer</i></a> has documented, folks have figured out how to do this reliably. But unlike my colleague, I don’t find it amusing.</p>

   <p>It essentially works like this: Fall from a great height but be sure there’s a ledge to grab waiting far below. Hold down the jump key or button while you’re falling and you’ll grab the ledge, your character’s arm sockets apparently absorbing the impact of falling from terminal velocity to cancel out all of the fall damage you right earned.</p>

 <p><i>Kotaku</i> has reached out to Embark Studios for comment on this “movement tech.”</p> <p>Don’t get me wrong. I do enjoy a good movement exploit when it feels like it requires a bit of mastery to pull off. “<a href="https://youtu.be/5QYRCVS7ix4">Curb sliding” in <i>Halo Infinite</i></a> (RIP) was one such thing. After sprinting, you could slide off a ledge to get a boost in speed. It was tricky to do, especially amidst the chaos of a good <i>Halo </i>match.</p>

 <p>But I don’t see that kind of skill in this ledge grab trick in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. Being able to bail from a high vantage point without consequence feels a little too easy, and antithetical to the fairly grounded approach to combat <i>Arc Raiders</i> seems to be going for.</p> <p>Ledges and climbing are quite important in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, so much so that the game sometimes reminds me a little bit of <i>Uncharted</i>. As some folks have commented in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1kmrtjt/i_hope_this_doesnt_get_patched/">a Reddit post documenting the ledge-grab exploit</a>, grabbing onto a ledge from a great height is fine, but it shouldn’t cancel out fall damage. Especially when you’re jumping off something as tall as a skyscraper. Such silliness.</p>

              <p>Since the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 in June, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-key-card-game-cart-physical-list-confirmed-1851777742">players have been pretty miffed</a> to discover that the physical versions of many games don’t actually contain the game at all. Instead they’re so-called “game-key cards,” essentially a phony game cart that only contains an instruction to download the game from Nintendo’s servers. Until now, it’s something that’s only affected third-party titles, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-elden-ring-digital-downloads-1851774694">albeit some very big-name games</a>. But now—with March 5, 2026’s <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>—the phenomenon will seemingly affect a Nintendo-published game for the first time.</p>

 <p>While this isn’t fully confirmed, it’s all but certain after Nintendo simultaneously announced a March 5 release date for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331">recently revealed <em>Animal Crossing-</em>like <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em></a>, and a video explaining how game-key cards work that used&nbsp;<em>Pokopia</em> as an example.</p>

  <p>Game-key cards have caused a huge amount of consternation among those who want to be able to simply buy and own a game, knowing it will be theirs and available to play forever. While Xbox and PlayStation consoles have long been plagued by shipping with discs containing just a fraction of a game’s code, or none at all, it’s not something that afflicted Nintendo consoles until the Switch 2. On every previous Nintendo device, if you bought a physical game for it, you can still install and play it today, going right back to the Game Boy. But no longer. And it’s seemingly happening for incredibly stupid reasons.</p>

 <p>For reasons no one but Nintendo seems to know, <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-cartridges-new-size-capacity/">the Switch 2 only offers 64GB carts to publishers</a> for their games to ship on, with the price (according to&nbsp;<em>Digital Foundry</em>) set at $23 a piece. That’s far bigger than most people need, and obliterates profits, so with Nintendo offering no other options, publishers are naturally picking the only other option, the fake carts. (In other cases, <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-game-key-card-2000623413">like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, it’s about transfer speeds from the cart to the system without installing on the Switch 2’s SSD.)</p>

 <p>It’s absolutely fascinating that it’s only now that Nintendo intends to use a game-key card for the first time that the company has felt the need to explain them to its audience. In the jaunty video, it explains how it’s selling you an empty box as if it’s doing you a favor, using <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em><em>&nbsp;</em>as its example throughout. The game, which is “only” 10GB, would therefore also make using the 64GB carts extremely expensive, even for Nintendo, a fact which is likely driving this decision. But, you ask, why not just make cheaper 16GB and 32GB carts, too? Well, yes, great question.</p>

 <p>So why buy the boxes at all, if all you’re doing is adding an extra series of steps and a huge amount of wasteful plastic and shipping to what amounts to just downloading a game anyway? Well, the one advantage that remains is that you can—for now—use the same game-key card in a different Nintendo Switch 2, and thus share your game with your friends without having to go through that god-awful time-limited digital sharing feature that was added to the console. You can even (audible gasp) sell them when you’re done.</p> <p>However, it remains a massive disappointment that now even Nintendo is using this preservation-destroying option for its first-party titles. The day the servers are switched off, which we know will be far too soon, none of these carts will do a single thing and the game you bought will be lost forever.</p>

              <p>Is Jesus now canon in <em>Game of Thrones</em>? Will we get a surprise <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> announcement at this week’s PlayStation State of Play? And why are video game genre names usually terrible? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I purchased <em>Star Wars: Rogue Squadron</em> last night and have been having the time of my life. I also re-watched <em>Episode 2: Attack of the Clones</em> and was much less impressed. It remains the worst <em>Star Wars</em> movie by far.</p>

 <h2>A Lannister always pays his AI</h2> <p>“So just to let y’all know the new [<em>A Feast For Crows</em>] illustrated edition is like almost definitely ai lol and id argue has taken pretty hard ’inspiration’ from existing fanart,” X user <span>novembernatten <a href="https://x.com/novembernatten/status/1986109371177181669">wrote</a> in a post that blew up last week (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/game-of-thrones-ai-art-controversy-a-feast-for-crows-artist-responds-denies/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>). They weren’t the only one throwing around accusations of generative AI, and now the publisher has stepped in to tell fans they’re wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ht" dir="ltr">lol. lmao, even <a href="https://t.co/YYwEO911nb">pic.twitter.com/YYwEO911nb</a></p> <p>— 2åse (@novembernatten) <a href="https://twitter.com/novembernatten/status/1986109385383330281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Recently there have been accusations floating around that the Penguin Random House’s illustrated edition of <em>A Feast For Crows</em> was produced using AI generative art,” Raya Golden, responsible for<em> Song of Fire and Ice</em> book materials, <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2025/11/10/ffc-art-accusations/">wrote</a> on George R.R. Martin’s blog yesterday. “To our knowledge and as presented by the artist who completed the work in question there was NO such programing used. While he is a digital multimedia artist and relies on digital programing to complete his work, he has expressed unequivocally that no AI was used, and we believe him.”</p>

 <p>Fans remain unconvinced, however. <a href="https://x.com/Mayham_H/status/1988054172613120286">They point to</a> an apparent crucifix that blurrily appears in the background of one of the scenes. “Uh. Then why are they all in blue?” <a href="https://x.com/andrewhunt_/status/1988046433899999721">wrote</a> one. “Why is there a cross on a wall? Why is Tywin obviously an AI recreation of Viserys? Why is there no heraldry? It genuinely could not be more obvious and no amount of lying is gonna work.” Is this a case of AI slop or just bad art?</p>

 <h2>Is <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> finally getting ported?</h2> <p>That’s the wishcasting from some fans after discovering a <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> voice actor will be <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1988112940428587350">MC-ing the PlayStation Japan State of Play</a> this week. It might just be cope, but a trilogy ported to PlayStation 5 (and Switch 2) would be pretty awesome. It’s the only major <em>Final Fantasy</em> arc that’s not playable on Sony’s current hardware.</p>

 <h2>Former <em>Marathon</em> dev thinks “extraction” is a bad genre name</h2> <p>Ex-Bungie production manager Chris Sides told the Shooter Monthly podcast it’s “dumb. “I hate the genre name of extraction shooter,” he said (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/marathon/extraction-shooter"><em>PCGamesN</em></a>). “When I was working on <em>Marathon</em>, I was working with marketing, dying to be like, ‘Can we please create a different genre name?’ because extraction shooter is so dumb. It’s the only genre where its name is a mechanic.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “I cannot stand the name of it. So I think that when you say the extraction genre, it should hit your spot. I think it’s really the fact that the genre doesn’t even know what it is. You, as a player, how do you know what you’re going to get? And I think that’s one of the real issues with the genre itself.”</p>

 <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s nasty drone glitch has finally been fixed</h2> <p>Players will no longer be able to <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-drone-glitch-fix-patch-ruining-matches-update-2000641355">take to the skies and rain down death</a>. “Fixed an exploit allowing players to ascend and access unintended areas when standing on a XFGM-6D Recon Drone by hitting it with the Sledgehammer,” EA’s developers confirmed in the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/article/1987957508426608743">latest patch notes</a>.</p> <h2>Switch 2 gets some nifty new features</h2> <p>A <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68473/~/system-update-information-for-nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2">new firmware update</a> made small but notable tweaks to the new console. Those include updated game card icons to make it clear when an installation is from a physical or digital purchase, the ability to cancel multiple game downloads at once, and an option to keep the system from going into rest mode while GameChat is active. Most importantly, perhaps, there’s now an “Improved the screen display when using Adjust Screen Size to make it easier to adjust.” Hopefully, that makes it easier to fix the system’s poor HDR implementation.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-tes6-shadow-drop-todd-howard-release-date-fallout-3-2000642434">We’ll probably get <em>Fallout 3</em> remastered before <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/goodnight-universe-review-before-your-eyes-webcam-baby-2000642517">The developers behind a radically innovative 2021 indie game are back with something more mixed</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/trap-plan-marketing-astroturf-warrobots-fake-reddit-accounts-posts-2000642503">A game company gloats about an astroturfed marketing campaign on Reddit</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

<p>It has been revealed that the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox helped increase engagement as well as sales for the PS5 and PC versions. </p>



<p>Arrowhead Game Studios released Helldivers 2 for Xbox in August 2025, and that decision helped revitalise the game for a new platform of players. <span>It was also revealed earlier this year that Helldivers 2 sold more on Xbox than PlayStation&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-sold-more-on-xbox-than-playstation-in-the-first-six-days/" target="_blank">in its first six days,&nbsp;</a>and now, it seems that the Xbox port has also helped bolster&nbsp;</span>sales on other platforms. </p>

Tao first talked about how their live service titles “overall accounted for more than 40% of our first-party software revenue.” Even though performance is different for each title, they observed that live service games are “a recurring source of revenue” similar to the previous quarter. </p>



<p>Tao then spoke about Helldivers 2, stating that it was also released for Xbox in 2025 and “is doing extremely well.” The group CFO added that the Xbox port has not only helped bring in new players on Xbox but also increased engagement from existing users on PS5 and PC. This move has “resulted in a significant increase in sales of the title year on year.” Tao concluded, stating, “Building on this recent progress, we aim to strengthen our studio, business, and expand our IP franchises through continuous learning and improvement.” </p>

But it turns out that things haven’t exactly gone to plan as the update was met with a backlash on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The $59.99 Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition includes the six official Fallout 4 expansions and over 150 Creation Club items (paid mods). But there’s also a Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition upgrade Bethesda is selling to existing owners of the base game, priced $39.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Bethesda points out that this upgrade offers a discount on all the items sold separately, fans have hit out at the pricing for the Anniversary Edition, especially in the context of Fallout 4 itself being a decade old and what the Anniversary Edition actually gets you. It’s worth noting that the Fallout 4 base game is currently $19.99 on Steam (it launched at $59.99), and the Fallout 4 Game of the Year Edition, which includes the base game and all the six official expansions, costs $39.99.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fallout 4 - Creations Bundle, which includes the 150 paid mods released as part of the Anniversary Edition, costs $19.99 on its own. And it’s the Steam store page for this bundle that has born the brunt of the backlash, with a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Complaints there report crashing issues, glitches, and even a problem with getting the new mods to work. Meanwhile, it sounds like the Anniversary Edition is breaking prior mods, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-issues-fallout-4-mod-warning-ahead-of-anniversary-edition-release-patch-will-make-gameplay-and-performance-improvements-as-well-as-add-new-creations-menu">Bethesda warned this would happen when it came to mods that affect the new Creation Club menu</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Be a gamer in 2025,” reads the most helpful review, according to Steam. “You purchase the content. You don't get the content in game. Bethesda's update causes even more crashes. Trying to quit the game causes it to crash. GG.”</p><div id="fallout-4-perks-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fallout 4 Perks Tier List</h3><h3>Fallout 4 Perks Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is bugging out like crazy and not giving out all of the creations that are mentioned in the bundle,” another review reports. “Game absolutely refuses to let you attempt to install anything involving the Creation Club and freezes upon launching and quitting the game to the point where you can’t even use task manager or Steam to force close. For the love of god Bethesda, this is worse than Skyrim's anniversary launch. Fix your game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reaction on the Fallout subreddit features a similar sentiment, and yes, the memes have begun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The backlash has also spilled over into Steam reviews for the Fallout 4 base game, where negative reviews have flooded in following the Anniversary Edition’s release, causing recent reviews to plummet to ‘mixed.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They just killed the game with this Anniversary update,” reads one negative review on the Fallout 4 base game. “Not going to sort my 400+ mods as it would take days. Goodbye Fallout, I would like to say I will miss you but I won't.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a disappointing start for Fallout’s big push ahead of the hotly anticipated December launch of Fallout Season 2 on Prime Video. A new Fallout: New Vegas bundle is also due out, with a Fallout TV show-themed update to Fallout 76 also coming in December. Hopefully Bethesda can sort these issues out sooner rather than later.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fallout 4 - Creations Menu Update November 10 patch notes:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Creations Menu</strong>: A new in-game Creations menu has been added, making it easier than ever to discover, download and enjoy content from professional developers and passionate enthusiasts alike.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay &amp; Performance</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>VATS Accuracy:</strong> VATS hit chances are now consistent across platforms and no longer drop to 0% or show incorrect values.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/reanimal/" data-ref-id="5000-640431">Reanimal </a>is an upcoming horror-adventure game developed by Tarsier Studios, the same team behind Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares II. It puts you in control of two children trying to survive and uncover the mysteries of a hostile island that was once their home. With its unsettling visuals and cooperative gameplay, Reanimal will hopefully build on Tarsier’s reputation for creating intimate and atmospheric horror.</p><p dir="ltr">Reanimal blends puzzle-solving, stealth, and exploration in a world filled with eerie creatures and twisted environments. You play as a brother and sister duo navigating the ruins of a corrupted island, solving environmental puzzles and hiding from monsters that seem to be shaped by their past trauma. The focus isn’t on combat, but survival--the connection between the two siblings is at the heart of the experience.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Reanimal_be_released__"><span>When will Reanimal be released?</span></h2><p>As of now, no exact release date has been announced. The game is listed on Steam as “coming soon.” The development team has said it wants to emphasize quality and won't rush to a release date. However, a demo recently appeared during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/reanimal-is-the-evolution-of-little-nightmares-youve-been-waiting-for/1100-6535470/">Steam Next Fest</a>, which shows the game to be in a state close to fit for release, so we wouldn’t be surprised if it appears within the next few months. Be sure to check out our list of the top <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-horror-games/2900-7150/">survival horror games</a> to play in the meantime.</p><h2 id="Reanimal_Trailers">Reanimal Trailers</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUymvhAXOnM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mUymvhAXOnM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">So far, Reanimal has received three trailers that each highlight different aspects of the game. The first announcement trailer introduced the sibling protagonists and set the tone with eerie island visuals and shadowy figures. A later gameplay trailer expanded on that foundation by showing puzzle solving, stealth, and cooperative movement between the two characters, giving players a better idea of how exploration and tension will unfold.</p><p dir="ltr">The most recent trailer focused on the story’s emotional weight, teasing new environments and darker creature designs while hinting at the personal history tying the siblings to the island.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Reanimal_Platforms">Reanimal Platforms</h2><p>Reanimal is set to launch on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and the Nintendo Switch 2. The release date hasn’t been confirmed yet, but the Steam page lists it as “coming soon.”</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Reanimal_Story__Setting_and_Characters">Reanimal Story, Setting and Characters</h2><p dir="ltr">In Reanimal you play as two child characters--a brother and sister who head back to an island from their past only to find it corrupted, hostile, and transformed. The setting fuses childhood nostalgia with horror--abandoned amusement parks, homes frozen in time, and creatures that reflect past trauma. The game uses the siblings’ relationship as the emotional core, making exploration and survival something personal rather than purely mechanical.</p><p dir="ltr">Reanimal aims to make horror more human. Where most horror games focus on powerlessness, this one highlights vulnerability and connection--how two people face fear together. The game’s co-op mechanics, psychological tone, and handcrafted environments set it apart from more action-heavy titles, offering something closer to a playable dark fairy tale.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Reanimal_Gameplay">Reanimal Gameplay</h2><p dir="ltr">Players can explore the world solo with an AI companion or in two-player co-op, either online or locally. The camera shifts between dynamic and fixed angles to build tension, much like classic survival-horror games. Tarsier’s signature use of scale and lighting returns here, making even quiet moments feel unsettling. Every corner of the island hides a piece of the story, from broken toys to forgotten homes, encouraging exploration and reflection rather than speed.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat is minimal. Your tools are stealth and evasion rather than firearms or brute force. The world design emphasizes hiding, running and reading the environment for clues. Environmental puzzles, exploration of hidden paths, and uncovering story fragments are key components. The game promises a tighter runtime and focused structure rather than an open-ended map.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Reanimal_Development_News">Reanimal Development News</h2><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/reanimal-is-the-evolution-of-little-nightmares-youve-been-waiting-for/1100-6535470/">Reanimal demo</a> was available during the Steam Next Fest in October of 2025. The demo showcases the grimy world Tarsier Studios has created. It's a major change of pace from both Little Nightmare games the team had created ahead of this project. One of the biggest elements that has enticed us so far is how it feels to explore the world of Reanimal.</p><p dir="ltr">"Little Nightmares 3--and even Little Nightmares 2--got away from the first game's especially morbid, skin-crawling monsters, or Residents, as they're called," GameSpot's Mark Delaney <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/reanimal-is-the-evolution-of-little-nightmares-youve-been-waiting-for/1100-6535470/">wrote</a>. "The Reanimal demo feels like a return to form for Tarsier [...] Reanimal's slithering skin suits, inky black waters, ever-present unease, and air of mystery combine to give me the sense that this is the game that will get us there."</p><p dir="ltr">The Reanimal demo also featured some evolution in how Tarsier approached using camera angles. Little Nightmares, as a series, has mostly utilized a static, side-scrolling angle that sometimes shifted for tense moments.</p><p dir="ltr">"Reanimal's demo showed off a lot more dynamism in its perspective. Sometimes the camera pulled far away; other times it was practically a third-person over-the-shoulder experience," Delany continued. "By shifting the dynamics, Tarsier is able to experiment more with puzzle design and exploration, which may help eventually separate it from the Little Nightmares comparisons."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/mixtape-is-a-sharp-looking-coming-of-age-story-with-music-from-devo">Mixtape</a>, the coming-of-age adventure by the creators of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-artful-escape/the-artful-escape-review-a-rocking-space-oddity">The Artful Escape</a>, has been delayed to 2026. First revealed during the 2024 Xbox Showcase, the game was slated to launch sometime this year.</p><p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mixtapegame.bsky.social/post/3m5cpiizcqc2h">social media post</a>, developer Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur states that Mixtape is “almost complete” and implies it's largely just applying finishing touches. The studio didn’t narrow the release window beyond the year, however, so we’ll have to stay tuned to see if the game arrives sooner than later.</p><p>Here is Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur’s full statement:</p><p>While developing Artful Escape, our 3D artist Mikey, made an oven asset. It was a nice oven - the work of a true pro. He even put the knobs on. And that’s who we are at Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur. We put the knobs on. Mixtape is almost complete, we’re just putting the knobs on. See you in 2026.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Mixtape is published by Annapurna Interactive and takes place in the 1990s, centering on teenager Stacy Rockford, who dreams of becoming a music supervisor in Hollywood. She has a passion for creating mixtapes, and the story follows her and her teenage friends as they embark on a final adventure together. The game primarily consists of playable vignettes as the teens recall cherished memories, which often unfold as exaggerated takes on these events, accompanied by fourth-wall-breaking narration. The game’s presentation features a stop-motion-inspired animation reminiscent of the Spider-Verse films, and the soundtrack boasts tracks from artists including Guns &amp; Roses, DEVO, The Smashing Pumpkins, Roxy Music, Iggy Pop, Joy Division, and many more.&nbsp;</p><p>We played Mixtape during Summer Game Fest this year, and it became one of our favorite demos at the show. You can read our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/13/one-of-sgfs-greatest-hits">full preview here</a>.

            <p>Nintendo and Lego have teased a new set based on The Legend of Zelda, which looks to be based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>.</p>
<p>A teaser video shared by both companies shows a Lego minifigure of Link in his iconic garb, with a floating Navi the fairy. He's overshadowed by a horned figure (Ganon), while a Lego Zelda is out of focus in the background behind flames.</p>
<p>"Do you realise who you're dealing with?" the post reads, with the set due some time next year.</p>

<p>Details of the set remain unknown, but considering the video clearly depicts the final battle between Link and Ganon from Ocarina of Time, it's very likely the set will be based on this scene and include these figures.</p>

<p>The set would be the second based on The Legend of Zelda, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">last year's Great Deku Tree set</a> featuring both Ocarina of Time and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> designs.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Nintendo and Lego released its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-taps-into-nostalgia-with-1980s-inspired-lego-game-boy-trailer">Lego Game Boy set</a>, launched with a trailer that recreated its famous 'Robot' commercial of 1989.</p>
<p>Next year, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-sets-could-be-among-the-most-expensive-ever">series of Pokémon sets will be released</a>, as revealed back in March, though they're looking pricey.</p>

		<p>Pokémon Pokopia, the cosy Pokémon life-sim, is set to launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 5th March 2026, Nintendo has announced.</p>
<p>Pokopia is a thoroughly odd feeling spin-off to the Pokémon franchise, as the shape-shifting Pokémon Ditto transforms into a human form – something which for a long time was said to be impossible, but is now a potentially horrifying reality with that blank line-art smile beaming back at you – and then sets about creating a little Pokémon paradise. They can do that, because Ditto will learn &nbsp;new abilities and moves from other Pokémon, perhaps spreading Bulbasaur’s vine whips to do a bit of gardening, and more.</p>


<p>It certainly looks like a Pokémon flavoured take on Animal Crossing, bringing other Pokémon to your corner of the world to hang out and engage with. Check out the original announcement trails from last month’s Nintendo Direct stream:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Wccftech was recently invited out to join a select number of content creators and fellow journalists to get an early look at the upcoming <a href="https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us">Beta Test II</a> for Arknights: Endfield on PC. Throughout this seven-hour session, we were treated to a live performance by Starset, a band that has done a number of collaborations with Gryphline for Arknights trailers and will be debuting a new track for Arknights: Endfield sometime in the future. During the actual gameplay, we were permitted to play through the redesigned opening act and then free rein across a number of saves at different level tiers to get samples of the combat at various difficulties, as well as exploration of the new hub city of Wuling.</p>



<p>Gryphline started off the preview event with a brief rundown of the current state of Arknights: Endfield and what it’s taken to get to this point. During this presentation, we were introduced to Endfield through a live-translated fireside chat with Lead Designer Ryan (last name not given) and Producer Light Zhong. As they wanted to address the matters of “Whenfield”, the developers talked about how Endfield first began proper development in 2022 with a technical test in 2024, followed by the first beta test earlier this year. The development team at Hypergryph is currently recruiting for the second beta test, currently slated to open on November 28th.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The intent for Arknights: Endfield to differentiate itself from other gacha action RPGs out on the market is the factory building systems. Light Zhong talked briefly about how sandbox titles offer freedom for players to explore the world and make it more immersive, while the factory elements are something refreshing for the players, as most gacha games don’t dip their toes into these systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using the feedback from the first beta test earlier this year, Arknights: Endfield’s upcoming test was centered around three refining pillars: overall game progression, the stages and maps, and redesigning the cutscenes and cinematics. One example they provided was changing out an early quest involving gathering piles of trash to clean up a camp and instead replacing it with clearing the camp of raiders and miscreants by way of combat. Overall, they’re intending to make the map design feel “more self-contained” and guide players through with both storytelling and gameplay. Whether this means that they intend for the quest chains to guide the player along a guided path or provide points of interest off the beaten path is something that players will have to check out for themselves if they’re selected to take part in the second beta test. Hypergryph estimates that the amount of content coming to Beta Test II is an average of 50-60 hours, with a majority of that time dedicated to new content.</p>



<p>The factory building is, of course, going to be one of the key features that will set Arknights: Endfield apart from other action RPG games on the mobile market. Regrettably, I was not able to dive in from the beginning and experience building up a camp from the ground up, so I was limited in what I could see for myself and instead only got a glimpse during their keynote presentation. One of the features I saw most requested for the factory building was an element to share base creations with other players, and this is indeed a feature that will be coming to Arknights: Endfield at launch. By allowing players to share blueprints of their factory creations, they intend to make the system more accessible and encourage experimentation as players begin to understand what is possible with Endfield’s factories. Players won’t have to befriend one another to get access to these blueprints, as there will be a code system to post on social media and share with others.</p>

<p>The opening act that aims to onboard players with tutorials is quite a bombastic opener, starting with choosing the gender of your player Endministrator and taking part in a raid against a raiding alien menace. While the opening act from the first beta test was far more introspective, examining artifacts and the relics left behind, the revised opener in Beta Test II is more in line with what players might expect from a Western action RPG. Enemies are slowly drip-fed to the player in combat encounters, leading to how to target and dodge attacks before culminating in a massive multi-stage fight against a behemoth titan that towers over the battlefield and uses its long reach to swipe and smack down the player Endministrator. Following this five-minute-long fight is a radical shift in thematics compared to the original story, instead focusing on a cycle of death and rebirth for the Endministrator, who returns to duty in a hospital bed, suffering from a small amount of amnesiac trauma from the whole ordeal. From here, it returns to being closer to the original beta test, where players slowly venture out to rescue a hub base and set up a proper base of operations on Talos-II.</p>



<p>Arknights: Endfield’s combat has been greatly refined to be more in line with the popular character action games of recent years, obviously taking some notes from PlatinumGames’ Babylon’s Fall and Astral Chain. Each battle sees not just the Endministrator taking the field but also all three of their party members, who operate independently in terms of basic attacks. The player character has one main attack button where players can either tap the button or hold it down for a combo string and use dashes and dodges to evade oncoming attacks, often indicated by the enemy attacker's glowing red moments before their attack would connect with the player character. For some enemy types, the red aura can be difficult to figure out at a glance, especially on the fiery lava rock type humanoids.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In its current form, party members don’t use any actual resources for their special attacks, meaning they don't need to manage MP, TP, or any other type of resource for these attacks. Instead, everything the player can do is time-based and recharges over a period of time. For those players who want to mash buttons and blast through battles as quickly as possible, sure it’s possible to fire off all four special attacks and abilities back to back but often, it’s better to utilize these abilities in a particular order as players learn to synergize the different roles in their party and take advantage of both player buffs and enemy debuffs to maximize their damage far above the couple of thousand damage they might be able to pull off otherwise. One comment I had for the Hypergryph developers during my preview session was a desire to have two different attack buttons for light and heavy attacks to help the combat feel more dynamic; going onto Beta Test II, the combat can begin to feel somewhat one note despite the polished dodging and speed of combat as I simply held down one button for basic attacks for much of the fight while waiting for my abilities to charge up. There’s certainly the framework of what could be the single best action combat system for a gacha game on the market, but Arknights: Endfield needs to bring in more than just a good defensive system to truly shine.</p>



<p>Exploring around Wuling City showed off one of my favorite parts of open-world games: environment puzzles leading to tangible rewards. Scattered throughout the city are dozens of collectibles and hidden treasure chests, rewarding exploration with bonuses to the regional development level for that area, as well as working towards an overall account level, which in turn leads to important boons like being able to increase the level cap of units. What kept me from really getting into the sense of exploration was the jumping mechanics and platforming. I would constantly want to double jump or try to climb up to a higher level by jumping onto rails and boxes, only to fall off. Instead, it’s more about a deliberate path through side paths to get up to some of these elevated rewards. Adding in a double jump might trivialize some of these exploration moments, so I’m curious to see what Hypergryph does to refine map traversal in the coming months.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even as someone who only knows the surface-level lore and gameplay of the original Arknights, having played early on in its Western launch and only having to rely on anecdotes from players who have been enduring through TN-4 earlier this year, I was able to get a proper grasp on the overall universe and themes that make Arknights what it is. Being an entirely new genre and set in the far future from the original game, Arknights: Endfield aims to be something that can draw brand new players in that might have otherwise overlooked the original tower defense game. The gacha action RPG genre has become competitive in recent years, but Endfield’s AAA presentation and emphasis on base building might do well to set it apart from the competition.</p>



<p>Following my hands-on with Arknights: Endfield’s Beta Test II, I was able to take part in an email interview with both Ryan and Light Zhong, who were able to respond and get answers back to us ahead of publishing. While both developers took part in the email Q&amp;A, the responses aren’t attributed to a specific person. There was one more question that was asked to the developers about balancing power levels in Algorithmic Memories, as some gameplay videos showcased a massive damage spike for certain team compositions, but that answer wasn’t returned in time for publication.</p>



<p><strong>What led your team to make such significant changes to the combat system over the</strong> <strong>course of the different betas?</strong></p>



<p>We believe players naturally develop certain habits, and game design trends follow those patterns. When developing our games, we’re always thinking about how to adapt to modern playstyles without compromising on the core fun of the experience. The changes to combat skills came from this idea—we wanted battles to feel smoother and more dynamic, matching the pace players expect. It greatly enhances the sense of impact in combat. As for strategy, that aspect hasn’t been diminished, in part due to the addition of the Combo Skill system. Battles are now more fun and have an extra strategic layer. Players must think carefully about team composition and skill timing if they want to unlock their characters’ full potential.</p>



<p><strong>Arknights is very well known and loved for its approach to unit design and distribution,</strong> <strong>with older units remaining useful over the life of the game. Is that something you’re</strong> <strong>looking to replicate in Endfield?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. In Endfield, the design philosophy ensures that early characters continue to play important gameplay roles even as new units are introduced. While six-star characters can be powerful, optimal team compositions often rely on a mix of units, including four/five-star or earlier characters, due to their unique abilities and synergy in combos. This approach keeps older characters valuable and relevant throughout the game’s lifecycle, maintaining strategic depth and rewarding long-term player investment.</p>



<p><strong>How integral will the factory be to resource generation in Arknights: Endfield? The</strong> <strong>efficiency of resource generation is something that veteran gacha players tend to</strong> <strong>theorycraft and come up with builds as quickly as possible to maximize what’s earned</strong> <strong>per day.</strong></p>



<p>The Factory System will allow players to greatly empower their characters with equipment and improve the rate of regional development. Even if players do not focus on the factory gameplay or production efficiency, they’ll still have a chance to create quality equipment for their characters; they’ll just have to wait longer for the region to develop. However, this does not make the game significantly more difficult.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, we hope to share the fun of automation and make factory-building gameplay accessible to more players.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any plans for considering a blueprint system to make and share base designs?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, we have introduced the blueprint system for Beta Test II to help make AIC Factory planning and construction easier. This will allow players to use various blueprints to quickly set up a production line and expedite development across various regions of Talos-II.</p>



<p><strong>What are the current plans for an Endgame in Arknights Endfield? Will this be available</strong> <strong>at launch? If not, do you have a timetable in mind?</strong></p>



<p>Currently, the game is still in the testing phase, and more information will be shared in the future, so please stay tuned!</p>



<p><strong>Will accounts be shared across different platforms for Arknights: Endfield? Can players</strong> <strong>group together for co-op across different platforms?</strong></p>



<p>The test will be available on PC, iOS, and Android. Endministrators will receive access for their chosen platform, and your progress will sync seamlessly between PC and mobile.</p>



<p><strong>Are there swimsuits on Talos II?</strong></p>



<p>More information will be introduced in the future, so please stay tuned.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any elements to the store or gameplay that will require premium currency that</strong> <strong>isn’t earned through regular gameplay?</strong></p>



<p>We aim to give active players more free opportunities to get high-star characters and weapons.</p>



<p>In the end, whether players choose to spend or not, they’ll still be able to experience the main content of the game—we’re not putting major content behind paywalls. We also greatly reduced character progression costs so players can devote more of their time to the core story content and gameplay.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fortnite-island-creators-can-test-selling-items-in-islands-loot-box-style-random-rewards/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-island-creators-can-now-test-selling-items-within-their-islands-including-loot-box-style-%E2%80%9Crandom-rewards%E2%80%9D.1349965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-adding-gambling-in-future-update-leaks-reveal/">Insider-Gaming</a> pointed to a leak claiming that Epic Games would let Fortnite Island creators add gambling mechanics to their islands, Epic published <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/tools-for-in-island-transactions-now-available-to-fortnite-developers">a blog post</a> announcing that Fortnite Island creators start testing in-island transactions, with creators capable of selling permanent items, consumables, and loot-box-style "<em>paid random items (items that provide a chance to receive a random reward)</em>."</p>



<p>The ability to sell items within a Fortnite Island is currently in a preview phase within UEFN, and at the time of this writing, it can only be tested in unpublished projects. The ability to add them to published projects is coming later, though Epic did not clarify when that would be.</p>



<p>It's the latest evolution of Fortnite <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-will-let-fortnite-developers-sell-in-game-items-december/">inching closer to Roblox in terms of how it handles user-generated content</a>. When the feature is live and available to be included in published projects, players will be able to purchase items for islands using V-Bucks. Ahead of that, Epic has updated its developer rules and included new documentation to address how it will handle in-island transactions.</p>



<p>Here's a list of what creators can sell within their islands:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Durable items (items players can buy once that don’t expire over time, persistent across sessions within an island experience)</em></li>



<li><em>Consumable items (items that deplete when used in-game, may be persistent across sessions)</em></li>



<li><em>Items with gameplay elements, including those that share a visual overlap with approved Fortnite cosmetics categories (e.g. “Boots of Speed”, “Jetpack”)</em></li>



<li><em>Bundles or collections of durable, consumable and gameplay items</em></li>



<li><em>Paid random items (items that provide a chance to receive a random reward)</em>
<ul>
<li><em>New parental control will let parents decide if their child can acquire paid random items in regions where these are available to players.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>Custom passes, progression systems, and paid areas</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The fifth bullet point, the one regarding "<em>random rewards</em>," is arguably the most concerning one, because it's essentially a loot box that creators can begin selling to players, but it is at least good to see that it's not an item that players will be able to purchase by default, at least for players who have their accounts under parental controls. </p>



<p>It's also worth noting that cosmetic items, items that contain visual overlap with other Fortnite cosmetics, items that try to undercut Epic's pricing for items it makes, physical products, experience points, and anything that takes the transaction off-platform with an external checkout process are all things that cannot be sold and are disallowed under the new terms for in-island transactions.</p>



<p>Even with those kinds of transactions disallowed, the concept of in-island transactions could have a major impact on Fortnite Islands and the culture surrounding them within the Fortnite community. It'll be interesting to see how the game is changed once the feature is fully implemented, and for now, it's arguably good to see Epic Games taking what appears to be a measured approach to the feature, even if it is adding loot boxes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/an-expensive-new-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-is-coming-next-year.1349956/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo and Lego are teasing another <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best-1792136643"><em>The Legend of Zelda</em></a> collaboration for 2026. There’s no price tag or description yet but we did get a neat little live-action tease recreating the end of <em>Ocarina of Time</em>.</p> <p>The scene shows Link in his classic green tunic with the Master Sword and Hyrulian shield standing in the ruins of the castle with Princess Zelda in the background. Navi hovers nearby as a shadow creeps up and Ganon’s theme plays, suggesting the Lego set might be a depiction of the final battle from the classic Nintendo 64 game.</p>   <p>The other big question, aside from what the set will be, is how much it will cost. Lego has been aggressively burrowing <a href="https://kotaku.com/legos-new-400-star-trek-enterprise-set-price-release-date-mini-figs-2000641658">into fan nostalgia</a> and bank accounts in recent years with licensed sets that cost as much as some video game consoles. The Great Deku Zelda Lego set <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-lego-legend-zelda-great-deku-tree-set-price-1851503670">arrived back</a> in 2024 for $300. At 2,500 pieces it was no small set, but it was also the same price as a Nintendo Switch (less now due to the latter going up in price earlier this year).</p> <p>It seems like Lego is at least sticking with the <em>Ocarina </em>era for the follow-up and bringing Ganon into the mix this time. They might as well keep going and give us Zora’s Domain, Death Mountain, Gerudo Valley, Hyrule Castle, and the rest of Kokiri Forest. Personally, I’d love a Lego recreation of Clock Town from <em>Majora’s Mask</em>. I’m sure both companies can get to that eventually. Nintendo has its <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-movie-delay-date-nintendo-avengers-secret-wars-1851784080">live-action <em>Zelda</em> movie</a> coming in 2027.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-popular-shokz-openrun-pro-headphones-reach-a-55-discount-before-black-friday-2000642514</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As the days get shorter and the weather gets colder, it’s going to be more and more difficult to stay motivated to keep in shape and stick to running throughout the winter. One thing that keeps me going is that I use my runs as my podcast time. Been working my way through the third campaign in&nbsp;<em>Not Another D&amp;D Podcast</em> and four days a week, I’m out running and listening. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/">My pair of OpenRun Pro headphones from Shokz are perfect for the job. Right now, they happen to be on sale over at Amazon for 31% off</a>. The brings them down from $180 to just $125. You end up saving yourself a solid $55.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Bone Conduction Listening</h2>
<p>These headphones are different from your standard earbuds in that they don’t go in your ear. They sit around your ears and deliver sound using bone conduction. By vibrating your skull, you get the perception of sound.&nbsp; Elder millennial like myself might remember this tech from those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3ca4tfXefk">lollipops in the 90s</a> that could play hit music when you put them in your mouth. Though unlike those, these play music, audiobooks, or podcasts through your cheekbones, not your teeth.</p>
<p>The main advantage to designing headphones this way is it keeps your ears free to hear the various sounds in your environment, keeping you alert of your surroundings. This is crucial while running in case, say, a car is approaching. You’re going to want to hear traffic for safety reasons.</p>
<p>The Shokz OpenRun Pro headphones sit comfortably on your ears like a backwards pair of sunglasses. They feature a lightweight, wraparound titanium frame which helps keep your headphones firmly in place during high intensity workouts. I much prefer this to in-ear buds so I can eliminate any fear of one falling out while on a run.</p>



<p>Battery life is reliable. You can expect a full 10 hours of listening time on a single charge. The OpenRun Pro headphones can recharge fast, providing up to 1.5 hours of listening time after being plugged in for only five minutes.</p>
<p>Shokz also offers a mini model which has a shortened connecting band that stretches around the back for smaller heads.

<p>LEGO has announced that a new Legend of Zelda set is coming in 2026, though details on what exactly it entails are scarce.</p>

<p>A short video on the LEGO website shows a minifigure of Link, with Zelda blurred in the background, standing still as an ominous shadow approaches.</p>



<p>The video ends with a message for builders across the world, telling them to ‘Build the Legend’ and confirming a new set is coming in 2026. However, that’s all the details that are available for now.</p>
