            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-an-earlier-release-date-as-accidentally-revealed-by-randy-pitchford<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>First-person "comedy" shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> will be released sooner than previously expected, according to a video accidentally tweeted too early by Randy Pitchford. The original date of September 23rd is being shifted in some sort of bizarre anti-delay. "Everything is going kinda the best case scenario," says the Gearbox CEO, "and so the launch date for Borderlands 4 is changing. We're moving it forward." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The new date is September 12th, said Pitchford in the video, and there's going to be more of the looter shooter on show during the upcoming PlayStation State of Play. But Pitchford posted the video early by accident, it seems, quickly deleting it as soon as he realised his error. A follow-up post reads: "Oops - time zones… Reposting momentarily". But it's too late, Randy, the news is out. The video was saved and reposted by other users. Noted industry rumourmonger Wario64 has <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1917223361622508015">a copy</a>, if you'd like to watch a studio executive do a weirdly breathless piece to camera. </p>
<p>Despite the Gearbox boss' excitement in this video, and his assurances that the team are "cooking", the date change may not simply be down to speedy development and executive confidence. When extraction shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>  recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-is-real-looks-ridiculously-stylish-has-a-release-date-and-is-getting-a-closed-alpha-this-month">announced their release date</a> too, Bungie did an interesting thing: they chose the same day as Borderlands 4 had already planned: September 23rd. </p>
<p>In business terms, it might seem weird to place yourself aggressively next to another shooter in autumn, but there is a weird logic to it if you step back. Borderlands 4 is published by Take-Two, and that previous release date was the one day Bungie and Sony could reasonably guess would be spaced far away from the release date for Take-Two's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-borderlands-4-release-date-gives-us-a-clue-about-grand-theft-auto-6s-arrival">other big hitter</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. They were essentially stepping into the elevator with a gassy teenager to avoid the other elevator coming down that <em>might</em> contain the obnoxious startup bro. Or at least this is what it looks like through my fun speculation specs. Who knows, it could all just be coincidence. </p>
<p>I don't know if any more release date chicken will continue now that Borderlands 4 has shifted its weight slightly to the left and disappeared in a green cloud of farts, but we'll see what happens. Anyway, in the time it took me to write this post, Randy has reposted <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917232560943345997">the original video</a>, alongside a <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917232887771844878">State of Play schedule</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I gave them plenty of chances.</p><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> endlessly defies what you expect it to be about. Sandfall Interactive’s favorite thing, other than making you sad with one of the most gut-wrenching RPG premises it could concoct, is twisting the knife and showing you nothing is as you believed. The game starts with the titular expedition group journeying beyond their island home in Lumière to defeat a god-like entity called the Paintress. Every year, she paints a number on a monolith visible from the island, and anyone of that age is “gommaged” from the world, disappearing in a cloud of petals. The knowledge that lives have a guaranteed expiration date has shaped the culture of this world. When people approach their final year, they join an expedition to hopefully stop the Paintress, or at least lay down the foundation for the next expedition to succeed. This has been going on for decades, and time is running out for the citizens of Lumière as the Paintress etches a “33” on the monolith. That’s where <em>Clair Obscur </em>starts, but I couldn’t have anticipated where it would end.</p><p>All three of <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s acts are punctuated with a game-shifting turn. At the end of the first act, Gustave, the grieving swordsman and gunslinger protagonist, is killed in cold blood. An incomprehensively old man named Renoir, who has somehow survived in a world where the life expectancy dwindles each year, is protecting the Paintress, and to do that, he kills your main character! The reins of this expedition are then handed to Verso, a man who is revealed to be the son of Renoir.. But this family drama goes far beyond a son trying to stop his father from killing expeditioners, and the consequences of this shift the entire world of <em>Clair Obscur </em>on its axis.</p><figure id="" data-id="2fedee88c865b45d2497d683e30fdce5" data-recommend-id="image://2fedee88c865b45d2497d683e30fdce5" data-format="jpg" data-width="3839" data-height="1599" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2fedee88c865b45d2497d683e30fdce5" data-recommend-id="image://2fedee88c865b45d2497d683e30fdce5" data-format="jpg" data-width="3839" data-height="1599" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ever more layers to this universe are revealed, and by the end of Act II, the scope widens to show you just how much bigger this tale is than the opening gambit of an expedition to stop the Paintress. It turns out the Paintress isn’t quite a god, but a woman who uses her family’s magic to “paint” worlds onto canvases that can bring whatever’s painted on them to life. She, her husband, and her children all wield this power and have created and explored different worlds inside these canvases throughout their lifetimes. This world, the one the expedition is trying to save, is the lone creation of the Paintress’ son, who died in a fire that left his sister scarred and the family broken. This world is all she has left of her son, and her unrelenting need to preserve it is consuming her.</p><p>Meanwhile, her husband (the real Renoir, on whom the fictional man who has been killing expeditioners is based) is trying to destroy this canvas so his family can try to move on. He wants his wife to be set free from this magical world of their son’s imagination, in which she is losing herself. The numbers the Paintress brushes on the monolith aren’t a signifier of the people she’s Thanos-snapping out of existence, but a warning that her power to defend the general populace is waning, and that as she loses her strength in this decades-long battle with her husband to preserve her son’s memory, the eldest among them will be the next to disappear.</p><p>This twist has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/review/563522/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-ps5-pc-xbox&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/review/563522/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-ps5-pc-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">understandably divisive</a></span>. Any time a story presents itself as one thing and reveals itself to be something else entirely, you run the risk of losing people brought in by the initial premise. However, I’m glad to report that at this point, I was more on board than ever. I’d already been locked in by <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s meditations on grieving a life you know you’ll never get to live. Grief is a cultural touchstone of this universe, and to find that it was all born of a mother’s loss of her child was an incredible new lens through which to view it. It’s revealed that all of this loss was not inevitable, and that the expedition’s fictional nature means that if they defeat Renoir and put an end to his gommage, they could potentially bring back everyone they lost. This adds new layers of nuance about how we keep someone’s memory alive when they’re gone, and how a creative work, even if it’s mostly a child’s fantasy, is one way to remember those we’ve lost. But again, this is <em>Clair Obscur</em>, and it always has another devastating trick up its sleeve.</p><p>The game’s final act lets you head right for the point of no return, to face Renoir, loosen his grip on this world, and bring back all the people he has gommaged over the past 67 years. By this point, you’ve learned that Verso is the fictional facsimile of the Paintress’ dead son. You’ve also found out that another of your party members, Maelle, is the Paintress’ real-life daughter, who entered the painting to find her missing parents, and instead found a new life in which she’s no longer debilitated by the damage from the fire. Verso now wants to tear down the canvas, so he can stop living as a puppet propping up his family’s memory of a son and brother long gone. However, Maelle wants to bring everyone back and live out her life in her brother’s creation. So it’s up to you, the player, to choose who to play as in one final battle and determine the fate of Verso’s canvas.</p><figure id="" data-id="4234e4cc7fef370f76ed405d0d32872d" data-recommend-id="image://4234e4cc7fef370f76ed405d0d32872d" data-format="jpg" data-width="3836" data-height="1599" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle and Verso face each other in front of a distorted painting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maelle and Verso face each other in front of a distorted painting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4234e4cc7fef370f76ed405d0d32872d" data-recommend-id="image://4234e4cc7fef370f76ed405d0d32872d" data-format="jpg" data-width="3836" data-height="1599" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle and Verso face each other in front of a distorted painting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This was a decision so agonizing I had to put down my controller and make food, so I could give it proper thought. I was swayed to Verso’s side, until I returned and picked up the controller, when somehow my instincts took over, and I played as Maelle. Only, the ending I picked wasn’t quite what I envisioned. Rather than a bittersweet moment of Maelle bringing back all her brother’s creations and living happily ever after, what I experienced was more of a horror story. In this scenario, Maelle had trapped Verso in this world, forcing him to play piano for her and the rest of the revived Lumière.</p><p>I hadn’t perceived the game as setting up Maelle’s wishes to be a selfish path. I’d bought into the idea that saving the canvas and Verso’s memory was a noble choice worthy of the themes <em>Clair Obscur </em>had been operating within. But maybe that was me getting swept away by an idealistic view of this entire conflict. One of the only things that’s just as embedded in <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s DNA as grief is misdirection.</p><p>It’s been a few days since I finished <em>Clair Obscur</em>. I’ve been talking with others who have finished the game, and we’re all wrestling with the same questions of whether or not Sandfall Interactive truly stuck the landing. There are throughlines of grief in every new path it takes, but as the game shifts its themes, what it has to say about the process, the good and bad ways we deal with grief, and who was actually “right” in the surprising metatexual conflict, seems to shift as quickly as its inconsistent dodging windows. I’ve chewed on every possibility for days now, and part of me wonders if that dissatisfaction is just part of the process.</p><figure id="" data-id="2ac0c160fdec88b332781dedad592424" data-recommend-id="image://2ac0c160fdec88b332781dedad592424" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle with distortion across her face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maelle with distortion across her face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ac0c160fdec88b332781dedad592424" data-recommend-id="image://2ac0c160fdec88b332781dedad592424" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle with distortion across her face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Maybe I’m grieving the happy ending I thought I was fighting for. Perhaps, after all the death and despair I saw in <em>Clair Obscur</em>, it was foolish to have been looking for one in the first place. Grief isn’t just mourning the loss of a person, it’s lamenting a life you imagined you’d have. Sometimes I wonder if coming out of the grieving process is in fact delusion. We have to explain to ourselves how something as senseless as death has meaning, or reassure one another that we’ll see those we’ve lost in whatever comes next. We tell ourselves whatever is necessary in order to feel somewhat okay again, even if it doesn’t quite make sense. But no matter how we bandage the wound, grief never entirely goes away. We just come up with whatever explanation helps us go on about our day. I feel like that’s where I’m at with <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. I’ve decided that its ending, my dissatisfaction with parts of it, and all the ways the conclusion subverted what I hoped for, was probably the point. I can stay in the denial phase a little bit longer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Borderlands 4's release date is changing.</p>
<p>A video shared and then removed by Gearbox's Randy Pitchford revealed that the game - originally slated for release on 23rd September - will now launch a tad earlier, on 12th September.</p>
<p>"Holy, holy, what? This never happens," Pitchford said in the video. So, why is it happening at all? Well, Pitchford says things are simply going very smoothly on the development side of things, but call me Clouseau, I reckon it could also be to do with a little game you may have heard of: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>.</p>

<p>GTA 6 still lacks a release date, of course, but since Borderlands is published by 2K the company likely has a better idea of when GTA 6 will arrive than the rest of us, thanks to 2K also being part of Take-Two, the shared  parent company of Rockstar.</p>
<p>Take-Two and Rockstar are yet to announce a firm release date for GTA 6, easily one of the most anticipated games right now, but has said it will debut some time this autumn. As of February this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">the companies remain confident of that release window</a>, and it seems more than likely that Gearbox and 2K won't want Borderlands 4 being in any direct release date competition with GTA 6 when the time comes. Others are already saying the same thing. In February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">EA CEO Andrew Wilson confirmed the publisher would be willing to delay its next Battlefield</a> - currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expected to release before April 2026</a> - if "some things happening in the year" meant that "wasn't a great window for us". So, that'll be GTA 6.</p>
<p>So, given all this, could we be getting GTA 6 at the end of September or early October? That would be around the time Borderlands 4 was initially set for release. I mean, I obviously can't say for certain, but it's a theory.</p>
<p>As I've been writing all this, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/29/watch-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-deep-dive-state-of-play-on-april-30/">Sony has announced a Borderlands 4-focused State of Play</a>, set for 30th April (that's tomorrow) so, tune in with us to find out more. </p> <div>

			<p>Borderlands 4 will launch two weeks earlier than originally announced, Gearbox Software's Randy Pitchford confirmed today.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted video, which was saved and shared again on X by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64">Wario64</a>, Gearbox's CEO confirmed that the game's development is going incredibly well, so much so that it will now be released on September 12th instead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-to-release-on-september-23rd-on-pc-and-consoles-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">September 23rd</a>. Randy Pitchford added at the end of the video that the previously announced State of Play presentation focused on the game is also coming "imminently," so an official announcement shouldn't be too far away. [<strong>UPDATE</strong> - The State of Play presentation will air tomorrow, April 30th, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(Randy Pitchford jumpscare) Borderlands 4 is moving its release date up to September 12th (though he deleted this video/post because it went up too early apparently) <a href="https://t.co/ILuijVDcaL">pic.twitter.com/ILuijVDcaL</a></p>
<p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1917223361622508015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While the news of Borderlands 4 launching earlier than anticipated is, by itself, excellent news, it is also great news for Grand Theft Auto VI. Publisher Take-Two Interactive previously confirmed that the sixth entry in the Rockstar Games series would launch after Gearbox Software's game, so there's a good chance Borderlands 4's release date has been moved forward in preparation for the Fall 2024 launch of what is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated games of all time. If this is the case, there's a very good chance that another Grand Theft Auto VI trailer will be shown soon, though a former Rockstar Games developer thinks <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-to-release-on-september-23rd-on-pc-and-consoles-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">it wouldn't be necessary</a>, as the surprise factor could make the game's release even more successful.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on September 12th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-open-beta-kicks-off-in-may.1176441/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-open-beta-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced that the open beta for portal-based first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be starting next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release, you'll be able to head into the world of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>on May 22nd, and the beta will be available across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, with full crossplay also being enabled between all three platforms.</p>

<p>There's no time period listed in the press release, which seems to indicate that the open beta for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be closer in spirit to an Early Access release rather than a limited-time stress test.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-2-open-beta-date-portal-shooting.jpg?itok=YfTfEvrY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-2-open-beta-date-portal-shooting.jpg?itok=4WUwVmb2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to try out&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>on May 22nd.</figcaption></figure><p>Tons of stuff will be available for you to try out when&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s open beta lands in May. You'll have access to over 15 maps, including "two new massive 24-player Onslaught maps" in the form of Drought and Fracture.</p>

<p>Over 25 weapons will be available for you to try out, including&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s new Borealis energy carbine, and 10-plus modes will be available at launch as well, including the "fan favorite" Takedown mode.</p>

<p>Rather tantalizingly, 1047 also says&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will feature something called "infinite" maps, over footage of what looks rather like a level editor, so perhaps you'll be able to make your own mind-bending portal levels as well.</p>

<p>It's all accompanied by a rather brief, but nonetheless exciting, teaser trailer that shows off some of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s frantic action. You can check out that (admittedly very short) trailer right here.</p>




<p>First announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-announced" rel="nofollow">in July last year</a>, <i>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</i>is the sequel to 2022's&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>. Developer 1047 Games is putting all of its eggs into the sequel's basket, too; at the same time that it announced the sequel, the studio also revealed it would cease future development on the original game.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s open beta when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate-2/9pf5q1b0fhsl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> on May 22nd.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Release Date Apparently Moving Forward, Per Randy Pitchford]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-forward-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-release-date-apparently-moving-forward-per-randy-pitchford.1176438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-forward-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>might be coming out sooner than you think, if a now-deleted post on X by Gearbox head honcho Randy Pitchford is anything to go by.</p>

<p>The post, which was <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1917223361622508015" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">handily salvaged</a> by Wario64, shows Pitchford excitedly claiming that development on&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is going great; in fact, he says that where the team is at with the game right now is "the best-case scenario".</p>

<p>As a result, Pitchford says the&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>release date is being moved forward to September 12th. He also reiterates that there will be a&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>-focused PlayStation State of Play show "imminently", with PlayStation subsequently <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/29/watch-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-deep-dive-state-of-play-on-april-30/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirming that show for tomorrow</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-up-shooting.jpg?itok=UmCwTRJP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-up-shooting.jpg?itok=wcEW7tx0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is coming sooner than you think.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, Pitchford is framing&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s sooner release as a positive for Gearbox, but it's equally likely that the team has moved the release date forward to avoid clashing with some big games that are due out this fall.</p>

<p>There's Sony's&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to arrive on PS5 in October</a>, as is Paradox and The Chinese Room's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>&nbsp;</em>(at time of writing, at least).</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest elephant in the room, however, is&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, which Rockstar (and Gearbox) parent company Take-Two says is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" rel="nofollow">still on track to arrive sometime this fall</a>. No release date has been revealed yet, of course, but it is possible&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>was moved to avoid clashing with&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>, it's the fourth mainline entry in the&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>series (although not the fourth overall, thanks to the existence of games like&nbsp;<em>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel</em>).</p>

<p>The game features four all-new Vault Hunters with new abilities and skills to master, plus lots and lots of new weapons to collect. According to its narrative director,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director" rel="nofollow">feature less "toilet humor"</a> than its predecessors.</p>

<p>Assuming Pitchford's deleted post was accurate,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will launch on September 12th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also coming to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Borderlands-4-2792057.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/conquest-dark-hands-on-preview-vampire-survivors-cosmic-horror-conan-the-barbarian-yes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">My first ritual was ended by a large man with two morningstars swinging around him in a circle. Think the hands of a clock — one short, one long — but spikier and much, much more deadly, and equally inevitable as time, at least to the novice. I was playing a Barbarian that run; I didn’t understand what I was doing yet, or how to avoid them. My dodges weren’t dodging. I’d done pretty well up until that point, but he chewed through my lives like a dog with a bone, and then I was dead, my ritual incomplete. But I’d gotten somewhere, earned some upgrades, had a better idea of what I was doing. Time to try again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Conquest Dark is a strange beast. It clearly owes a lot to Vampire Survivors, but its inspirations don’t quit there. It’s also pulling from stuff like Conan the Barbarian — your characters look like they can bench press a car but start with little more than a loincloth — and some cosmic horror, as a treat. There isn’t much story in Conquest Dark, but the actual setup is cool. After the arrival of something called The Black Planet 237 years ago, humanity stands on the brink of annihilation. Undead armies have laid waste to the great human kingdoms. The Cosmic Gods have fallen. The Primordial Ones have awoken from their long slumber. Only Kharathia, The City of Legends, still stands, one last hope for humanity. In a last, desperate effort, people of all stripes — heroes, criminals, devotees of old gods, those seeking glory — complete Dark Rituals to summon the undead hordes and fallen heroes to gain power, hoping to use it to uncover the secrets of the Black Planet and reclaim what they can.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Conquest Dark Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a cool conceit, but Conquest Dark isn’t one for exposition. Most of this is delivered as text, and it’s up to you to stitch things together. You see it in the little details. The named bosses, like Lord Commander Urien, who appears outside Kharathia. Who was he before? A protector of the city, now turned against it in undeath? What about Witch Smeller Mzawi in the Shifting Sands? How do you smell witches, and what do you do if you catch a whiff of one? What happened at The Chasm of Fallen Heroes? Who was S’hes, why did she hunt Titans, and what specifically did she do to have an order of hunters named after her? What is the Black Planet? Where did it come from? I don’t know how interested in answering these questions Conquest Dark is, but every time I went to a new place, saw what was there, or learned a little bit more from a description, I was intrigued.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Dark Rituals, Big Choices</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In practice, Conquest Dark is pretty simple: you go to an area on the map to start a Dark Ritual. Once you’ve selected where you want to be, it’s time to figure out who. You’ve got a trio of characters to select from, and you can reroll those options as many times as you like. You only have one race (Human) and two classes (Hunter and Barbarian) from the jump, though you’ll quickly get more. I won’t spoil the additional races, but the new classes like the agile Thief, paladin-esque Oathkeeper, and the spellcaster-flavored Acolyte of Kuu, all do exactly what they sound like. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But let’s start from, well, the start. The Hunter is faster and more nimble and naturally inclined towards bows and ranged attacks, while the Barbarian has more health and bleed resistance, and thrives up close and personal with melee weapons, but what might be more interesting are the randomly generated proficiencies they get right from the jump. An extra 5% critical hit damage, 2.5% bonus health, or 5% reduced bleed rate may not seem like a big deal, but it can define who you want your character to be, and how you upgrade later. I particularly like that you can reroll your three starting choices as much as you want, for free, or leave an area entirely at no cost if you decide this isn’t where you wanna be.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>No matter who you pick, your character starts with nothing more than a loincloth and their fists. That doesn’t last long, though.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve got your guy (or gal), the fun begins. First, you select an origin. Veteran of the War gives you Heavy Armor, Shields, and 25% Bonus Health, while Hunter’s Apprentice adds Short Bow proficiency, Survival, and 0.5 Projectile Pierce. It’s important to note that you can double-up here. If you’re playing as a Hunter, you probably shouldn’t take Hunter’s Apprentice, for instance, because you already have two of those proficiencies, but it would be great for a Barbarian that wants to play the ranged game. If you play things, right, you can essentially multi-class: Oathkeepers are already hard to kill, but it’s even more difficult when you take the Stargazer origin, which gives you the Acolyte of Kuu’s barrier. Once you’ve got an origin, the games begin. No matter who you pick, your character starts with nothing more than a loincloth and their fists. That doesn’t last long, though. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After you smack your first undead back to the afterlife, you get your first major choice: your weapon. Some of your options might not seem all that important. Take a Hunter’s opening choices. Shortbow versus longbow’s not really that crucial, right? Wrong. Shortbows shoot faster, but do less damage per shot and have less range, while longbows take a little more time to fire, but hit harder and farther. Once you’re got your killing instrument of choice, things escalate. The first few waves are small, just so you have enough time to get used to things. Like Vampire Survivors, you don’t actually control much in Conquest Dark; just where you move and when you dodge. Attacking happens automatically. Instead, your focus is almost entirely on positioning. Where to be, when to dodge, keeping track of when abilities will activate, and being in a position to capitalize on that big shot or big swing.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>I Ain’t Got Time to Bleed</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As you level up, you’ll make more choices. What to equip, what abilities to upgrade, when to re-roll a selection you don’t like or skip it entirely for more currency for re-rolls later. There’s a ton of build variety here. I gravitated to builds with huge critical hit damage and high crit chance with the Hunter, but the Barbarian works well with AoE damage and by increasing the chance for enemies to drop health. Picking early and specializing seems to be key.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your real goal, aside from putting together a build that works, is staying alive as long as you can. See, you get 10 lives on each run. If you lose one, you start bleeding. The more lives you lose, the more you bleed. The first time you die, you start losing 1% of your health every second. The second time, that jumps to 2%. The third time makes it 3% and so on. There’s no way to stop bleeding once you start, but you can reduce it by speccing into health regeneration, reduced bleed rate, and how likely enemies are to drop health. Surviving long enough to complete a Ritual means staying alive after enemies cover every inch of the screen, and you start dying. The longer you can stave it off, the better, but the difference between a failed run and a successful one is how long you can hang on once things go sideways and the bosses start showing up. Like you, they have a lot of lives, and they can get pretty nasty, swinging morningstars or not. They’re tough, but if it bleeds, you can kill it. I’ve had the most success as a Hunter, Oathkeeper, and the Acolyte of Kuu (I like standing far away from things and shooting them), but I admire how different each class feels and how they forced me to approach fights in unique ways that played to their strengths.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Your real goal, aside from putting together a build that works, is staying alive as long as you can. See, you get 10 lives on each run. If you lose one, you start bleeding. The more lives you lose, the more you bleed. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you succeed or fail (and by the way, you die regardless; even if you succeed, an army of unkillable ghosts sweeps in to ruin your day. Oops), you’re going to unlock rewards, and then it’s back to the map to spend them to help future runs. Maybe that means heading to the Stygian Archive in Kharathia, where you can not only see everything you’ve unlocked, but also upgrade individual skills, weapon sets, abilities, and so on with the Soul Coins you get on each run. Or maybe you’re off to the Altar of Power to spend crystals for increased damage, or the Altar of Toughness to take a chunk out of that pesky bleed damage, or the Altar of Souls to make sure you can collect souls (experience) from farther away. And then there’s the Factions, like the aforementioned Order of S’hes, which rewards you with buffs for all classes for slaying things as a Hunter. And <em>then</em> there’s the Obelisk of the Moon, where you can ramp up the difficulty of performing Rituals for increased rewards by offering up Shards of the Black Planet. Then it’s back to a Ritual. Live, die, upgrade, repeat.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Live, Die, Upgrade, Retry</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Conquest Dark doesn’t stop and explain how all of this works off the bat, though there is a detailed game guide there if you want to do some light reading before you set off. Mostly, you learn by doing, and I like that. Put me in, coach, I’m ready to play, win or lose. And once you start unlocking more stuff, the wheels start turning. ‘What can I do with this class? How do I build around this thing? What if I tried taking this origin with this class? What can I <em>do</em>?” And once they start, they don’t really stop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This preview’s written, Lord Commander Urien (the dude with the morningstars) has been sent on his way, and I’ve seen several hours of Conquest Dark at this point. But I also can’t stop thinking about it, either. What I might try next, how I might upgrade certain things, what classes I want to explore. The moment-to-moment gameplay here is remarkably simple. You just move and dodge (or use dodge-based abilities that can double as attacks), but there’s an elegance to it that I appreciate, and it kept me coming back with new ideas. Upgrades may be what put you over the top, but the magic happens when you step into the arena, in the moments between life and death. You’re going to die; that’s a given. The question is how far you can get (and how many horrors you can vanquish) before you do.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivions-original-level-scaling-system-which-is-still-in-oblivion-remastered-was-a-mistake-designer-admits<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the heightened interest in all things The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion brought on by Bethesda’s popular remaster, its original designer has admitted the game's level scaling system was a “mistake.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion’s level scaling system is perhaps one of the most frustrating aspects of the 20-year-old open-world role-playing game. It means loot acquired is tied to the level of your character at the point you acquire it. So, if you complete a quest for a coveted sword at level one, you’ll get that sword locked at level one power. If you complete the same quest at level 25, you’ll get the sword at level 25. This, frustratingly, locks that cool sword you got at level one to level one power for your entire playthrough, no matter how much you level up. In effect players could, through no fault of their own, complete quests too early, renedering unique items useless later in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, enemies will still spawn according to your level. While this allows the foes you face to always provide a challenge, it does present a problem if you aren’t focusing on certain skills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to 2025 and some fans were shocked to find that Oblivion’s original level scaling system reappeared in Oblivion Remastered, when other parts of the game’s mechanics were modernized. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is very disappointing, especially when they said they went out of their way to fix the leveling system, which, to be fair, they did fix for player attributes,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k5mknf/fyi_for_remaster_level_scaling_is_still_in_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor minifat commented</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Original Oblivion designer Bruce Nesmith told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-levelling-system-mistake-admits-designer-haunts-remaster/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer</a> the game’s level scaling, or “world scaling” system was a “mistake.” Bethesda ended up changing the level scaling for 2011’s The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, which most fans believe was for the better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had a very substantial hand and voice in both levelling systems,” Nesmith said. “The nuts and bolts work, the mathematical mechanics, that was my work and I’m intimately familiar with how both of those things work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the world leveling with you was a mistake and that’s proven out by the fact it did not happen the same way in Skryim. That we came up with a much, much better way to continue to provide the player challenge without making it feel like, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter that I went up in levels, the dungeon went up in levels with me.’ "</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One area Oblivion Remastered did improve on was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/How_Leveling_Works_in_Oblivion_Remastered">leveling up your character</a>. In Oblivion Remastered, increasing both Minor and Major Skills now all contributes towards your next level, instead of only Major Skills providing any progress (Major Skills increase at a much faster rate, giving them a larger impact).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon resting in bed to begin the Level-up Screen, you're now presented with the list of Attributes and 12 Virtue Points. These points can be distributed among your Attributes (which cannot exceed 3, just like in the original), with a maximum of +5 points in any one Attribute (which was also the cap in the original).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the points can be allocated regardless of which skills you improved, you can now align your Attribute increases during each level up without fear of becoming underpowered by allocating points to Attributes that your character may not use as much. The only exception to this is Luck: It requires 4 Virtue Points for every point added to the Luck Attribute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There have also been a few changes to how certain skills increase. Mercantile, for example, increases at rates that align with how expensive the item bought or sold is, and Magick Skills increase faster when using spells with a higher magick cost, making spamming low-level spells to increase skills faster a less effective method.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, modders have once again come to the rescue. Fresh from tackling PC performance issues in Oblivion Remastered, modders have also released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/182" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">balanced NPC level cap mods</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/99?tab=description" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">balanced unleveled rewards mods</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Oblivion Remastered, including a report on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-player-escapes-the-confines-of-cyrodiil-to-explore-valenwood-skyrim-and-even-hammerfell-the-rumored-setting-of-the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>a player who managed to escape the confines of Cyrodiil to explore Valenwood, Skyrim, and even Hammerfell, the rumored setting of The Elder Scrolls VI</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've also got a comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil"><u>Interactive Map</u></a>, complete Walkthroughs for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Main_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>Main Questline</u></a> and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Guilds"><u>Guild Quest</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Character_Building_Guide"><u>How to Build the Perfect Character</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Things_to_Do_First_in_Oblivion"><u>Things to Do First</u></a>, every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/PC_Cheats_and_Console_Commands"><u>PC Cheat Code</u></a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/28/get-a-new-look-at-the-gorgeous-shinobi-art-of-vengeance-through-a-stage-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's been more than a decade since we received an all-new Shinobi title, but thanks to Sega's recent initiative to revive dormant IPs from its deep catalog, the company is set to release Shinobi: Art of Vengeance later this year. The gorgeous revival comes from Lizardcube, the development team behind 2020's Streets of Rage 4, a franchise that was originally published by Sega.</p>

<p>This entry is the first all-new game in the series since 2011's Shinobi on 3DS. Unlike the Streets of Rage revival, which was published by Dotemu, Sega is partnering directly with Lizardcube to revitalize the Shinobi series. Late last week, Sega gave us about a minute of new gameplay, teasing the design of the stages in Shinobi: Art of Vengeance. Though the levels and encounters appear well-designed and engaging, the visual aesthetic continues to steal the show with every new glimpse at Lizardcube's next title.</p>

<p>You can view the new trailer below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lLxNxbmRX0" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 29. Those pre-ordering the Digital Deluxe Edition can play three days before everyone else and receive additional in-game items, including currency, a Ghost outfit, a Medic Lite Amulet, and a Sega Villains Stage.</p>

It launched last week to generally rave reviews, and developer Sandfall Interactive announced it’s also performing similarly well sales-wise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The developer took to <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1916409440011444331">X</a> yesterday to reveal it shipped over 1 million copies of the hit RPG in just three days (the game launched on April 24). Though marketed primarily by Xbox, Sandfall confirms this number does not include Xbox Game Pass players, so it appears the game is also selling well across PlayStation 5 and PC. It also seems the surprise launch of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/22/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-available-today">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> days earlier has not hindered the game’s success.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the debut title for French developer Sandfall Interactive and has garnered critical acclaim. It currently sits at a 92 critical score on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Metacritic</a>; we awarded it a 9 out of 10 in <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33/melancholy-rpg-eminence">our review</a>. The adventure follows an expedition of adventurers on a mission to stop a mysterious paintress with the power to wipe out humans of a certain age every year. It boasts fast-paced turn-based action bolstered by third-person action elements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As editor Kyle Hilliard noted in his review, “The world, art, and narrative are unique, but it makes me nostalgic for a game I remember from the past. It’s as though developer Sandfall Interactive managed to make a classic RPG with only the good parts. I’m sad in a way to have concluded the journey, but the adventure to pursue the Paintress will linger with me for some time.”</p>

			<p>The bean bag is a stone-cold classic. Filling professional lofts, student flats and playrooms since the 1960s, it’s a universal piece of lo-fi design, that was more or less perfected the first time out. That said, modern companies like <a href="https://www.bigberthaoriginal.com/">Big Bertha</a> have seen that there’s clear room for improvements, nipping and tucking the classic bean bag into new, more contemporary forms, with modern, harder-wearing fabrics and updated ‘beans’. What that amounts to, in the Big Bertha Ultra Lux Gaming Chair, is a bean bag that’s comfortable, can take some punishment, and is perfect for the longest gaming sessions you can muster.</p>
<p>To be sure we understand each other, bean bags are not full of beans of the baked, broad or green variety, and nor are they made from plastic or paper bags. The Ultra Lux is a fabric bean bag with an additional fabric chair back built into it, with the beans moving freely between the two and sculpting to your body when you settle down into it. Because it moulds to your body as you sit down it’s incredibly comfortable, and the extra structure of the chair back means that you’re also really well supported in a way I’ve not experienced from a bean bag before.</p>



<p>Our review chair came in grey cord, which, purely by luck, matched our sofa perfectly. If you happen to have bought a cord sofa in the past five years or so – there’s a good chance you’ve been to DFS at some point – you’ll know how soft and hard-wearing the fabric is, and through our testing it stood up to plenty of punishment, as well as the requisite popcorn and biscuit crumbs that any seat manages to accumulate, even when you haven’t eaten anything.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s stain resistant if you do have a food or drink based snafu, and refillable if someone manages to make their way through the dual zips – during our testing these thankfully stopped the inside beans becoming outside beans. The beans themselves are made from SupremeX polystyrene, which is designed to last longer and be more durable than competitors offerings, and through our time with the Ultra Lux, we’ve not noticed any noticeable loss of bean density, or the bag – in essence – deflating, so they appear to be doing exactly what they’re designed for.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I’ve had with the Ultra Lux is that I struggle to get into it. Not because I lack the flexibility to sit closer to the floor, but because my 8 year-old has claimed it as his own. For someone much smaller than myself it literally turns into a nest, and he’s generally found secured within it with Lego City on the TV and an iPad in hand looking far too pleased with himself.</p>

<p>Seriously, it’s almost upsetting how pleased with himself he is, and I have to be faster than an 8 year-old if I want to take my turn in the chair. Luckily, he goes to school and I get to stay at home some days, so the joke’s on him. Thanks to the headrest, it’s ideal for a sneaky midday nap, which I absolutely don’t do because I am consistently working hard.</p>
<p>While our review unit was grey, there’s a whole range of different colours and a choice of alternate fabrics to wrap your beans up in. The Aegean Blue colour that they use in a lot of their advertising looks particularly good, and I’m already thinking of picking up a second one for a different room.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing about the Ultra Lux, or indeed any of the Big Bertha bags, is that they don’t cost very much. You can currently pick one up direct from the Big Bertha website for £109.90, and I think that’s phenomenal value, particularly for the build quality and extreme comfort you’re going to experience for a very long time.</p>

				<p>Summary</p><p>
				If you're looking for a cost-effective and hugely comfortable gaming chair, it's well worth thinking about an Ultra Lux bean bag from Big Bertha. Not only are they a fraction of the price, unlike traditional gaming chairs, they're light enough to move around your home too. 			</p></div>

			<p>Straight4 Studios has announced that its upcoming sim racing game, Project Motor Racing, will arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC sometime in Fall 2025.</p>
<p>At launch, Project Motor Racing will feature more than 70 vehicles across 10 racing classes and 27 track layouts. Straight4 Studios also showcased some gameplay in a new trailer released today, showing off some early, but still impressive, footage.</p>
<p>The trailer also included a cameo from professional racer Derek Bell, playing the game with a full <a href="https://wccftech.com/genesis-announces-the-seaborg-400-racing-wheel-controller/">racing sim setup</a>. It's a clear sign of the kinds of players that Project Motor Racing is targeting: the sim racing fan who went all-out to play their favorite kinds of games in the best way possible.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Motor Racing | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dMerxYOaOm8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The upcoming sim racer will have the expected modes, including a single-player career mode and an online multiplayer mode, which will feature leaderboards and "<em>full race weekends</em>" for a more in-depth multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>While Project Motor Racing is being developed by Straight4 Studios, it's being built on publisher Giants Software's own GIANTS game engine. For chief executive officer of Giants Software, Christian Ammann, it's a new step forward for the studio and the beginning of a new era.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">This is the next gear for GIANTS Software: Moving forward, we will be recognized not only as the creators of Farming Simulator but also as the publisher of Project Motor Racing,</span></em>" Ammann said in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Our strong collaboration with Straight4 gives me full confidence that we’ll deliver an exceptional experience for all sim racing enthusiasts!</span></em>"</p>
<p>Straight4 Studios' chief executive officer, Ian Bell, added, "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">This is not about driving. It’s about racing. With our streamlined approach and what we consider to be the most authentic handling model we’ve ever created, Project Motor Racing is both a nod to our genre’s rich legacy and a big step into the next era of simulation.</span></em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/sniper-elite-board-game-and-eagles-nest-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>He's there. You know he's there. Even before you found the bodies, it's almost like you felt his presence. Always watching. You feel like you're under a constant crosshair. But to save yourself from going mad, you've fallen back on your orders. Guard the facility, patrol the routes, but he's still there. You know he's there.</i></p>

<p><i>Sniper Elite the Board Game </i>is based on the popular <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/sniper-elite" rel="nofollow"><em>Sniper Elite</em></a> video game series. In this review, we'll look at how it plays and how it stacks up against the video game it's based on, and we'll also check out what the Eagle's Nest expansion adds to games. <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> was a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2020, and another expansion, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/rebellionunplugged/sniper-elite-operation-kraken" rel="nofollow">Operation Kraken</a>, is planned on Gamefound.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=FFSOzB3L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=bOUJS-PW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The sniper miniature in <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> actually only shows your last known location. You could be long gone as the guards close in.</figcaption></figure><h2>Hidden Sniper Moving Target</h2>

<p><i>Sniper Elite the Board Game </i>is a hidden movement 1 vs many board game. What that means is that 1 player takes the role of the Sniper, and up to 3 players (or an AI card deck if playing solo) take on the role of the guards. The guards are split into 3 teams of 3, and their miniatures are placed on the map. During their turn, they can move and search areas, looking for the sniper.</p>

<p>The sniper, using a smaller separate copy of the game board, uses a dry-erase marker to track their movement, as they try and complete 2 objectives. Their miniature is kept off the board and secret, creating noise if they move too fast, which the defenders can track, narrowing their search area. The sniper miniature is only placed on the board if the defenders discover them, they complete an objective, or if they create too much noise when taking a shot.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=wdhT5_Ms 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=1GEhJogp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> uses radomly drawn tokens for shooting.</figcaption></figure><p>Shooting in <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> uses an interesting, unique mechanic. It's an almost completely diceless board game (except a single die for solo play), and instead, when making a shot, players draw tokens from a bag. A number of aim tokens is required, equal to the number of spaces between you and your target (including your target's space). The number of tokens you draw is up to you, but if you draw 2 or more noise tokens, then your position is revealed, and if you draw a combination of 5 or more noise and recoil tokens, then you miss your shot regardless of how many aim tokens you draw. Tokens are added to the bag as the game progresses, such as more noise tokens for being spotted, or more aim tokens for taking out enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=Jc9wdOx9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=1EjQwmPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sniper Elite the Board Game </em>has a map where the action takes place, and a seperate map for the hidden sniper to track their movements.</figcaption></figure><h2>Boom Headshot</h2>

<p>There are only 2 maps in the core game box, but the variety comes from the random objectives, keeps the game varied for the sniper and the guards guessing. There are also 6 specialist abilities that each one of the guard commanders can choose 1 of, and 10 items that the sniper can choose 2 of. This combination of objectives, specialists, and items means that rarely will a game be the same.</p>

<p>The hidden nature of the game also keeps things fresh, and playing the guards made me super anxious. It's much simpler to have one player playing all 3 guard units, as they can work overlapping search areas, but having 3 makes it as complicated as 3 independent units would, each with their own ideas for where the sniper might be.</p>

<p>For the sniper player, I honestly thought going into the game that I would be blasting away the enemies of the Allied campaign as you do in the game, but it's actually better to fire no shots at all, and when you do fire, shoot an irrelevant target to confuse your opponents. Moving a target out of your way alerts them to your rough area and possible objective.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=c8bCYrBl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=Xi0ABjmG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sniper Elite the Board Game Eagle's Nest </em>expansion adds a load of new variety with new snipers and new maps.</figcaption></figure><h2>Where Eagles Dare</h2>

<p>The <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game Eagle's Nest </em>expansion adds a lot more variety to games. It includes 2 new maps, with solo defender control cards and new objective cards for them. It also includes some new equipment cards to help you navigate the cliffs and water of the Heavy Water map. The other map is set entirely inside Eagle's Nest, a challenging, claustrophobic room-to-room mission.</p>

<p>Eagle's Nest also includes 4 new sniper miniatures and stat cards to go with them, offering a variety of special abilities. Karl, the original <em>Sniper Elite</em> character, starts with the most aim tokens in the bag and can fire twice a turn. Rosa from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sniper-elite-4" rel="nofollow"><em>Sniper Elite 4</em></a> can only target enemies 5 spaces away, but only starts with 1 noise token. Jun, from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zombie-army-4-dead-war" rel="nofollow"><em>Zombie Army 4: Dead War</em></a> can remove multiple adjacent targets with a single shot, at the cost of adding noise tokens to the bag, and Major Eazy, from Battle comics, and starts the game with 3 noise and 3 aim tokens, but noise tokens count as aim tokens for him, so you can freely blast away.</p>

<h2>Sniper Elite the Board Game Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I honestly thought that I would have a completely different experience going into <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em>. I thought shooting would be a lot more prevalent than it is, and I didn't expect the hidden movement element to be so much fun. It captures an element of the video game perfectly, with the sniper having a feeling of such control, until things go wrong, and then things can deteriorate quickly. It is 2 vastly different experiences playing the guards or the sniper, both fun and challenging in their own right. The token bag for shooting plays into it all perfectly, and the risk/reward element is a pivotal focus of the game.</p>

<p>The Eagle's Nest expansion adds a lot more variety, with the extra maps doubling the number in the core set, and the extra snipers adding some very different styles of play. The core game stands alone as a great experience out of the box, and while the Eagle's Nest is a great addition, it is simply adding more variety on top of an already great and varied game.</p>
