Based on the classic 1987 film, The Princess Bride pinball table has several features that'll let players interact with characters from the fantasy movie, like matching Vizzini in a battle of wits and freeing Westley from a deathtrap by shooting a pinball through marked lanes. If you're feeling lucky--or you're prepared to die--you can even challenge Inigo Montoya to a duel.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="457620312" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

the Goat Simulator table, things get weird with this crossover as it has headbutting bumpers, a big red button that can be triggered to start a nuclear apocalypse, a chance to stop an alien invasion, and an opportunity chance to impress the judges on an episode of Farmer's Got Talent. Like the Goat Simulator games developed by Coffee Stain North, this one is all about causing as much chaos as possible in each run.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="634961961" data-promo-id="0"

            <p>In my brief time with massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/"></a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout London</a>, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”</p>
<p>“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services <em>are</em> crap!” I was having a <em>good</em> time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I am not alone in this. There's a <a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1817959101441446153">patch on the way</a>, and there are already a few supposed fixes. One of which involves <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-crash">downloading yet another mod</a>. The other is a apparently a Nvidia issue with the ‘Weapon Debris’ setting. Unfortunately, to turn that off I have to uninstall FOLON and Fallout 4, then reinstall Fallout 4 to access the vanilla settings menu. I have already done this twice. I initially tried to get the thing working on Steam, then had to go buy it on GOG because the downgrader wasn’t working. Then, I did a fresh install the first time I started experiencing crashes so I could tweak the settings. It did not work.</p>
<p>Simply put, I’m done. To be clear, this isn’t me saying “avoid the mod”, just that I’ve hit my own personal tolerance for pissing around with files. I’ll watch a YouTube video, because I do genuinely want to see more of what FOLON has on offer. So, PSA then: try to get set up with the extra mods and settings you need <em>before</em> you go in, to avoid similar ballaches. That, or wait for the patch.</p>
<p>It’s a real shame, because London seems great so far. Everything from architecture to lighting, to a new dialogue system more reminiscent of New Vegas, is such an incredible step up from vanilla Fallout 4. Feast your mince pies on this station from the opening area:</p>

<p>It reminded me far more of Bioshock’s spooky grandeur than what I was expecting, but it works well. I’m also finding the lack of traditional Fallout iconography to be incredibly refreshing. I don’t think I’m alone in feeling that Vault Boy and Nuka-Cola have long been stripped of any satirical charm they once might have held; mascot-ified to Funko Pop tier, all dead gloss like the eyes of taxidermied critters. But here, even the Pip Boy has been replaced, and these new symbols are enough to run interference on stifling familiarity, revitalising the setting. Also, again: you can restore health by eating pink wafers.</p>
<p>So, do enjoy Fallout London when you get around to it. I’m certain you will, just make sure you’re all set up beforehand. Me? I’m going to have nightmares about a giant file that simply will not unzip.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A mod has been released for the fan-made <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> mod Fallout: London to change all football references to soccer.
</p>
<p>
Fallout: London, unsurprisingly, transports the post-apocalypse of the series to the English capital and has been created by a group of British fans, Team Folon.
</p>
<p>
That means the mod is full of British references, but the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/11?tab=description">It's A Soccer Ball mod</a> on NexusMods from GrumpyOldNord changes things for American players.

<p>
"Are you an American exploring London for the first time and find some of the lingo a bit confusing?" reads the mod description. "Have no fear! The soccer ball is now properly named so as to avoid confusion with a real football."
</p>
<p>
Not only is the ball itself renamed, but the Football Kit outfit has been changed to Soccer Uniform.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, this has caused quite a stir. 
</p>
<p>
"Immersion restored," reads one comment on the mod's NexusMods page. "Finally, a good mod on Nexus," reads another.
</p>
<p>
One comment even suggests to go "full circle and change all the spelling as well. Turn this into a damn salt mine".
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/11-1721959587-1489190043.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Looks like a football to me. | <span>Image credit: <cite>GrumpyOldNord</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Other comments, presumably from Brits, are more horrified. In fact, fans have tagged the mod as "horror" along with the creator's "humour, joke or just for fun".
</p>
<p>
There are replies of "Oi govna!" and "R u havin a giggle?", though one takes it a step further: "Reporting this mod for terrorism. Absolutely dastardly behaviour, you deserve a hundred fortnights in the stocks."
</p>
<p>
It's - mostly - all in good faith. "This is the best troll mod in a long time," wrote one fan. 
</p>
<p>
Of course it's also brought up plenty of comments about the origins of the term soccer - ironically it's from Britain. The sport was known as Association Football, which was shortened to "assoccer" - the name then stuck over in America to differentiate it from what became American Football.
</p>
<p>
If anything, the popularity of the mod reflects the success of Fallout: London overall. However, it's been an unstable launch with players noting plenty of performance issues.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-developers-promise-incoming-fix-for-biggest-issues">Team Folon is working on fixes</a>, with an update on the way soon.

<p>As confirmed on the game's <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/star-wars-outlaws/645ba713a9ce0448bffa4c12.html">Ubisoft store page</a>, the minimum system requirements for 1080p, 30 FPS low-settings gameplay include an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 @ 3.6 GHz or Intel Core i7 8700K @ 3.70 GHz CPU, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 (6 GB), AMD RX 5600XT (6 GB), Intel Arc A750 (8 GB, with ReBAR on) or better GPU, and 16 GB RAM.</p>
<p>The Star Wars Outlaws system requirements get obviously more demanding for 4K resolution, 60 FPS gameplay.

Following news of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">yesterday's layoffs at Bungie</a>, CEO Pete Parsons has faced criticised from staff for spending millions on classic cars since the studio was purchased by Sony in 2022 and bragging about his lavish collection, as the company headed towards this week's latest brutal round of job losses.
</p>
<p>
Employees - some of whom are now unemployed - have shared links to an array of classic cars purchased via the <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/">Bring a Trailer website</a>, with <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/member/bngpparsons/">Parsons profile</a> public and listing a vast number of auction wins. The earliest was in September 2022 costing $34,000; the most recent was 1st June this year costing $91,500, just a month before these latest layoffs. "How exciting!" wrote Parsons in a comment. "I have wanted a c1 since I was a little kid. My second hot wheel ever (in gold). Going to its forever home."
</p>
<p>
Parsons spent $79,000 on a vehicle in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">October 2023 just ahead of the previous layoffs</a>, followed by three more purchases over the remainder of the year - including a Porsche costing over $200k. In total, Parsons appears to have spent $2,414,550 on vehicles.

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">Sony purchased Bungie in 2022 for $3.6bn</a>. While it's unclear how much Parsons has earned since the buyout, it would appear Bungie's senior leadership has not taken salary cuts while over the past nine months almost a quarter of the workforce has been laid off.

</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover">report from IGN</a> last December following layoffs at Bungie, employees asked a department head during a post-layoffs Q&amp;A if leadership would be taking salary cuts, to which the response was Bungie was "not that type of company".

</p>
<p>
Parsons described yesterday's layoffs as "some of the most difficult changes we've ever had to make as a studio" in a blog post, citing the rising costs of development, industry shifts, and "enduring economic conditions" as key reasons for the cutbacks.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">response to the layoffs online has been mostly anger</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s global community lead Dylan Gafner in particular calling the layoffs "inexcusable".

</p>
<p>
Parsons' Bring a Trailer account was spotted and shared online following the news, with many calling for the CEO to step down.
</p>

Former Destiny 2 community manager <a href="https://x.com/DirtyEffinHippy/status/1818699797228081650">Liana Ruppert shared a story on social media</a> of struggling to find money for groceries while working at Bungie, while Parsons "bragged about a few new expensive cars he bought and that we should come to his house and see them."

<p>
Ruppert continued: "And I have not stopped digging since October. There's so much more to this that won't come out for a few more years to protect people, but I just want to say this: This falls squarely on leadership."
</p>
<p>
Another <a href="https://x.com/TheSamBartley/status/1818678522397049082">former employee called out Parsons</a> as a "coward" for setting his social media to private, adding: "You lied to my face. Straight to it. You also invited me to come see your new cars two days before you laid me off." Parsons has since made his account public once more.

</p>
<p>
Destiny 2 YouTuber <a href="https://x.com/MyNameIsByf/status/1818671790538809555">MyNameIsByf also called out leadership</a>. "They've been reckless with the studio, its employees, and its franchises," he posted. "The problem is clear. Bad leadership. It needs to change."

</p>
<p>
Destiny 2's most recent expansion, The Final Shape, has received praise from critics and players. "Bungie sticks the landing as it finally brings together the threads of its epic first saga," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review">Eurogamer The Final Shape review</a>. It seems even this success was not enough to prevent layoffs.

<p>The game will be released on September 26 on PC (Steam, Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. Destructive Creations also confirmed that it will partner with Intel to optimize the game for Intel-powered PC hardware such as laptops and handhelds.</p>
<p>The announcement lands today because it is the 80th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, which sought to free the Polish capital from Nazi occupation. It lasted 63 days, hence the game's title. Destructive Creations also released a free PC demo, available for download via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2202120/63_Days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. The store page also includes full system requirements for 63 Days, which we have included below.</p>

It is also bloody wonderful. A land filled with hallowed stodge. Pies and gravy. Buttery chip barms. Corned beef and tattie hash. It's a realm with more dialects than common sense. Broad accents. Yawning vowels. Enunciation? Pure myth. Industrial roots run deep. Change comes slowly, but somehow that's no bad thing. You make do and crack on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thank Goodness You're Here!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> leans into that roughshod, redbrick vision of England. The "comedy slapformer," developed by Coal Supper and published by Panic, is an offbeat palette cleanser that dares to be different. It's equal parts puzzler and sketch show, whisking players away to the fictional town of Barnsworth so they can help the locals run absolutely crackpot errands.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The interactive elements are kept light. You can jump and slap objects while exploring a series of interlocking vignettes–and that's about it. Coal Supper co-founders Will Todd and James Carbutt (who both hail from the Yorkshire town of Barnsley) explain that was a deliberate choice made in service of their own irreverent, farcical, and slightly raunchy brand of comedy.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ey up! What's all this then?">Ey up! What's all this then?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Early on, we reconciled that humor is all we've really got," says Carbutt, speaking to Game Developer ahead of launch. Initially, he explains </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thank Goodness You're Here!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had more robust gameplay elements. There were deeper puzzles, non-linear elements, more complex controls. That all fell away when Carbutt and Todd realized that striving to make a puzzle-first experience would be incredibly counterproductive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We realized that if we make a puzzle game, and it's not great, then we've made a bad puzzle game," says Carbutt, who explains the pair instead decided to focus on what they're "pretty good at." Being absolutely ludicrous.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Something we landed on early, before there was even a town that was ostensibly Barnsley or anything, was this idea of distinct compositions or vignettes," adds Todd. Exploring that concept convinced the duo there should be fewer "verbs" in the game–largely because they questioned whether more complex interactions, such as asking players to physically lug objects around the world, would actually work in a title that was disparate by design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In a way it was a technical limitation [we imposed ourselves], but it also let us lean away from being a puzzle game or any other genre into putting the comedy forward. So that's why basically we only have one interact button." He says. "Secretly, it's just a short film where the player is pressing 'play' every so often."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Putting the comedy forward involved slowly teasing scenarios out of gags. The joke would come first, and if they were still laughing a week later they'd begin figuring out how to turn an abstract jape into something more tangible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Early on, we really had no clue [how to make it work]. We tried to come up with bits and then ask 'how do we get from A to B,'" says Todd. "We got really experimental with it, but I think what worked was very slowly teasing gameplay and narrative out of the gags. If we were still laughing after a week we asked 'how does this fit? What does the player do on-screen while this is happening? Should it just be a cutscene or should we have interaction in there?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thank Goodness You're Here!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was initially a more non-linear experience. Players were able to complete tasks in any order, ambling through Barnsworth at their own behest. The idea was to give players more freedom, but playtesting proved that's not always a boon. "We found that people were often in the wrong areas, just doing laps through pathways and missing the one thing they were supposed to do," says Todd. "So basically we just realized we should just put this on-rails and it'll still work. We can have a more tight, curated experience where you can only do certain things enough times to see the jokes unfold."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The vignettes themselves remained freeform to some degree. Players can explore areas and interact with objects to find jokes that have been squirrelled away, but moving between those sections is a one-way street. "I don't feel like we lost too much by taking that big sprawling flowchart of branching paths and just laying it out in a straight line, because you get to the meat either way."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Are you having me on?">Are you having me on?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Testing for design is relatively straightforward. You cobble together various elements and see how players react. Testing for comedy is a more intuitive task, especially in the case of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thank Goodness You're Here!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">–which was in development for over four years and draws on the personal experiences of both Todd and Carbutt. It meant both creators had to follow their instincts and believe in their barmy brand of buffoonery.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's very difficult to [test comedy] because it's a joke you're telling in private for four years, and then in public once," says Carbutt. "So much of the humor is in the dialogue and the characters and the minutiae of their facial expressions, you don't actually know [whether it'll land] until it's all done.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Early on, we decided we need to stick to our guns and what we find funny. Then if it doesn't quite hit the mark and miss, then at least we haven't pandered and then missed. We've made something unique in our tone of voice, and that's interesting. The truth is some of the jokes haven't worked. They don't make a lot of sense. People don't quite understand them but people seem to be quite forgiving because it's a nice world to exist in. It's something we struggled with, but the bottom line is 'go with your gut.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coal Supper's debut project, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Good Time Garden</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was equally absurd but still found an audience. That early success was a proof-of-concept the pair could reference when refining their silliness in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thank Goodness You're Here!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The fact the title is essentially a sketch show–reminiscent of classics like Monty Python and The Fast Show–also helped. It means those gags that don't stick rarely outstay their welcome, letting Todd and Carbutt swing for the fences without fear.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think the fact that we didn't really go in with a broad story circle and say 'here are all the characters we need to develop as people' really helped. It's like sketch comedy basically," says Todd. Carbutt agrees and hopes the pacing of the experience, which shifts gears at speed, means it won't become "too grating."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps the most compelling aspect of</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Thank Goodness You're Here!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the gaudy northern whimsy slathered onto every pixel. It'll be fascinating to see how the game lands with an international audience–and even those Brits who have spent most of their years confined to the South. The poor sods.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It feels like a love letter to the very foundations of England. A jovial ode to a working class bedrock that's rarely the centerfold in mainstream media. Carbutt and Todd looked everywhere to capture that underrepresented side of the country. The dustbins that lined the streets of their hometown. British comics like Beano and The Dandy. The nonsensical imagery you might inexplicably find on the walls of a Toby Carvery. And those traditional dialects you can still hear on the pothole-strewn tarmac across the country.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That wasn't necessarily the plan from the outset. Carbutt says the pair never sought to make the 'English Game,' but after workshopping the earliest vignettes using their own voices and accents, it felt natural to simply lean into their heritage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In reality, the big motivation was doing something "fun" for themselves. They find joy in the chaos of misdirection. Teeing up a gag only to befuddle and bemuse. Weaponizing wordplay and double entendre with reckless abandon. "Doing stupid voices and getting paid for it," chimes in Todd.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Having fun was always the big motivation. We never said 'let's make an indie video game to have a really good work-life balance and healthy salary," he continues. "It was always what we enjoyed doing. That was the big motivating factor. It's just what feels right to us."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

			<p>BioWare has <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/07/31/unveiling-the-veilguard-cast-and-characters-detailed-at-san-diego-comic-con/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that it will reveal the release date (and a roadmap) of Dragon Age: The Veilguard at some point in August. A likely option is Gamescom Opening Night Live, hosted by Geoff Keighley and due to go live on Tuesday, August 20 at 8 PM CET on all major streaming platforms, for an expected two-hour duration. It would certainly be an interesting choice, given that the game itself is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-and-paradox-arent-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not</a> currently planned to be shown at all at the German convention, press included.</p>
<p>In the blog post, BioWare also shared some highlights from its recent trip to San Diego for 2024's Comic-Con. There, the developers presented the Dragon Age: The Veilguard voice cast for the player character (there will be two choices for males and two for females, allowing players to pick between UK and US accents) and the seven companions.</p>
<p>Performance Director Ashley Barlow said:</p>
<p><em>I feel like you can fall in love with any of them. Everyone that has touched this project has put a piece of their heart into it and into all of the different characters you could cross paths with. I know for me at times, in the companion stories, it seemed like I was watching a scene out of my own life. It’s a powerful feeling to have something or someone to relate to on screen.</em></p>
<p>She also talked about fan-favorite character Lace Harding, the dwarf ranger returning from Dragon Age: Inquisition, played by Ali Hillis (Dr. Liara T'Soni in Mass Effect):</p>
<p><em>Ali brought a weight and a history to this project as an anchor of the series. There was a growth to Harding. She’s a veteran now. She’s a trusted voice at the table, and the writers did such a great job of integrating her with the new team and finding the relationships with each of the unique characters.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is slated to launch this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Find out everything about the fourth chapter in the fantasy roleplaying game franchise in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roundup article.</a></p>

            <p>Well, would you look at that! I just got done pining for the merest whiff of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeon-keeper">Dungeon Keeper</a> when what should appear on Steam but a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400770/Dungeon_Tycoon/">free prologue</a> for delightful voxel-arty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management</a> sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeon-tycoon">Dungeon Tycoon</a>. I’m using the word ‘appear’ because, following yet more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">industry layoffs </a>yesterday, I’m choosing to adopt the brain of an idiot as to shield myself from the crushing reality of material conditions. So, anyway, the magical game goblins whacked the demo on Steam, and I’ve been having a lot of fun with it. Thanks, adequately compensated and unionised gobbos!</p>

<p>Admittedly, the similarities to the Bullfrog classic do more or less end with the construction and theming. Here, it’s all about showing the heroes that visit your dungeon a rip roarin’, loot haulin’, exp-gettinin’ time. It’s closer to a traditional park manager, really. You charge an entrance fee to your dungeon, and try to please your visitors. This earns you prestige, which means better dungeon gubbins, and so on. After my first day, I get complaints like “not enough monsters to kill” and “horrible loot!,” which makes me feel more like a beleaguered MMO dev than an evil overlord.</p>
<p>You can still kill the heroes, and you'll actually want to do this sometimes to gain souls, which can be spent on certain researchables, among other things. Otherwise, it’s about finding the balance between keeping the vistors challenged, but also adequately buffed with totems, potions, and the like. You can view a given hero’s specific praise and grumbles at any time. “Fair health potion prices!” one declares, upon which I immediately jack up prices. They also love loot, although paradoxically, you actually gain money when a hero opens a chest. They also leave Yelp reviews for you after they’ve been skewered to death on a spike trap, so I’ll suspend my disbelief.</p>
<p>I guess my big criticism here is there’s no real management to do during the actual days, so you just have watch the heroes at pleasehurryup times speed until they’re done. Still, there’s a chunky rhythm to the build/start day cycle, and I found myself very quickly planning out my next addition, whether that be a new monster or a frankly offensive amount of traps for a single room. As I said, it’s not Dungeon Keeper, but you do<em> keep </em>a <em>dungeon</em>. Also, I just realised the publisher is actually named “Goblinz”. I knew it!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Having a list of Suffolk amusement park mascots one desperately wishes to outlive out of an innate desire for revenge is, I imagine, not a universal experience. Still, on the day Pleasurewood Hills mascot Woody Bear is taken by the soil, I will jig and whoop under the moon. I actually cannot remember when the beef started, but my mum reliably informs me that I was terrified to tears by this bear as a child. He yet survives, but mark my words: when the Woody Copters finally fall from their rusted hinges, I will salt the earth.</p>
<p>Happily, I didn’t spot any bear mascots in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a>’s new deep dive trailer.</p>

<p>The big ticket (whey!) new feature in this sequel to 2016’s theme park <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management game</a> is water parks, which can co-exist with your more traditional theme parks, peaceful creatures that they are. You’ll have the expected expansive toolkit for making your slides. Just like the coasters from the original, getting real wiggly with it does run the risk of causing nausea in your guests, so you’ll need to balance your Daedalusian tube-hubris with at least a modicum of consideration for their preferences.</p>
<p>Life guards are a new staff type, and you’ll be able to assign them to specific pools and areas. You can’t run a park on flawless safety records, however, so you can plonk down inflatable sellers, ticketing booths, and other cash siphons to monetise every aspect of your guest’s vacation. Has anyone done an expansion to one of these park sims where you can follow a guest home to watch them morosely budget next year’s family holiday, desperately trying to flog all the park tat they bought on eBay to afford extra petrol money and car sarnies? Sounds like a right laugh. Get on that, industry. Until then, we’ve at least got simulated changing rooms for speedy speedo switching, which you’ll need to lay out carefully to keep the flow of walking wallets running smoothly.</p>
<p>Guests in Planet Coaster 2, says the devs, will be more varied and diverse, and you’ll also get more feedback as to whether they’re enjoying themselves. You’ll also need to make sure they’ve got access to things like suncream and shade, since they can now get sunburn if the weather’s too hot.</p>
<p>‘Flat rides’, such as teacups, will offer more creative options, like scenery and attaching blueprints directly to rides. Frontier say they’ve “pared back” some of the complexity from certain rides, to allow more space for customisation.</p>
<p>Much of the rest of the video shows new, impressive rides that I’m mostly certain I will never be able to get working properly. They look good though! You’ll be able to personally spiff up coaster cars, too, with QOL tools like twinning and mirroring to save you adding bits individually. Lastly, the video mentions the need for water filtration in your pools, which get dirtier over time.</p>
<p>Given Planet Coaster’s exceptionally dedicated and talented modding community, there’s a good chance the theme you want won’t take long to show up on the Steam workshop, if it isn’t in the game already. I’ll never miss an opportunity to share this <a href="https://youtu.be/ca3eYxZedD4">outstanding Aliens ride</a>. Earlier in the year, Frontier <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frontier-announce-third-jurassic-world-game-and-two-other-management-sims">teased three “creative management sim” games</a>, one of which is a new entry in their Jurassic World series. Assuming Planet Coaster 2 is another, that leaves one more. Two Point don’t look to be reviving Dungeon Keeper any time soon, so may I humbly suggest Planet Dungeon? I say "humbly," I mean aggressively. Do it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>Over the past few months, we have seen the release of plenty of controllers from Chinese companies that attempt and succeed for the most part, at offering advanced features for very competitive prices. Some of these features, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/qrd-spark-n5-controller-an-affordable-solid-choice/">back paddles</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/manba-one-controller-advanced-features-for-an-affordable-price/">built-in LCD screens</a>, however, may not be enough to justify the higher price for someone just looking for a functional controller that can be used on multiple platforms. For this reason alone, the <a href="https://www.easysmx.com/products/easysmx%C2%AE-x05-multiplatform-gaming-controller-with-hall-effect-joysticks?variant=43849282158780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasySMX X05 controller</a> is a controller worthy of more than a look for those gaming primarily on PC or Nintendo Switch who are looking for more reliable Hall Effect sticks and have no use for the fancy features offered by other controllers.</p>
<p>At a glance, the EasySMX X05 doesn't look much different from any other controller using the Xbox controller asymmetrical sticks layout. Coming in three colors - Oyster White, Lime, and Black - and with controllable RGB lights placed around the sticks, the controller looks pleasing to the eye. With a net weight of 218g and a size of 13.70 × 6.70 × 17.40 cm, the EasySMX X05 feels light and comfortable enough even for those with big hands. The Hall Effect sticks and triggers prevent drifting issues and grant maximum accuracy, as do the regular face and shoulder buttons. The face buttons are also quite silent, as they have a minimal amount of clicking, which is great for late-night players who require their controllers to be as silent as possible. The controller also features 5-level adjustable vibration, providing the user with more customization options that are always welcome. The anti-slip texture on the back of the controller feels pleasant to the touch and does its job rather well. The stick caps and Teflon, which prevent wear on the stick surfaces included in the package, are rather welcome and could potentially extend the controller's life considerably, even with hard use.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EasySMX-X05-02.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Setting up the EasySMX X05 controller on PC is easy and straightforward. The controller was instantly recognized by Windows 11 while plugging it in using the included USB-C cable, and I had to do no other operation to use it with Steam games. The wireless setup is just as simple as plugging the included dongle in my PC was all I had to do to use the controller wirelessly. The ceramic chip antenna featured in the controller enhances its stability and minimizes its latency, so using it wirelessly is definitely a viable option, even for intense games that require quick reactions with minimal latency, such as fighting games. The Ternary Lithium 750 mah battery granted around 8 hours of gameplay, so in this sense, the EasySMX X05 delivers a similar experience to other wireless controllers.</p>
<p>Speaking about fighting games, I have found the EasySMX X05 controller to be a surprisingly decent one to play them, thanks to its d-pad, which is rather accurate and doesn't take too long to get used to. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a>, I tested the controller using charge characters, my main Blanka and M.Bison, since I've found this type of character to be the most problematic for the average d-pad, and I'm happy to say I had no issue whatsoever. I had no trouble with motion characters as well, so if you're looking for a controller with a decent d-pad for fighting games to use on PC without breaking the bank with more expensive fight pads, the EasySMX X05 could be a decent choice for you. For every other genre that may not require the same level of accuracy as a fighting game, the controller is just as good, feeling incredibly comfortable even if you are more used to the PlayStation or Nintendo Switch controller layout. Besides Street Fighter 6, I have tested the controller with other games I am currently playing, such as Final Fantasy VIII Remastered and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-berseria-review-tale/">Tales of Berseria</a>, and had no issues whatsoever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, much like most controllers produced by Chinese manufacturers, the EasySMX X05 is not compatible with PlayStation and Xbox consoles, which limits its appeal quite a bit. It is a real shame, as $29.99 is an excellent price for such a solid controller. If you play mostly on PC or Nintendo Switch, however, and don't need advanced features like back paddles, the EasySMX X05 is an excellent choice that is well worth its low price.</p>

<p>The EasySMX X05 is an excellent controller for those who primarily play on PC and Nintendo Switch and are looking for hall effect sticks without breaking the bank. While the controller lacks advanced features such as back paddles, it makes up for this with a solid d-pad, accurate face and shoulder buttons, hall effect triggers, and seamless pairing with all compatible devices. All this makes the EasySMX X05 a very compelling choice, especially considering its low price.</p>

            <p>
Current and former employees of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie have responded to the news of devastating layoffs at the studio - which has seen 220 employees lose their jobs - aiming harsh criticism at the handling of the cuts amid calls for Bungie CEO Pete Parsons to resign.
</p>
<p>
Parsons announced the studio would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">laying off approximately 17 percent of its workforce</a> earlier today, blaming "rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions." The news marks the second round of job cuts at the studio in less than a year, with approximately 100 employees having been laid off last October.
</p>
<p>
Following this latest round of job cuts, former and current Bungie employees took to social media to lambast the decision. Destiny 2's global community lead Dylan Gafner (AKA dmg04) called the move "inexcusable" in a <a href="https://x.com/A_dmg04/status/1818668997443023183">post on X</a>. "Industry leading talent being lost, yet again," he wrote. "Accountability falling upon the workers who have pushed the needle to deliver for our community time and time again."

<p>
"I'm safe but I'm fucking enraged," Bungie technical UX designer Ash Duong <a href="https://x.com/_Ashdown/status/1818679800426643820">wrote</a> in response to today's news. "This is hitting people who were told they were valued. That they were important. That they were critical to business success. But none of that mattered."
</p>
<p>
Others more directly aimed their ire at Parsons. Bungie's former global social media lead Griffin Bennett, who was laid off as part of last year's job cuts, <a href="https://x.com/GriffinWB/status/1818670768152363478">posted</a>, "Pete is a joke", while former Destiny 2 community manager Liana Ruppert <a href="https://x.com/DirtyEffinHippy/status/1818677930622685516">wrote</a>, "Step down, Pete."
</p>
<p>
Anger at Parsons was also felt in the community, with noted Destiny content creator MyNameIsByf (AKA Lore Daddy) <a href="https://x.com/MyNameIsByf/status/1818671790538809555">posting on X</a>, "Leadership needs to be changed. Their decisions have consistently led to disaster for everyone who has actually been making the games we play. They've been reckless with the studio, its employees, and its franchises. The problem is clear. Bad leadership. It needs to change."
</p>
<p>
Criticism of Parsons' leadership, and the devastating impact Bungie management's decisions have had on its employees, follows a series of troubling reports that have surfaced since last October. In December, Bungie employees told IGN the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-staff-reportedly-worried-about-bungies-future">mood at the studio</a> was "soul-crushing" as leadership implemented harsh cost-cutting measures, seemingly in a bid to cling onto independence following Sony's acquisition of Bungie in 2020. It was also claimed senior management met employees' sadness at last year's layoffs with "indifference or even outright flippancy or hostility", and that leadership rebuffed suggestions they took a salary cut to prevent future cuts, telling workers, Bungie is "not that type of company".
</p>
<p>
In November, it was reported last year's layoffs followed internal warnings that studio revenue was 45 percent below projections due to a "sharp drop" in the popularity of Destiny 2 - news that was followed by an open letter to players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-tells-destiny-2-players-we-know-we-have-lost-a-lot-of-your-trust">admitting</a> the studio had "lost a lot of your trust" and promising a "bigger, bolder, and brighter" future for the game.

We’re already surviving a global pandemic, so why would anyone consider playing a game with that name literally in the title? Because, my friends, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-op board game</a> version of fighting this big thing is all about coming together for the sake of the greater good.

The necessary teamwork involved helps strengthen friendships and see where communication and coordination might be improved. You see, it’s an all-or-nothing game.

It’s a great stand-alone game that gives you a bit of the enjoyment of Pandemic but without the doctor part… unless you want to play as the doctor character, because it wouldn’t be Pandemic if that weren’t still an option, right?</p></div><p id="star-wars-the-clone-wars-board-game"><h3 data-toc-title="Star Wars: The Clone Wars Board Game">Star Wars: The Clone Wars Board Game</h3></p><div catalogid="66057520-6e77-41d1-b66d-c953d586bcd4" id="179755"><div id="179755" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars: The Clone Wars Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $59.99 USD</li><li>1-5 Players </li><li>60 minutes</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Intergalactic game board, Star Wars character meeples, connected game cards</p><p>This is a stand-alone board game with Pandemic-style mechanics, and its version of intergalactic dramas to defeat and reign victoriously cooperatively.

The game features several of the franchise’s beloved (and hated) characters from the film, including Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Maul, and Count Dooku.

Two different editions take half the time in the Hot Zone series. <a href="https://zdcs.link/rdNen?object_uuid=f7c215f0-03e7-4176-816b-eed6ef0799f2&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Hot Zone North America</a> brings the battle against the virus stateside in half the time that it takes to complete its original counterpart.

Contagion, while also a shorter-to-play game, is completely different from any of the others out there. You see, in this version, players play as the disease. Yep, you read that right. You and other players are working as the virus to wipe out the human race.</p><h2>Pandemic Legacy Games</h2></div><p id="pandemic-legacy-season-1"><h3 data-toc-title="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1">Pandemic Legacy: Season 1</h3></p><div catalogid="8958ad46-461f-4918-88ca-84eb6ca4aba9" id="161120"><div id="161120" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 (Blue Version)</h3></p></div><p>On the opposite side of the time-to-play spectrum, if you are seeking a very repeatable, lengthy, and committed gaming experience, consider one of the legacy versions of the game. Legacy games feature campaigns done across multiple play sessions. They require a lot of time commitment and are something to jump into with mindfulness. Legacy games pack in a lot more content than standard games, and are generally more expensive.</p><p>Pandemic has multiple legacy versions available to play. The legacy titles are <a href="https://zdcs.link/knAPY?object_uuid=f7c215f0-03e7-4176-816b-eed6ef0799f2&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Season 1</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/V0gAN?object_uuid=f7c215f0-03e7-4176-816b-eed6ef0799f2&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Season 2</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ey53G?object_uuid=f7c215f0-03e7-4176-816b-eed6ef0799f2&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Season 0</a>. Legacy games take place over the course of one year. Your actions each month of the campaigns will continue to affect you throughout the course of the very lengthy gameplay. If your gaming crowd holds grudges, well, this one will be a rough year to maneuver! </p><h2>How to Play the Pandemic Board Game Online</h2><h3>Board Game Arena</h3><p>A number of iterations of Pandemic are available in digital form. The site <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board Game Arena</a> is a browser-based platform where folks can play the game. It's how several of my friends in my digital board game group and I have enjoyed this version.</p><p>To play the base game over there (available for 1-4 players who can play in real-time or turn-based games where players can take turns over several days), someone in your board game group will have to have a premium subscription. A premium subscription to Board Game Arena costs $3 a month, billed at $36.00 once a year. Playing multiple games, even outside of Pandemic, can be well worth the investment. My board game community currently has several ongoing turn-based premium version games going on with regularity.</p><h3>Tabletopia</h3><p>Another place you can play Pandemic digitally is via the website Tabletopia. Tabletopia offers three digital versions of the game: <a href="https://tabletopia.com/games/pandemic-north-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pandemic Hot Zone North America</a>, <a href="https://tabletopia.com/games/pandemic-hot-zone-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pandemic Hot Zone Europe</a>, and <a href="https://tabletopia.com/games/pandemic-legacy-season-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pandemic Legacy Season 0</a>. All of the versions on Tabletopia are available to play free online. The gameplay is a bit different than on Board Game Arena, as their version is a physics-simulated version that is essentially one step in between playing the game physically and playing it on BGA.</p><h3>Video Game Iterations</h3><p>Steam used to have a PC version of Pandemic <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/622440/Pandemic_The_Board_Game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on its store</a> but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pandemic-digital-game-removed">removed it in January 2022</a>. Other versions of the game on Xbox and the Nintendo Switch were <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=5462088137147638&amp;id=941343545888809&amp;paipv=0&amp;eav=AfbMHmsHPKPpQbPrTw_oHL9KHelFcyS59T1mj8hqg_mIOirMG3sLB7mux359M2znEKE&amp;_rdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">removed at the end of July 2022</a>. It was reported that the development team (Asmodee Digital) might work on a newer game version at some point, they haven't announced any solid plans yet. Asmodee did not respond to my request for an updated comment. </p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>I know that in our post-pandemic era, it probably sounds strange to play a game about fighting a pandemic – or, goodness, even being a virus on the opposite end – but my experiences with the Pandemic board game have all been enjoyable. It’s a fun game that shows where your tabletop group's communication skills work together… and where they could improve. My personal crew has both won and lost plenty of battles playing the game, but our sessions have always been full of laughs, regardless of the outcome. In any case, rally your gaming group and pick the Pandemic base game, spinoff, and/or expansion, and have fun.</p><p><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

They shared their various problems and concerns about Apple Arcade, the tech giant’s lack of vision, and how it poorly treats game studios.<br></p><h2 id="h84522"><a id=""></a>Apple makes devs wait for money and rarely replies</h2><p>One big problem is that some devs have to spend months chasing Apple down for their money. The way Apple Arcade works is devs get a large amount of money upfront to make the game, and then collect royalties from Apple as more players download and play their titles. In the early days of the service, devs say these payments arrived promptly, but now these royalty payments can take months to arrive. One dev claimed they had to wait for six months to get paid and it nearly killed their studio.</p><p>“We can go weeks without hearing from Apple at all and their general response time to emails is three weeks, if they reply at all,” said a developer speaking to MobileGamer.biz. “We’re supposed to be able to ask product, technical, and commercial questions, but often half the Apple team won’t turn up, and when they do they have no idea what’s going on and can’t answer our questions, either because they don’t have any knowledge on how to answer it, or are not able to share that info for confidentiality reasons.”<br></p><p><em>MobileGamer.biz </em>contacted Apple for comment but didn’t hear back.<br></p><p>Another problem is discoverability and promotion on Apple Arcade, with a developer telling the outlet that it feels like their game has been in a “morgue for the last two years.”<br></p><p>“It doesn’t matter what we put in the game, Apple won’t feature us, it’s like we don’t exist,” claimed the dev. “So as a developer you think, well, they’ve given us this money for exclusivity…I don’t want to give them the money back, but I do want people to play my game. It’s like we’re invisible.”<br></p><h2 id="h84523"><a id=""></a>Apple Arcade is a pain to work with and lacks vision</h2><p>This same dev described a horrible QA and update process, saying that a single update can take multiple back-and-forth meetings with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/apple-ipad-pro-hydraulic-press-crush-commercial-ad-1851463729&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/apple-ipad-pro-hydraulic-press-crush-commercial-ad-1851463729">Apple</a></span>.</p><p>“Submitting updates is so painful our developers started trying to avoid it,” they said.<br></p><p>One person who spoke with <em>MobileGamer.biz </em>claimed that one QA and localization process involved submitting 1,000 screenshots all at once to show the game was correctly working on all devices and in all languages. “My team were like: ‘There’s no fucking way we’re going to do that,’” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-again-late-payments-stonewalled-studios-terrible-tech-support-and-vision-pro-woes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-again-late-payments-stonewalled-studios-terrible-tech-support-and-vision-pro-woes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told the outlet</a></span>.</p><p>Another common complaint from devs was a lack of vision or planning on Apple’s part, with some suggesting the company was just working devs because it was a “necessary evil” as games are so popular on Apple’s devices.</p><p>“Given their status as a huge tech company it feels as if they treat developers as a necessary evil,” explained one developer. “And that we will do everything we can to please them for little in return, in the hope that they grace us with another project – and a chance for them to screw us over again.”<br></p><p>“It’s like an abusive relationship where the abused stays in the relationship hoping the other partner will change and become the person you know they could be.”<br></p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now it’s quickly become something else entirely. </p><p>Nvidia was trading below $15 a share at the start of 2023. Less than two years later it’s over $100. What changed? Microsoft and others are gobbling up GPUs to power their AI ambitions. It seemed like the fever might have broken amid a renewed wave of skepticism around what generative AI and machine learning will actually be useful for, but then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/technology/microsoft-earnings-profit.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/technology/microsoft-earnings-profit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft announced it’s going to continue pouring billions</a></span> into server farms for AI computing and Nvidia’s stock shot up more than most companies are worth in less than eight hours. Let’s remember some previous high scores:</p><p> $329 billion is more than Netflix, Coca-Cola, and Bank of America. It’s the value of eight Electronic Arts and 12 Take-Twos, whose subsidiary Rockstar Games publishes <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> next year. Nvidia isn’t worth more than ever—it peaked last month at over $3 trillion—but this single-day swing points to how completely untethered the company has become from its recent history or the current marketplace reality in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsofts-ai-dreams-make-for-an-expensive-reality-90a8c8e4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsofts-ai-dreams-make-for-an-expensive-reality-90a8c8e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which OpenAI is reportedly losing billions</a></span>. With Meta pivoting from VR to the AI chip arms race and others chasing desperately to catch up, Nvidia has quickly become the center of the tech and financial universe. </p><p>‘These violent delights have violent ends.” We might just be witnessing the first of many transformations before Nvidia’s final form. Maybe it will be the first true megacorp in a future cyberpunk dystopia, or maybe some of the plates stop spinning and start breaking and the company goes back to releasing hard-to-find <em>Gundam</em>-branded graphics cards for $4,000 gaming rigs that let you play <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> in 4K at 120fps. It’s never a good sign when the numbers get so insane that they stop meaning anything. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Saint-14's shotgun, Perfect Paradox, was a serious powerhouse in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> when it was released way back in the Curse of Osiris expansion, and then again during the Season of Dawn. It's been a while, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-echoes-act-2-brings-new-guns-and-a-big-focus-on-sniper-rifles/1100-6524811/" data-ref-id="1100-6524811">Echoes Act 2</a> has brought the weapon back in a big way with a new perk pool. It's still a powerhouse with the right roll and is great for melee-centric builds, particularly in PvE. Here's how you can get Perfect Paradox and the god rolls you should be chasing.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Perfect_Paradox">How To Get Perfect Paradox</a></li><li><a href="#Perfect_Paradox_God_Rolls">Perfect Paradox God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Perfect_Paradox_PvE_God_Roll">Perfect Paradox PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Perfect_Paradox_PvP_God_Roll">Perfect Paradox PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Perfect_Paradox">How To Get Perfect Paradox</h2><p dir="ltr">Like the other reprised Season of Dawn weapons in this episode, Perfect Paradox is now part of the overall loot pool, so you can get it from Episode activities. That means you might get Perfect Paradox as a reward from Breach Executable, Enigma Protocol, or the newly released Nessus Battlegrounds missions.</p><p dir="ltr">Perfect Paradox is a guaranteed reward for completing the story of Echoes Act 2, so no matter what, completing the episode's story quests will get you one. Once it's in your loot pool, you can visit Failsafe in the HELM to focus Echoes engrams into new Perfect Paradox rolls.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Perfect_Paradox_God_Rolls">Perfect Paradox God Rolls</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4343871-20240731142313_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343871" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4343871-20240731142313_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343871"></a><figcaption>Perfect Paradox</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4343871-20240731142313_1.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perfect_Paradox_PvE_God_Roll">Perfect Paradox PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Barrel Shroud  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Handling, +10 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload Speed, +5 Stability, +1 Magazine</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Dual Loader / Pugilist  <ul><li dir="ltr">Dual Loader: Reloads an additional shot at a time</li><li dir="ltr">Pugilist: Final blows with this weapon grant melee energy</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: One-Two Punch / Trench Barrel / Swashbuckler  <ul><li dir="ltr">One-Two Punch: Hitting a target with every shotgun pellet in a shot increases melee damage for a short duration.</li><li dir="ltr">Trench Barrel: After a successful melee hit, this weapon gains increased damage, range, and handling for a short duration, or until three shots are fired.</li><li dir="ltr">Swashbuckler: This weapon gains increased damage from melee kills and kills with this weapon.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Handling / Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Perfect Paradox is a gun you combine with melee strikes, and it is <em>great</em> in that role. It has a bunch of perks that play into the punch/shoot rotation, such that you kind of can't go wrong with whatever you pick--it really comes down to your specific build and how you want the gun to function.</p><p dir="ltr">In the first perk column, Dual Loader is a good all-around pick that helps you reload the gun faster, which works well paired with a Reload Speed Masterwork. Pugilist, however, might find better synergy, depending on how you use the gun, as it charges your melee when you get kills with Perfect Paradox.</p><p dir="ltr">In the second column, you'll be making use of that melee. One-Two Punch powers up your melee by a pretty huge margin if you hit the enemy with every pellet in the shotgun blast, making it great to use against bosses and major enemies in a melee-focused damage build. Trench Barrel, on the other hand, increases Perfect Paradox's damage when you punch an enemy, so go for this perk if you want the bulk of the damage to come from the shotgun rather than your punch. Finally, Swashbuckler enhances the shotgun's damage when you get melee kills <em>or</em> kills with Perfect Paradox; you might want this option if you're running a melee build that's better for clearing minor enemies.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perfect_Paradox_PvP_God_Roll">Perfect Paradox PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Smallbore / Corkscrew Rifling  <ul><li dir="ltr">Smallbore: +7 Range, +7 Stability</li><li dir="ltr">Corkscrew Rifling: +5 Range, +5 Stability, +5 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Accurized Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Slideshot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Sliding partially reloads this weapon's magazine and temporarily boosts range and stability.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Opening Shot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improved accuracy and range on the opening shot of an attack.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Perfect Paradox isn't nearly as great in PvP as it is as a PvE weapon, but it's still a strong shotgun that can be very useful. It carries a classic shotgun perk combo in Slideshot and Opening Shot, which can allow you to boost its range and accuracy pretty significantly. As a gun you use for close-range encounters as you're rounding a corner, Perfect Paradox is a strong contender, allowing for those one-shot kills on unsuspecting enemies or for you to follow up with a quick punch to finish someone off.</p><p dir="ltr">There are better PvP shotguns out there, but Perfect Paradox isn't necessarily a bad option. Just make sure to prioritize its Range stat if you want to take it into the Crucible, as that'll help you land more kills in tight situations.</p>

Discovered by the player Joo, the glitch can be initiated in a variety of ways, including the use of the DLC’s perfume weapons or hitting a Site of Grace where players can rest.</p><p>If the player manages to interrupt the mounting animation at the exact right frame, they can achieve a “limited no-gravity” effect that simply allows the player to walk on air. The initial animation isn’t so much canceled as it is “paused” while the player commits to another action. That last bit is especially important because in order to maintain the Legasus effect, you can never idle.<br></p><p>There are actually a million caveats to making Legasus work, which you can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hackmd.io/@ViRazY/er-legasus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hackmd.io/@ViRazY/er-legasus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read up on here</a></span>, but the gist of it is that movement isn’t exactly free once you manage to activate the glitch. You can only move forward or step backward and you must always be doing something like holding guard with a shield out. If you idle, you’ll be restored back to the point at which you activated the glitch, and if you accidentally break the effect somewhere else, you naturally risk plummeting to your death. Additionally, in order to turn, you have to use a bow, aim in the direction you’d like to go, and then dodge roll that way.<br></p><p>Once you get it working though, you can get pretty far, and players have been using it to get into areas like <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s Abyssal Woods (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-abyssal-woods-torrent-1851560149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-abyssal-woods-torrent-1851560149">which apparently sucks ass</a></span>) while skipping segments of it that might be a pain in the ass. That’s because you can also “unload” Torrent, which commits to the rest of the summoning animation and breaks the glitch exactly where you are, allowing players to tactically position themselves to die near checkpoints and respawn there. </p><p>The tournament that prompted this find is being held by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-speedrun-world-record-distortion2-youtube-30-1848655345&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-speedrun-world-record-distortion2-youtube-30-1848655345">Distortion2</a></span>, one of the most prominent speedrunners of FromSoftware’s catalog, and a guy who’s beaten <em>Elden Ring </em>with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-speedrunner-bosses-ground-slam-malenia-margi-1848783561&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-speedrunner-bosses-ground-slam-malenia-margi-1848783561">nothing more than his character’s ass</a></span>.

                <p>The Tesla Cybertruck has been the subject of jokes and memes since the very moment it was announced, and they didn't slow down at all once the thing came out earlier this year--its launch was greeted with <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91109879/a-timeline-of-tesla-cybertruck-problems-from-rust-to-hail-damage-to-pedal-recalls" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">all sorts of severe issues, which have sparked multiple recalls</a>. Now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/teslas-cybertruck-is-your-fortnite-summer-road-trip-reward/1100-6525207/" data-ref-id="1100-6525207">the Fortnite version of the Cybertruck</a> is finally here, too, and it's introduced at least one game-breaking bug to battle royale.</p><p>Right now, the Cybertruck SUV car body is available for free through a series of quests in Fortnite, and July 31 was the first day the vehicle skin could be earned. But it took roughly five minutes of use before folks discovered a fatal flaw with their Cybertrucks: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1egqhzh/cybertruck_breaks_nitro_fists_ships_in_bottles/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">It rendered their Nitro Fists unusable for the remainder of the match</a>. The bug also affects the Ship in a Bottle item, though at least that isn't super important for this season's meta. A lack of Nitro Fists, on the other hand, could get you killed, since they're the season's primary traversal item and are also very effective in a close-range fight.</p><p>What happens is that transforming the standard SUV into a Cybertruck during a round of battle royale will cause your character to twitch oddly every time you try to fire off either your Nitro Fists or the Ship in a Bottle, and the effect persists for the rest of the match. If you see a Cybertruck that somebody else made, it's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1egvuel/transforming_suv_into_cybertruck_disables_the_use/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">apparently safe to use</a>. But if you're using the Cybertruck as your SUV skin, this is simply going to be a thing you have to deal with.</p><p>It's possible this bug is related to the Cybertruck's main unique property: Its backseats are actually in the bed of the truck, allowing for full aim and body rotation from those positions, as well as exposure from fire from enemies.
