			<p>The list of games and applications that feature RTX technologies continues to grow, with games having access to NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and advanced ray-tracing integration. This makes those who have GeForce RTX cards have a prettier and more immersive experience. With more than <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">600 games and applications</a> utilizing these technologies, there is no sign of the list slowing down any time soon. This week, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-2-void-crew-towers-of-aghasba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three more games</a> joined the ever-expanding list, with more to come in the future. This week sees Void Crew, War Thunder and Towers of Aghasba join the list of games featuring<a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-extensive-preview-of-nvidia-rtx-effects-and-performance/"> RTX technologies</a>. Below is a breakdown of how you can expect to utilize them in the game.</p>
<p>Void Crew has just been released from early access and is a fun co-op roguelite title from Hutlihut Games and Focus Entertainment where you get to play as a METEM-chosen clone warrior, where you and your friends have to embark on a Pilgrimage. As you explore and get deeper into the unknown, you come across the HOLLOW, an alien force like no other. It's up to you and your friends to face off against them to try and bring peace back to the people. Void Crew will be utilizing DLSS Super Resolution, allowing GeForce RTX gamers to accelerate the performance of the game with the advanced technology.</p>
<p>Next up on the list is War Thunder. This game is far from new, as it was first released in 2013. However, since its release, it's received a new coat of paint and looks better than ever. There are hundreds of tanks, ground military vehicles, planes, and warships that will look even better by using DLSS Super Resolution and NVIDIA Reflex. War Thunder just received a new update, which also added support for hardware-accelerated ray-tracing effects to make the game even more immersive and stunning. These options include ray-traced ambient occlusion, ray-traced water, and ray-traced shadows, for example.</p>
<p>Finally, Towers of Aghasba is the latest game to join the roster of games with RTX technology integration. This game is hot off the press and is currently in Early Access. In this game, you get to explore an open-world with fascinating flora and fauna. You will meet some interesting characters along the way, and you can help breathe life into the world, as well as create your very own island civilization. If you are playing this title, you will be able to use DLSS Super Resolution for a faster and smoother experience in Towers of Aghasba.</p>

			<p>New Alan Wake 2 PlayStation 5 Pro improvements are being researched by developer Remedy Entertainment, but it will take the team weeks to implement them.</p>
<p>Following the release of today's new <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.2.5 update</a>, which introduces some improvements to the base game and Night Springs and The Lake House expansions alongside some fixes, the Finnish studio commented on the lack of PlayStation 5 Pro-specific improvements, saying that player feedback is being heard, and more research is being done on how to improve performance. As the game's PlayStation 5 Pro support was the work of many months, it will take the team more than just a few weeks to implement changes and improvements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">🛠️ A new update for Alan Wake 2 has been released. It includes (fingers crossed) fixes for the missing Pat Maine radio shows, and more fixes, improvements and additions.</p>
<p>As always, update notes are here: <a href="https://t.co/zqW9QhguFF">https://t.co/zqW9QhguFF</a></p>
<p>Please allow additional time for the update to… <a href="https://t.co/DO5Fyl2dnI">pic.twitter.com/DO5Fyl2dnI</a></p>
<p>— Alan Wake 2 (@alanwake) <a href="https://twitter.com/alanwake/status/1861394569448894731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While the Alan Wake 2 PlayStation 5 Pro patch has the merit of finally bringing ray tracing to a console version of the game, the improvements are far from the best we have seen among all Pro-enhanced titles. PSSR, in particular, struggles to deliver significantly better image quality than on the base console, showing how the upscaler currently isn't a good fit for 4K resolution with a low internal resolution like that of the game. Hopefully, Remedy Entertainment will be able to work some of its magic in the future and enhance this version of the game to deliver better image quality and performance.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-omens-of-destruction-dlc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-warhammer-3-omens-of-destruction-dlc-announced-for-next-month.1045617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-omens-of-destruction-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Creative Assembly have announced&nbsp;<em>Omens of Destruction</em>, the next major DLC pack for grand strategy game&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3</em>, and it's due to arrive alongside a major free update for the game next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/39" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official Creative Assembly website,&nbsp;<em>Omens of Destruction&nbsp;</em>launches on December 12th, and it brings three new Legendary Lords with it, all of whom have their own combat perks and campaign bonuses to look forward to.</p>

<p>Your first Legendary Lord is Skulltaker, a champion of Khorne who seeks - you guessed it - skulls for the skull throne. He brings new units with him as well, including legendary heroes Skarr Bloodwrath and Skyla Anfingrimm, as well as "a host of acolytes".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-omens-of-destruction-dlc-skulltaker.jpg?itok=mzen7Cbv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-omens-of-destruction-dlc-skulltaker.jpg?itok=FF5mqwA1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer 3</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Omens of Destruction&nbsp;</em>DLC includes Legendary Lords like Khorne's Skulltaker.</figcaption></figure><p>The second Legendary Lord is Gorbad Ironclaw, "one of the most infamous of all Orc Warbosses" who's probably about the closest thing to a master strategist the Orc faction can boast. Like Skulltaker, he brings his own additional units and heroes.</p>

<p>Finally, the Ogre Kingdoms gain Golgfag Maneater, a mercenary with a fearsome reputation who'll fight for anyone if the price is right. He's an anti-infantry "blender" who can tear through soldiers using his "barbaric" weaponry.</p>

<p>These three will arrive alongside Update 6.0, which brings a free Legendary Lord in the form of Khorne's Arbaal the Undefeated, as well as faction updates for Khorne, Orcs &amp; Goblins, and the Ogre Kingdoms.</p>

<p>As with previous&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3&nbsp;</em>DLC packs like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-reveals-shadows-of-change-dlc-with-3-legendary-lords-more" rel="nofollow">Shadows of Change</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-thrones-of-decay-lords" rel="nofollow"><em>Thrones of Decay</em></a>, it'll be possible to buy all three Legendary Lords separately if you'd rather pick up just one or two of them.</p>




<p><em>Total War: Warhammer 3&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Its&nbsp;<em>Omens of Destruction&nbsp;</em>DLC, as well as its major 6.0 update, both launch on December 12th.

<ul>
<li>Ironspoon Rumpgouger</li>
<li>Football Groinsmasha</li>
<li>Krumpstopher Waagghken</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sigmarxism/comments/1g5f32j/korl_morx/">Korl Morx</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An orc that even these despicable haters are forced to admit is real, however, is Gorbad Ironclaw. If you look very carefully, you may spot him below, in the new trailer for Omens Of Destruction - the next expansion for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>. We've got a release date, too: 12th December.</p>

<p>The folks at Creative Assembly sent me a document, and in that document is some information about what’s to come in both Omens Of Destruction and the accompanying free update. If I were so inclined, I could write this information out in a natural, conversational tone, interspersed with my own commentary. As I’m sure many of you are aware, however, that commentary would mostly just be me going “wow! Neat!”. Instead, here’s the free-range information, uncorked and unbesmirched by the flaky preservatives of opinion. </p>
<blockquote><strong>SKULLTAKER, THE HERO SLAYER (KHORNE) </strong>
<p>Cloak of Skulls: Skulltaker must seek-out and defeat powerful enemy lords across the heroic
pantheon of the Warhammer World. With each skull added to his cloak, powerful new
abilities and traits can be earned and upgraded.
</p>
<p>A force of daemonic destruction, Skulltaker excels at hunting down and duelling enemy lords
before cleaving through ranks of troops with his two-handed Slayer Sword. His Cloak of
Skulls passive ability grants increasing spell resistance and ward saves the more he kills.</p>
<p>New units from the Blood God’s domain enter the fray, including two legendary heroes;
Skarr Bloodwrath and Skyla Anfingrimm, followed by a host of acolytes including the
Bloodspeaker, Slaughterbrute, Bloodbeasts, Wrathmongers, Skullreapers, and Khorngors.</p>
<strong>GORBAD IRONCLAW, THE BRUTAL UNIFIER (ORCS) </strong>
<p>Da’ Plan: A tenacious tactician (for an Orc), Gorbad must experiment with unique battle
strategies for his armies to employ, granting a deadly of exotic battle bonuses and army
compositions that can overcome any challengers.</p>
<p>Riding into battle atop his fierce Warboar, Gnarla, Gorbad penetrates the enemy lines with
devastating charges before engaging in close combat with his mighty axe, Morglor ‘the
Mangler’. His ‘Da Great Leader’ ability which activates when troops are in his vicinity,
granting increased melee attack and defence.</p>
<p>New units joining Gorbad’s Waaagh! include the legendary hero Snagla Grobspit
accompanied by warriors such as the Savage Orc Great Shaman, Night Goblin Big Boss, Black
Orc (Axe &amp; Shield), Mangler Squiqs, Colossal Squig, Arachnarok (Flinger), and Bolt Throwa.</p>
<strong>GOLGFAG MANEATER  (OGRE KINGDOMS) </strong>
<p>Mercenary Contracts: Ever keen to lace his pocket with gold, Golgfag helps clients
throughout the Warhammer World settle their warring disputes by taking on all wars they’re
involved in and conducting hostile actions against their enemies for handsome reward.</p>
<p>An anti-infantry blender, Golgfag tears through hordes of infantry with the aid of barbaric
weaponry. His globe-trotting nature also gives him access to a variety of exotic abilities such
as Dead Eye which allows him to take a powerful shot from his pistol causing huge damage</p>
<p>New units joining Golgfag’s mercenary brigade include the Legendary Hero Bragg the
Gutsman as well as the Ogre Paymaster, Bruiser, Golgfag’s Maneaters, Pigback Riders, Blood
Vultures, Yhetees and Thundertusks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The good word of Korl Morx has failed to reach Creative Assembly, however, so you will have to pay for all this stuff (please don’t tell me “that’s not how communism works” I just wanted to write ‘Korl Morx’ again). If you don’t feel like spending any money, though, there are some free goodies, too. These’ll include the series 100th Legendary Lord, Khorne champion Arbaal The Undefeated, who’s defeat trait I’d look forward to reading if there wasn’t already twelve other characters with some version of ‘the undefeated’ in their names. You’ll also get faction updates for Ogres, Khorne, and - my boys and yours - the greenskins.</p>
<p>Wow! Looks neat! I especially liked the part where I get some more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> to play with. Easily my favourite part!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>The weekends are full of time, which means it's also easy for them to slip away. </em></p><p><em>We live in an era where it's never been easier to pick up a new hobby, or follow a new sport, and, once again, watch time slip. What keeps our attention, and for how long? How do you fill in knowledge, analysis, and history gaps? If you pay for a subscription to a publication, isn't that the same as reading it? No? Hmm.</em></p><p><em>This week, with the NFL season in full swing, Rob and Patrick mull how they spend their weekends watching the world's greatest athletes race cars and throw footballs and mull what it means to be "effective" during a period where you should be allowed to be lazy.</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@tjdragotta?ref=remapradio.com"><span>TJ Dragotta</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Last year, I remember Austin proposed a name for this time of year: The Feast. It’s the playoffs in MLB and WNBA, the football season is through its creaky opening weeks and most teams are still approaching their peak condition and preparation, some soccer leagues are nearing the crescendo and others are just getting started, the auto racing seasons are in their final stages, and somewhere in all this the NBA and NHL are going to start up again. If you are into sports of almost any type, early autumn is one of the greatest times of year as well as one of the most challenging to keep up with.</p><p>There are times I feel almost burdened by how much my love of sports is being indulged this time of year. A typical Sunday might start with an F1 race in the morning and proceed smoothly into a day of NFL games until deep into the evening. That might be more than 12 hours of sports! Thing is, I don’t <em>really </em>have 12 hours in a weekend where I can just sit on the couch petting dogs and watching sports. There’s too many other things that I also value: giving those dogs a walk, tackling projects around the house, playing games, catching up on reading…I almost wish I could run the day twice, enjoying one version of Sunday where I just soak up the games and races I want to see, and then after a nice rest tackling the Sunday where I spend most of the day enjoying other hobbies and getting out of the house with my family.</p><p>There have been times I’ve split the difference a bit by reading and playing games while keeping sports on in the background. Turn-based games are pretty fantastic for slower parts of an event. Still, I struggle with the sense that when I’m “multitasking” between watching the Bears or an F1 race and playing a video games, I’m not really following anything particularly well. There are few things I find more frustrating than looking up and realizing I have no idea why the scoreboard has changed, or pulling my gaze back to an article to see a completely unfamiliar passage in front of me.</p><p>You keep a pretty busy schedule between work and family obligations, but you also follow Chicago sports and the NFL more broadly pretty well. I am curious, how do you tackle this kind of year? Do you just force yourself to make some firm choices about what you’re engaging with, or do you find you’re able to juggle your attention from sports to other pursuits without chafing?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@julesrodr?ref=remapradio.com"><span>julia rodriguez</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>I’ve gotten pretty lucky. You can’t pick your family and you can’t pick your neighbors. It wasn’t until COVID-19 that my children became friendly with the neighborhood kids during an era when their options were hanging out with us or hanging outside. Those friendships lasted beyond the most intense parts of social isolation <em>and</em> we became friends with the parents in the process. The strongest of those relationships is with one couple in particular, and guess what? They love drinking beer and watching football all day. Our Sunday ritual is getting together with them, letting the kids run wild, and enjoying our afternoon. It’s very easy to imagine a different version of my life where I’m far more hands-on during Sundays, or required to be out of the house to keep them entertained, and I’m that dad sneaking in a few minutes here or there on their YouTube TV app to figure out why the Bills game has flipped scores.</p><p>We used to time my eight-year-old’s naps with the start of Bears game! Oh, honey, are you rubbing your eyes? Could you have taken a nap at 11:00 am? I’m sorry, but we’re going to find a way to keep you up for another hour, so that we can ensure your nap at least takes us through halftime. But my kids broadly don’t take naps anymore, so instead, the world has blessed me with Sundays where my primary obligation is asking my neighbor to change the Sunday Ticket lineup on his second garage TV and, if I’m lucky, to pick up my four-year-old and run her around the yard when the Bears actually manage to score a touchdown.</p>

<p>2K has announced a ‘Complete Sunset’ of their launcher, removing it from every Epic Games Store and Steam game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sunset of the 2K Launcher was <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JB9YXRZ3YFJBHS1QPZ5DP40N" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> on November 18; however, a follow-up update on November 25 led to its complete removal from Steam. The “2K Launcher Beta” created for Sid Meier’s Civilization V was also removed. Players will see that their 2KLauncher folder has been turned into a text file called 2kLauncherRemoved.tx, which can now be deleted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players might still find the 2K Launcher pop-up even after this update, and there are some troubleshooting procedures that they can follow to remove it entirely. The first method is closing and reopening Steam completely. Next, rebooting the PC is always a good idea. Also, for Epic Games, you will need the game to be updated to its most recent version. Check out this <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/32209414429203--2K-Launcher-Removing-2K-Launcher-Files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">guide</a> to learn how to remove all the additional launcher files.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After 2K Launcher’s shutdown, games like Bioshock Remastered, Bioshock 2 Remastered, Bioshock Infinite, The Quarry, and Marvel’s Midnight Suns will launch directly when you click Play. Other games like Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition, Civilisation V, and more will use Steam and Epic’s launchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a new PGA Tour 2K game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been confirmed for 2025</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-reveals-upcoming-promo-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokemon TCG Pocket’s latest leak</a> has revealed upcoming promo cards.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-eshop-online-closing-china-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it will shut down the eShop and all Switch network services in China in 2026. No reason has been given for the shutdown.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.nintendoswitch.com.cn/topics/57ea6913-1a17-4afa-b325-a1a1a8596e15" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a notice</a> posted on the official Chinese Nintendo website (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-eshop-closing-2026-in-china" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), the eShop will cease selling games and software on March 31st, 2026, after which point you won't be able to buy any games from the eShop, nor will you be able to download demos, trials, or free games.</p>

<p>Following that, on May 15th of the same year, you won't be able to download games from the eShop, and you won't be able to redeem codes either. That means you won't be able to buy any DLC, and it also seems to mean you won't be able to download games you already own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-odyssey-eshop-closure-china.jpg?itok=clxwOBnG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-odyssey-eshop-closure-china.jpg?itok=0WvP487i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch eShop, as well as all of the console's network services, will be coming to an end in 2026 in China.</figcaption></figure><p>On the same day, all Switch-related network services will also be shut down, so you'll no longer be able to play Switch games online with your friends at that point.</p>

<p>You can see a full list of all of the games that will be affected by the network shutdown <a href="https://www.nintendoswitch.com.cn/support/software_affected.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. It's in Chinese, and we're using machine translation for it, but it seems relatively accurate to me (although I have little to no knowledge of Chinese as a language).</p>

<p>In order to compensate Chinese Switch gamers for this decision, Nintendo will give away up to four Nintendo games for users via their WeChat account. You'll need to have activated your Switch console, and you'll need to have stuck to the Terms of Use as well.</p>

<p>The list has a couple of...unusual entries using machine translation, but games like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Yoshi's Crafted World&nbsp;</em>can be redeemed, as well as&nbsp;<em>Kirby Star Allies</em>,&nbsp;<em>New Pokemon Snap</em>, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-eshop-closure-china-new-pokemon-snap.jpg?itok=o1tMZUrf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-eshop-closure-china-new-pokemon-snap.jpg?itok=I6sOdYmB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're a Switch user in China, you could be entitled to a free copy of&nbsp;<em>New Pokemon Snap</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The giveaway starts on November 27th and runs until March 31st, 2026, and you'll need to use WeChat's game redemption applet in order to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Do note that you'll have to download whatever games you decide to grab before May 15th, or else your free games will be gone for good. It's also worth noting that as far as we know, this doesn't affect the eShop anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>News of the eShop's closure in China comes amid fevered speculation about the Switch 2, which Nintendo is due to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">reveal sometime before April</a>. It's not clear what this might mean for the Switch 2 in China.</p>

From there, you can adjust your avatar’s&nbsp;<strong>Animation</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Background</strong>.

That’s not to say you should be tempted to fork over real money just yet! There are plenty of cards to fill out your custom build and in-progress dream decks alike.</p><p>In addition to useful Item and Supporter cards, we’ll also be including Pokémon with unique abilities and decent attacks that call for Colorless Energy. That last part is especially important, since Colorless Energy requirements can be fulfilled by any Energy you attach to it. These cards have you covered for any type of deck you’re making!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="61eda78304533bd1ec3b6db7e9126d54" data-recommend-id="image://61eda78304533bd1ec3b6db7e9126d54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Persian card shows a large muscular cat lounging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Persian card shows a large muscular cat lounging." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="61eda78304533bd1ec3b6db7e9126d54" data-recommend-id="image://61eda78304533bd1ec3b6db7e9126d54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Persian card shows a large muscular cat lounging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Starting this list is Persian, which might initially sound like a tough sell. Not only does its Shadow Claw attack require two Colorless energy and only deal 40 damage, but it’s a stage-one Pokémon and will require you to evolve a Meowth just to bring it out. What makes it worth it, however, is the Shadow Claw’s ability. You’ll flip a coin with every attack, with heads forcing your opponent to discard a random card from their hand. This effect can greatly disrupt any player’s plans when you remember every deck is only 20 cards. </p><p>Additionally, Meowth isn’t a bad card itself. Its Payday attack might deal a measly 10 damage, but its effect lets you draw a card with each attack. Both this ability and the one from its evolution can be pretty handy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a10e884acca1e2a89db5a230f3cb4f24" data-recommend-id="image://a10e884acca1e2a89db5a230f3cb4f24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow Heliolisk card shows the lightning-type lizard in action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The yellow Heliolisk card shows the lightning-type lizard in action." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a10e884acca1e2a89db5a230f3cb4f24" data-recommend-id="image://a10e884acca1e2a89db5a230f3cb4f24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow Heliolisk card shows the lightning-type lizard in action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Next is the only Pokémon on the list that isn’t a Colorless one. Heliolisk is a stage-one lightning-type Pokémon that evolves from Helioptile. Its Quick Attack, which uses two Colorless energy, makes this an attractive inclusion for a deck. It’s a pretty unique attribute. So many evolved Pokémon require at least some energy that matches their type. The attack also does a base 50 damage, with a coin flip potentially adding an extra 40 if you land a heads.</p><p>Heliolisk’s biggest problem is its pre-evolution Helioptile. It’s only a basic Pokémon and its Tail Whap attack requires one Lightning energy. If your deck doesn’t have enough Lightning types to necessitate that energy, Helioptile will essentially be worthless for you before it can evolve it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a3f896205d3be65c6fc14d85521a1b4f" data-recommend-id="image://a3f896205d3be65c6fc14d85521a1b4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Kangaskhan card shows the Pokémon carrying their young and getting ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Kangaskhan card shows the Pokémon carrying their young and getting ready." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a3f896205d3be65c6fc14d85521a1b4f" data-recommend-id="image://a3f896205d3be65c6fc14d85521a1b4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Kangaskhan card shows the Pokémon carrying their young and getting ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sometimes your deck needs a tanky Pokémon that can stall while you build up your main strategy. Kangaskhan is one of the best at this approach as a basic Pokémon with 100 HP. Just as impressive is its Dizzy Punch attack. For just one Colorless energy, you can flip two coins and inflict 30 damage for each one that lands heads.</p><p><br>Luck can be a tricky thing with this card, however. Getting two tails and dealing no damage at all isn’t a great situation. However, the chances of dealing 30 or 60 damage are worth taking in my opinion. This is especially true when you consider the high HP and low energy cost. If you haven’t received this card yet, which is likely given its low offering rate, you might want to try crafting it through the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/get-the-pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-you-want-with-the-pack-1851702255&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/get-the-pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-you-want-with-the-pack-1851702255">Pack Point Exchange</a></span> system.  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d2646d852c050ef56f650b13a295d821" data-recommend-id="image://d2646d852c050ef56f650b13a295d821" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Poké Ball opens slightly on the identically titled card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Poké Ball opens slightly on the identically titled card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d2646d852c050ef56f650b13a295d821" data-recommend-id="image://d2646d852c050ef56f650b13a295d821" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Poké Ball opens slightly on the identically titled card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There are quite a few Item cards that feel necessary for specific kinds of decks or situations, but some will work just about anywhere. A fantastic example of this is Poké Ball, which adds one random Basic Pokémon from your deck to your hand.</p><p>This card doesn’t have any downsides. The only bad use for it is if it’s played late enough into a game when you no longer have anything to properly target. Things might change as new cards are added in future expansions, but it’s currently the kind of card that belongs in every deck.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fed50b39bf1b760c972530d9d067b25d" data-recommend-id="image://fed50b39bf1b760c972530d9d067b25d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves while carrying a book on the Professor’s Research card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves while carrying a book on the Professor’s Research card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fed50b39bf1b760c972530d9d067b25d" data-recommend-id="image://fed50b39bf1b760c972530d9d067b25d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves while carrying a book on the Professor’s Research card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Just like Item cards, Supporter Cards often have very specific use-case scenarios but some are useful to anyone..

Drawing an extra card or two is always appreciated in these quick-paced matches. I’m not sure if there’s a deck that wouldn’t benefit from having one or two copies of this.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="abfc38dd8d11a4639447c2666295070c" data-recommend-id="image://abfc38dd8d11a4639447c2666295070c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the entire evolutionary line for the bird Pokémon sitting on a tree branch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the entire evolutionary line for the bird Pokémon sitting on a tree branch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="abfc38dd8d11a4639447c2666295070c" data-recommend-id="image://abfc38dd8d11a4639447c2666295070c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the entire evolutionary line for the bird Pokémon sitting on a tree branch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Next up is the sole stage-two Pokémon on this list, but we promise it’s worth building up for. Pidgeot has the Drive Off ability, which allows you to switch out the opponent’s Active Pokémon once per your turn. The opponent will be able to choose which of their benched Pokémon will take the new active spot. It’s basically like using a Sabrina card for each turn.</p><p>Drive Off is a separate ability that doesn’t rely on its attack. Speaking of, a 70-damage dealing Wing Attack isn’t too bad for two Colorless energy either. You can comfortably use Drive Off whether Pidgeot is in the Active spot or on the Bench. Still, how useful this is depends on personal preference. You’ll need to include both of its pre-evolutions just for the chance to benefit from the ability. No matter how beneficial and disruptive the ability is, that’s a lot to accommodate for.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c0426164f663a227bf4bb654d0b7c9ac" data-recommend-id="image://c0426164f663a227bf4bb654d0b7c9ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The duck-like Pokémon Farfetch’d carries a leek in its mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The duck-like Pokémon Farfetch’d carries a leek in its mouth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0426164f663a227bf4bb654d0b7c9ac" data-recommend-id="image://c0426164f663a227bf4bb654d0b7c9ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The duck-like Pokémon Farfetch’d carries a leek in its mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We could not have a list like this without including one of the most helpful cards. Farfetch’d is a simple, basic Pokémon that can hit hard thanks to its 40-damage Leek Slap. What separates this attack from everything else added so far is that it only requires one Colorless energy.</p><p>That isn’t to say the card is completely OP. Farfetch’d is less likely to survive a turn once some ex or stage-two Pokémon are out on the field. They’re typically more effective during the initial few turns. That being said, I have come across situations where bringing in this vegetable carrying bird to dish out a quick 40 damage was helpful for closing matches.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6b93756987474a874512e44b68e58eb5" data-recommend-id="image://6b93756987474a874512e44b68e58eb5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Potion card shows a potion bottle in mid-spray." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Potion card shows a potion bottle in mid-spray." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6b93756987474a874512e44b68e58eb5" data-recommend-id="image://6b93756987474a874512e44b68e58eb5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Potion card shows a potion bottle in mid-spray." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Poké Ball isn’t the only Item card to keep in all of your decks. Potion has the simple and effective ability to heal 20 damage for one of your Pokémon. There aren’t as many healing options currently, so this is a pretty essential card to have.</p><p>Obviously, the main setback is that 20 damage isn’t that much. It can feel more effective when weaker Pokémon are attacking each other, instead of stronger ones that can easily deal closer to 100 damage. An easy way to get help with that is to include more than one copy in your deck. Again, healing isn’t that common of an effect during this first expansion. Potion is an essential card that’s even better when you have two of them.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="636217937f4a13f7d580c69f48f521ac" data-recommend-id="image://636217937f4a13f7d580c69f48f521ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A full art Sabrina card, showing the psychic trainer posing with arms stretched out and fingers pointing up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A full art Sabrina card, showing the psychic trainer posing with arms stretched out and fingers pointing up." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="636217937f4a13f7d580c69f48f521ac" data-recommend-id="image://636217937f4a13f7d580c69f48f521ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A full art Sabrina card, showing the psychic trainer posing with arms stretched out and fingers pointing up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Many consider this to be the best card in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> so far, and a big part of that is how useful it can be for any deck. Sabrina is a Supporter card that switches your opponent’s Active Pokémon with one that they choose from their bench. It’s identical to the Pidgeot ability, except you don’t need to bring out two other cards to play it.</p><p>This card can be used almost any time during a match. The obvious choice is to switch out a tough Pokémon in hopes of one that’s easier to knock out. In the early turns, where there sometimes isn’t much on the field, you can also use it to take out a basic Pokémon that you know your opponent will want to evolve. Even when your opponent has a full bench of options, causing a switch like this is bound to be a hindrance to their game plan.</p><hr><p>Adding these cards to an incomplete deck is sure to round it out and give it some better legs to stand on. There is a better chance to get most of these before finding the right ex card for your meta build.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-marvel-rivals-free-to-play-cost-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Marvel Rivals’ ambition is matched by its star-studded roster, list of iconic maps, and excitable community eager to play. However, one big question circling Marvel Rivals is if the shooter is free to play, or if you need to pay a fixed price to get your heroic groove on.</p>



<p>Fans of the MCU—and Marvel in general—can rest easy as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals release date</a> is nearly upon us. An ensemble shooter with a list of playable characters so almighty it’s enough to make your eyes water—I’m not crying, you are. Marvel Rivals takes the hero shooter literally by supplying a roster chock-full of some of the most notable superheroes and villains in media.</p>



<p>Several successful alpha and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-beta-surprises-players-with-thor-and-another-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beta tests</a> have set the scene, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-roadmap-reveals-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> ahead is promising, and it’s nearly time to say “Action!” and let the chaos unfold. No doubt you want to play Marvel Rivals, so let’s see if greatness requires a gratuity.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-marvel-rivals">How Much is Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There is a God, and I’m not talking about Thor. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is a free-to-play</strong>, third-person shooter, meaning, <strong>you don’t have to pay a penny to play NetEase Games’ shooter</strong>—a free download and a stable internet connection are the only requirements.</p>



<p>The live-service model continues to be a trendsetter for many shooters and fellow online multiplayer platforms. It’s no surprise to see Marvel Rivals adopt the F2P formula with contemporaries such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suicide Squad</a> showing how a <em>paid</em>, live-service title can fail.</p>



<p>So, if you want to enjoy all Marvel Rivals has to offer without spending a single penny, you go right ahead. Of course, Rivals has an abundance of microtransactions and Season Passes filled with content for players who want to more out of the shooter, but it’s entirely optional.</p>



<p>Thankfully, every current character is available at launch, and according to the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/news/20240821/40185_1174687.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official site</a>, “<strong>All heroes will be unlocked and free-to-play at launch and beyond</strong>, ensuring every player can fully immerse themselves in the experience of becoming their favorite Super Hero without any barriers!”</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-marvel-rivals-for-free">How to Play Marvel Rivals for Free</h2>



<p>Once Marvel Rivals releases, it’s likely all you have to do is go to your platform’s storefront, search for the game, and <strong>press to download it</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s sure to be as simple as this. Like Fortnite, Warzone, Overwatch 2, or any other free-to-play title, Marvel Rivals is a quick and easy download. Here are the steps you probably need to follow to download the Marvel shooter:</p>



<ol>
<li>Load up your PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, or PC.</li>



<li>Go to the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, or Steam.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>Marvel Rivals</strong>.</li>



<li>Once it’s live, press the download option.</li>

<p>According to a new report, Sony and Kadokawa have been discussing a partnership for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since Sony sent a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-confirms-acquisition-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter of intent</a> to Kadokawa, the entire gaming community has been wondering whether this acquisition will go through, and now new information has come to light. According to a <span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-26/sony-s-pursuit-of-kadokawa-anime-looks-like-a-great-takeover-idea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg report</a></span>, Sony and Kadokawa have been “testing the waters for a potential combination for years.” However, the issue seems to be the “degree of commitment.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the report states, Kadokawa wants Sony to acquire them completely or not purchase anything at all. On the other hand, Sony only wants ownership of assets related to anime and video games, which will help build their IP portfolio. The Kadokawa group has several game developers under its banner, including heavy hitters like FromSoftware, Spike Chunsoft, Gotcha Gotcha Games, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sony is developing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-developing-playstation-handheld-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Handheld</a> that will rival the likes of Switch and Xbox. Also, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-sales-better-ps4-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro sold better than the PlayStation 4 Pro</a> in the same period. What are your thoughts on Sony and Kadokawa discussing a potential combination for years?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

But where does Echoes of Wisdom fit in? After <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/character/zelda/en/history/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent update</a> from Nintendo itself, fans finally know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>, which flips the franchise's famous formula on its head by having Zelda as the playable character, is part of the ‘Hero is defeated’ timeline, a fork generated by the seminal Ocarina of Time if Ganon defeats Link. From there, Echoes of Wisdom takes place after the 2015 3DS game Tri Force Heroes, but before the very first Zelda game, released in 1986 for the NES.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ominously, Nintendo notes the “Decline of Hyrule Kingdom” that followed the events of Echoes of Wisdom, but came before the first Zelda. Here’s Nintendo’s official blurb on the game’s entry:</p><blockquote>The hero Link sets out to rescue Princess Zelda, who was captured by Ganon. Following a fierce battle, Link defeats Ganon, only to be swallowed up by an eerie rift. It was as if he'd been stolen away... All across Hyrule, more mysterious rifts are forming and taking the people of Hyrule away. Nobody is safe — not even the king himself and his advisers, who have also gone missing. Princess Zelda must set out on an adventure to save her father — the king of Hyrule — the people, and Link.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/26/screenshot-2024-11-26-123857-1732626477149.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Echoes of Wisdom's place on the Zelda timeline is now official. Image credit: Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This particular timeline fork ends with 1987’s side-scrolling The Adventure of Link, the direct sequel to the first Zelda game. The ‘Hero is Triumphant’ fork includes two timelines of its own: Link’s child and adult eras. The child era continues with the likes of Ocarina of Time follow-up Majora’s Mask, whereas the adult era includes Game Cube masterpiece Wind Waker. Still with us?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, that’s where we’re at for now. But does any of this matter? One person who doesn’t care about the Zelda chronology is producer Eiji Aonuma, who last year told IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-producer-eiji-aonuma-doesnt-really-care-about-the-series-chronology">overthinking the Zelda chronology could limit the development team's creativity and vision</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course there will be new Zelda games released, no doubt for Nintendo’s Switch successor, and we’ll have this timeline debate all over again. The question is, what’s the next Zelda game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-moves-on-to-brand-new-the-legend-of-zelda-game-rules-out-tears-of-the-kingdom-dlc">Nintendo said it had no plans to release DLC for Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and confirmed it had moved on to a brand new game in the series. In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202309/06314767.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a>, Aonuma left the door open to a return to the Hyrule of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, potentially setting up a third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the first place, the reason I decided to make this a sequel to the previous work was because I thought there was value in experiencing a new game in that Hyrule place,” Aonuma said. “If that's the case, if a new reason arises, we might return to the same world again. Whether it's a sequel or a new work, I think it's going to be a completely new game, so I hope you're looking forward to it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-timeline<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has finally allocated a place for&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>on its sprawling and baffling&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>timeline, although one rather wonders if that constitutes wasted effort on the Japanese gaming giant's part.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-places-echoes-of-wisdom-on-its-official-zelda-timeline" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>,&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is now located just before the original 1986&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>&nbsp;and just after&nbsp;<em>Tri-Force Heroes&nbsp;</em>on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/character/zelda/en/history/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official timeline</a>, which means that it takes place in the branch in which Link was defeated in&nbsp;<em>Ocarina of Time</em>.</p>

<p>In case you need reminding, the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>timeline is unified until&nbsp;<em>Ocarina of Time</em>, at which point two divergent branches are created: one in which Link is defeated by Ganondorf and one in which he emerges victorious.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-timeline-beds.jpg?itok=zARfnUfm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-timeline-beds.jpg?itok=FfIUiNcH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>now has a place on the official&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>timeline.</figcaption></figure><p>The branch in which Link is triumphant has its own two branches, too: one set in Link's "child era" and one in his "adult era". The former gives rise to&nbsp;<em>Majora's Mask&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Twilight Princess</em>, while the latter leads to&nbsp;<em>The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>and its DS sequels.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild" rel="nofollow">Breath of the Wild</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom" rel="nofollow">Tears of the Kingdom</a>&nbsp;</em>fit into the timeline...well, they don't. They're part of their own branch, one that's not connected to any previous&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>I've never quite understood the appeal of creating an overarching&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>timeline. The series doesn't feel like it fits neatly into a chronology, and imposing a rigid timeline on things arguably makes it harder for fans to create fun theories, like the one that posits all&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games are retellings of the same story.</p>

<p>Still, if you were wondering exactly where&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>fits into the broader <i>Zelda</i>...storyline, then now you know.</p>




<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is the latest entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>series. It combines the top-down perspective of classic&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games with the experimental systems-based style of&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild</em>.</p>

<p>Unlike previous&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games, you'll play as Princess Zelda in this one, and you'll use Echoes to conjure everything from objects to monsters in order to help you solve freeform puzzles.</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is available right now <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively on Nintendo Switch</a>.

<p>CODMAS returns in 2024 with Black Ops 6 and Warzone, bringing all kinds of holiday gifts and surprises for players. Driving the holiday spirit, Treyarch have detailed what to expect in the CODMAS event, from the return of the Nuketown Holiday map to limited-time modes.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about the Warzone and Black Ops 6 CODMAS event, including its release date and expected content.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-codmas-event-in-black-ops-6-amp-warzone">When is CODMAS event in Black Ops 6 &amp; Warzone?</h2>



<p>The devs have not confirmed an official date for the Black Ops 6 CODMAS event yet, but if we look at last year’s release date for the event, we <strong>expect it to arrive mid-December</strong>, perhaps Tuesday the 17th. </p>



<p>The event is definitely arriving, as the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Weapons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6 Season 1 blog</a> confirmed its return alongside Nuketown Holiday, the Christmas-themed variant of the iconic map that’s set to arrive in the days leading up to CODMAS.</p>



<p>The previous year’s CODMAS event landed on December 19 and ended on January 3, so if that’s anything to go off, this year’s event will also last around 2 weeks as well. Keep in mind that this is just speculation, so take it with a pinch of salt. Treyarch will likely announce the event soon, so when they do, we’ll be sure to refresh this piece with the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-expected-content-for-codmas-in-bo6-amp-warzone">Expected content for CODMAS in BO6 &amp; Warzone</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Event rewards</li>



<li>Limited-time modes</li>



<li>Themed maps</li>



<li>Store bundles</li>



<li>Warzone mode</li>
</ul>



<p>Similarly to last year’s CODMAS event, BO6 players can expect to see an in-game event panel with a variety of rewards for players to earn. These prizes will likely be cosmetic rewards like Charms, Calling Cards, Emblems, Weapon Blueprints, and maybe even an Operator skin. We also expect to see Holiday-themed Store bundles.</p>



<p>On top of tasty rewards, CODMAS will also bring themed maps and limited-time modes like last year’s Santa’s Slayground It’s unclear whether the mode will be completely new or just another iteration of last year’s. </p>



<p>Further, Warzone will likely also receive its own Christmas-themed mode, but players will hope that doesn’t mean the return of Krampus, who completely ruined the festivities a few years back by being an unstoppable killing force in lobbies.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closed-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-bioware-dev-casey-hudsons-studio-humanoid-origin-closes-down.1045515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closed-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Humanoid Origin, the studio started by ex-BioWare staffer Casey Hudson, has closed down, citing "an unexpected shortfall of funding" that left the studio "unable to sustain operations".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn post</a>, Humanoid Origin says that the closure happened despite its "efforts to shield the studio from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">broader challenges in the industry</a>", and that the company is "heartbroken" it won't be able to complete its debut project.</p>

<p>The project in question was set to take place in a "new science-fiction universe", and while Hudson and Humanoid Origin never revealed what kind of game it would be, the studio's <a href="https://humanoidorigin.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>&nbsp;describes it as a "multi-platform AAA title focused on character-driven narrative". Sounds very familiar indeed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closure-mass-effect.jpg?itok=4I2uaIGN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closure-mass-effect.jpg?itok=sGPLRKBe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Casey Hudson is perhaps best known for his work as a director on the&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>Humanoid Origin says that it's "committed to supporting [its team] in their transition to new employment", and that during the team's time together, it "achieved incredible progress", fostering "a culture of fun and creativity".</p>

<p>The studio is right when it points to the current time as one of tumult and difficulty for the gaming industry (or certain sections of it, at the very least).</p>

<p>Major studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> have laid off hundreds of staff members in recent times, and some studios, like&nbsp;<em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition" rel="nofollow">Volition</a> and&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">Piranha Bytes</a>, have been outright shut down.</p>

<p>Many game projects are being canceled as well; in recent months, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-canceled" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff Project T</a>, online action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-canceled-west-japan-service-ending" rel="nofollow"><em>Blue Protocol</em></a>, and an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">unannounced&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>FPS</a> canceled (at least in the West, in <em>Blue Protocol</em>'s case), among others.</p>

We'll just have to wait and see, I suppose.</p>

Explore the natural landscapes of Colorado and Texas, alone or in a group, and hunt numerous animal species with the help of your faithful hunting dog.</p><p>With almost 10 years’ expertise in hunting games, developer NACON Studio Ghent intends to offer fans of the genre an authentic hunting experience with this third opus. Thanks to feedback from the community, which numbered over one million players on the two previous titles, NACON Studio Ghent has retained the foundations that have made the series such a success, while introducing a number of new features and gameplay improvements. Among these, <em>Hunting Simulator 3</em> introduces an all-new dynamic system, “SimFauna,” which faithfully reproduces animal behavior, allowing players’ actions to have a real impact on animals and the environment.</p><p>In addition to improved hunting dog behavior and sound design, and the addition of vehicles, the game features realistic, natural open-world environments thanks to Unreal Engine 5. Players can hunt over 40 species of animal, using hunting equipment from renowned brands such as Beretta, Winchester, Browning, and many others.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>'s next season is named Dual Destiny, and will kick off next week on Tuesday 3rd December. 
</p>
<p>
Its logo features obvious black and white-themed branding, which should perhaps not be a surprise considering Pokémon Black and White region Unova is next on the docket to be featured in the game's Go Tour event series. Dual Destiny finishes on 4th March, around the time we'd expected Go Tour Unova to be held.
</p>
<p>
So, why "Dual Destiny"? In a press briefing, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> said the name was designed to reflect "opposites coming together to strengthen one another and celebrate two sides of a whole", which is nice.
</p>
<p>
In terms of content, much of what is to come will be announced over the coming days, but perhaps the headline for now is the early introduction of teacup Pokémon Sinistea. This fits the Dual Destiny branding as it has two different types - Antique and Phony - depending on whether it comes with a stamp of authenticity. (Maybe it should have been called Authencitea?)
</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with Sinistea - a Ghost-type Pokémon that debuted in Pokémon Sword and Shield - it looks like a small chipped teacup. Its Pokédex entry describes it thus: "The soul of someone who died alone possessed some leftover tea." It evolves into Polteageist: "The tea that composes Polteageist's body has a distinct and enjoyable flavor. Drinking too much, however, can be fatal."</p>
<p>
From the start of the season, Red and Blue-striped Basculin will now be Shiny-possible and available in 7km eggs. Oddly, though, the form you obtain will relate to where the gift is <em>hatched</em>, not from where it was sent. (Here in the UK, you'll obtain Blue Basculin while on the West side of the Prime Meridian line, and Red Basculin on the East.)
</p>
<p>
Gigantamax Lapras will also make its debut in Max Battles, while Go Battle League will feature avatar items based on Unova Elite Four member Grimsley. Dragalge, Bibarel, Glliscor, Starmie and others will receive additional moves.
