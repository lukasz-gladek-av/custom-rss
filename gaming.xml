<p>Here's the full rundown of the Patch 1 preview, and when we find out about a Switch 2 and Switch release, we'll share an update.</p>
<h3>Hades II - Post-Launch Patch 1 Preview</h3>
<div><p>In addition to various bug fixes and some balance changes, this patch contains...</p><p>

• <strong>True Ending Enhancements</strong>: Added new events in the lead-up to the True Ending, and some after. As part of this, increased the number of Underworld clears required, and added to and revised parts of the main True Ending scenes before the end credits. <em>Note: The vast majority of changes are to the Underworld route; the Surface route is mostly unchanged.</em></p><p>

• <strong>Returning to a Real Possibility</strong>: Added Cauldron incantation lets you return to an earlier point in the story in case you wish to re-experience key events, such as the True Ending.</p><p>

• <strong>Fated Prophecy Adjustments</strong>: A number of character-related Prophecies, including the one connected to the story epilogue, should unfold faster than before.</p><p>

• <strong>Crossroads Renewal</strong>: Many decorative items have reduced costs in Kudos compared to before. Any excess Kudos you have already spent will be refunded.</p><p>

<p>If you haven't already checked out our review of Hades 2, here's a quick sample. On Switch 2, we gave the game an excellent nine out of ten. We also shared our impressions of the title on the original Switch version.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Supergiant Games is five-for-five with Hades II, a huge, triumphant sequel that manages to diverge mechanically and offer more challenges and variety than its predecessor. It helps that it’s nearly faultless on Switch 2 in particular."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wolfe “<a href="https://kotaku.com/shiny-pokemon-scarlet-violet-tatsugiri-dondozo-wolfey-1850157723">WolfeyVGC</a>” Glick is one of the most prolific competitive <em>Pokémon</em> players in the space. He’s won the official World Championship tournament, competed in several events around the world, and has amassed millions of followers on his YouTube channel where he talks about competitive <em>Pokémon</em> and the events he attends. However, Glick says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmVgzNasYjI">in a lengthy new video</a> that he will likely step away from in-person events because of harassment from fans.</p> <p>The pro player says he’s had to deal with fans groping him during pictures and pushing boundaries like touching him without consent. He says this meant leaving this year’s Worlds tournament early because he wasn’t able to watch the event in peace after he’d been eliminated and that the stress he feels from these events has now started to outweigh his enjoyment of competing in the tournaments themselves.</p>

 <p>Glick also says he wants to be there primarily to compete, but the fan interactions have begun overtaking his private time at the shows and even, in some cases, prevented him from getting to the matches on time.</p>  <p>Beyond that, Glick says that he doesn’t want to make a video for this year’s Worlds tournament because it would make him “relive” the event and all the bad memories he has associated with it. For now, he’ll be taking time off from in-person events, which could affect whether or not he qualifies for 2026’s World Championship.</p>

 <p>“Even if I do qualify for the World Championships this year, it is very likely that I will not attend,” Glick says in the video. “It’s gonna depend on how the rest of the season and how the rest of these events go. But what I will say is that I do not want to have another Worlds like the one I just had. I would rather not attend than take the risk because I think that if I don’t attend Worlds there’s a chance I could come back in the future. I think if I have one more Worlds like this one, I don’t think I’m coming back.”</p>

 <p>Glick says that these “parasocial” interactions have been both a problem in-person and online. The pro claims that while he isn’t above criticism, the “vitriol” from some has become so prevalent that he’s not comfortable interacting with fans or critics online, and that the unwanted attention has included sexual harassment in online messages too.</p>

 <p>“I guess what I’m trying to say is that I feel like I’ve become more of a symbol and less of a person,” he continues. “There is a lot of responsibility and I’m very privileged to be in that position, but at the same time, I would like to be a person. Sometimes I would like to be Wolfe and not WolfeyVGC.”</p>

 <p>For now, Glick will be taking social media breaks, doing fewer videos, and even playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> in solitude rather than on stream. He signs off the video saying that he still wants to create content about competitive <em>Pokémon</em>, but that he’ll have to take time to reevaluate his approach after these “dehumanizing” experiences. But he isn’t fully walking away and says he still wants to make changes to improve his relationship with the competitive <em>Pokémon</em> space.</p>

 <p>“I always figured that if I stopped competing it would be because competition stopped being fun for me; like I lost the love of the game or maybe I wasn’t able to keep up with a new guard and it was really hard for me to never win. […] The thing I’ll say about this that is positive is that I’m still having fun. I still love competing and I’m still having a blast. If I could just do the competition part of tournaments and not everything else, that would be great for me. […] Because it’s still fun for me, I have motivation to try and fix things.”</p> <div dir="auto" data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1761270211.861699" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1761270211.861699"> <p>He says he’s still looking into arranging meet-and-greets where fans can chat with him in-person, but isn’t yet sure what form those will take moving forward.</p> </div> <p>“I wish that I could do more,” Glick says. “I wish there was more of me to give. I really have tried for so hard for so many years to be the person people see me as, as this symbol, as this kind of unshakable bastion in the scene, but I am only human, and I think pretending that I’m not is not doing me or you any favors.”</p>

<p>So many games nowadays come loaded with DLC, or at least plans for some other paid content drop in the future, but when it comes to the upcoming Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, you'll be getting the full package on release.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the latest Nintendo Direct broadcast, the game's director Masahiro Sakurai mentioned how the Kirby Air Riders team isn't currently planning on any DLC, and "everything is here". Additionally, he's not planning to turn this into an "ongoing series".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Just so you know: We're not planning any DLC. Everything is here...I've thrown everything I have into this game from the start. So I hope you don't miss this opportunity."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, no DLC is planned, and don't expect this racing entry to necessarily transform into an ongoing series or anything similar. Of course, there will be some additional physical content in the form of a new amiibo line, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/three-more-kirby-air-riders-amiibo-have-been-announced">multiple figures already announced</a>.</p>
<p>You can find out more about these amiibo and the latest Kirby Air Riders Direct in our full guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>

This new change will still see Neutron Capture being one of the best (if not the best) damage scalars in the game, but the power level will be much more in line with our expectations. Additionally, since all damage from the Gun is converted into Radiation, it should have more scaling vectors for clever build crafters, and allow for meaningful boosts from Gun Damage.</p><h3>Cosmic Brilliance - Passive</h3><ul><li>Flux Generator + Annihilation interaction updated so spawned grenades now scale correctly with character level</li></ul><h3>Amon the Forgeknight</h3><ul><li>Shield visuals adjusted for improved clarity in combat situations</li></ul><h3>Trait - Forgeskill</h3><ul><li>Adjusted interaction with Forge Master class mod so Forgeskill now respects its cooldown in multiplayer</li></ul><h3>Onslaughter - Calamity</h3><ul><li>Camera behavior stabilized when combining Onslaughter with Order Legendary Pistol Noisy Cricket</li><li>Attack frequency of Rocket Punch is now consistent in multiplayer</li></ul><h3>Balance Adjustments</h3><ul><li>Seeing Red Duration restored no longer increases per point invested, and is now 4 seconds for all ranks.</li></ul><p>Dev Note: Seeing Red was always meant to have huge damage scaling potential, but was always meant to be hard to maintain. We didn't want to nerf this passive's power, but we're making the effect harder to maintain.</p><h3>Scourge - Vengeance</h3><ul><li>Scorched Kairos passive now displays consistent magazine size values for the Ordnance gadget</li><li>The Forgewave no longer fires unintentionally during Glacial Rapture</li><li>Projectiles no longer get stuck in the air when Forgemaster Firewall is active during the Fortress Indomita boss fight</li><li>Blackout Shock Damage now properly scales with points invested</li><li>Blackout is now 15% per point, down from 21% per point</li></ul><p>Dev Note: After fixing the scaling of the DoT (damage over time), we found that Blackout was overperforming a bit, so we gave it a slight re-adjustment.

We still want this skill to be effective, but it should not be able to scale infinitely. We’ll be monitoring Melee builds after this change to make sure they are meeting expectations, and will further adjust if necessary. This ultimately had to be fixed so we can establish a baseline before we investigate further buffs/changes.</p><h3>UI &amp; UX &amp; Text</h3><ul><li>Sorting settings in menus now persist when switching tabs or leaving the menu</li><li>“Toggle Junk” behavior has been corrected to target the desired item in Bank menus and Backpack</li><li>Weapon wheel no longer sticks when opened near Guns vending machines</li><li>Combat Radar now features a dedicated Legendary Loot Indicator, making high-value drops easier to spot in the heat of combat</li><li>Press/Hold input now cancels correctly without triggering unintended actions</li><li>“Apply Settings” prompt only appears when changes are made</li><li>[PS5 and Xbox] Splitscreen updates, including number text scaling, Equipment/Backpack improvements, scrollbar behaviors, Party list layout, and “Flip Card” functionality</li><li>Restored Fullscreen resolution controls and switching behavior</li><li>Weekly Activities now populate after campaign completion</li><li>Maurice's Black Market Vending Machine timer updates to show correct cooldown</li><li>Firmware 3-Piece bonuses (Ahoy, Oscar Mike, Daed-dy O’) now show cooldown icons; Deadeye Tier-3 stacks now appear in the passive bar</li><li>Boss Bar spacing corrected when Combat Radar is active</li><li>Transfer Machine naming has been standardized across the game</li><li>Travel notification now displays the initiating player’s name</li><li>ECHO Location path remains readable over time; made improvements to pathfinding</li><li>Updated various UI visuals and icons for alignment, consistency, and clarity</li><li>Updated localization and various text descriptions across the game</li><li>Standardized/updated terminology across gear, menus, customization, and manufacturers</li></ul><h3>Visuals</h3><ul><li>Updated various character and NPC animations</li><li>Corrected various reported instances of VFX not rendering correctly</li><li>Grapple Vault points now show proper models instead of placeholders</li><li>Reduced reported instances of visual pops at cinematic starts</li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><ul><li>Audio and VO now remain active when returning to menus after level traveling in multiplayer</li><li>Adjusted audio mix for improved balance across gameplay and VO</li><li>SFX volume slider now correctly applies to high HDR-value sounds</li><li>Addressed several reported instances of VO not playing as intended across multiple missions and scenarios</li><li>Vault Hunter battle voiceover frequency has been tuned so lines repeat less often</li><li>Missing pain reaction audio restored for several named NPCs</li><li>Improved various subtitle timing and text</li><li>Background music now continues as expected during the Idolator Sol boss fight</li><li>Unique audio cue restored for Phosphene (shiny) gear spawns</li></ul><h3>Settings &amp; Accessibility</h3><ul><li>Personal Cross-play settings can now be adjusted immediately after switching Party Privacy from Local Only to Public in Session Settings</li><li>Air Dash is now fully usable on controller when Toggle Crouch is set to Off under Accessibility → Gameplay</li><li>Individual graphics options now reset properly after making changes and then selecting Run Auto-Detect in Options</li><li>[PS5 and Xbox] Field of View resets consistently to Default on consoles without showing mismatched values</li></ul><h3>Player Experience</h3><ul><li>Improvements to stability</li><li>We are continuing to investigate and will make further improvements to stability and performance.</li><li>Addressed multiple reported issues across multiplayer, missions, menus, and engine systems.</li><li>Improved matchmaking and session stability.</li><li>Addressed performance in multiplayer when there were large numbers of homing projectiles</li><li>Refined graphics settings and shader handling</li><li>Improvements made to patch reliability and automation processes</li><li>Ocean could occasionally fail to load</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>[Epic] Rich Presence now displays correctly in non-English languages on Epic</li><li>[PS5] Friend list now loads properly after logging out and back in during patch checks on the title screen</li><li>Joystick input now behaves consistently when lowering deadzones</li><li>[PS5 and Xbox] SHiFT account linking verification codes now auto-copy and apply correctly on console</li></ul><h2>Weekly Activities:</h2><p>Weekly Big Encore Boss has switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those that take it on.</p><ul><li>The Battle Wagon</li></ul><p>The Weekly Wildcard Mission has changed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Avalon Hill has announced two new board games at Essen Spiel 2025. The iconic board game developer stated that their next two projects will include a strategic experience created by award-winning designers, as well as a new expansion for the iconic <em>HeroQuest</em>.</p>

<h2>The Avalon Hill Essen Spiel 2025 Announcements</h2>

<p>As part of the first day of the iconic board game convention, Avalon Hill announced two new board games: <em>Market Fresh</em>, and <em>HeroQuest Wizards of Morcar</em>.</p>

Players gain points for every crate they add, and score higher for every crate they stack. However, space will run out as competition intensifies, so who can hold out the longest? The game was created by award-winning German designers Michael Kiesling (<em>Azul</em>, <em>Vikings</em>) and Wolfgang Kramer (<em>Take 5</em>, <em>Coliseum</em>).</p>

<p><em>Market Fresh</em> will be available in January 2026 at local game stores. It will be sold at an MSRP of $44.99.</p>

<p>The second game, <em>HeroQuest Wizards of Morcar</em>, is an updated version of the 1991 original quest pack. At its core, it is the same fantasy story. A dark alliance of wizards has come together to do Zargon's dark bidding. What is he after? The power of 1,000 Dread sorcerers locked away in the High Alter of the Northern Dread Wastes.</p>

For if Zargon gets a hold of this power, he will be unstoppable. The expansion will include 5 quests based on the original story, alongside 5 new quests. The box will include 27 detailed miniatures, 64 game cards, and a cardboard tile sheet. You will need <em>HeroQuest Game System</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hero-quest-first-light-review-your-favorite-ttrpgs-favorite-gateway-ttrpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>HeroQuest First Light</em></a> to play this expansion.</p>

<p><em>HeroQuest Wizards of Morcar</em> is available for pre-order right now. It is currently available at an MSRP of $49.99.</p>

She warns that this <em>won’t</em> be something you’ll want to play every day, but she’s still making it real.</p><p>She’s calling her kit <a href="https://buildaboy.co/">the Build A Boy</a>, and she says the completely pre-soldered version should truly be “drop in and play.” It’s her custom-designed board with everything you should need beyond the bricks, including:</p><div><ul><li><span>an actual harvested Game Boy Pocket CPU</span></li><li><span>a 2.7-inch 320 x 320 display</span></li><li><span>working switches you can place behind your Lego buttons and D-pad for actual controls</span></li><li><span>a speaker and a volume wheel</span></li><li><span>a rechargeable battery</span></li><li><span>a USB-C port to charge it</span></li></ul></div><p>Natalie confirms to <em>The Verge</em> that she’s planning to offer an optional glass lens if you hate the plastic window that Lego uses to cover the screen — and she might even offer some sort of <em>video output</em> so you can play on a TV or other external screen, though it’s not guaranteed. She’s not sure how she’ll make video out happen yet, though. “It could even be potentially be over Wi-Fi if that doesn’t affect performance,” she tells me.</p><p>While the original Game Boy offered a 160 x 144 10:9 aspect ratio display, Natalie says the 320 x 320 one will simply upscale the original images by 2x while keeping their relative shape and size the same.</p><p>Natalie doesn’t plan to wire up a Link Cable port for multiplayer play — “I don’t personally care for the link port,” she tells me — but says she’ll “probably” leave a pinout so modders can add their own.</p><p>As far as harvesting the chips goes, Natalie says she’s managed to buy damaged Game Boy Pockets in bulk, as they’re the “unloved sibling” of the Game Boy family, but she doubts she’ll have enough to satisfy demand. If you have a donor Game Boy Pocket yourself, she’ll also sell a version that only requires the CPU and RAM for around $60. She’ll also sell a completely DIY version for the “soldering iron pros” out there. She’ll also still release files for free.</p><p>It’s not clear what the entire drop-in kit will cost yet, given Trump’s tariffs. “I am aiming for $99 USD but y’know how the world is at the moment,” she writes. She’s hoping to start selling them in early 2026, and says she should receive the first test boards this very week.</p><p>Natalie’s kit won’t be the only way to play a Lego Game Boy for real. For example, tap the video below!</p><p>While it’s quite a feat to shrink an entire actual working Game Boy down to the size of a Game Boy cartridge, others are coming close — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/18/24159721/retrohai-nintendo-ds-lite-game-boy-color-advance-sp-mods">modder Hairo Satoh</a> has been showing off <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DP-5jNhk3BO/">an excellent Game Boy Color version on Instagram</a> that uses real cartridges, though he tells me it required a lot of modification to the Lego “shell” and he’s not sure he’ll release a kit himself. Generally, Satoh sells one-offs on commission.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805376/lego-game-boy-brickboy-emulator-kickstarter">the rival BrickBoy kit</a> might be the easiest and most sustainable way to power a Lego Game Boy yet. It plays ROMs on an emulator, not actual cartridges on actual chips, which defeats some of the fun for me — but at least no Game Boy Pockets will be harmed in the making of that kit. We’re still waiting to share how much it’ll cost; it’ll launch on Kickstarter on October 28th.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/805673/nintendos-chips-make-this-lego-game-boy-upgrade-kit-the-most-authentic]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-day-fallout-5-tease-event-remaster-2000638661</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/todd-howard-can%E2%80%99t-wait-to-tell-you-all-about-fallout-5-but-not-today.1333519/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier today, Bethesda released a new video dedicated to the future of <em>Fallout</em>. And while the studio announced a new version of <em>Fallout 4 </em>and showed off more of <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s next big update, there was no explicit mention of a <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-show-todd-howard-amazon-1851325762">Fallout 5</a></em>. But don’t worry, Bethesda’s creative director Todd Howard wants you all to know that “more” is coming and he’s excited to share it with fans…eventually.</p> <p>In case you weren’t aware, October 23 is known as Fallout Day among the fan community. It’s the day that, in the video game franchise and TV show, the bombs dropped and destroyed the world. A weird day to celebrate, but hey, every mass media franchise needs a holiday to get excited about once a year. Anyway, on Thursday, for the second year in a row, Bethesda aired a Fallout Day Broadcast aka a <em>Fallout</em> Direct filled with some new trailers and updates on the series. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-fallout-4-switch-2-2026-anniversary-edition-trailer-xbox-ps5-2000638638">The big news was <em>Fallout 4</em> making its way to Switch 2 in 2026</a>. But, for those hoping for <em>Fallout 5</em> to be announced or <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_3_remaster">the rumored <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster</a> to be shadow-dropped during the event, well, it was a disappointing presentation. That might explain why, at the end, Howard showed up to assure fans that the company was still working hard on more <em>Fallout</em> games.</p>

  <p>“Even though I am recording this—it’s not live—and I’m probably watching myself right now from my desk and I’m reading your chat and these…that thing you want and this other thing you want…Hey, we read it all,” said Howard. “Just know, we are working on even more. We are looking forward to the day when we can share that with everybody. But thank you again for tuning in and happy Fallout Day.”</p>

 <p>And…that was it. The stream then cut to a video of <em>Halloween</em> director and gamer John Carpenter (?!) claiming to be the biggest<em> Fallout 76</em> fan and then wishing everyone a happy Fallout Day as well. Thanks, John! <a href="https://youtu.be/HMDSfOs1EPY?t=1313">While Howard did also show up at the end of last year’s Fallout Day event</a>, it was a much shorter experience that didn’t seem so apologetic.</p>

 <p>It’s clear that Bethesda knows there’s a large demand for <em>Fallout 5</em> and other <em>Fallout</em> games. That demand has existed for years now, but has only grown larger thanks to the really successful Amazon TV show. That likely explains <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em> getting a Switch 2 port, and the next<em> Fallout 76</em> update adding the Ghoul from the show as a quest-giving NPC. It’s an easier way to get more <em>Fallout</em> content out there that might appeal to both players and TV show fans.</p>

 <p>Bethesda’s next big RPG after <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627">2023’s <em>Starfield</em></a> is <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>, not <em>Fallout 5.</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-v-bethesda-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-starf-1849062025"> In 2022, Howard confirmed that <em>TES6</em>, announced in 2018, was entering pre-production</a> and was still years away from release. After that’s done, Howard confirmed Bethesda will make <em>Fallout 5.</em> But considering how long these games take to make, that means the next main entry in the post-apocalyptic RPG franchise might be close to a decade away at this point.</p> <p>In 2024, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-new-vegas-2-fo3-remaster-starfield-dlc-1851544120">Howard explained in an interview</a> that Bethesda doesn’t want to “rush” out a new <em>Fallout</em> single-player RPG and pointed to <em>Fallout 76</em> and the TV show as options for fans longing for new <em>Fallout</em> content. But considering how successful the company’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remaster-elder-scrolls-eso-glitch-meme-1851777557"><em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remaster</a> was earlier this year, I wouldn’t be shocked if, in a move intended to provide players with more <em>Fallout</em> games quickly, we see a similar remake for<em> Fallout 3</em> and maybe even one for<em>&nbsp;Fallout: New Vega</em>s in the future. And there’s always next year’s Fallout Day!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League’s Toronto Ultra has unveiled a rebrand, taking on a new name and logo. In a press release, OverActive Media revealed the new name, ‘Toronto KOI’, in recognition of the organization’s association with KOI and Movistar. </p>



<p>This is the latest in a line of a few organizations to rebrand going into the 2026 Call of Duty League season. We recently saw the Riyadh Falcons, FaZe Vegas, and G2 Minnesota all surface amid ‘rostermania’. Merchandise and new jerseys to celebrate the new branding will launch in December, the organization advised.</p>



<h2 id="h-introducing-toronto-koi">Introducing: Toronto KOI</h2>



<p>In a press release, Adam Adamou, the CEO of OverActive Media, Toronto KOI’s parent company, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To be KOI is to belong</p>



<p>KOI has always been about connection, about fans, players and communities coming together under one banner. Toronto KOI brings that spirit home and gives it a global stage. This launch marks an important moment in our global strategy. It connects our North American operations with one of the most recognized and influential brands in global esports. </p>



<p>Bringing this illustrious brand to the Call of Duty League and to Toronto will benefit everyone, our fans, our players, our partners and the broader esports ecosystem. We are building a single, unified brand platform that scales across regions and delivers lasting value for all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This alignment brings Toronto Ultra into the core OverActive ‘KOI’ branding, offering fans something more tangible to connect to than the arguably arbitrary term ‘Ultra’.</p>



<p>It’s what ROKKR did by taking on the ‘G2 Minnesota’ label, and there are expectations that Gentlemates will deepen brand identity in the coming weeks by ‘moving’ LAG M8 to Paris. It’s a busy time to be a Call of Duty League fan, as everything is changing ahead of the long-awaited Black Ops 7 season.</p>



<p>It already feels like an age since the Call of Duty League Championship wrapped up towards the end of June, and there are still many weeks until the new season starts.</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the new Toronto KOI brand? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Seven legendary ornaments from across the franchise timeline.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Halloween may be right around the corner, but the winter holiday season will come at us just as fast. If you're a big Zelda fan or have special someone in your life that is obsessed, Hallmark has a handful of awesome ornaments spanning the franchise's storied history you can buy right now. Ranging in price from $12 to $32, purchasing one of these won't break the bank and will last for holidays to come. If you're looking for an affordable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-legend-of-zelda-gift-ideas">Legend of Zelda gift</a> to buy ahead of the 2025 Christmas season, this is a delightful option worth considering.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Legend of Zelda Hallmark Ornaments</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pretty much every era from Zelda's history is represented with these ornaments, from the NES original 8-bit Link to 2023's Tears of the Kingdom <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-hallmark-christmas-ornament-amazon-buy-2025">Decayed Master Sword</a>. The Link with his sword and shield ornament is another notable inclusion, since it plays classic Zelda tunes at the push of a button. I personally would have appreciated some Twilight Princess love with this collection, but I can't complain with what's on offer here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each ornament is only a few inches in every dimension, so storing them efficiently in the off-season or utilizing them as year-round decor is definitely on the table. I have a game shelf that the Toon Link ornament would be right at home on. The 8-bit Link ornament is low on stock, so if you've had your eye on it, now's the perfect time to pick one up.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Hallmark Nintendo Ornaments</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, The Legend of Zelda franchise isn't the only <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hallmark-keepsake-ornaments-nitendo-where-to-buy">Nintendo property receiving the Hallmark treatment</a>. There's an Elephant Mario from Super Mario Bros. Wonder would look great on any Christmas tree, and the winter hat Rowlet is one of the cutest things I've ever seen.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is Hallmark a Good Ornament Brand?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hallmark isn't the only ornament brand out there, but it is certainly one of the most well-known. The main appeal of Hallmark Keepsake ornaments is that the brand offers yearly releases from popular IPs like Nintendo, Star Wars, Disney, and more. If you're looking for a little piece of your favorite movie or video game to hang on your tree, it's most likely going to be a Hallmark-branded ornament. Seeing as the ornaments are officially-licensed, they are also likely to be of higher quality than any knock-off brands you find elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.

Digital Foundry also noted small lighting downgrades in PS5.</p><p>As for the PS5 Pro, the report states that it uses Sony's proprietary upscaler, PSSR, which doesn't interact well with The Outer Worlds 2's lumen lighting or RT lighting effects. The report concludes that PS5 Pro's "frame rate dips and more intense encounters are common, and the general run of play is noticeably worse than Series X in the finished game."

		<p>Lion Shield has announced that players will be able to get their hands on the Roman city builder Nova Roma, with the date being January 22nd 2026. The Nova Roma early access release will be available on both Steam and Epic Game Store. The game is not just about mimicking Rome, but striking out and building an improved version.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nova Roma - Release Date Trailer | Roman City-Builder" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P0Is5zmKugs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Nova Roma, the Roman Empire is falling into decay so you have to lead a small group of citizens to build a new version of the city in new lands. To build successfully you will need to meet the needs of the citizens, and gain the favour of the gods through building temples. Nova Roma is not just a builder where you throw up some buildings a be done with it. You will need to plan where to place dams and aqueducts to get water flowing to the city, without causing floods, and set up supply routes to get raw materials to the city without spreading too quickly.</p>
<p>Advisors and senators will be there to help guide you build Nova Roma, and deal with the different issues that come up which will need balancing. You will need to make sure there is enough variety of entertainment to keep citizens happy after days of working, otherwise they may become unhappy too leading Nova Roma to ruin.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire has piqued our curiosity for years, thanks to its fusion of black-and-white 30s-style animation and shooter mechanics reminiscent of classic Doom games. While it was slated for 2025, developer Fumi Games and publisher PlaySide Studios announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2416450/view/499462068471070731?l=english">the game was sliding into 2026 earlier this week</a>. However, this news also came with the caveat that the release date would be revealed at today's Galaxies Gaming Showcase, and sure enough, we just got a release date trailer. Mouse: P.I. For Hire will launch next year, on March 19. You can watch for yourself below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IlwZMgDK-kQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IlwZMgDK-kQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Join P.I. Pepper in a world where danger lurks even in the tiniest mouse hole," reads a post announcing the date in the news tab of the game's Steam Community page. "Investigate a complex web of intrigue, corruption and murder with a thrilling noir-fueled detective story, lively environments to explore, an original big band jazz soundtrack and a fully-loaded arsenal of cartoon weapons and devastating power-ups."</p><p>While a delay is never ideal, it's nice to know an exact time to expect the game, especially since it's only five months away. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2023/05/15/mouse-is-a-noir-retro-shooter-inspired-by-classic-cartoons">Mouse's initial reveal came back in 2023</a>, with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/12/vintage-animation-shooter-mouse-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-and-2025-release-window">its release window of 2025 announced not much later</a>, so we've been anticipating its launch for a while. Most recently, we learned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QhWXpfjBjQ">the protagonist would be portrayed by none other than Troy Baker</a>, one of the most prolific game actors working today.</p><p>For more on shooters, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/battlefield-6/battle-ready">check out our Battlefield 6 review</a>.

That’s the work of EA’s extraordinary artists, designers, developers, storytellers, and innovators.”</p><p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson has spoken highly of AI in the past, saying last year that the technology is at the “<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/ea-the-future-of-entertainment-is-interactive-as-dev-looks-to-become-launchpad-for-new-businesses/">very core</a>” of the company’s business.

Stability AI <a href="https://stability.ai/news/stability-ai-and-ea-partner-to-reimagine-game-development">notes that</a> the two companies will “also pursue developing AI systems capable of pre-visualizing entire 3D environments from a series of intentional prompts, allowing artists to creatively direct the generation of game content with unmatched speed and precision.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/805777/ea-stability-ai-transformative-game-development-tools]]></content:encoded>

The extended five-minute cut was introduced by studio founder Emanuel Palalic, and offered more gameplay by showing off a squad of THE SYSTEM’S heavily armed police forces storming the grimy halls of a massive apartment complex to terminate a rogue artificial intelligence. They’re quickly given a warm welcome by the ruthless gang lording over the complex, drawing each faction into an explosive firefight that tears the environment to shreds. A quick-thinking officer is able to hijack the consciousness of an unfortunate gang member which allows him to revive a downed teammate by placing them into the mind of this gang member thereby making them part of the friendly team until the end of the match. The squad of police descend further into the guts of the building in order to reboot the entire block, taking their final stand while soaking in the neon lights and lasers of an underground dancefloor. The two-minute short-form version of the gameplay trailer condenses the action down to the highlights in all their destructive glory.</p><p>Initially announced in 2024, <em>DEFECT</em> is a new squad-based cyberpunk shooter, from the creative minds of emptyvessel. <em>DEFECT</em> delivers a new kind of experience through its immersive and highly tactical combat for fans of the action shooter genre. The game is set in a futuristic, divided city ruled by an enigmatic AI known as “THE SYSTEM” all while ruthless gangs and rogue law enforcement vie for supremacy. <em>DEFECT</em> is being created by industry-leading developers behind iconic franchises including <em>DOOM</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, and <em>The Last of Us</em>; and features music from legendary composer Mick Gordon.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1002177"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->

		<p>Ion Lands has announced that its cyberpunk slice of life RPG Nivalis, set in the same world as Cloudpunk, will not be making a 2025 release date. Last year, the development team was aiming for a Spring 2025 release but that passed. However, the team did want to get the game out this year. However, there is still work to be done, so Ion Lands has made the decision to delay Nivalis to 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nivalis | Official Summer 2024 Trailer [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VYykZ9RBo3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, Ion Lands said, <em>“As you know, our goal over the past year has been to launch the game within 2025. The progress we’ve made in recent months has been both steady and substantial, allowing us to refine every aspect of Nivalis – our unique take on the slice-of-life genre – including all the intertwined, dystopian, and mysterious stories unfolding throughout its streets. However, there’s still one final piece of the puzzle missing.</em></p>
<p><em>Right now, we’re deeply focused on the voice over: we’ve just completed the casting process for over 100 new voice roles after our first casting of 32 roles for our demo 2 years ago. We have received more than 8,000 auditions this time. In Nivalis, there will be around 135 primary and secondary fully voiced characters, for a total of about 200,000 words. They will bring to life the multitude of complex personalities you’ll meet in the game. It’s a massive undertaking that we’re carefully overseeing, because for us this is a key element: as we’ve said many times before, we want the Nivalis experience to be as immersive as possible. So – as some of you correctly guessed after last month’s devlog – between casting, recording, and implementing the voiceover, releasing the game in 2025 would risk compromising its quality.</em></p>
<p><em>For that reason, we’ve made the decision to officially move Nivalis’ release a few months ahead into 2026. This will also allow us to dedicate all the time needed for additional testing, optimization, polishing, and balancing, to ensure the smoothest experience possible. We’re currently working closely with our publisher to determine a specific launch date – which we hope to share before the end of the year. Soon, we’ll let you know when we’ll be able to celebrate ‘Nivalis Day’. Thank you all for your patience, understanding, and incredible support – it’s what gives us the strength and motivation to push through this final stretch.”</em></p>

<p>In Nivalis, you begin with a small business, such as a noodle stand or a small nightclub. Your goal is to grow from these modest origins into a huge enterprise that Nivalis’ citizens will rave about and want to spend their time and money at. However, there’s more to Nivalis than just building up a business. You can get to know some of the city’s inhabitants, go fishing, or just dedicate time to home decoration. Delving into the underworld of Nivalis is also an option, if you want to go that route.</p>

		<p>Yesterday, PlaySide Studios and Fumi Games announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/22/mouse-p-i-for-hire-has-been-pushed-back-to-early-2026/">Mouse: P.I. For Hire had been pushed back to early 2026.</a> Today, the teams have confirmed a concrete release date for the cartoony first person shooter, and players will be able to get their hands on it from March 19th, 2026. The game is coming PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

<p><i>“We are very excited to share our game,&nbsp;<b>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire</b>, with fans across the world on 19 March 2026”</i>, says Mateusz Michalak, CEO &amp; Founder, Fumi Games.&nbsp;<i>“Set in the cartoon-noir city of Mouseburg, MOUSE: P.I. For Hire offers a unique mix of explosive FPS action and hand-drawn rubber hose animation. Stepping into the shoes of Private Investigator Jack Pepper – played by the inimitable Troy Baker – will be an experience that players will not forget!”</i></p>
<p><wbr>In Mouse: P.I. For Hire you play private investigator Jack Pepper, who is being voiced by Troy Baker, in a noir inspired first person shooter drawing on 1930’s animation. The setting is the city of Mouseburg and Jack is initially hired to help a “damsel in distress”. However, things take a turn as the case dives deep into the criminal and corrupt world that lays beneath the surface of the city. There will be numerous areas to explore including the city streets, the sewers, a casino, a film studio, and the docks. All of these locations will have loot and collectibles to gather, along with clues to help Jack solve the case.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-october-24-866/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-866-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-friday-october-24.1333444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday, and as the week comes to a close, I’ve got another round of NYT Connections hints and solutions to help you usher in the weekend. Today’s puzzle was tricky, but I persevered to bring you the hints you need to wrap this NYT Connections puzzle up much faster.</p>



<p>It’s time for the weekend! Let’s get into the NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-24">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 24)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #866:</p>



<ul>
<li>BAYWATCH</li>



<li>HIGHLIGHT</li>



<li>RAINBOW</li>



<li>HERRING</li>



<li>PRIME</li>



<li>SUNSET</li>



<li>BOLD</li>



<li>PEACOCK</li>



<li>COOTIE</li>



<li>HEYDAY</li>



<li>KALEIDOSCOPE</li>



<li>UNDERLINE</li>



<li>ZENITH</li>



<li>KINGPIN</li>



<li>STRIKETHROUGH</li>



<li>PINNACLE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words mark the peak of something — think career highs, golden eras, or when someone was “in their prime.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These are all formatting options — the kind you’d find in a word processor or messaging app.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are vibrant by nature — often used metaphorically to describe something dazzling or full of variety.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word ends with something you might wear or carry — but the full word itself isn’t necessarily about fashion.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 24.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-24-866">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 24 (#866)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– HEYDAY, PINNACLE, PRIME, ZENITH</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BOLD, HIGHLIGHT, STRIKETHROUGH, UNDERLINE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – KALEIDOSCOPE, PEACOCK, RAINBOW, SUNSET</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BAYWATCH, COOTIE, HERRING, KINGPIN</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

This is described as a "mysterious force that grows more perilous" the longer you linger in the Whispering Woods, and to survive, you'll need to equip specially attuned parts to your station wagon that can keep it at bay. Artifacts from Altars will also be found in the expansion, and these offer reality-warping powers that affect both the environment and you.</p><p>Pacific Drive made a lasting impression when it debuted last year, as the Indie survival game blended a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-pacific-drive-pulls-off-being-unnervingly-spooky-and-relaxingly-chill-all-at-once/1100-6523113/">well-crafted layer of suspense with a surprisingly chill vibe</a> as you explored a creepy patch of the Pacific Northwest from the relative safety of your station wagon.</p><p>"With its wonderful depth in both story and gameplay, Pacific Drive is an early hit in 2024," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pacific-drive-review-road-trippy/1900-6418183/">Pacific Drive review</a>. "It sets out to create a world that fits comfortably in the New Weird genre but brings its own style and substance to it. Though the game can be especially hard to decipher, difficulty options help to counter some of its more overwhelming aspects. I'll stick to bikes in my day-to-day life through the actual northwest, but in Pacific Drive, I'm up for another joy ride through one hell of a winding road."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div data-nosnippet="">
		
		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>A new datamine points from <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981402959180427611">X (formerly Twitter) user ModernWarzone</a> points to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/">the battle royale mode</a> for Battlefield 6 shadow-dropping next week when the game's Season 1 update arrives on October 28, 2025.</p>



<p>According to ModernWarzone, the new mode which is codenamed "<em>Granite</em>" will be fully revealed first on October 27 with a trailer before it goes live the next day on October 28. It's worth noting that we've heard nothing concrete from EA and Battlefield Studios about when the battle royale mode will arrive, and that it has not been included in any promotional materials for the game's Season 1 roadmap.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>BREAKING: A new content drop for Battlefield 6 that is NOT Season 1 codenamed “Granite” with release date of October 28th has been datamined from the EA App. 🗓️</p><p>Think it’s safe to say this is the BF6 Battle Royale. 🪂</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/onebattlefield?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@onebattlefield</a> for sending the info over to me 🫡 <a href="https://t.co/H3xaZpWmne">pic.twitter.com/H3xaZpWmne</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981402959180427611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>According to ModernWarzone, this is partly due to EA not wanting to immediately pull focus away from Battlefield 6's core offering, its multiplayer modes. If that's true, then that's likely because the coming battle royale will be free-to-play and likely a separate offering compared to the core Battlefield 6 game. Essentially, it'll be just like how you can play Call of Duty: Warzone for free, but to jump into the multiplayer for the new annual Call of Duty release, you'll have to buy the latest entry.</p>



<p>Just yesterday from the time of this writing, Wccftech and several other media outlets <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">shared hands-on impressions with the Season 1 content set to arrive next week</a>, including the new maps and game modes, the first batch of which arrives on October 28, the second on November 18, and the third on December 9.</p>



<p>The new maps both look stunning and like they'll be solid additions to Battlefield 6, but the new game modes, both the permanent one arriving next week and the limited-time mode coming in November failed to impress, and at least in their current state, are rather stale and boring.</p>



<p>If this battle royale mode does arrive next week, then that certainly gives Season 1 a huge boost compared to what it already has available. </p>

            <p>Watch out. There's a musician mystery afoot. They've gone missing, mysteriously. So says Silver Pines, a Twin Peaks-inspired survival horror puzzler that's set to arrive next year, according to an announcement trailer that's just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">barged into my house</a> in a trench coat, waving a gun about and demanding to know whether I did it.</p>
<p>No, I respond calmly, there are no missing musicians around here. For a moment, I fear he might notice the outline of a guitar's headstock buried under the carpet. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, he says, as all detective-ish types do. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...</p>

<p>I try to distract him by asking for more information about Silver Pines. It's by developers Wych Elm, he says. You must roam the small town filled with horrors to survive, doing puzzles to unlock different areas and managing your resources. Arrrrrrggghhhhhh, I scream, resource management! Shhhhh, he replies, let me read you the plot synopsis to calm you down:</p>
<blockquote>Private investigator Red Walker finds himself in Silver Pines, a place half-abandoned, half-forgotten, in the middle of nowhere on a job to track down vanished musician Eddie Velvet. As the case begins to reveal a dark past, Walker soon slips into a strange and nightmarish descent beyond his control.</blockquote>
<p>The exploration's a bit Metroidvaniay, he claims, and you'll need to find better tools and weapons to open up more bits. Ok, I reply, the roaming around a small town as a moody investigator clearly going through some shit intrigues me, even if this certainly isn't pitching itself to be as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>y in an RPG sense as my brain sort of wishes it was.</p><p>It's set to arrive at some point in 2026, he says, and you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2333000/Silver_Pines/">Steam</a>. Nice, I respond, hoping the ensuing awkward silence will drive him away. He turns towards the door, takes a few steps, and brutally stubs his toe on the telltale head. Watch out, I whisper as he writhes on the floor.</p>
