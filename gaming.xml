That sub-header quote from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hitman_absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> has made us sad now. Poor Agent 47. It must be lonely being an insane psychopath who spends his time flying around the world, looking cool, getting free clobber, and offing folk in trendy nightclubs.</p>
<p>However, chin up, baldy, as we've got some good news that involves you: Feral Interactive has just announced that Hitman Absolution is coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 in late 2025 and TBC 2026, respectively.</p>
<p>This follows on from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> alongside the Switch 2 back in June.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067syltij&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here are some more early details from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hitman Absolution features all the series’ hallmarks of stealth, distraction and disguise, while revealing 47 as a more complicated and thoughtful character, aware of the effects of his actions, for both good and evil.</p>
<p><em>Absolution</em>’s missions invite players to explore and experiment as they stalk their targets, engineering opportunities to strike from the shadows or, when the bullets fly, unleashing an arsenal of weapons, gadgets and anything else that may come to hand. Whether executing a silent hit or creating mayhem, players have no end of inventive ways to approach their targets, with opportunities to beat their high scores and meet each mission’s multiple Challenges."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think it's fair to say that Absolution was <em>quite divisive</em> amongst critics when it launched back in 2012, and for what it's worth, this writer did initially kind of hate it when it came out. It was just so far removed from the vibe and style of a 'proper' Hitman, it really didn't hit well.</p>
<p>However! It has to be said that a replay a year or two later, away from the excitement and noise of release week, well, it's a fine enough action game if you just take it on its own terms, really.</p>
<p>The game is also coming to iOS and Android, and Feral says that more details on the Switch versions will be coming "later this year". We'll keep you updated on this one as we find out more.</p>

			<p>Half-Life 2 Remake, an impressive fanmade remaster of the second entry in the popular series by Valve in the Source 2013 engine, is getting a playable demo before release to allow players to check out the impressive gameplay and visual improvements featured in the project for themselves ahead of the full release next year.</p>



<p>The demo was confirmed on the project's Mod DB page by GameROOSH, the developer behind the project. As of now, the developer is considering two different possibilities—a demo featuring a couple of levels or a remake of the Lost Coast demo that Valve itself released in 2005 to showcase the Source engine's HDR capabilities. While a decision has yet to be made, the developer seems to be leaning more towards the latter option to preserve first impressions of the project at launch.</p>



<p>The Half-Life 2 Remake project aims to remaster the original game's visuals with realistic graphics on par with those of modern games while properly conveying the game's unique atmosphere. Besides the impressive new visuals showcased in the screenshots below, the project will also feature new gameplay features, like realistic bullet simulation, destructible objects, and more to deliver an improved experience that fans of the original are sure to appreciate.</p>

<p>Fan projects like the Half-Life 2 Remake continue to be the only new releases related to the series. Still, the situation may change in the future, as a new entry in the series is rumored to be in active development. <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/">Earlier this year</a>, we learned that the mysterious project codenamed HLX may be close to the end of development, and some of its features, like the story, are being openly talked about in certain circles. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see what this project will be about, and if it will indeed be the Half-Life 3 that fans have been waiting for for decades.</p>

<p>Based on real dreams?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Mexican indie studio Interactive Dreams has announced that its short interactive story, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/a_dream_about_parking_lots">A Dream About Parking Lots</a>, arrives on Nintendo Switch... today.</p>
<p>The game, which only takes around 30-40 minutes to complete according to the PR, sees you search for your car, whilst at the same time having a conversation with a therapist about why you have this recurring dream about parking lots.</p>
<p>It may be short, but when indies hone in on something mighty specific in a laser-focused way like this — and especially when the writing is up to scratch — special things can occur. And, given this one is currently sat on a "Positive" user rating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3500340/A_Dream_About_Parking_Lots/">over on Steam</a>, where it released back in March, it seems it might pack some big messages into its short running time.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer above, and here's some more from the PR blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A Dream About Parking Lots</em> is a short, surreal narrative game where you search for your car in endless parking lots while talking to your therapist about recurring dreams. Blending retro visuals with emotional storytelling, it explores themes of feeling lost, creative block, and the strange logic of dreams 🧠</p>
<p>Look for your car by using your car key!<br>
30-40 minutes long.<br>
Retro-style graphics.<br>
Existential story about feeling lost and creative blocks.<br>
Based on real dreams!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can't find details on pricing, as it's not yet showing up on the eShop, but it's $3.99 on <a href="https://interactivedreams.itch.io/adreamaboutparkinglots">itch.io</a> and Steam. It's 699 yen <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000101018">on the Japanese eShop</a>, although there's a 20% launch discount right now that brings it down to 559 yen.</p>
<p><em>Looking forward to having therapy in a car park that may or may not exist?</em></p>

			<p>Hideo Kojima is disappointed in the current state of the video game industry, as there are too many games that look and play the same.</p>



<p>Speaking with Ssense, the legendary game creator commented on the current state of the video game industry following this year's Summer Game Fest showcase, noting how almost every game shown involved fighting either aliens or medieval monsters. It's not just the premise that seems to be almost identical, as Hideo Kojima finds that even visuals and gameplay systems are pretty much the same. While he understands that many people enjoy these games, he believes that it is important to put something really new for the industry, which is something that the legendary game creator has consistently been doing for years, especially with the release of the two Death Stranding games, and only indies seem to be doing nowadays. Being disappointed in a game industry that is putting out games that look and play almost the same, it's not surprising that Hideo Kojima is not going to play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake of the third entry in the series, which will not change the original's gameplay significantly.</p>



<p>Although Hideo Kojima's games often manage to set themselves apart from almost every other game out there, the legendary game creator hasn't been exempt from criticism, especially for its extreme involvment in many aspects of game development. However, he believes that it is this singular concentrated vision the reason of his success, as it allows him to work on multiple aspects of a game simultaneously, unlike a movie where the process proceeds step by step, starting with writing the script then moving on to storyboarding and production.</p>



<p>With Death Stranding 2: On the Beach now out, Hideo Kojima and his Kojima Productions studio are working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/">Physint</a>, which will mark his return to Metal Gear Solid's action/stealth formula, and the mysterious&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">OD</a>, which will be something totally different that people will either love or hate. Once the game is out, Kojima-san will listen to people's opinions, but reception won't matter, as he is sure the legacy of his games will be defined in the future.</p>



<p>You can learn more about the aforementioned latest game by Hideo Kojima, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review</a>. The game is now out on PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>Very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tamriel-man-skywind-squeezes-morrowind-into-skyrim">long-in-the-works</a> Elder Scrolls modding project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skywind-releases-long-new-trailer-for-morrowinds-21st-anniversary">Skywind</a> has hit another milestone in its winding road towards an eventual release. The folks behind the mod, which aims to deliver a version of the series' beloved third entry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a> remade in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine, have recruited the final three voice actors they were looking for to fill out the base game's entire roster of characters.</p>
<p>Skywind's still without any kind of release date, meaning it's almost certainly further off than its Oblivion-centric sort of cousin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, which is aiming to arrive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-and-gog-chat-about-partnering-up-to-release-the-massive-elder-scrolls-mod-following-fallout-londons-troubled-success">this year</a>. However, the regular updates we've been getting about it of late are encouraging signs that it will eventually let us into its heart chamber.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The team behind the mod have taken to the socials to announce that they've now cast voices for every character in the base game. "Roughly 300 voice actors are lending their voices to give life to the approximately 3000 NPCs of Vvardenfell," the modders explained, "and we are looking forward to you all hearing them on your adventures."</p>
<p>Given that scale, you can see why it'd take such a gargantuan effort to bring together enough dulcet tones to fill the voice boxes of everyone from Alvis Teri to Zabarbael. The final three characters the Skywinders were looking to find voices for weren't exactly minor roles either. As the team explained in their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wWpMR5mo-w">most recent showcase of the mod</a> back in May, Dagoth Ur, Vivec, and Yagrum Bagarn were the trio left communicating via silent text.</p>

</span></p><p>Jeff Baker's performance as Dagoth's only one of the most iconic things about the original Morrowind, how tough can it be to fill those god-sized shoes? Well, I'd certainly not want to be the one tasked with bellowing at Nerevar to come and look upon the heart, and Akulakhan, and bring Wraithguard please, because I have need of it. My work certainly wouldn't be god-tier enough to make folks want to stick synthwave behind it to form <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR-K2rUP86M">funky tunes</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, Moon-and-Star, the Skywind team aren't resting on their laurels having ticked this box, and they're still looking for volunteers to help out.

Many of the experts I spoke with at the conference in Sao Paulo waxed lyrical about the passion and ability of developers in the region, but acknowledged that what's so often missing from teams and studios of all sizes is experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There is a definite gap in the skills that are needed to get to the pro level," explained Amber general manager Jorge Suarez Basañez, during a fascinating panel that sought to spotlight how Latam studios can achieve global success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Basañez has spent decades building and growing studios in Mexico. He currently oversees full-service development company Amber, which is headquartered in Guadalajara and has worked with notable partners like Amazon, Netflix, Paradox Interactive, King, Epic Games, Disney, and more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Basañez, the talent destiny in Latin America is surging—which is turn has created an opportunity for studios in the region to nurture and retain developers on home soil. Of course, he suggests employers ensure their workers want to stick around for the long haul, and that means they must play to their unique strengths.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-make-it-political-how-can-the-brazilian-game-industry-establish-itself-on-the-global-stage-" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Make it political:' How can the Brazilian game industry establish itself on the global stage?</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Implement systems that nurture those talented people and help them to grow&quot;">"Implement systems that nurture those talented people and help them to grow"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He believes rising development costs in North America and Europe coupled with a widespread return-to-office drive at major studios in those regions has created a window for employers in Latam to flip the script. As such, he tells developers across Latin American to encourage hybrid and remote work, noting how people will be attracted to companies that allow them to choose between working productively at home or in-studio based on their individual needs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a move that would also enable employers to access talent outside of larger urban areas, where the cost-of-living might also be lower.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[By enabling remote working] you can tap into a whole lot of talent in small towns that didn't previously have an opportunity, and that makes a big difference," he says. "Implement systems that nurture those talented people and help them to grow."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's about building for the future—and to do that, employers must strive to understand how to instill cultural values that enable them to punch above their weight. For instance, he suggests the elephant in the room right now across Latin American studios is salary. Although studios in the region might not be able to offer the same wage as some of their rivals, what he feels they can do is ensure people "don't feel like a number on the payroll."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/investors-and-publishers-share-their-pitching-tips-at-gamescom-latam" target="_self" data-discover="true">Investors and publishers share their pitching tips at Gamescom Latam</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He suggests employers can offer both financial compensation and emotional compensation—and for some people the latter is far more important. "The best projects attract the best talent and the best talent attracts the best talent," he adds. "The best way to let go of your best people is to keep the people with a bad attitude."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In short: build your team around the positive influences and refuse to let toxicity fester. Nurture your workforce by offering training that allows them to expand their skillset rather than stagnate. Basañez explains Amber has a training center dedicated to bridging the skill gap between its more youthful hires and more experienced team members, pushing them to evolve their technical and soft skills beyond what was taught at university.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer was invited to Gamescom Latam by event partner Abragames, which covered flights and accommodation.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p>Dauberman has secured the screen rights to the game and will produce the film alongside Mia Maniscalco, the president of Coin Operated - the production company he founded (thanks <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gary-dauberman-spooky-video-game-the-medium-exclusive-1236333819/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>).</p>

<p>"When I talked to Piotr [Babieno, Bloober CEO] about it, we immediately connected on our mutual love of horror and his vision for where the genre is headed," he continued. "I have no doubt anything Bloober develops is going to push horror forward in unique and terrifying ways, and I'm excited to be working alongside them."</p>
<p>The search for a writer and director for the film adaptation has now begun.</p>
<p>"Adapting games into films often involves balancing many interests, but with The Medium, I have a deep sense that Gary is the perfect partner for us," said Babieno. "From our very first conversation, I felt we were completely in sync. And every conversation since has only reinforced that feeling."</p>
<p>This won't be the first game adaptation Coin Operated has worked on, after the company co-produced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-until-dawn-film-trailer-shows-plenty-of-gruesome-deaths">Until Dawn film</a> with PlayStation Productions.</p>
<p>Dauberman himself is known for writing The Conjuring Universe films Annabelle and The Nun, as well as the 2017 film It and its sequel (based on Stephen King's novel).</p>
<p>The Medium, released in 2021, followed Bloober's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a>, Observer and Blair Witch. Set in Poland, it's a psychological horror with a protagonist who's able to travel between two terrifying realms.</p>
<p>Bloober has since seen success with its remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> and is now preparing for the release of Cronos: The New Dawn later this year. According to our preview, it pilfers liberally from other survival horror games.</p>
<p>"In the crudest terms possible, Cronos: The New Dawn is a survival horror game about going back in time to steal things from the past," wrote Eurogamer's Ian Higton in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-feels-like-a-combination-of-every-other-survival-horror-game-ive-played-before-it-which-isnt-always-a-good-thing">Cronos preview</a>. "I say this because its developers, Bloober Team also seem to have gone back in time and stolen almost every aspect of Cronos' gameplay from past survival horror titles and more."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-the-medium-will-be-adapted-to-film-courtesy-of-it-and-annabelle-writer-producer-gary-dauberman]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In the realm of Warhammer 40k, players have faced formidable enemies for years. But Warhammer publisher Games Workshop has run into an unlikely foe that it has yet to defeat. According the company's latest financial disclosure, Games Workshop's plan for a new car park have apparently been derailed by a "cute looking" bat</p><p>As spotted by IGN, Games Workshop <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/6RTEwwgirDZoH36H2AfQ8f/41dd13da3aad11bb599a6c2ad9df8f2b/2024-25_Press_statement_29_Jul.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has shared its latest financial report</a> for investors, and notes that a "cute looking pipistrelle bat is delaying our work on our new temporary car park," before adding that the company is "carefully looking after the bat."</p><p>The report notes that Games Workshop amassed huge profits for its fiscal year ending in June 2025. However, President Trump's tariffs are a larger concern going forward for the company's lucrative physical goods business.</p><p>"We hope the uncertainty around tariffs is resolved soon," notes the company in the report. "We are also mindful of the increased risk of supply chain disruption as a direct consequence of conflicts around the world, which we highlight as a principal risk... This new problem will be dealt with in our normal pragmatic way. We will not change our operational plans too much... It's mostly out of our control."</p><p>Games Workshop also acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-and-games-workshop-finalize-deal-for-warhammer-40000-adaptations/1100-6520022/" data-ref-id="1100-6520022">a deal with Amazon for the Warhammer 40k adaptation rights</a> has been finalized, with some creative issues still to worked out for any film and television projects.

Other Microsoft titles including Doom: The Dark Ages, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and Minecraft also appeared as best-sellers on PlayStation's Q2 chart.</p><p>Microsoft went on to state that Black Ops 6 has drawn 50 million players to date, and added that the Minecraft movie led to record active usage and revenue for the already wildly successful game.</p><p>The report doesn't really dwell on the recent layoffs or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">canceled gaming projects like Rare's Everwild</a>.

            <p>Xbox Game Pass made Microsoft almost $5bn in annual revenue last year, proving the company is in a healthy state despite last month's shock layoffs.</p>
<p>During the company's latest earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella stated "Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5bn for the first time" and Microsoft has 500 million active users across multiple gaming platforms and devices.</p>
<p>Indeed, Microsoft overall has seen an 18 percent increase in revenue (up to $76.4bn) and 23 percent increase in operating income (up to $34.3bn). As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/microsoft-q2-2025-earnings">The Guardian</a> has reported, the company's stock rose by more than seven percent on Wednesday, as it remains the world's second-most valuable company.</p>
<p>Said Nadella: "Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector.</p>
<p>"We're innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era, and this year, Azure surpassed $75bn in revenue, up 34 percent, driven by growth across all workloads."</p>
<p>The news follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">a statement from Nadella last week</a>, where he claimed "Microsoft is thriving" and doubled down on the importance of AI.</p>
<p>"What does empowerment look like in the era of AI?" he said. "It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It's about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That's the shift we are driving - from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organisation to build whatever they need to achieve."</p>
<p>But this success comes at a human cost. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">Over 9000 employees were laid off from Microsoft earlier this month</a>, including across its gaming divisions. The likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMax MMORPG were all cancelled</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">roughly 200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and reportedly replaced by the AI tools they helped to build.</p>
<p>Microsoft told Eurogamer the layoffs were "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>
<p>This Game Pass success is alongside Microsoft's success as a third-party publisher on PlayStation. As we reported earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-games-made-up-most-of-playstations-top-sellers-in-the-us-last-quarter">the majority of PlayStation's top-selling games in the US over the last quarter were published from Microsoft</a>, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-hits-almost-5bn-in-annual-revenue-and-microsoft-profits-grow-despite-thousands-laid-off]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I would be hard pressed to call Dear Me, I Was a game in any true sense of the word, because it really does not feel like a game. Describing it as a visual novel would do Dear Me, I Was a disservice to its artistic style too. The best way to describe Dear Me, I Was is a reflective piece about life from beginning to end.</p>
<p><iframe title="「Dear me, I was...」Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s43znSJMsAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Dear Me, I Was follows the life story of an unnamed woman from her childhood to old age, with each significant moment getting its own chapter, of which there are ten in total, including the epilogue. The start of each chapter begins with a meal for breakfast, and one of the few interactive moments in the experience where you pick each item to eat. As the woman grows older her breakfast of choice changes from a glass of milk and some fruit as a kid to croissants and coffee. It’s a good way to introduce each chapter, as it signifies the change in life that the woman is going through.</p>


<p>Every scene is depicted as a watercolour, with moods shown through how bright or muted the watercolour is. The art style immediately stands out and Dear Me, I Was could be a contender for visual design of the year with the way the story is played out through Taisuke Kanazaki’s watercolours which are brought to life through rotoscoping.</p>


<p>Each scene is unique and brief, but carries enough meaning to provide the context of what you are seeing. These scenes are accompanied by plaintive piano pieces, with the music again matching and complementing the scenes, from positive songs to slower and more depressive tones when the story calls for it.</p>
<p>To discuss any element of the story would be a spoiler, but it shows the highs and lows that each of us will experience at some point in life, especially the relationships we have with others. In that way, Dear Me, I Was is relatable even if our life experiences are different to what the woman in this piece goes through.</p>
<p>Dear Me, I Was lasts approximately one hour and in that time you will only be required to put in minimal effort to interact. Already mentioned is picking at the food at the start of each chapter, but there are other moments where you ‘sketch’ scenes, though this is just holding the A button while moving the analogue stick to uncover pictures. There are a few other interactive moments, but it feels like they have been thrown in so you are given something to do instead of simply being a passive viewer.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Dear Me, I Was offers reflection on a life accompanied by eye-catching art and gentle piano music. There's very limited interactivity though, and while the story is relatable at some points, it's not particularly unique. It is worth picking up if you're looking for something that will make you sit back and reflect, but it feels as though Dear Me, I Was will only appeal to a very specific audience.	</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hey-microsoft-is-it-%E2%80%98xbox-pc%E2%80%99-or-%E2%80%98xbox-on-pc%E2%80%99.1257840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft first started using the “Xbox PC” term in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/">blog post</a> announcing the <em>Gears of Wars</em> remaster in early May. It was a new branding effort designed to signal that games are available on PC through its own Xbox PC app and store. The Xbox PC branding didn’t last long though, as Microsoft has now started using “Xbox on PC” instead. Which one is it, Microsoft?</p><p>The Xbox PC branding has been picked up by third-party publishers, with Focus Entertainment using it for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCpWo0A0i0">gameplay trailer</a> in early June. Then on June 25th Microsoft introduced the Xbox on PC branding for its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/"><em>Hellblade II Enhanced</em> announcement</a>, but confusingly used both Xbox PC and Xbox on PC in the same blog post.</p><p>Xbox game studio World’s Edge used the Xbox PC branding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MkpGj44bFc">for its trailer</a> of an <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em> expansion in June, and then swapped to the Xbox on PC branding in a <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/pre-order-heavenly-spear-for-age-of-mythology-retold/">preorder blog post</a> yesterday. <em>Grounded 2</em> was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0HQNOtg1WI">announced</a> last month as an Xbox PC title, before an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcUeK3xv17k">early access trailer</a> debuted yesterday and also switched to the Xbox on PC branding.</p><p>I wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/693576/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-steam-notepad">last month in my <em>Notepad</em> newsletter</a> that calling the Xbox app on Windows simply Xbox PC was a clear bid to position it as a Steam competitor or alternative. The Xbox on PC branding isn’t too different, but it’s a subtle change that makes it sound more like you’re getting Xbox games on PC rather than needing some kind of Xbox PC hardware.</p><p>Both of these brands have challenges, though. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827140/microsoft-pc-game-pass-naming-rebrand">rebranded</a> its Xbox Game Pass for PC subscription to just PC Game Pass four years ago because people were getting confused. There has always been an inherent conflict with Microsoft’s efforts to bridge PC and Xbox, because the experiences are often so different.</p><p>That’s something Microsoft is now trying to change, especially as it heads towards its next generation of Xbox consoles that look set to lean further towards Windows than ever before. Microsoft is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">combining Windows and Xbox for handheld PCs</a> later this year, and we’ll hear more about that effort at Gamescom next month.</p><p>I think the Xbox PC branding is just a little too early, and that’s probably why it has changed to Xbox on PC in a matter of weeks. It’s a similar situation to how Microsoft used its “this is an Xbox” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">marketing campaign</a> months before it started to make sense.</p><p>Microsoft is attempting to redefine the Xbox brand as a platform that spans across phones, laptops, TVs, handheld gaming PCs, and even VR headsets. There are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/693576/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-steam-notepad">plenty of challenges</a> to overcome to make that a reality, and let’s hope Microsoft avoids some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/11/6135053/windows-mobile-history-branding-names">Windows Mobile-esque branding changes</a> in the process.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/716564/microsoft-xbox-pc-xbox-on-pc-branding-changes]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo has already revealed that today's stream will be roughly 25 minutes long, and that it will be specifically targeted at its third-party partners - don't expect anything first-party from Nintendo here (so that's no Fire Emblem, Mario, Pokémon, Smash Bros. and so on). </p>
<p>Maybe we will hear something about Level-5's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</a>, though - it's been a few years since we first saw that game, and I'm hoping it's nearly ready for another blowout, now.</p>
<p>Personally, given that we recently<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-one-final-early-access-patch-before-full-10-release"> saw (two!) 'final updates'</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, I'm praying for a shadow-drop of the highly-anticipated sequel - especially since we know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">it's going to be a timed console exclusive on Switch and Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The world and its partner is also holding its collective breath for more news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> Silksong, though given<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong"> the game's relationship with Microsoft</a>, I do wonder if all announcements are going to be tied into Xbox-related showcases for the near future.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the Direct yesterday, a lot of internet chatter has been kicked up, referring to the showcase as the 'game card Direct' - a cynical nod to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-cards-thatll-let-you-share-you-digital-switch-and-switch-2-games">the controversial rollout of Nintendo's virtual game card system</a> that prevents games from being loaded onto (and played) on more than one Switch system at a time. It appears Nintendo has undermined a lot of the goodwill it generated since the launch of the Switch with this move, and I anticipate comments like this only getting louder and more dismissive in the official chat channels and social media during the presentation proper.
</p>
<p>As ever, we're planning on watching and bringing you all the news as it's revealed. Is there anything you're particularly excited for as part of today's Nintendo Direct?

<p>Button mashing is smashing, especially with friends</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've known for a while now, and as reported by our sister site Time Extension <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/taitos-track-and-field-esque-arcade-game-field-day-is-heading-to-ps4-and-switch-this-month">a week back</a>, Taito's 1984 classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arcade_archives_field_day">Field Day</a>, is on its way to Nintendo Switch consoles as part of the Arcade Archives series.</p>
<p>Now, Hamster has announced that the game will officially release on 31st July. Which is today. Holy timely news piece, Batman.</p>
<p>Field Day was amongst a whole crop of a very particular style of button-mashy sports game that popped up in the mid-'80s, mostly off the back of the enormous success of Konami's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_track_and_field">Track and Field</a>. This very writer whiled away copious hours playing most of them on his trusty Commodore 64, so can therefore confirm that the whole thing becomes very addictive if you let it get to you. These were as good as games looked back at the time, too, especially on home computers.</p>
<p>Of course, where Track and Field had regular sports games in a regular stadium sort of scenario, in this one you are taking part in a raft of challenges at a girl's school - stuff like tug-of-war, hence the name Field Day, which is like a Sports Day, right? Right?</p>
<p>Despite the somewhat antiquated look of this one, you must understand — and especially if you've never tried any of these sorts of games — that adding a second human player can lead to a category-10-level time sink. We're talking extinction-level event here. Well, not really. It does get bloody competitive, mind.</p>
<p>Also, some experts (or boffins, if you want) reckon this effort is actually more challenging than Track and Field, given its slightly odder collection of events. Here's some further details from Hamster:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"FIELD DAY" is an action game released by TAITO in 1984.<br>
Players compete in a variety of seven non-conventional sporting events from three-legged race to tug-of-war in an effort to become the sports day champion.<br>
Each event features a qualifying score which must be met to progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Field Day releases today and costs £6.29/$7.99/€6.99</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Buried in the fuzz of an otherwise unstartling <a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-interview">SSENSE interview</a> with Hideo Kojima, a sudden spike of violence. "People who are making military games, they probably don't know how to dismantle a gun or shoot a gun," said the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a> man, in amongst pictures of himself dressed as various Minecraft skinpacks. "So that's kind of sad." Does Kojima know how to dismantle a gun? "Yes, because I've been doing this training as well, and I learned so many ways to kill people as well."</p><!--more-->
<p>
Pretty big talk for a guy who likes to go out on rooftops and cosplay as a sail. I don't know how to shoot a gun myself, Kojima, unless you count the sniper rifle I fired at a Sniper Elite press event in 2012, but I know a bazillion other ways of ushering my enemies off to the pearly gates, and only half of them are from Hanna Barbera cartoons. Here's a quick rundown to show you I'm serious business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a nice warm bath for my adversary in a copper bath tub on a very high hill under a very tall tree sprinkled with iron filings during a thunderstorm</li>
<li>Get all up in my adversary's grill and invite them to "step outside", while standing in a space station</li>
<li>Hack my adversary's internet history and expose their deep and abiding love of all the things they say they hate on social media</li>
<li>Exchange my adversary's favourite earphones for some carefully painted Black Widow spiders</li>
<li>Build a mile-long chain of dominoes of relentlessly increasing size</li>
<li>Paint very small images of calm blue skies on the inside of my adversary's flying goggles</li>
<li>Place a tactical guillotine on the other side of a fence with a hole labelled "free hat"</li>
<li>Photoshop evidence of my adversary playing patticake patticake with the spouse of the local mafia boss</li>
<li>Challenge my adversary to a friendly unranked game of "who can drink the most nail polish", then sportingly let them go first</li>
<li>Shoot them with a gun. How hard can it be. You just have to remember which end is the bangy one and wait for the button prompt</li>
</ul>
<p>There isn't much else of note in the interview. The second spiciest moment is the revelation that Kojima found this year's Summer Game Fest trailer deluge dull, presumably not including the trailer for his own latest game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>. </p>
<p>"Even the visuals and the systems are pretty much the same," he said of the games on show, "and a lot of people enjoy this, I understand, but it is important to put something really new in there for the industry." I can't judge how "new" Death Stranding 2 is because Auntie Sony ain't put it on PCs yet, but I bet it doesn't let you kill people with dominoes.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-has-learned-so-many-ways-to-kill-people]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Vid watching should now be easier to navigate and come with less sudden quality jumps</p>

            <p>If you're the sort of person who likes to take in plenty of trailers when you're hunting for new stuff to play on Steam, Valve have just put out an update that should make doing so a bit more pleasant. The pipe-themed platform operators have casually gone through hundreds of thousands of videos as part of an effort to make Steam's trailer player easier to use and less likely to run into hitches as it shows you the video games.</p>
<p>To put it how Valve do in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500579723494031420">their news post</a> about the changes, they've improved the player's "interface and streaming to help you browse more quickly". So, much like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-redesigned-store-menu-is-out-in-beta-so-you-can-take-the-freshly-embiggened-search-bar-for-a-spin">Steam store revamp that's currently in beta</a>, Mr Newell and co want you to be able to zip around at the speed of sound.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Starting off with the new user interface, Valve say it'll be "more responsive" to whichever sort of clicking you're doing. For instance, it'll now automatically realise whether you're on desktop, mobile ("it even works well on iPhones now", Valve boast), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, or using big picture mode, then adjust accordingly. Jumping to different bits of a video will see you served a quick preview, while doing either that or hopping into full screen "should see fewer pauses and hitches".</p>
<p>Pretty obvious quality-of-life stuff there, but it's far better to have than not. To make the video streaming better, the Steamy folks say they've undergone what certainly sounds like a pretty beefy bout of scrawling through their trailer back catalogue.</p>
<p>"In order to update the streaming technology," they wrote, "we had to re-encode every trailer that appears or could appear on the Steam store. That ended up being around 400,000 video files." Oof. Holy admin, Batman. The result of that work is that these revisited trailers now have up to four quality options they'll automatically switch between based on how much net bandwidth you're packing at a given time, with the new player also adapting to different aspect ratios.</p>
<p>So, you're not guaranteed  1080p for every vid, but it seems you should at least get a version that's of decent quality and won't freak out if you do a single mouse click. Valve admit there are older trailers which are of very low resolution, but suggest they can do nothing about this because the original files are no longer lurking in Steam's system.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is the case with one of their own games in the original Portal. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/">I've checked</a> and your options for that trailer are limited to 360p and 394p. Don't worry, you can still pretty easily make out the diagrams of toilet sign-esque person outlines being pointed towards colour-rimmed holes that'll spit them out somewhere slightly different.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-upgrade-steams-trailer-player-and-all-it-took-was-trawling-through-something-like-400000-videos]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite the NES being an incredibly popular system, Nintendo was the only company making steady profit, according to a CAPCOM veteran Yoshiki Okamoto.</p>



<p>As reported by Automaton, the Japanese developer, who produced some of CAPCOM's best classic games like Street Fighter II, recently discussed in a video shared on YouTube how a third-party developer like CAPCOM struggled to earn money releasing Famicom/NES games. While he admits there are probably some exceptions, Okamoto-san says in the video that Nintendo was the only company making steady profits back then, as everyone else involved in the production of games didn't make much money, retailers included. For example, out of a game costing 10,000 yen, 3,000 yen went to the retailer, 4,000 yen to the developer, and 3,000 yen to Nintendo, with 1,500 yen going to the manufacturing contractors. The issue was that Nintendo had to be paid upfront for the exact number of copies, so only Nintendo was getting a guaranteed profit. Companies new to the console market at the time, like CAPCOM, did not have a lot of cash on hand, and so these upfront costs were a burden, often requiring taking out bank loans. With the time it took to deliver cartridges and for CAPCOM to get paid from distributors, the publisher would have to deal with six months' worth of bank interest, which would further eat into any profit CAPCOM made, together with every other cost, including the risk of having unsold copies.</p>



<p>With the arrangement above continuing to be a thing for years, it's unsurprising to hear Okamoto-san describe the launch of the first PlayStation as a revolution for third-party developers. During the first PlayStation era, CAPCOM's profit increased significantly, thanks to lower production costs and a more developer-friendly returns policy, as the company would give back to the publisher its share for unsold copies, essentially charging only the manufacturing costs. Restocking was also much faster, which allowed CAPCOM to take advantage of sudden popularity spikes of their games.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Nintendo's first-party line-up was often more than enough to make its systems popular, the loss of third-party support for the Nintendo 64 was a decisive blow that compromised the system's popularity in many regions. Things have changed a lot since the late 90s, however, and with third-party developers aiming to massively support the Nintendo Switch 2, it looks like the company has finally managed to mend those relationships ruined by its old strict policies</p>

            <p>The majority of PlayStation's top selling games this last quarter in the US came from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Data <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lv6vqqhmyc2w">shared by Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a> revealed that between April and June of this year, six out of PlayStation's top 10 selling games in the US were Microsoft published titles, with the likes of The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and Minecraft all making the cut.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, which was released on PlayStation 5 back in April, took the number two spot, coming only behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s co-op spinoff <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>. Earlier this month, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-forza-horizon-5-is-ps5s-highest-selling-game-of-the-year-so-far-says-analyst">Forza Horizon 5 was the highest-selling game on PS5 this year so far</a>, and had surpassed 3m copies sold.</p>
<p>Sony, meanwhile, only had two titles in PlayStation's top 10 US selling games last quarter - MLB: The Show 25 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.</p>

<p>The top 10 selling Playstation games last quarter in the US were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Elden Ring Nightreign (Bandai Namco Entertainment)</li>
<li>Forza Horizon 5 (Microsoft)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered (Microsoft)</li>
<li>MLB: The Show 25 (Sony)</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Doom: The Dark Ages (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (Sony)</li>
<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Minecraft (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Shadows (Ubisoft)</li>
</ol>
<p>Xbox's own top sellers differ slightly from PlayStation's. While once again Elden Ring Nightreign takes the top spot for Microsoft's own consoles, the likes of EA's Split Fiction also made it into the top 10. In fact, only four Microsoft published games made it into the Xbox top 10 last quarter.</p>
<p>To compare, the best 10 selling Xbox games for the last quarter in the US were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Elden Ring Nightreign (Bandai Namco Entertainment)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered (Microsoft)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls Online (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Minecraft (Microsoft)</li>
<li>NBA 2K25 (Take-Two Interactive)</li>
<li>WWE 2K25 (Take-Two Interactive)</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Shadows (Ubisoft)</li>
<li>PGA Tour 2K25 (Take-Two Interactive)</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Split Fiction (EA)</li>
</ol>
<p>Many big Microsoft titles are notably missing from Xbox's own list, including the likes of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, however it is worth noting that both this game and Doom: The Dark Ages are available via Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service.</p>
<p>In an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella noted that Microsoft is now the "top publisher" on both Xbox and PlayStation. The company executive also stated "Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5bn for the first time", adding that the company has 500 million monthly active users across various gaming platforms and devices.</p>
<p>Today's earnings come just weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">over 9000 employees were laid off from the company</a>, which Microsoft told Eurogamer was "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace". While the total number of laid off employees in gaming positions is unknown, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMax MMORPG</a> were cancelled.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Nadella released a statement to say "Microsoft is thriving", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">before the CEO doubled down on the importance of AI</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-games-made-up-most-of-playstations-top-sellers-in-the-us-last-quarter]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q4/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q4 fiscal year 2025 results</a> show that Xbox content and services revenue grew 13% this quarter (12% when considering constant currency). Hardware revenue continues to decline (-22%), but overall gaming revenue is still up 10%. According to Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, the result was driven by 'better-than-expected performance from first-party content and Xbox Game Pass.'</p>



<p>During the subsequent investor call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shared some new milestones, such as the fact that the Game Pass subscription service has nearly reached $5 billion of yearly revenue for the first time since its launch in 2017. Nadella also referenced the fact that Microsoft was the top publisher not only on Xbox but <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-dominates-playstation-q2-top-10-chart-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also on PlayStation</a> this quarter. Lastly, the chief executive officer noted that Xbox has nearly 40 games in development.</p>



<p><em>When it comes to gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. And we are now the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter, with the successful launches of Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. The Call of Duty franchise has never been stronger: 50 million people have played Black Ops 6. Total hours surpassed 2 billion.</em></p>



<p><em>Minecraft saw record monthly active usage and revenue this quarter, thanks in large part to the success of the Minecraft movie. And we have nearly 40 games in development, so much, much more to come. We surpassed over 500 million hours of game play streamed via the cloud this year. And Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time.</em></p>



<p>Microsoft CFO Amy Hood noted, however, that Xbox revenue will likely decline in the first quarter of the next fiscal year due to a tough comparison with the previous year: </p>



<p><em>In Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high single digits. Against a strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid single digits.</em></p>



<p>Xbox Game Studios is about to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-launches-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-pc-on-august-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced</a> on PlayStation 5, no doubt hoping to repeat the excellent results of ports like Forza Horizon 5 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The remaining release schedule for the publisher's calendar year includes Gears of War: Reloaded on August 26, Double Fine's new game Keeper on October 17, Team Ninja's Ninja Gaiden 4 on October 21, and Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 on October 29. There's also Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, although that one is technically published by Activision, which is nevertheless owned by Xbox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was drawn to <em>Dead Take</em> on its teased reveal with my love for psychological horror, love of movies, and a cast of some of my favorite actors from various live action, video game, and actual play content. Getting to sit down and play <em>Dead Take,</em> I was taken on a rollercoaster of emotions, tense relationships, and a veritable 'who's who' of warped power dynamics and relationships.</p>

<p>In <em>Dead Take,</em> the player takes on the role of Vinny Monroe, an actor in Hollywood trying to score his dream role but coming up short due to a number of reasons. After not hearing from your friend, Chase Lowry, who attended a party in the home of renowned producer Duke Cain, you go to investigate.</p>

<p>Arriving at the mansion in the Hollywood Hills, you find the lights on, but no one is home. Letting yourself in, you begin a strange exploration of the house where you'll get to solve puzzles, witness audition footage and screen tests for Cain's latest film, The Last Voyage, and learn what it takes to make it in this warped version of the industry.</p>

<h2>Exploring The Mansion</h2>

<p>This mansion covers three floors of locked rooms and progressive exploration. From the get-go, though, you can explore most of the rooms, interact with some strange objects and letters, and even pick up a few progressive puzzle pieces.</p>

<p>You'll walk and run, but the game doesn't let you do more than that as you're forced to sit with your own thoughts amid tense audio and the sound of your own echoing footsteps. The game will do a lot more to set you on an unsettling edge, teasing you that something might be about to happen, far more than it ever actually scares as you're moving through this space.</p>

It felt a lot like playing a classic Resident Evil title, but more of the mansion exploration and less active antagonists.</p>

<h2>Some Puzzles Were Highlights, Others Were Too Simple</h2>

<p>Puzzles were one of the two core aspects of <em>Dead Take</em> to engage in. From the moment you start the game, it's about figuring out how to get in. You can do this by programming a Fob with a certain frequency based on a sticky note in a drawer and the numbers on the front plate of the house.</p>

<p>There were some really entertaining puzzles, like getting to walk by a grand piano with all kinds of cultish and demonic symbols on it or needing to develop film correctly by bathing it in different chemical solutions.</p>

I had to read pages of the script, including notes from the director, in order to determine the 'correct' setting for the scene. Make sure all of the actors were in place, they had the correct props, and that the camera was angled correctly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there were also a few puzzles that really let me down. I was excited to make it to the pool house and begin picking up different weapons with snake motifs: a Snake Sword, Dagger, Sickle, etc. As I was hypothesizing where they could go or what they could do, I happened across a plaque with four places to put them and a very clear description of what cardinal direction each should point in.</p>

<p>The other major aspect in gameplay, and one that lends to the deeper part of the story, is in collecting footage to watch, and Splaicing that footage. Splaicing is an 'AI' driven editing tool that lets you combine two pieces of footage together automagically.</p>

<p>For the narrative, this meant you could see one scene where Alanah Pearce's Victoria Cross is running her sides of a pivotal scene in the movie, and a second scene of Ben Starr's Chase Lowry doing the same, and combine them to get the full scene's context.</p>

<p>You'll watch footage and combine it for new footage to advance the greater plot of the game.</p>

<p>You can also get a variety of behind-the-scenes footage that honestly doesn't make sense based on the clips you provide the machine, but is interesting nonetheless. It might be Travis Willingham's Harry Dufresne, who plays the captain and love rival in The Last Voyage, candidly telling Vinny that just because he feels a role should be his… doesn't mean it should, and he shouldn't be so quick to use his connections, as it might backfire.</p>

<h2>Surface Story Didn't Do Much, But The Deeper Narrative Was Fascinating</h2>

<p>The surface story didn't do too much for me, it was never entirely clear why Vinny was in that mansion, what had happened to the party members, or why there were terrifying mannequins that were lurking around. Honestly, by the end of it, I wasn't exactly sure what kind of adventure Vinny had been on.</p>

<p>The aspect of the game that fascinated me was the deeper story. About the kind of man Duke Cain was — Producer, Husband, and Father — and how each of the actors in the story used their own power and were abused by each other's power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In talking with<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="81fc54e7-5f6a-4933-8e34-9698b21581bd" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/inside-dead-take-abubakar-salim-explores-fear-fame-and-actors-experience" rel="nofollow"> Narrative Director Abubakar Salim </a>he told me that Video Games were the place to tell this story because it allowed him to present a situation and have others interpret</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeing these audition tapes, learning about the Cain family history through notes around the house, and learning about how everyone was pining to be part of The Last Voyage and were cutthroat to earn their place was an interesting reflection on aspects of the movie industry, but also many creative careers.</p>

<p>Playing as Vinny I could feel his pain for not making the cut and losing the role of the lead man to Chase, but we also got to see how Chase reacted when screening Vinny's phone call, tossing him to the side as an actor without a job.</p>

<p>It shows that even when the entire system is working against you, and is trying to churn you up and spit you out, that if it's something you love, and you feel you were born to do you'll continue to lay everything on the line and even cross some lines to get to where you feel you 'deserve' to be.</p>

Obviously not to the level of horror, but I can understand taking something you love doing and wanting to push to make a larger name for yourself in that field. For me, my ambition and drive have me sitting here and writing this review, but even in the game review and journalism space, I've heard all kinds of stories of abuse of power from those running the companies, to individual writers seeking to propel themselves to spite all others.</p>

<p>How this journey can relate to your own personal story of development, or in what you've seen of major industries, or closer to home,e can really enhance how deep this story is.</p>

<h2><em>Dead Take</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Dead Take </em>was a game that I went into expecting a few good puzzles and a cheap jumpscare or two. In that sense, the game perfectly delivered on my expectations. It did bring something extremely unique to the table in the live action sequences, delivering different sides of a story or a whole picture, letting the player mull over what they've seen and then rediscover it in an altered framework.</p>

<p>The surface story of Vinny in the mansion and his adventures throughout were entertaining gameplay wise, but didn't make as much sense from a narrative perspective. The grander story that it revealed of each of the main characters was one that was truly fascinating to me and will sit with me for a long while to come.</p>

<hr><p><strong><em>Dead Take </em></strong><em>was reviewed on PC via Steam with a copy provided by the Developer over the course of 5 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>
