			<p>A new The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered unofficial patch is now available for download, addressing a huge number of bugs.</p>
<p>The patch, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and requires game version 0.411.140.0, addresses a massive number of issues, including script, quest, NPC, object, item, dialogue bugs, and more. The main goal of the unofficial patch is to eventually fix every bug in Oblivion Remastered that won't be fixed by the developers within the capabilities of the Creation Kit and other community-developed tools. The complete changelog for the latest version of the unofficial patch can be found <a href="https://www.afkmods.com/Unofficial%20Oblivion%20Remastered%20Patch%20Version%20History.html">here.</a></p>
<p>As the game still uses the original's Gamebryo engine, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered features the usual selection of bugs and issues that have become tradition for Bethesda games. Even with these bugs and performance issues on PC, the remaster of the fourth entry in the beloved series is a more than worthy purchase for any role-playing game fan, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Enhancing the original where it mattered most while preserving what made it truly unique, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered stands as the definitive way to experience Bethesda’s classic. Although the shift in atmosphere and noticeable performance issues will put some players off, as will the dated gameplay, the game couldn't have debuted on current gaming platforms in a better way.</em></p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-another-trailer/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> has been delayed from its Fall 2025 release window, and will now launch next year on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Today, Rockstar Games confirmed on <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1918265468076605706?t=Px5bjAPYlpMHJab6nnPEdQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> the highly anticipated new entry in the series will not launch this year as expected, and will now release on May 26, 2026 worldwide on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. While apologizing to fans for launching the game later than expected, the developer highlighted how their goal has always been to try and exceed their exceptions and with Grand Theft Auto VI, they want to do no different. As such, extra development time is required to reach the quality that players expect and deserve. More information on the game will be shared soon, so hopefully another look at the game won't take too long.</p>
<p>While it is disappointing to learn that Grand Theft Auto VI will not be released later this year on consoles, it is most definitely not that surprising. Considering their long history of delays, it would have been more surprising for Rockstar Games not to delay what is going to be, regardless, the biggest entertainment launch of all time to date, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">analysts</a>.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on May 26, 2026. We will update you as soon as Rockstar Games shares more information, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

That’s all now thrown for a loop, with the game now set to be released on May 26, 2026.</p><p>“We are very sorry that this is later than you expected,” Rockstar <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1918265468076605706&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1918265468076605706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted to X</a></span>. “The interest and excitement surrounding a new <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.”</p><p>Delays at this stage are not unusual, as teams take stock and realize that another half a year isn’t going to be enough to get the game ready for launch. But given <em>GTA 6</em> has been in development for many years already, it does take on rather more significance. Not least for Rockstar owners Take Two, whose shares took a sharp pre-market dip in the minutes following the announcement, losing over nine percent.</p><p>“With every game we have released,” Rockstar’s statement continues, “the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.”</p><p>Take Two Interactive, via 2K, already have quite a busy fall, with <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> due, alongside the likes of <em>NBA 2K26.</em>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-date-moved-up-gta-6-2k-randy-pitchford-1851778271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-date-moved-up-gta-6-2k-randy-pitchford-1851778271"><em>Borderlands 4 </em>has only just moved it own release date ahead 11 days</a></span>, fueling much speculation that it might be moving out of the way of <em>GTA 6</em>. We now of course know this is definitely not the case, but could have been an early sign of the publisher rearranging things ahead of the announcement.</p><p>This delay will have enormous implications across the entire industry, given the wide expectation that the game will sell record-breaking numbers of copies. Not releasing ahead of the holidays will likely hit console sales extremely hard, given <em>GTA 6</em> will be a game many are waiting for before upgrading to the current generation. It will also be a real blow for physical gaming stores.</p><p>Still, for the regular player, these delays might suck, but are invariably good news in the end. A finished game later on is always better than a broken one earlier. But gosh, this remains a seismic announcement that’ll ripple across the whole gaming industry.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Rockstar has delayed the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> to 2026.
</p>
<p>
The highly-anticipated sequel will now arrive on 26th May 2026, Rockstar announced today in a short statement. 
</p>
<p>"Hi everyone, Grand Theft Auto 6 is now set to release on 26th May, 2026," the company wrote in a statement shared via social media.</p>
<p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p>
<p>"With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.</p>
<p>"We look forward to sharing more information with you soon. Sincerely, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>."</p>

<p>Today's news comes ahead of parent company Take-Two's next financial results briefing, set for 15th May, and days after Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-not-the-reason-for-borderlands-4-release-date-change-randy-pitchford-insists">Borderlands 4's recent launch date change was nothing to do with any other game</a>.
</p>
<p>No other information was announced by Rockstar today - and there's certainly no sign of a new GTA 6 trailer. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">Rockstar released GTA 6's first - and so far only - look at the game back in December 2023</a>, at which point it was set for launch this year.</p>
<p>Rockstar's confirmation of a delay follows months of speculation over whether the game would still make its 2025 launch window, despite assurances from Take-Two that the game was still on track. 
</p>
<p>In November 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">GTA 6's publisher insisted the game would arrive in autumn 2025</a> despite whispers of a delay, something it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">doubled down upon again just a few months back</a> in February.</p>
<p>"This calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for [Take-Two], as we plan to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February, Mafia: The Old Country in the summer, Grand Theft Auto 6 in the fall, and Borderlands 4," the publisher noted in a now-outdated earnings report. </p>
<p>And just a month ago, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-date-is-still-secret-because-take-two-boss-wants-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-excitement">the publisher was still keeping the GTA 6 date close to its chest to "maintain the anticipation and the excitement"</a>. Still, reading back through his comments now, there is a suggestion of caution around announcing a firm date too early. Here's what he said:</p>
<p>"We do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand, and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation," Zelnick noted.</p>
<p>The delay is at least good news for other games hesitant to lock down a launch date towards the tail end of 2025. Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">EA boss Andrew Wilson previously said the company would be willing to delay its next Battlefield</a> - currently expected to release before April 2026 - if "some things happening in the year" meant that "wasn't a great window for us".</p>
<p>Sony, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-announced">waited until last week to confirm an October launch date for Ghost of Yōtei</a>, likely its biggest PlayStation launch for the year. Its hard to imagine the company did that without knowing the game would not clash with Rockstar's behemoth.</p>
<p>Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta6-active-development-now-well-underway-rockstar-says">first confirmed GTA 6 development was "well underway" back in 2022</a>, following reporting that stated the game's initial scope had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-grand-theft-auto-6-plans-reportedly-featured-four-protagonists-and-three-cities">pared back to allow for a smoother development and the ability to grow the game's world post-launch</a>.</p>

            <p>Survival hellscape <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rust">Rust</a> has added a tropical jungle biome to its procedurally generated maps, the biggest change to the landscape of the game in nine years. It'll appear close to where new players spawn and hides a number of threats and fun. Poisonous snakes will skitter through the undergrowth and riverside crocs will chew your face given the chance. There are ruins and temples hidden among the trees, housing some basic loot. And you can swing from vines, perhaps inspiring a whole new life in the canopy. Probably for the best, considering there are now tigers and panthers stalking the ground below.</p>

</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0BHMuwU4Nk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Developers Facepunch detailed all the changes in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/252490/view/498319683381887523">update post on Steam</a>. Maps are still procedurally generated (they've been this way since the nudist murder sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-new-version-review">moved to Unity 5 in 2016</a>) but until now maps have been basically a mix of arctic, temperate, and desert biomes. So this does seem a significant new addition to the deadly dog-eat-dog dangerzone. </p>
<p>To help out with that, there are two new weapons: a boomerang that returns to the player, and a blowpipe "for those who enjoy causing problems quietly." It can be loaded up with different types of dart ammo, including an "incapacitate" dart that slows its victims and obscures their vision for a time. Or a "radiation" dart that simply stacks radioactive ill-health onto your foe. Hideous behaviour, and not one bit surprising for Rust. The new wildlife sounds equally brutal. </p>

</figure>
<p>"The tiger may be the deadliest animal you'll ever encounter [in] Rust," say the devs. "It closes in extremely slowly from behind, and only strikes when it's sure to kill. A moment of inattention in the jungle is all it takes."</p>
<p>To make sure that enemy's AI doesn't feel "unfair and bullshit," the animal will have a set of cues that you have to watch and listen for while roaming the fern-ridden floor. "It'll be on you to experiment and discover those hidden signals."</p>
<p>The overgrown temples (an ancient ziggurat, for example) will hide some mysteries, we're told. And slightly less weathered ruins will contain "low-tier supplies and maybe even a few surprises tucked away". The place is also a botanist's delight, from the sounds of things.</p>
<p>"The jungle biome features a large variety of completely new foliage," they say. "This includes new types of bushes, such as bromeliads and monstera. New undergrowth plants like arrowroot and calathea. As well as [a] variety of new trees like trumpet trees, jungle palms and sandbox trees. The biggest of them all are enormous kapok trees that you will be able to climb and swing from." </p>

</figure>
<p>There's a bunch of other stuff accompanying the update (here's the <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/news/jungle-update">full patch notes</a>), including beefing up of servers, and a DLC pack with an Aztec-flavoured AK-47. If only Moctezuma had had one of these... </p>
<p>I'm not going back to Rust, even with all this lush-looking leaf rendering. I haven't visited its randogen den of misdeeds in over a decade, when I chronicled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-diary">a nine-life misadventure</a> with its chaotic players. But even I can see the game has changed a huge amount since then, adding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-adds-boasts">boats</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusts-next-dlc-pack-adds-pools-tubes-and-water-guns">water pistols</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-has-submarines-spearguns-and-sharks-now">submarines</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusts-new-instruments-dlc-lets-you-shred-the-shovel-bass">musical instruments</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-now-has-npcs-who-can-give-you-missions">NPC quest-givers</a>, and even - oh my god - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-is-finally-adding-backpacks-to-kick-off-its-second-decade">backpacks</a>. No wonder it remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a>. If you're made of sturdier stuff than I, this could be a good time to go camping. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But, according to the publisher of Clair Obscur, not only did Oblivion <em>not</em> harm Clair Obscur, Clair Obscur actually benefitted from Oblivion’s release because it boosted excitement for the RPG genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So says Kepler Interactive’s senior portfolio manager Matt Handrahan, who told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a> all about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s launch success against the odds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some background. RPG fans were faced with the difficult choice between spending hundreds of hours in Oblivion’s Cyrodiil, or embarking on an expedition to take down the Paintress in Clair Obscur. The launch of the two games in the same week provoked both joyful and frustrated reactions from RPG fans, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-acknowledges-the-barbenheimer-energy-of-releasing-the-same-week-as-oblivion-remastered">a cheeky comment from Kepler Interactive itself</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an X/Twitter post, Kepler shared an edited image of the characters from Clair Obscur walking into an Oblivion Gate, with the text "omg its like barbenheimer" in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/internet-embraces-barbenheimer-memes-mashups-more"><u>humorous nod to the simultaneous release of the films Barbie and Oppenheimer in theatres on the same day in 2023</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">omg its like barbenheimer <a href="https://t.co/TN1AFzdggc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TN1AFzdggc</a></p>— Kepler Interactive (@Kepler_Interact) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kepler_Interact/status/1914703225652945047?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft, which owns Oblivion developer Bethesda and which had heavily backed Clair Obscur since its reveal at an Xbox Showcase last year, also came under fire for shadow-dropping Oblivion on top of Clair Obscur, with both games being Game Pass day-one titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, according to Handrahan, there was nothing to worry about. “We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity,” Handrahan said. “When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur has become a big hit for Keplar and its French developer, Sandfall Interactive, selling over 1 million copies in just three days and posting impressive concurrent player numbers on Steam. It’s done so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/french-president-macron-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-for-creating-one-of-the-best-rated-games-in-history">French President Macron has praised the development team</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has announced Oblivion Remastered has seen over 4 million players since launch, but hasn’t announced a sales figure. It too has seen big Steam concurrent player numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Business quoted data from Ampere that shows 35% of Clair Obscur players also played Oblivion remastered, which means there was significant overlap. A lot of that has to do with both games launching in Game Pass, with the overlap percentage dropping for Steam and PlayStation 5 players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Oblivion Remastered, including a report on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-player-escapes-the-confines-of-cyrodiil-to-explore-valenwood-skyrim-and-even-hammerfell-the-rumored-setting-of-the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>a player who managed to escape the confines of Cyrodiil to explore Valenwood, Skyrim, and even Hammerfell, the rumored setting of The Elder Scrolls VI</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've also got a comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil"><u>Interactive Map</u></a>, complete Walkthroughs for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Main_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>Main Questline</u></a> and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Guilds"><u>Guild Quest</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Character_Building_Guide"><u>How to Build the Perfect Character</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Things_to_Do_First_in_Oblivion"><u>Things to Do First</u></a>, every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/PC_Cheats_and_Console_Commands"><u>PC Cheat Code</u></a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Clair Obscur, be sure to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33/Tips_-_Things_Clair_Obscur_Doesn't_Tell_You"><u>check out our tips for the important things to know before </u></a>heading into the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-are-so-chill-about-skyblivion-that-theyre-promoting-it-in-oblivion-remastered-videos<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content" data-component="article-header">
  

        <p>Oblivion remaster art lead is "excited to see their interpretation"</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> is theoretically terrible news for the creators of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, a long-in-development mod that recreates Bethesda's 2006 RPG in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> engine. On the one hand, you could argue that the official comeback care of Virtuos Studios renders Skyblivion unnecessary. On the other, there's the usual worry that Bethesda's intellectual property lawyers are going to erupt from the toilets like radioactive rats and eat the modders alive.</p>
<p>The Skyblivion crew professed themselves undaunted by the news, however. "This always was a passion project and still is until the end," modder KRebel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-get-twice-the-amount-of-oblivion-this-year-says-skyblivion-modder-undeterred-by-official-remaster">insisted last week</a>. "For the community its a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year." And Bethesda have now met them with open arms by not only declining to sue the pants off Skyblivion for intellectual property infringement, but handing the modders keys for the official remaster and even going on camera to say that they're looking forward to Skyblivion's release.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Even though I worked on Oblivion Remastered, I'm still excited for Skyblivion," art and development lead Dan Lee comments in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_vxm8svHko">video</a>, as noticed by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesda-gives-full-throated-shout-out-to-skyblivion-fan-remake-after-giving-the-whole-dev-team-free-oblivion-remastered-keys-i-think-what-theyre-doing-is-very-special/">Passable Crumpet Gamer</a>. "I think what they're doing is very special, and I'm excited to see their interpretation of what we've done in the past. I think it's a great year for Oblivion fans." In case there was any lingering ambiguity about Bethesda's goodwill, the video closes with some footage of the mod.</p>
<p>The Skyblivion team are naturally very happy about this. "Dan, we're just as excited to get Skyblivion into your hands this year as you are to play it!" they <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skyblivion.com/post/3lo4pnqtszs2h">write on Bluesky</a>. "Thanks for the shout-out and kind words."</p>
<p>All this is being greeted online as a rare dollop of wholesome vibes from publishers that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/28/17511658/bethesda-lawsuits-fallout-elder-scrolls-prey">have launched their fair share of legal action over copyright infringement</a>. At the risk of being a Cyrodiil Cynic and/or Daedra Downer, I think it could be a mixture of genuine benevolence and Bethesda calculating that Skyblivion poses no real commercial threat to the Oblivion remaster at this juncture, and that being nice to the modders is great publicity. See also: this news post. If only Take Two Interactive thought the same of people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike">trying to recreate GTA 6 in the GTA 5 engine</a>. </p>
<p>Regardless, I am interested to compare the visuals of Skyblivion and the official remaster, particularly given James's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">conclusions about the latter's performance</a>, and Nic's comments in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review">Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered review</a> about how the extra graphicsability only emphasises Oblivion's capacity for silliness. As he puts it: "by whacking up the verisimilitude dial, by making you believe that much more in every flickering flame or dancing shadow or rapturous sunrise, everything that actually occurs in Cyrodiil becomes that much stupider."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has congratulated Sandfall Interactive for its new RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, calling it a "shining example of French audacity and creativity".</p>
<p>Sandfall's game released last week to widespread acclaim. It sold 500k copies in its first day, which then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">grew to 1m copies within three days</a>.</p>
<p>"1m copies and to date, one of the best-rated games in history: and yes, it's French!" Macron wrote in a reply to the studio on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJHKCJyNVZ_/?igsh=a2ZyZWJsYncxejBr&amp;img_index=1">Instagram</a> (Google translated). "Congratulations to Sandfall Interactive and all the creators of Expedition 33. You are a shining example of French audacity and creativity."</p>

<p>The game's account replied in turn with the only acceptable response: a baguette emoji.</p>
<p>"We hope you've enjoyed spotting the nods to our home country throughout," the original post reads.</p>
<p>Despite being set in a surreal and painterly fantasy world, Clair Obscur is filled with silly French references: from battling mimes, to stripy outfits, a twisted version of the Eiffel Tower, and a fair amount of swearing in French.</p>

<p>The game released in the same week as Bethesda surprise-dropped Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. Yet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-oblivion-surprise-release-didnt-seem-to-harm-clair-obscur-expedition-33-success-publisher-says">Clair Obscur publisher Kepler noted that hasn't harmed sales</a>.</p>
<p>"Proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all," said Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan. "In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre."</p>
<p>"Outstanding artwork and glorious combat bring Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's bold, painterly world to life," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p>
<p>Macron's comment recognising the success of a video game is also a welcome u-turn after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-clarifies-view-on-video-games-after-blaming-them-for-riots">he previously blamed the culture around the medium for riots in the summer of 2023</a>. He later clarified on social media he "always considered that video games are an opportunity for France, for our youth and its future, for our jobs and our economy".</p>
<p>"I expressed my concerns at the end of June because video game codes had been used by offenders to trivialise violence on social networks," he added. "It is this violence that I condemn, not video games."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>A fresh update roadmap for historical 4X game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> has been shared, alongside fresh information for the game’s first premium DLC, Untold Scenarios.</p>
<p>Oxide Games won’t be going it alone in supporting the game going forward, though, as Stardock Entertainment (best known for Galactic Civilizations and publishing Sins of the Solar Empire) is assuming production management. Oxide is still lead developer on the title, and the game is still being published by Xbox Game Studios, but this is a rejig of the game’s ongoing support, with Stardock having already collaborated with Oxide in the run up to release in September 2024 and through post-launch updates since then.</p>


<p>“With our decades of experience in delivering high-quality strategy games, Stardock is uniquely equipped to lead development on future content for Ara: History Untold,” said Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock Entertainment and Oxide Games. “By listening closely to players, we’ll elevate the game’s history-defining potential for players everywhere.”</p>
<p>On the roadmap, May and June will build up to Version 1.4 (with a preview build), which will bring warfare updates, AI improvements in several areas, performance optimisation and more.</p>
<p>June will also see the paid Untold Stories DLC release with with new scenarios, maps, events, amenities, and technologies.</p>

<p>Looking further ahead, this summer will bring Version 2.0 with more significant overhauls.</p>

<p>Ara: History Untold is one of a number of historical 4X titles that have sprung up to challenge Civilization – especially looking to launch ahead of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/14/civilization-7-review/">Civ 7</a> – each introducing their own twist on how to deal with the passage of time. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/ara-history-untold-review/">our review</a>, I said, “Ara: History Untold is another distinctive take on the historical 4X strategy genre, putting a real emphasis on furthering your nation, managing supply chains and resources, and shifting the focus away from warring mentality it’s so easy to sink into. There’s room to grow, but this is a strong contender.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blades-of-fire-free-copies-to-be-given-away-at-london-comic-con-%E2%80%93-if-you%E2%80%99re-celebrating-your-steel-wedding.1179417/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-free-copies-to-be-given-away-at-london-comic-con-if-youre-celebrating-your-steel-wedding/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blades of Fire publisher 505 Games announced a rather unusual offer. They'll be giving away free digital copies of the game (presumably handing out redeemable codes) at London Comic-Con in three weeks, on Friday, May 23. There's a pretty big caveat, though: you have to be celebrating your Steel Wedding (11-year) anniversary on May 22. That means you only get a free copy if you were married on May 22, 2014, and can bring a wedding certificate (or copy/photo) attesting to this.</p>
<p>The seemingly arbitrary date is obviously a reference to <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's launch date</a>, set for May 22, 2025 on PC (only <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/blades-of-fire-f8178f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Epic Games Store</a>, at least for now), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game will be priced at $59.99, although there's a 10% pre-order discount available now on PC and Xbox. PlayStation users can also get the same discount, but only if they have an active PlayStation Plus subscription. As a side note, if you want to play on PC but don't have a good enough hardware (the system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are fairly demanding</a>), the game will be playable via cloud <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-get-doom-the-dark-ages-blades-of-fire-and-more-in-may/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through NVIDIA GeForce NOW</a>.</p>
<p>Blades of Fire had a relatively short marketing period, having been revealed only in late February. However, MercurySteam has shared many details on the action/adventure game since. The title is set in a fantasy world where the evil queen Nerea has magically turned everyone's steel into stone, making it impossible to challenge her rule. However, protagonist Aran de Lira receives a unique hammer that isn't affected by the curse and sets out on a journey to take her down.</p>
<p>Forging weapons is, therefore, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-will-focus-strictly-on-weapons-and-your-skills-instead-of-magic-and-rpg-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a big part of the game</a>. Not only are there seven weapon families and 30 Forge Scrolls, but even the choice of materials will greatly influence the crafted weapon, leading to many different combinations. It will be up to the player to choose the right tool for the job, too, as weapons can have wildly different efficiencies depending on the enemy's armor. With over 50 enemy types, players will have to keep track of each one's strengths and weaknesses. The combat system also lets players attack specific body parts.</p>
<p>MercurySteam also <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-narrative-driven-game-where-you-decide-how-much-you-want-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Blades of Fire is narrative-driven. At the same time, players will decide how much they want to know about the story. One way to do that is by engaging in dialogue with Aran's companion, the young scholar Adso de Zelk, who is something of a human encyclopedia.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-a-pleasant-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going hands-on with the game at GDC 2025</a>, Kai Tatsumoto was quite interested in the final game:</p>
<p><em>MercurySteam’s strange AA blacksmithing adventure wasn’t on my radar before going to GDC after missing the initial preview event, but after going hands-on for an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised with their latest unique IP. It’s just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven’t seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I’d still be on board for crafting a massive warhammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies.</em></p>
<p>By the way, a new Blades of Fire trailer will go live later today during Future Game Show's Gamescom LATAM edition. We'll update this story once it is available.</p>

The Photo Of God is not an especially brilliant game, but it is a game I keep thinking about. It's a spooky, throwaway interactive epistle from the evidently self-deprecating Serious Daniel, in which you play a photographer standing on a rooftop in a flooded city, under a low, funereal sun. The photographer decides he is going to snap a picture of God. To do this, he must first take pictures of birds that form a breadcrumb trail around the rooftop and through an abandoned building, lit by blazing oil drums. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's not clear whether the abandoned building is the same one you start on. There appear to be several floors but, perhaps due to the fade-outs when you enter the stairs, it feels more like you're repeatedly traversing one hallway, with objects shuffling around behind your back. It makes sense that a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a> about the joy and hubris of photographing a deity would complicate the notion of ascending or descending, that it would feel innately purgatorial. For every photograph you take, the photographer rambles to himself a little about beauty and divinity.
</p>
<p>
The birds, meanwhile, spawn one after the other, each cycling the same animation of cocking its head and pecking at the lurid, featureless environment. They appear indifferent to your presence until you snap a photo, using right-click to aim through the lens. Then, there's another fade-to-black and the sound of flapping wings and when the blackness lifts, the bird has vanished. You could call the inability to watch it fly away evidence of limited technical expertise or resources, but again, these crude ruptures feel appropriate. Cameras cut the world to pieces, whereas godhood is (going by the Judeo-Christian concepts I grew up with) continuous, all-pervading. Even when not seeking deliberately to visualise the deity, snapping a photograph is chopping God's body apart.
</p>
<p>
The game lasts a handful of minutes. You will probably guess at the rough nature of conclusion. If you can't, there's a picture of it right there on <a href="https://danieloschepkov.itch.io/the-photo-of-god">the Itch.io page</a>. The Photo Of God is no extended philosophical treatise, but a whimsical modelling of feelings of cosmic dread and presumption that are already perfectly encapsulated by the title alone. There may be a lot more to it or not much at all - I leave that for you to determine. It's free to download.</p>
<p>I keep thinking about the game because you could take the concept and apply it to any vaguely agnostic game with camera mechanics, and it'd be transformative. Imagine if, say, Ubisoft updated callous Clancy fest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands">Ghost Recon: Wildlands</a> with a bonus Steam achievement labelled "take a photo of God", with no guidance about what is meant here by God, no actual unlock parameters, and no other changes to the game. Just throw that one out there for the completionists to anguish over, while they're synching headshots. 
</p>
<p>
I'm not religious, as you may guess, but I would spend many enchanted hours in such a game attempting to conceive and envisage godhood through drone feeds, sniper scopes, and the game's own Photo Mode. I would also enjoy reading threads of other people striving to do likewise, according to their own modellings of divinity. We don't need to wait for that Steam achievement. We can start the ball rolling here.

The initial hype has peaked, and bloated prices are falling fast. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t just the usual post-release cooldown, it's a mix of wider stock availability and Pokébro investors moving on, making it far more affordable to pick up cards individually rather than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-1-2025">gambling on overpriced sealed boxes</a> (no matter how appealing that is!). Here's why buying singles could be the smart move for collectors in the US right now.</p><p id="tldr-japanese-single-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TL;DR: Japanese Single Cards">TL;DR: Single Card Prices Are Crashing</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just look at the current value of Japanese booster boxes for The Glory of Team Rocket set, more than double the shelf price right now. We haven't seen overpricing like this since 151, but I think we're looking at the light at the end of the tunnel for stock <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundle-shining-fates-amazon-restock-latest">shortages of Pokémon TCG</a> worldwide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Team Rocket's <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3m5W?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mewtwo ex SIR for example</a>; sold listing were at the $500 mark starting 20th April, which has nose dived down to around $370.77 over the past couple of days. A strong start when it comes to market correction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGlk8?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Moltres ex SIR</a>, going from a few sales at around $250 to $163.

Not bad. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-30-2025">These price drops</a> happening sooner shows us that more scalpers are leaving our hobby, which means <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-25-2025">artificial bloating on release is down.</a></p><p id="most-affordable"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Most Affordable">Most Affordable Team Rocket Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not all about the ridiculously expensive chase cards however, with Glory of Team Rocket's Super Rare ex and Hyper Rare ex variants looking stunning. These cards are usually over looked in each set, which is great for trainers like me and you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, we can see that it's not just us thinking this with certain cards like <a href="https://zdcs.link/98LwDL?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Mewtwo Super Rare ex</a>, which has climbed in value by $6 and change since release to $38.75. Following Journey Together's artstyle of the full color Pokémon with an outline of their trainer in the background, these cards are worth snapping up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe it's just a Mewtwo thing? <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEjZ0y?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Nidoking Super Rare ex</a> is performing as expected, dropping from $26 with some stability at $12.94. it's an iconic card for generation one fans and watchers of the first season of the Pokémon anime, not to mention it looks more menacing than Brock with a frying pan. This is one of those cards to buy now and watch it climb down the road, the same goes for Moltres and Crowbat.</p><p id="best-trainer-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Trainer Cards">Best Team Rocket Trainer Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-game-sale-switch-2-woot">peak nostalgia here from generation one</a> and two here, specifically Giovanni and Ariana. The former being the don of Team Rocket who players take down in Kanto, and Ariana serving as the second interim boss of Team Rocket in Johto. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's not much data on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXZqA?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giovanni 129/098 right now</a>, but it features Team Rocket's leadership alongside the boss himself. It's likely to hold it's value at around the $17 mark, so if it comes up cheaper, grab it. A rule of thumb with this set; if it's Giovanni or Mewtwo, expect to pay out of your nose for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aN4vWV?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Ariana 128/098</a> is a stunning artwork variant of the standard trainer art, sporting prices between $17 and $18 and rightly so. Again, the set hasn't been out long enough to judge the value of this card properly, but any listing for under $18 is a good deal right now.</p><p id="best-art-rares"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Art Rares">Best Team Rocket Art Rares</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the best artwork in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youll-save-more-buying-single-paldean-fates-pokmon-cards">Scarlet and Violet era</a> belongs to illustration rares and art rares. They're cheap and look amazing, easily some of the most slept on cards in the TCG. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">If you're looking for your collection to span binders</a>, grow in value and look good whilst doing it? This is the way forward for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming in higher than most right now is Team Rocket's Meowth 109/098, sitting at around $19.25 at the time of writing. That's a fall of nearly $20 from the launch of The Glory of Team Rocket, which is to be expected so close to launch. But the link to this Pokémon and Team Rocket is iconic to say the least (Where the hell is Jesse and James in this set?). It looks like this card is still crashing, so anything below the $20 mark is an awesome deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some reason, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmXrE3?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blaziken 101/098</a> is crashing card right now. This artwork is incredible, showing off exactly why this generation three starter Pokémon is a fan favorite. These are usually all traits that go into a Pokémon card having a nice climb, which tells me this is a card to snap up rigt now. It's even playable thanks to it's Infernal Legs attacks, dealing 120 damage to your opponents active Pokémon and another 120 damage to a benched Pokémon. This card could literally snag a trainer two prize cards in one move, which is another reason why it should be worth more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you really want to open boosters of The Glory of Team Rocket despite the price tags and five card count of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-japanese-pokmon-tcg">Japanese packs</a>, go for it. But there's some serious bargains to be had on single cards. Just to note, pricing mentioned in this article are correct at the time of writing. Also, stock may go in and out due to TCG Player being a live secondary marketplace. But that's what makes it fun, right?

But their latest breakthrough is perhaps the greatest yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tom, aka <a href="https://ko-fi.com/warhammerworkshop" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Workshop</a>, the modder behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/massive-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-mod-adds-lore-accurate-classes-a-weapon-previously-locked-to-campaign-and-even-new-operations"><u>Space Marine 2’s excellent Astartes Overhaul</u></a>, signaled the release of 12-player co-op this week and it looks fantastic. Gameplay footage shows multiple players taking on a Tyranid Trygon Prime in a battle reminiscent of an MMO boss fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is not something players thought possible, given vanilla Space Marine 2 supports up to three-player co-op only. But the modding team has not only broken through that barrier to hit 12-player co-op — with the support of developer Saber Interactive itself — but has a grand ambition to turn Space Marine 2 into something even better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Honestly, I’m just kind of in awe of Saber’s support for the modding community,” Tom told IGN. “None of us expected 12-player PvE sessions to be possible this soon — but somehow, here we are. Thanks to their generosity and trust, this huge leap forward is finally here, and it completely changes what we can do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that the mod available right now is just a test — a test that works well, but a test nonetheless. 12-player co-op makes a mockery of Space Marine 2's PvE balance, which you'd expect given there are nine more players taking on the Tyranids and the Thousand Sons than Saber designed the encounters for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But with 12-player now unlocked, modders are building add-ons to make the most of it. Tom told IGN the team is working on modes such as prop hunt, PvP inside operations, “massive” horde mode updates for when the official horde mode finally launches, and, perhaps most exciting of all, raid-style missions “with bosses that hit like trucks, take proper teamwork to bring down, as well as some other completely new mechanics.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 modding has grown into a significant community, with some 20,000 tinkerers in the main Discord server.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As both a modder and a player, it’s hard not to be excited,” Tom continued. “Huge credit as always to the Saber team for not just making all this possible, but continuing to drop amazing content of their own too, without any of the usual predatory battle-pass nonsense we take for granted in modern titles.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/01/sm2-1746137803550.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Could this 12-player Space Marine 2 mod give us an idea of what to expect from Space Marine 3?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an exciting time for Space Marine 2 generally, with the aforementioned horde mode coming soon, a new class in the works, and of course more Operations maps and weapons. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-8-detailed-horde-mode-mechanics-and-map-revealed">Saber recently detailed Patch 8</a>, confirmed some horde mode mechanics, and revealed the map it’s set on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive"><u>Space Marine 3 is officially in development, too,</u></a> which is no surprise given just how well Space Marine 2 has done. And I'm left wondering whether this 12-player co-op mod might give us an indication of what to expect from the sequel. When Space Marine 3 was announced, we were told to expect "large-scale battles that are even more spectacular." That sounds a lot like upping the co-op player count limit to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until we find out, modders will be around to keep things fresh and interesting, and this latest effort is a perfect example of just that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/sea-of-stars-free-throes-of-the-watchmaker-dlc-ticks-to-release-in-may/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Already one of the most celebrated RPGs of recent years, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a> is set to get a big new DLC adventure for free next month. Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker will arrive on 20th May as a free upgrade across all platforms – PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker DLC | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgFi2jXwzVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Throes of the Watchmaker expands on the inventor known as the Watchmaker that you meet through the main adventure of Sea of Stars. Architect of the Clockwork Castle and the creator of the tabletop game Wheels within this world, he’s now gone and created a miniature clockwork world known as Horloge, which is being threatened by a cursed carnival. So you have to go and get all Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and miniaturise Zale and Valere to delve into this world and put an end to this evil plight.</p>
<p>Through the expansion, Zale and Valere will have a self-contained progression built around completely new classes, skills and combos. Zale will become a skilful juggler, while Valere transforms into an acrobat, fighting alongside new playable party member, the last-wielding sharpshooter Artificer.</p>
<p>As well as having new areas, puzzles and enemies, Sabotage has been able to lavish Throes of the Watchmaker with a cinematics budget equivalent to the main game, so expect some super pretty cutscenes!</p>

<p>Not only that, but the soundtrack will also feature more original songs by guest composer Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger), working alongside lead composer Eric W. Brown.</p>
<p>One of the best indie games of 2023, we had plenty of praise for the homage to classic JRPGs. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/31/sea-of-stars-review-a-love-letter-to-jrpgs-of-the-past/">Sea of Stars review</a>, Nic said, “Sea of Stars has clearly been made by people with a deep and abiding love of JRPGs. That level of passion is hard to mimic, and the result is a heavily playable game with morish visuals, a cracking story and deeply considered level design. However, while it is very good, it isn’t quite perfect. Combat needed to be deeper (or at least escapable) and while the dynamism was a great touch, it wasn’t enough to carry it all the way through to the end.”</p>
<p>The game has been well supported over the past year and a half with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/sea-of-stars-free-dawn-of-equinox-update-adds-local-co-op-and-more/">major updates</a> that have overhauled combat, revamped the prologue and added local co-op play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valves-invite-only-deadlock-has-an-even-more-exclusive-top-secret-hush-hush-build<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Everyone's now heard of Deadlock, the in-development MOBA from Half-Life maker Valve. Maybe you're even playing it, as part of the game's still-invite-only alpha playtest.
</p>
<p>
But are you playing the top-secret even more invite-only version? Probably not. (Although if you are, feel free to get in touch.)
</p>
<p>
The existence of an even more elusive version of Deadlock was spilled publicly last night when a top Deadlock streamer appeared to load up the wrong version of the game, beaming Valve's more-exclusive version to the world. 
</p>
<p>
This version of Deadlock includes a much larger character roster, as well as updated designs for some of the game's current heroes. New faces include the bellhop-styled Doorman, bespectacled Bookworm, and gothic Vampirebat, among many others. 
</p>
<p>
The streamer in question quickly shut down the game and deleted its archived version - but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kclj5p/streamer_accidentally_leaks_hero_roster_of_a_more/">not before the internet inevitably took screenshots</a>.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kclj5p/streamer_accidentally_leaks_hero_roster_of_a_more/">Streamer accidentally leaks hero roster of a more "secret" private Deadlock pre-alpha playtest build</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/atahutahatena/">u/atahutahatena</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

Deathlock has been in early playtesting now for over a year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">leaks happening pretty much ever since</a>. Valve attempted to keep the game a secret for as long as possible, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">ultimately dropped its confidentiality requirement last August</a>, when a Steam page for the game finally appeared. 
</p>
<p>
Since then, though, Valve has simply kept working on Deadlock (and seemingly multiple versions) in the background, keeping the game invite-only. When will it publicly launch? There's still no word.
</p>
<p>
Matt Cox previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadlocks-biggest-update-yet-marks-a-threshold-moment-nows-the-time-to-grab-yourself-an-invite">checked out Deathlock for Eurogamer</a> back in February this year, and noted how a recent update felt "like a huge leap towards Deadlock's full release, but there's still plenty of time to go, as Valve makes a great game even greater".

            <p>The surprise release of Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered hasn't impacted the sales of French JRPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, its publisher has said.</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive's game was released last week from publisher Kepler and with support from Xbox, but some feared any success would be overshadowed by the Oblivion release that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">leaked ahead of time</a>.</p>
<p>However, Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan has drawn a distinction between the two games, adding "proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all".</p>

<p>"We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity," Handrahan told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls">The Game Business</a>. "When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</p>
<p>"Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre."</p>
<p>According to data from Ampere, there's a 35 percent crossover between the two RPGs. On Xbox in particular - the number one platform for both games - 55 percent of Clair Obscur players also played Oblivion. Both games were available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p>
<p>This crossover percentage drops to 22 percent for Steam players, and 16 percent on PS5. However, average playtime on Xbox has been lower - likely due to players dipping in on Game Pass.</p>

<p>Handrahan revealed Kepler didn't sign Clair Obscur straight away, but could see the potential of its battle system.</p>
<p>"My CEO, Alexis Garavaryan, had the most contact with them at [an early stage]," said Handrahan. "He saw the potential in it, but thought there were still some parts that needed a little bit more work. So Sandfall went away, did that work, came back, and on the second time of seeing it, our response was extremely, extremely quick."</p>
<p>When another publisher started looking at the game, Kepler had already snapped it up. "We were straight on top of it," said Handrahan. "If you find a game you like, if you find a game that excites you, you really have to act quickly. There's a lot of good games, but the really remarkable stuff comes along relatively rarely."</p>
<p>He also spoke to the game's promotion during Xbox's Summer Showcase alongside the likes of AAA first party games Gears of War and Fable. "It helped us to kind of claim this AA territory in a much more confident way," said Handrahan. "Because it's a vague space that exists somewhere between small games and extremely big games, and there's a lot of ground that that covers."</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 hit 500,000 sales in just one day, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">quickly rose to a million copies in three days</a>.</p>
<p>"Outstanding artwork and glorious combat bring Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's bold, painterly world to life," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Earlier this week, Moon Studios released the big Breach update for its game No Rest for the Wicked. In early access since May 2024, the action role-playing game received a lot of new content, starting with brand-new quests and new high-quality cinematic animation delivered through 18 new story scenes. The world size has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new areas, Lowland Meadows and Marin Woods, which also include a dangerous new Blight hazard that players must beware of. There are also two new settlements, Hunter's Vale and Marin Village, and several dark caves to explore.</p>
<p>The Breach update has introduced a new endgame Plague System as well, while the Food and Hunger mechanic has been reworked and Status Effects have been overhauled. Of course, a game like this one is heavily focused on loot. No Rest for the Wicked now offers over 150 weapon options, an increase of 50 compared to launch. This includes new Gauntlet and Wand types. There are also multiple new armor sets and a rework for the Shield. Throughout the campaign, players will encounter several new boss fights (and 3 updated ones), 9 new Plague bosses, 2 new enemy factions, and 9 new critters. Those who really seek a challenge when playing the game can now activate the Hardcore mode, which enables permadeath.</p>
<p>The audio was improved with new music by Gareth Coker and new voice-overs. Moon Studios also touts extensive balance changes, quality-of-life improvements (updated item previews, tooltips), and noticeable performance improvements, including NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, memory usage optimizations, quicker load times, and improved physics. Lastly, the patch features 'hundreds of bug fixes'.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this update hasn't been well-received by No Rest for the Wicked players. Recent user reviews on Steam are 'Mostly Negative' due to a very low 36% score. Hopefully, the developers can get to the bottom of the community's feedback. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our hands-on report from May 2024</a>, the game's core does have a lot of potential.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Austrian developer is now fully on its own, <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-gets-new-major-update-moon-studios-purchases-publishing-rights-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having purchased the license back from publisher Private Division</a>.</p>
