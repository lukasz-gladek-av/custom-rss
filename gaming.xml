		<p>The Chinese Room, the celebrated UK developer behind Dear Esther, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/08/12/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review/">Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes The Deep</a>, has regained its independence after a management buyout from Sumo Digital.</p>
<p>The studio is currently at work on concluding development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-will-now-launch-in-october-2025/">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> for Paradox Interactive, and now has two original IPs in development.</p>


<p>The management buyout has been facilitated by venture capital firm Hiro Capital, with studio director Ed Daly continuing to head the developer.</p>
<p>“This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision,” Daly said. “This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we’re happy to carry on in this vein.”</p>
<p>The Chinese Room had been bought up by Sumo Digital in 2018, as Sumo went on a large expansion drive through the last decade, opening up or acquiring studios in Nottingham, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/02/sumo-digital-have-rescued-ccps-newcastle-studio-from-closure/">Newcastle</a>, Leamington, Warrington, Pune and Bangalore and more, growing to around 1,400 employees by 2023. In turn, Sumo was<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/19/british-developer-sumo-digital-acquired-by-tencent-1-3-billion/"> acquired by Tencent in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>However, the future of Sumo and all their subsidiaries were thrown into doubt earlier this year when the company issued a statement that it would <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/04/sumo-group-stops-making-original-ip-to-focus-on-partner-titles/">now refocus on third party work</a> as opposed to original IP and self-publishing. This led to layoffs and the sale of publishing label Secret Mode.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room was also being put up for sale, but with the likelihood of being acquired by an overseas entity again has been staved off. Hiro Capital is a London and Luxembourg VC fund that specialises in founding and angel funding gaming, sports and technology.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“The Chinese Room is a huge British success story that has rightly been recognised as a unique creative force capable of competing on the world stage,” said Spike Laurie, a partner at Hiro Capital. “From hiring British people to making games set in the UK, they’ve been one of our foremost creative studios and now they are once again in charge of their own destiny while remaining British.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“We are at risk of overlooking these creative gems and letting them be sold to overseas corporations,” Laurie continued. “That is a travesty for the $5.5 billion British gaming industry which has a world-renowned reputation. We need to nurture this talent and support it through difficult times, because it is one of our leading creative exports.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role has announced an official videogame partnership. The multimedia company has announced it will be collaborating with AdHoc Studio on several upcoming videogame projects. One of them is an official Critical Role videogame.</p>

<h2>The AdHoc Studio Critical Role Videogame Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Critical Role's CEO Travis Willingham discussed the reasoning behind their collaboration with AdHoc Studio. According to Willingham, he was auditioning for a role in the studio's upcoming narrative-driven superhero workplace drama game, <em>Dispatch.&nbsp;</em>Afterwards, more in-depth talks happened, resulting in a partnership which includes official Critical Role videogame development.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-game-dialogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=8hZ74aQ7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-game-dialogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=zeL7O1ub 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><blockquote>
<p>"Just from looking over the audition and game materials, I knew there was something special about what AdHoc was creating and I immediately reached out,” said Willingham. “The design, tone, style and storytelling of DISPATCH jumped off the page, and I knew given the pedigree of the folks at AdHoc, this was a team we wanted to collaborate with. Critical Role is always looking to build with people who are innovating around new ways to deliver story, character and worldbuilding, and AdHoc fits that perfectly.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this partnership, Critical Role will collaborate with AdHoc on future Dispatch brand development. This will include merchandise, tabletop gaming, and more. In addition, both AdHoc and Critical Role will help co-develop the first videogame set in Critical Role's fantasy setting of Exandria, showcasing AdHoc's design strengths in deep, player choice-driven storytelling.</p>

<p>AdHoc's pedigree in videogame narrative cannot be understated. The studio was founded by several veterans of Telltale Games, the studio responsible for their critically-acclaimed videogame adaptations of <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> set in the <em>Fables</em> universe.</p>

<p>Considering the voice cast of Dispatch includes two other key members of Critical Role, Matt Mercer and Laura Bailey, there is clear vested interest in AdHoc from a creative and design perspective.</p>

<p>A Critical Role videogame has been something the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-confirms-video-game-is-coming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has wanted to do</a> for a while. Given breadth of the world of Exandria, told throughout <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">three major campaigns</a> and several spin-offs spanning ten years, there is plenty of material to pull from.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown’s</a> launch last year got off to a tortured analogy about a bad start to a motor race. Did it stall as the lights went out? Did it burn out its tyres with wheelspin? Did it bog down in second gear? Perhaps all of the above? KT Racing haven’t given up on their open world lifestyle racer, though, and with the imminent launch of Season 4, they’ve now opened up about what Year 2 holds for their game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Behind the Scenes: The Future of Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K88Nrddj4fw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since last September, KT Racing has delivered two major updates, first with the Ibiza City map at the end of last year in Season 2, while Season 3 in March brought new mission types, a solo mode, more vehicles, AI difficulty selection and more. What awaits through to 2026 is more of an incremental approach to improvement, adding requested features with each season, new mission types, and continuing to engage with the community to decide the path ahead.</p>


<p>But first, Season 4 is set to arrive this month, bringing with its a bunch of new race events branded as Stock Races. There’s 20 new races and 20 redefined ones across both Hong Kong Island and Ibiza, all of which will challenge you to drive in cars locked to their stock value. Alongside that comes an overhaul of active aero for select cars that have moveable parts, with a revamp of the dynamic aero system aiming to recreate each car’s behaviour with aerobrake, DRS and deployment. In certain instances, you’ll have both automatic and manual control – your Bugatti Veyron will now have high and low drag modes, for example.</p>
<p>The UI is also getting a makeover, giving players full control over which parts of the HUD are active, adding a new quick access filter system for the world map, and catering better to groups driving together with support for up to 4 routes in the GPS and an itinerary plan for players to follow.</p>

<p>There’s also five new cars, this time arriving with the first paid Solar Pass of rewards, alongside a free rewards track. These include the Aston Martin DB11 Volante, DeLorean Alpha5 and more.</p>

<p>But perhaps most exciting for long-time TDU fans is the return of the casino. The Wintory Casino is a brand new social area which allows for up to 32 players to share the space – up from 8 or 16 players in the base game. There’s two new shops for avatar and car cosmetics here, but the big difference is that you need to buy things with casino chips, which you obviously get from gambling –&nbsp;or turning Solar Coin to casino chips at a rate of 2:1.</p>
<p>Initially there will be just the one slot machine type, but a mid-season update will bring a Golden Dragon slot machine and the ability to play poker. Get lucky enough and you could win a Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series.</p>

<p>This should hopefully tide players over to October and the start of Season 5, which brings major changes to the game with an overhaul of the KT Engine that adds new water shaders, reflections, shadowing and lighting, and aims to make better use of the CPU and GPU. There’s no details yet, but hoepfully this brings some big improvements for the game on console as well as on PC.</p>

<p>This also sees the addition of Taxi missions, where you’ll have to pick up a client and drive them to a destination following common sense road rules like adhering to speed limits and using indicators –&nbsp;this ain’t Crazy Taxi, alright? Along the way, clients might make specific requests, such as having you roll down windows or turn on the radio, and you might have to meet a dress code beforehand as well.</p>

<p>Season 6 will also add a new mission type in January, but this one will be determined by the community, with voting now active to decide between a Detective, Package Delivery, Photography and Adrenaline missions. You can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdV49jCWe1BvGaZpkgYEpdY0tTJOSYappAnQj0V06ZYg7gEuQ/viewform">head here to vote before 4th August</a>.</p>
<p>Even further away are the Official Racing Centre hub in April’s Season 7, where players can gather at an island race track and launch ranked events together, and then houses and real estate won’t appear until Season 8, letting you throw money into buying properties that you can customise, furnish and invite friends to visit to check out the cars you’re displaying in your garage or garden.</p>

<p>There’s further things being teased, such as more Asian market vehicles appearing in Season 7, the possibility for body kits and more car customisation, car selling as well, and there are still plans for bikes at some point as well. Also high on the priority list are cross-region servers – cross-platform play less so – eight player groups and selling cars.</p>
<p>There’s a long road ahead for Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, and while it didn’t get off to an ideal start, it is good to see KT Racing sticking with the project to build out their vision. The goal, of course, is to build up more momentum and bring both new and returning players into the game once more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza has been a stellar return for Nintendo's beloved ape, with the critical consensus from players and critics making it one of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">2025's best games so far</a>, and as for its commercial success, it was reportedly at the top of the sales charts for physical games in the UK. That said, it didn't come close to hitting the heights of Super Mario Odyssey's launch.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/">The Game Business</a> founder and editor-in-chief, Christopher Dring, <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1946977090487923167">posted on X</a> that Donkey Kong Bananza was at the top of the UK's physical sales charts, and that its launch was "<em>3x bigger than the launch of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze."</em> However, Dring reports that it was "<em>less than half of Super Mario Odyssey's</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bonanza launches at No.1 in the UK chart (physical sales) . Its launch is 3x bigger than the launch of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze on Switch. But it is less than half of Super Mario Odyssey’s</p>— Christopher Dring (@Chris_Dring) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1946977090487923167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza was only released days ago at the time of this writing, so Dring is only reporting on the launch week sales. It's also worth noting that it's only physical sales for one region. Physical sales are still an important moniker for Nintendo games, since the only people still buying games physically seem to be Nintendo fans, but they're not yet the whole picture of Bananza's success.</p>



<p>As we get more information about Bananza's sales in the coming weeks and months, it'll be interesting to see how the game continues to take off. The comparisons to Nintendo's main mascot and the last major 3D platformer we got from Mario are perhaps a bit unfair, but relevant considering that the team who worked on DK Bananza stemmed from the same team that made Super Mario Odyssey, and that's before getting into all the gameplay similarities between the two.</p>



<p>In his review of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, Wccftech's Nathan Birch, giving the game a 9/10 said, "<em>Donkey Kong Bananza doesn’t monkey around, as it’s inarguably the biggest, most ambitious 3D platformer Nintendo has ever produced. Taking the formula established by Super Mario Odyssey as a starting point, Nintendo goes deeper, wilder, weirder, and punchier. Donkey Kong Bananza is perhaps a bit less refined than the near-immaculate Odyssey, but if you can overlook a few minor brown spots, this banana is very much worth peeling.</em>"</p>

Or survival game-like?--has an early access release planned, but there’s currently a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam demo</a> that lets you try to figure out what exactly it is for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Prologue</em> spreads itself between survival game, walking sim, and tech demo. Each run takes place on a new huge, generated map; you’re tasked with walking from a starting cabin to a weather station somewhere out in the world, using only a compass and a paper map that doesn’t update with your position. There isn’t any wildlife or monsters out there, just nature and a few points of interest, also marked on your map, that could be cabins, lean-tos, or piles of rocks. In its current form the game has some light survival elements in terms of managing your character’s hunger, thirst, and temperature. These aren’t terribly taxing, though letting them bottom out will end your run.&nbsp;</p><p>The game’s maps are created with what <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/prologue-go-wayback-brendan-greene-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a writeup on Epic Games</a> calls “a mixture of procedural generation, machine learning, and good old-fashioned handcrafted art.” This includes in-house machine learning technology to generate the heightmap and uses data drawn from, the developer <a href="https://playerunknownproductions.net/news/guided-generation-in-prologue-ml-generated-landscapes-based-on-game-designer-inpu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a>, “real-world landscape data (from public geospatial datasets).” The generation is done on the player’s machine rather than in the energy-guzzling data centers AI is known for. Developer Brendan Greene told Epic that “We try not to use generative AI for the artistic process;” while it’s not clear to me what “try” means, there’s no AI disclosure on its Steam page. The whole thing is kind of a tech test for a sort of–oh god–metaverse, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pubg-2-prologue-brendan-greene-playerunknown-metaverse-1851765648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku</a> writing that “This metaverse, a 3D version of the internet as Greene calls it, is the long-term goal, potentially 10-15 years away, guiding <em>Prologue</em>’s development like a north star.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Prologue: Go Wayback! - Official Trailer | IGN Fan Fest 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbRDB5ygQ6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That’s a lot of the kinds of buzzwords I hate, and also not a lot of insight into what the thing you can download on Steam actually is. This might explain why I hadn’t realized a playable version of the game existed until YouTube put one of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTin6ycnDWw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorite <em>The Long Dark </em>players</a> messing with it in front of me over the weekend. I love <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Long Dark</em></a> for all the things <em>Prologue</em> has in common with it, namely wandering around in the woods, so I downloaded the demo to check it out. In my five hours with the demo I did not make it to the weather station, though I did glimpse it once in the distance before fog set in, I made some bad choices that got me hopelessly lost, and died.</p><p>In real life, I am not great with maps; I will admit that I sometimes can’t even parse a Google map without turning myself or my phone in different directions. <em>Prologue</em>’s compass and paper map setup were a huge challenge for me. The best way to navigate the demo’s world is to find the big river that crosses every map and then follow it; this also helps with your need for water, which can’t be collected from rain or puddles despite the game’s abundance of rain, puddles, and containers that can hold water. In one run, the starting cabin I spawned in was firmly between three river tributaries and a mountain; as long as I didn’t climb a mountain, I thought, it was impossible for me <em>not</em> to hit a river eventually. But then I kept <em>not</em> hitting a river <em>or </em>a mountain, stopping to look at my map and compass, asking myself if I even actually understood cardinal directions.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath/PlayerUnknown</figcaption></figure><p>When I did find a river in a run, things were going great until curiosity got the better of me and I wandered into the woods. I kept muttering “the river is behind you, just turn around” to myself until I came upon a little lean-to that thrillingly contained a new map showing my updated position. Then, a snowstorm set in, and when it ended, I somehow <em>didn’t</em> just turn around and, even with my new map, couldn’t find the river again. With the world changing each time, there’s none of the learning landmarks of games like <em>The Long Dark </em>that help you improve over time. Given that navigation is the main activity the <em>Prologue</em> demo has going for it, how much you understand the concept of where your body is in space will likely dictate how challenging you find it.</p><p>As a demo, the game struggled a bit for me tech-wise, with frequent framerate drops and some effects I had to turn off to stop the leaves on all the trees from turning into weird little strobe lights. The controls can be equally finicky, sometimes not picking things up when they should. But I didn’t mind looking past this to enjoy just wandering in <em>Prologue</em>’s world, full of shifting biomes and weird rock formations. There is spectacular weather: in one of my runs, a powerful rainstorm started up as soon as I spawned, threatening to tear the roof off my starting cabin in a roar of water and flapping wood. There are snow storms and, captivatingly, hail. There are muddy areas that slow your walk speed and fog that obscures everything, and, less frequently, solid ground and sunny skies. With no crafting and little in the way of shelter, changes in weather can spell the end of a run.</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath/PlayerUnknown</figcaption></figure><p>You find food and items as you explore, though you have a clunky, maddeningly small inventory to contend with. You can also carry items under your arm; I mainly did this for firewood, since bigger pieces can be in short supply out in the world. The firestarting mechanic is great: using a firestriker you hopefully remembered to pick up in the starting cabin, you arrange tinder, sticks, and logs and then strike enough sparks for everything to catch. The placement of your fire items matters, as does the weather you’re trying to light a fire in, and it feels very much like starting a fire in the real world. One of my runs ended when I found myself slogging through a <em>The NeverEnding Story</em>-esque mud flat, moments from freezing to death, with the ground too wet to light a fire on.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s good that the fire mechanic is interesting, because otherwise there isn’t all that much to <em>do</em> in the demo. The landscape can become repetitive, and there’s no narrative to follow, secrets to uncover, or timer or closing circle to push you toward the weather station. I wouldn’t fault anyone who simply found it boring–its world is very beautiful, but there isn’t very much <em>in </em>it–or players with better navigational skills than me finding it too easy. Beyond mishaps with my fires, foraged mushrooms were enough to keep me fed and hydrated; my deaths didn’t feel inevitable so much as consequences of my own bad choices.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath/PlayerUnknown</figcaption></figure><p>Despite all this, <em>Prologue</em> ate up a chunk of my Saturday. In the absence of so many of the things that make video games video game-like, it has its own intriguing atmosphere that feels like it has nothing to do with metaverse cringe. It isn’t exciting, or necessarily <em>good</em>, and I can’t even say I honestly understand what it’s trying to be. But it drew me in regardless, given my love of a slow-paced wandering game and the pleasures of exploring virtual woods. <em>Prologue</em>’s eventual early access release plans to add narrative, “new ways of surviving,” and “hazards to explore,” and while it definitely feels a bit too bare bones right now, I think leaning too far into the hallmarks of standard survival games runs the risk of PlayerUnknown just making a crappy survival game. <em>PUBG</em>’s Arma mod lineage made it wonderfully, grimly clunky, and I hope <em>Prologue</em>, whatever it’s developing itself into, sticks with that feeling while improving on the parts that don’t function quite right yet.</p><p>I can’t totally say I’d recommend it if you’re not a survival game nerd like me, or even if you are. But I had a hugely particular-feeling experience in it, one that had me scooted forward in my chair with my face close to my computer screen, one that told the kinds of personal, harrowing stories only a very slow survival game can, even one as baffling as <em>Prologue</em>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/waypoint-quit-steam-vice"><h3>Waypoint Writers Quit Over Removal Of Articles Related To New Steam Policy [Updated]</h3></a><p>Two articles by writer Ana Valens were removed at the demand of Vice owner Savage Ventures, the latest in multiple deletions at the site</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon"><h3>Warframe, Still A Space Ninja Game (Technically), Is Now Drawing Inspiration From World War I</h3></a><p>"I liken it to the moment in World War I where you have soldiers playing football on Christmas day across the trenches"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-valnet-off-the-grid-gunzilla-rip-this-sucks"><h3>🙃 [Update: 🤔]</h3></a><p>Cool, cool, cool</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse"><h3>‘Friendslop’ Isn’t Real, But People Love Posting About It Anyway</h3></a><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone saying "friendslop" and meaning it.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/prologue-go-wayback-demo-pubg]]></content:encoded>

Not only is an open beta coming, but the <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1947310614411616383" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Battlefield account said</a> the game's beta will allow players to choose either an "open" or "closed" weapon setup.</p><p>"Why not both?" the developer said. In the open beta, players can choose playlists that have signature weapons locked to a specific class, or not. "More to come," the developer said.</p><p>Older titles, like the much-loved Battlefield 4, had class-locked weapons, but Battlefield 2042 introduced the ability for players in any class to choose whatever weapon they wanted. Some portion of the audience didn't enjoy this, while others embraced this expanded freedom. It appears DICE is trying to appease both audiences by giving them the option in Battlefield 6.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-brings-back-controversial-change-from-battlefield-2042/1100-6531734/" data-ref-id="1100-6531734">Each class in Battlefield 6 will have signature weapons</a>, and using them provides certain benefits. For example, DICE said if you choose the Recon class, a weapon from the sniper rifle category will afford increased breath-holding duration. If a player who chose the Assault class uses a sniper rifle, they don't get this benefit.</p><p>DICE said it wanted to offer players the option of customizing their loadouts irrespective of class because doing so may allow them to "meet the needs of your squad" to have success on the battlefield.</p><p>Battlefield 6 will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-when-battlefield-6-could-be-revealed-and-its-soon/1100-6533290/" data-ref-id="1100-6533290">officially unveiled on July 31, according to a report</a>, and it's also at this time that DICE may share more details about the open beta. Online speculation suggests the open beta could begin in August, but nothing is confirmed as of yet. Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Battlefield 6, which is scheduled to launch by March 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_5">What to expect from Season 5</h2><p dir="ltr">As always, a new season of Call of Duty means a fresh battle pass packed with cosmetics. There will likely be more Black Ops 6 events and crossovers as well. Season 4 was cartoon-themed with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-beavis-and-butt-head-event-all-weapons-skins-and-all-rewards/2900-6729/">Beavis and Butt-Head</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-american-dad-collab-is-real-shop-bundles-coming-soon/1100-6533245/">American Dad</a> collaborations, but it's uncertain what theme could arrive with Season 5. Call of Duty has confirmed the next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-next-operator-knows-what-you-did-last-summer/1100-6533292/">operator collab is the Fisherman</a> from I Know What You Did Last Summer, so this could be Season 5's first crossover news, but it's possible the operator bundle arrives before Season 4 ends.</p><p dir="ltr">The new weapons haven't been officially revealed, but <a href="https://x.com/Vondyispog/status/1940450354266800365" rel="nofollow ">leaks suggest</a> Season 5 could include the return of the iconic MP-40 submachine gun and the M60 light machine gun. The game files also mention melee weapons such as the chainsaw, boxing gloves, and brass knuckles. Of course, these are weapons that could be saved for another season or scrapped all together.</p><p dir="ltr">The operator Sims was also found in the recent game files, suggesting he could be the Season 5 battle pass operator.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6">Black Ops 6</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4535417-19610c617ef50-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535417" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4535417-19610c617ef50-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535417"></a><figcaption>Zombies crew in Shattered Veil cutscene</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4535417-19610c617ef50-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 multiplayer will likely feature new maps and game modes in Season 5, but we don't have those details yet. As for Zombies, the most recent Call of Duty podcast episode confirmed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/">final map will launch with Season 5</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This brings a conclusion to the ongoing storyline for Black Ops 6 Zombies. Following the events of Season 3's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shattered-veil-story-easter-egg-guide-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/2900-6418/">Shattered Veil main quest</a>, the Zombies crew and Edward Richtofen will face off against S.A.M. in a setting that takes place in or around the Janus Towers location of Liberty Falls.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Warzone's Verdansk returned in Season 3, and the map has slowly evolved to mimic updates of the original map. This added the moving train, opened up the Train Station interior, and included several Easter eggs. While not confirmed, Stadium's rooftop is expected to open up with Season 5 and include playable areas for the interior. Data miners also found <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_/status/1940521748715471055" rel="nofollow ">references in the game files</a> to back up the speculation, with new map locations for a boardroom and computer room within Stadium. There's also mention of some type of lockdown for Stadium. It's uncertain if this is a location, event, or tied to an Easter egg.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 is officially announced, and a full reveal is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-set-for-gamescom-in-august/1100-6533147/">scheduled for Gamescom Opening Night Live next month</a>, but it's possible there could still be some sort of in-game Warzone event tied to the big announcement. Warzone events have been used in the past to create hype around new Call of Duty releases.</p><p dir="ltr">An official Season 5 trailer, more teasers, and a full roadmap will likely arrive near the start of August, and we'll update as new information releases.</p>

                <p>Switching between playing games on different Xbox devices is about to get a little easier, as Microsoft has introduced a new Play History feature that makes it simple to see what games you've played across any Xbox device.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in an Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/21/now-available-for-xbox-insiders-your-cross-device-play-history-and-easier-access-to-your-cloud-playable-console-games-on-pc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the new feature will start rolling out today for Xbox Insiders. On the Xbox device's homescreen, a new list titled "Jump Back in" will appear with games that have been played recently on your current device. This is basically how it already works on consoles, with the tiles displaying recently used games and apps, but is new to the Xbox PC app.</p><p dir="ltr">New to both consoles and PC devices is the "Play History" button. At the end of the Jump Back in list (or on the far right side of the recently-played games and apps list on console) is an entire Play History category that will show games played across all devices. For those who bounce between console, PC, or a Windows handheld, the feature should make it faster to dive back into a game previously played on another device.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4535409-xboxplayhistoryupdateui.png" data-ref-id="1300-4535409" data-ratio="0.56410256410256" data-width="624" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4535409-xboxplayhistoryupdateui.png" data-ref-id="1300-4535409"></a><figcaption>A look at the new Jump Back in and Play History tiles added to the Xbox app.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4535409-xboxplayhistoryupdateui.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Xbox with this latest Insider update has also added the ability to filter games by "cloud playable" on the Xbox PC app, making it easier to see what games can be played straight from the cloud without the need to download them.</p><p dir="ltr">To join the Insider program and get updates and other new features early, you just need to download the Xbox Insider app on console or through the Microsoft Store on PC and opt-in to either the Xbox Update Preview or the PC Gaming preview, depending on what platform you are on.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox has made a big multi-device push in the last year, with a marketing campaign that declares <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">Xbox is more than just a console</a> and that any Windows device can be an "Xbox". Earlier this summer, Microsoft revealed an Xbox branded PC handheld, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, that is slated to arrive later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">major layoffs</a> that resulted in around 9,000 people losing their jobs earlier this month, including many who worked at Xbox studios, resulting in cancellation of games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">Perfect Dark</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a>.</p>

Sumo Digital acquired the developer in August 2018 for £2.2 million, and now The Chinese Room is independent once again.</p><p>This weekend, The Chinese Room completed a management buyout, with the company to be led by current studio director Ed Daly. This deal was facilitated by VC firm Hiro Capital, but <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-chinese-room-is-independent-again-heres-how-it-happened">according to&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em></a>, it also resulted in layoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, following the divestment process a number of roles were made redundant," Daly told&nbsp;Eurogamer. "The specifics are confidential but the studio is currently 55 developers. Clearly this was a very difficult process as we sought a future for the studio outside of Sumo."</p><p>The Chinese Room also announced it's actively working on two new IPs. "We had been working on new IP that needed investment and that was no longer possible with Sumo's new model," Daly told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-chinese-room-is-independent-again-heres-how-it-happened"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>.</p><p>In the immediate future, The Chinese Room is planning to release Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 this October, and&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/16/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-game-informers-next-cover-story">it's the game on the cover of&nbsp;<em>Game Informer</em>'s next issue</a>, out tomorrow.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-announces-management-buyout-gaining-independence-from-sumo-digital"><em>IGN</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-chinese-room-is-independent-again-heres-how-it-happened"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/21/bloodlines-2-still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-cuts-ties-with-parent]]></content:encoded>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> comes in at 75% female, with an average age of 35 years old, while the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirbys_return_to_dream_land_deluxe">Kirby</a> series fanbase is sat at 55% female amongst those surveyed, with players at an average age of 30.</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5mhxviy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpG4hedNmz8" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>A few more balanced series' come in the form of, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>, both rocking a 60:40 ratio (in favour of male). This is all quite the turnaround when compared with the surveys' result for "Games In General", which shows a 75:25 spilt in favour of males aged 30 and over.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario</a> holds a 70:30 split, with player age average sitting at 32, while a more recent series in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> sits at a 65:35 split, with the average player range being below 30.</p>
<p>The average age for two of the big Japanese RPG titans that started life on Nintendo consoles, <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> and <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>, sits at 42, which is tied with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disney_tsum_tsum_festival">Disney Tsum Tsum</a> as having the oldest average player base among the games surveyed.</p>
<p>Other interesting tidbits include the fact that the survey found the vast majority of gamers were young mobile players, whilst Nintendo's IPs, in relation to other consoles, attract the most young players (obvious), but also the most over 30s (not as obvious!).</p>
<p>The survey makes for fascinating reading, and while many of the results are predictable, there's plenty of little factoids that you might not have guess before! Of course, this only covers Japanese players, and it's only a slice of the market, but it's a good insight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 just got another major update recently, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-3-amd-fsr-4-frame-generation/">Patch 2.3 going live this past week</a>, and among the new features added was one that caught the eye of the tech experts over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-df-weekly-cyberpunk-2077s-vrr-upgrade-sees-some-impressive-boosts-for-ps5-pro">Digital Foundry</a>. Cyberpunk 2077 now supports VRR on consoles, including PS5 Pro, and while CD Projekt RED has yet to put out an official PS5 Pro patch, the results of adding VRR support are about "<em>the closest we'll get</em>" according to DF.</p>



<p>The last time CD Projekt RED spoke on an official PS5 Pro update for Cyberpunk 2077, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-wont-be-getting-a-ps5-pro-patch-anytime-soon/">claimed that there were "<em>no plans</em>"</a> to develop one, but then again, CD Projekt RED has also stated that it was done updating Cyberpunk 2077. Only to later release a new update for Cyberpunk 2077. So take that previous statement with a grain of salt for now, since it could just be that the studio is working up to it with updates like last week's adding VRR support.</p>



<p>As for what VRR support does for PS5 Pro owners today, Digital Foundry's testing found that unlocking the framerate can get players on PS5 Pro playing the game at 80 FPS+ on the Performance graphics mode. As Digital Foundry's John Linneman put it in today's DF Direct Weekly video, "<em>It's significantly better overall..averaging around 80 to 90 FPS, you can feel that. That is a significant upgrade.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #223: Cyberpunk 2077 VRR Tested, Space Marine RT Upgraded, New SNES Doom Wows" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m05yE_-X7uY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Base-PS5 players have much less to be excited about, since DF found that playing with the new VRR modes on a base PS5 still has you hovering around 60 FPS, which is where the regular performance mode already stood. The same goes for the quality mode, which keeps players at the same previous marker of 30 FPS. PS5 Pro players get their framerate bumped up to 40 FPS when playing on the quality mode with ray tracing on.</p>



<p>Digital Foundry points out that there's still room for CD Projekt RED to improve Cyberpunk's performance on the PS5 Pro in both the performance and quality modes, such as improvements to ray-tracing, and to the framerate for other areas of Cyberpunk that, even with VRR on, still barely manage to hit 60 FPS on a PS5 Pro. </p>



<p>Still, if you shelled out the cash for a PS5 Pro, seeing a 20 FPS bump compared to the base PS5 on games like Cyberpunk 2077 is realistically the kind of improvement you paid for. It's good to see PS5 Pro players reaping the benefits of their upgrade, and hopefully, CD Projekt RED will one day release a proper, official PS5 Pro patch that improves elements of performance and graphical fidelity in the game across the board.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer.1248960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is an operating system sim in the mold of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hypnospace-outlaw" rel="nofollow">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Simulacra</em>, and it asks a simple question: What kind of secrets could the innocuous facade of a distinctly '90s-inspired Windows 2.0-style interface be hiding?</p>

<p>Structurally, solo developer Cara Cadaver's game has you trawling through the primitive menus and basic graphics of an old PC, searching for the truth behind the disappearance of adult film actress Candy Corpse.</p>

<p>Just like the OS itself, though,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is hiding a lot from you at the outset, and things are not as simple as that setup implies. If you want to find out what might have happened to Candy, you're going to have to put your digital detective hat on, and happily, it's worth doing so, even if you'll be left wanting more at the end.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>Is a Very Convincing '90s PC Sim</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-calculator.jpg?itok=VNaMJplg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-calculator.jpg?itok=0QO1fPgO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Agh! My eyes! The numbers!</figcaption></figure><p>There's a refreshing lack of adornment to&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. As soon as you boot it up, you'll be faced with a simple login screen that asks you to enter a 4-digit PIN. There's no fluff, no introductory cutscene explaining who the key players in this story are, and no tutorials to be found either.</p>

<p>That works to its credit; since&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>doesn't mess around, you're free to "enjoy" its unsettling, eerily quiet atmosphere right from the get-go. The silence of the operating system is almost oppressive, broken only by the sound of clicking as you navigate clunky menus and positively atavistic-looking websites.</p>

<p>I never felt like Cadaver's game jumped the shark, either. Its PC simulation remained convincing until the very end, helped along by the eldritch glow of the CRT monitor filter overlaying the "action," so to speak.</p>

<p>If you don't have any nostalgia for old-school operating systems, then&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>might not be able to weave its strange magic for you, but I thoroughly enjoyed the matter-of-fact, no-nonsense style in which this ancient PC coughed up its secrets.</p>

<h2>You'll Find a Timely Story in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-forum.jpg?itok=mStteqII 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-forum.jpg?itok=Sh7u5tPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s story doesn't pull its punches.</figcaption></figure><p>Those secrets are worth discovering, too. While&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is nominally the story of Candy Corpse and her disappearance, there's more to discover inside this particular computer's memory, not least to whom it belongs and why you're digging through it.</p>

<p>Unlike the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Simulacra&nbsp;</em>or its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/simulacra-2" rel="nofollow">slightly disappointing sequel</a>,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>doesn't resort to cheap jump scares, nor does it descend into the valley of daft pseudo-supernatural horror.</p>

<p>The scares are much closer to home, and while I don't want to spoil anything, the Steam page does make clear mention of "themes of sexual content, violence, and abusive and harmful language," so you know what kind of realm we're in here.</p>

<p>Since you're free to explore the operating system in whatever order you choose,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s story will likely unfold in a non-linear fashion, and discovering what happened to Candy is just one part of filling in the wider picture.</p>

<p>Great horror is grounded in the real, and that's certainly the case with&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. If its story ever threatens to feel silly or outré, the fact that many of its themes still disappointingly resonate in the real world only add to the threat.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s Operating System Is Filled With Secrets</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-password.jpg?itok=3LoXQWs9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-password.jpg?itok=-iFvlUpR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Good luck working this one out.</figcaption></figure><p>Discovering the narrative feels chilling thanks to the plethora of secrets contained within&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s operating system. Some applications will give up their secrets readily, while others require passwords or authentication to access.</p>

<p>You're left to discover many of these keys by yourself, although hints are frequently available. Making discoveries therefore feels like pulling off great detective work, evoking the quiet satisfaction of getting an old, irascible computer to do what you want in the process.</p>

<p>Some of those secrets can feel a little too esoteric for their own good, however. I never managed to work out what lurked behind the innocuous-seeming perfume website, for instance, and there are a couple of other head-scratchers that defeated me as well.</p>

<p>Still, if you're the type to pore over games hunting for every scrap of information, then&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>should give you a good couple of hours of entertainment. Unfortunately, however, that's all it's going to give you.</p>

<h2>Frankly, There's Just Not Enough of&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-ffvr.jpg?itok=Jy1QxqQ9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-ffvr.jpg?itok=ybKZ1h8m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I wanted to spend more time in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s meticulously constructed operating system.</figcaption></figure><p>If I have a core criticism of&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>, it's that there's just not enough of it. Just when things are starting to move along and adrenaline is starting to build, it's over. The ending is a pretty abrupt one, too, although it feels appropriate given what you're likely to have learned beforehand.</p>

<p>Discovering the story of Candy by digging through old websites and deducing passwords is a hugely enjoyable (if that's the right word) experience, so the fact that there's just so little of it is heartbreaking for me.</p>

<p>Cadaver has made it clear&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is designed to be played in a single sitting, and there's no save function, nor does it allow you to continue playing after the credits. I sort of understand why from a narrative perspective, but I'd have loved the chance to continue spending time with this throwback machine.</p>

<p>Still, I will always prefer a game that leaves before its time to something that massively outstays its welcome. In being so shockingly brief,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>avoids the pitfalls of puzzle games that keep going long after their best ideas are spent.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-vns.jpg?itok=K0T8_eCC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-vns.jpg?itok=VCMzvbqH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>has plenty of "delights" to offer retro puzzle connoisseurs.</figcaption></figure><p>Cara Cadaver has crafted a very neat little puzzler in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. On one level, it's a great simulation of a time before user-friendliness and "idiot-proof" operating system design, and on another, it's an unsettling tale of violence and abuse that may well stay with you (it certainly has with me).</p>

<p>I'd love to see what Cadaver can craft in a larger, more open-ended sandbox environment, but if you're looking for a (very) tightly-plotted experience that doesn't stick around after it's not welcome,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>will provide.</p>

        <p>"Nothing is eternal", says Yves Guillemot</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has responded to a shareholder question about the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign - and in a very newsworthy corporate question and answer session, revealed that a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-breakpoint">Ghost Recon</a> game's in the works.</p>
<p>To quickly recap, Stop Killing Games aim to stop publishers rendering online games unplayable after the cessation of official support. They were inspired to take action by Ubisoft themselves 'sunsetting' online racer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's response to their campaign comes around the time the group's petition to the EU to take action against the mass extinction of online games <a href="https://x.com/StopKilingGames/status/1947064216298406179">hits 1.4 million signatures</a>. Despite some doubts about potential signature spoofing, the petition's recently attracted support from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign">EU politicians</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-only-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create-argue-eu-lobby-group">industry trade bodies</a>, so it's no surprise Guillemot's fielding questions about it from moneyfolk.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Regarding the petition, we operate in a market," the CEO began (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report">Game File</a>), immediately whipping out what I assume's the corporate version of the phrase '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHhbdXCzt_A&amp;t=1s">we're living in a society</a>'. He went on to say that players are "forewarned that eventually the game may be discontinued", and framed the studio putting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> on sale for €1/$1 back in 2024 as an attempt to let players of the first game hop across to one that wasn't about to be deep-sixed.</p>
<p>"You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone and at some point the service may be discontinued," Guillemot continued, "Nothing is eternal. And we are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously support for all games cannot last forever. But that’s an issue that we’re working on. That’s something that the industry at large is working on, to minimize impact on players."</p>
<p>The exec closed out his point by saying that the likes of software and tools made to make live-service games "become obsolete" or no longer available in time, outlining that this is why studios can opt to put out new versions.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Stop Killing Games have been clear they're not asking for all online games to be "eternal", but rather to "implement an end-of-life plan to modify or patch the game so that it can run on customer systems with no further support from the company being necessary".</p>
<p>Moving away from Stop Killing Games, in the same shareholder ask-a-thon Guillemot and Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet casually alluded to a new Ghost Recon being in development. The CEO mentioned "capitalising on upcoming launches, such as The Division and Ghost Recon", while Duguet touched on investment from Tencent being used for "future development of other major brand names", citing Ghost Recon as an example.</p>
<p>Confirming the execs' chatter about the ghost reconning their attic, an Ubisoft spokesperson has told Game File that the publishers "look forward to sharing more when the time is right". Nice. Here's hoping it doesn't come with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-launching-ghost-recon-breakpoint-nfts-later-this-week">NFT trousers</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-ceo-responds-to-stop-killing-games-and-casually-mentions-a-new-ghost-recon-games-coming]]></content:encoded>

So while it will be the old guard of mutants who show up for 2027's <em>Avengers: Secret Wars</em>, after that they’re off.

And that might stretch even further, to new actors playing long-established superheroes in the MCU mythos, too. I say: thank you, <em>thank you</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="c4c20463ad643f7ad9a651dc651a5fb0" data-recommend-id="image://c4c20463ad643f7ad9a651dc651a5fb0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTS footage from the latest Captain America." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="BTS footage from the latest Captain America." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c4c20463ad643f7ad9a651dc651a5fb0" data-recommend-id="image://c4c20463ad643f7ad9a651dc651a5fb0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTS footage from the latest Captain America." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>OK, bear with me. Phases 4, 5 and 6 of the MCU have been called The Multiverse Saga, and have involved multiple versions of reality crashing into one another. This has taken place across Disney+ TV series like <em>Loki</em>, and movies like <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> and <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </em>and <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, and has led to the brief appearances of a whole bunch of actors who played X-Men characters in the previous Fox-created franchise of movies that ran from 2000 to 2019.</p><p> In 2017, Disney bought Fox, which allowed decades of licensing conflicts to go away, freeing up familiar mutants to show up in MCU movies, but it’s all been so incredibly piecemeal that it’s been tough to follow. This, we’re told, is all building up to the end of Phase 6, a pair of <em>Avengers</em> movies—<em>Doomsday</em> and <em>Secret Wars</em>—that will finally close the multiverse saga and let us all move on.</p><p>See, so much of the trouble with the current era of the MCU is that even trying to write out what’s happening is a nightmare of overlapping movies, TV series and references to entire other franchises from the past. No wonder audiences are tiring of the films, given the amount of background research you need to do to have the faintest idea what’s going on. </p><p>Yes, it’s absolutely led to the fantastic fun of films like the aforementioned <em>Spider-Man </em>and <em>Doctor Strange </em>outings, but it’s the consequences of these movies that are such a headache. The thrill of characters from multiple universes and franchises meeting up on screen is great while you’re sat in your seat, but needing to remember who was in which and why for next time isn’t what going to the movie theater should be about. Thankfully, there’s only two years of it left.</p><figure id="" data-id="117d4d03b2067abd25ed0ab502f16716" data-recommend-id="image://117d4d03b2067abd25ed0ab502f16716" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTS pic from Deadpool &amp; Wolverine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="BTS pic from Deadpool &amp; Wolverine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="117d4d03b2067abd25ed0ab502f16716" data-recommend-id="image://117d4d03b2067abd25ed0ab502f16716" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTS pic from Deadpool &amp; Wolverine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After that, in what has yet to be called Phase 7, Feige is promising that the MCU will match the move made by the comics in 2015's papery version of Secret Wars, and collapse all these bloody timelines into one. In this process, we’ll say goodbye to the likes of Kelsey Grammer, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Rebecca Romijn and James Marsden, who will presumably be cast off into the ether, and we’ll get a completely new, fresh team of X-Men actors.</p><p>“We’re utilizing [<em>Secret Wars</em>] not just to round out the stories we’ve been telling post-<em>Endgame</em>,” Feige said at a press briefing this weekend, “[but] it very, very much sets us up for the future.” <em>Endgame</em>, the final movie in Phase 3, was about endings, he said, adding, “<em>Secret Wars</em> is about beginnings.”</p><p>When asked if this is a reboot, Feige was very careful to distance himself from the concept. “Reboot is a scary word,” he told reporters. “Reboot can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. Reset, singular timeline—were thinking along those lines.”</p><p>Feige will want to avoid the notion of “reboot” because it would suggest scrapping all that’s come before and starting fresh, which isn’t the plan. It seems it’s more about, as he says, a reset: letting things calm back down before introducing the superheroic world to mutants. This, he notes, should give the movies a chance to also dramatically lower the age of their casts.</p><p>Remember, the MCU began in 2008, a frightening 17 years ago, meaning what were once fresh-faced actors are now very much middle-aged. In order not to age out, the movies will quickly need a younger audience, and since <em>X-Men</em> stories lend themselves to teenage and 20-something characters discovering their powers, this is a great chance to hire some of the most audience-attracting younger actors working today, who would have been very young indeed when the first <em>Iron Man</em> was released.</p><p>According to Feige, this recasting isn’t going to stop at the <em>X-Men</em>. He even suggested—while referencing James Bond as evidence that it’s possible—that characters like Tony Stark and Steve Rogers could be recast. And, as weird and unlikely as that might sound, if the movies are to continue on for generations, it’s unavoidable.</p><figure id="" data-id="56c2db963dd9788d74f26f86cc2ae082" data-recommend-id="image://56c2db963dd9788d74f26f86cc2ae082" data-format="jpg" data-width="895" data-height="504" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of Marvel comic heroes attacking Godzilla." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lots of Marvel comic heroes attacking Godzilla." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="56c2db963dd9788d74f26f86cc2ae082" data-recommend-id="image://56c2db963dd9788d74f26f86cc2ae082" data-format="jpg" data-width="895" data-height="504" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of Marvel comic heroes attacking Godzilla." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sure, Marvel comics have a squillion heroes that the MCU has never gone near. The issue is, few have  broad enough recognition to hold up a movie, and as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/superman-james-gunn-opening-weekend-box-office-1851786190&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/superman-james-gunn-opening-weekend-box-office-1851786190">James Gunn is about to discover in the DCU</a></span>, you have to do a hell of a lot of work to convince an audience to show up for a superhero they’ve never seen on a t-shirt. On the other hand, if you stick to the big names, you can’t have your core characters played by men in their 50s and 60s. Robert Downey Jr. just turned 60. Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) is 57. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) is 54. Even the babies like Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are now in their 40s. And yes, of course I’d love to see the MCU’s equivalent of <em>The Watchmen</em>, but the reality is that if you want to keep banking on these most popular heroes, you’ll have to recast the roles.</p><p>This could suggest some <em>really</em> dramatic implications for the climax of <em>Secret Wars</em>. It’s obvious to assume that this “reset” would bring us back to what we already know, the Earth-616 where we started before it all got out of control. But what if that’s not the plan? What if the timeline that survives is a completely fresh one, perhaps the one in which this month’s <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> is set? Or an entirely new Earth, which has never seen a Robert Downey Jr. Iron Man or Chris Hemsworth Thor?</p><p>I’d take it. While that’s a lot closer to a “reboot,” and those can be exhausting too (we all have to do the mental gymnastics of already knowing everything while the characters know nothing), it’d be so great not having to try to remember 20 years of backstory, including which character cameoed in which episode of a TV series five years earlier in order to understand why that woman wants to kill that guy in this movie...Yeah, I’ll take a reset.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/marvel-mcu-x-men-movies-multiverse-phase-6-avengers-1851786617]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Today is clearly the day Atari and Namco have sealed their reunion with pursed lips and probing tongues. Following the announcement of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pac-man-dig-dug-and-other-retro-favourites-get-the-interactive-museum-treatment-in-atari-50s-new-namco-dlc">new Namco-themed expansion for the excellent Atari 50 interactive museum thing</a>, the pair (along with third wheel Plaion) have cuddled up to unveil an <em>extremely</em> yellow Pac-Man edition of the Atari 2600+.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ataris-bringing-its-classic-2600-console-back-as-a-100-modern-day-faithful-recreation">original Atari 2600+ launched in 2023</a>, when it was described as a "modern day faithful recreation" of Atari's classic 70s/80s console. As for the new 2600+ Pac-Man Edition - released to celebrate the character's 45th birthday - it's pretty much the same thing, featuring mod cons like HDMI output, USB power, and multiple screen resolutions. However, the Atari 2600's timeless, woody hued design has been abandoned in favour of "signature pac-Man yellow".
</p>
<p>
And you know what? It's pretty tasteful in its own garish way. While the body of the machine is about as (Pac-Man) yellow as yellow can be, the spherical chomper and his old ghost pals make an apparently illuminated appearance on the front panel, while the black of the upper panel is broken up with a matching yellow cartridge slot and knobs.

<p>
"The Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition is more than just a console," manufacturer Plaion writes in the machine's announcement, "it's a tribute to the moment home gaming truly began. By reimagining the iconic hardware in Pac-Man's unmistakable style, we're celebrating the legacy of two cultural giants who helped define a generation of play."
</p>
<p>
If that burst of enthusiasm has you sold, you can pre-order the Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition starting 23rd July, and it'll cost you £129.99. For that, you get the machine itself, one CX-40 wireless joystick (also yellow), and a Pac-Man Double Feature cartridge, which includes Pac-Man's home console debut - Pac-man 2600, which released in 1982 - and Pac-Man 7800, a "brand new, arcade-style version of the classic".
</p>
<p>
And if you're after more than one Pac-Man CX40+ wireless joystick, you're in luck; they're also being sold separately for £29.99 each. But don't think you're limited to yellow. Plaion is also releasing Blue (Inky ghost), Red (Blinky ghost), Pink (Pinky ghost) and Orange (Clyde variants), and you can pre-order those from 23rd July too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>When we reviewed the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> for Switch 2 just a little while back, we came away as impressed as ever with IO Interactive's incredible world-building and gameplay. However, we were also a little bit disappointed with the game's performance at launch.</p>
<p>For a title we really love on other platforms, it was unfortunate to have to mark it down to a relatively disappointing 7/10 as a result of some fairly constant choppiness in both docked and handheld modes. And so we are delighted to discover that those boffins over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ6Mkwkvyxs">Digital Foundry</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hitman-world-of-assassination-seems-to-have-an-undocumented-performance-mode">cheers, Eurogamer</a>) seem to have found an unannounced 'performance mode' of sorts that we can all benefit from. Hooray for boffins!</p>
<p>According to DF's Richard Leadbetter, he received an email which notified him that a player had gone into the console system settings to have a muck about due to the fluctuating framerate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I went into the system settings and changed the TV output res from 4K to 720p, went back into the game and found it vastly improves performance. The Hawkes Bay Mission ran at... a very solid and stable frame-rate."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leadbetter then proceeded to put this to the test, capturing various scenes from the game's whistle-stop tour of the globe at 4K, 1080p and 720p. Choosing areas that push the GPU and CPU, and give us lots of crowd density, the results, he comments, are very interesting.</p>
<p>In the game's Whittleton Creek level, as an example, a setting of 4K output manages an average framerate of 46.88fps - which then rises to 59.95fps at 720p. A 62.5% improvement!</p>
<p>At 1080p, things get more interesting still:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...the game actually seems to be rendering at a slightly higher resolution, with pixel counts suggesting 1152p to 1188p. Meanwhile, with Switch 2 set to 4K, performance drops but pixel counts are still in the same 1152p/1188p window. The performance drop may be down to upscaling to a higher resolution with an approximate cost of around 2.4ms compared to what we assume is the same content without any upscaling."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leadbetter continues, unsure whether Hitman is using DLSS to upscale, "as there are rounded edges where we'd expect to see aliasing." DF has reached out to IO interactive for confirmation.</p>
<p>The team has also checked out the game's super cool Berlin level, reporting that things jump up by some 61% when knocked down to 720p, whilst 1080p is 9% faster.</p>

<p>Moving on to CPU-intensive crowded areas, and as expected the frame rate jumps aren't quite so sensational once you factor in a ton of NPCs. However, you are looking at a jump, according to DF, from around 35fps in the Paris fashion show stage, to in and around the 45fps mark, which is still rather tasty.</p>
<p>So, whilst this isn't an actual performance mode, hence why it hasn't been mentioned officially by the devs, you <em>can</em> pick up some nice frame boosts <em>if</em> you're willing to drop your resolution down a little. More interestingly, the disparity in these numbers should, says Leadbetter, enable DF to get a better handle on the computational costs of Nintendo's DLSS implementation on the new console going forward. Something that's been a bit of a mystery up until this point!</p>
<p>IO Interactive has also recently announced that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/hitman-developer-is-working-on-switch-2-performance-issues-right-now">working hard on Switch 2 performance issues</a>, so hopefully we won't have to sacrifice picture clarity for too long.</p>
<p><em>Have you been playing Hitman: World of Assassination? Tempted to drop the resolution down for some extra frames? Let us know!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Ubisoft Massive announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> will receive a major update on December 5, its third anniversary. The date has also been chosen because it is exactly two weeks before the theatrical release of Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third movie in the franchise. </p>



<p>The update's main highlight is the addition of a full-fledged third-person camera. As you might recall, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was first-person only, which certainly turned at least a few gamers away for various reasons (motion sickness being one of the most obvious). </p>



<p>With third-person mode, players will be able to experience Pandora from a whole new perspective at the push of a button. Whether they're exploring, fighting, or simply taking in the view, the third-person mode brings a new sense of scale, freedom, and immersion. Ubisoft Massive reworked the animations, controls, audio, and camera systems to make the experience seamless and intuitive.</p>



<p>The upcoming update will also add another highly requested feature, New Game+, which allows players to replay the story while keeping their inventory and skills. They will face tougher enemies and unlock a brand-new skill tree and more powerful gear. It's a fresh challenge for seasoned players looking to delve deeper into the world of Pandora.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Omar Bouali, Creative Director at Massive, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We’ve always envisioned Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora as a living world that evolves with our players. This update is a celebration of our community’s passion and we’re thankful to our players for their support—it means the world to our team.</em></p>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is also having a limited-time sale on various platforms. For example, on Steam, you can get any version of the game at 70% off through July 31. The Gold and Ultimate Edition provide access to the two story DLC packs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-the-sky-breaker-story-pack-is-out-on-july-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sky Breaker</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secrets of the Spires</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-to-add-new-game-plus-and-more-in-december.1248921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced a new update for&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, and the studio has promised to add two of the features most requested by the game's community.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/AvatarFrontiers/status/1947325865982914631" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a>, the update, which is due to arrive on December 5th, will add a New Game Plus mode to the first-person shooter, so you'll be able to tackle its story again with all of your equipment and skills intact.</p>

<p>New Game Plus will, however, also bring tougher enemies and a higher level of overall challenge, so you'll need to take advantage of the stronger gear and new skill tree offered by the mode in order to prevail.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-new-game-plus-mech.jpg?itok=MGTm52Cw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-new-game-plus-mech.jpg?itok=6VlH0YTK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>is getting a big new update in December.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the New Game Plus mode, you're also getting a third-person view option, allowing you to see your character as you explore the lush environments of Pandora. Honestly, I'm surprised there was no third-person view mode to start with, but better late than never, I guess.</p>

<p>According to Massive Entertainment, various gameplay systems in <i>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</i>have been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-brings-third-person-and-new-game-plus-modes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reworked</a> in order to ensure a "seamless and intuitive" experience while playing in third-person, so it shouldn't just feel like a tacked-on extra.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why it's going to take so long for the update to arrive, it's probably because Ubisoft wants to time the release as close to the launch of the upcoming third&nbsp;<em>Avatar&nbsp;</em>movie as possible.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-gets-gameplay-debut-and-december-7-release-date" rel="nofollow">released on December 7th back in 2023</a>, so while this update won't land exactly on the game's second anniversary, it'll be close enough to be considered a celebration anyway.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While those attempts to censor through manufactured controversy failed, Collective Shout may be having more success directly targeting payment processing companies which have been cracking down on pornography across the the broader web on creator platforms like OnlyFans. Earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/fansly-ban-furries-new-rules/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/fansly-ban-furries-new-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fansly banned any sexualized “anthropomorphic content”</a></span> in an apparent bid to censor bestiality on the platform, despite that being condemned within the furry community as well. Instead of nuanced moderation, some platforms appear to be making more drastic shifts to appease payment companies.</p><p>That’s the concern around the recent purge of sex games on Steam. In addition to bans on games that use crypto currencies or feature “sexually explicit images of real people,” Valve added the much more ambiguous restriction against “Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content.”</p><p>The new guideline coincided with Vavle removing games from Steam with titles like <em>Incest Tales: Webcam Daughter</em> and <em>Reincarnation in another world going to rape All NPCs VR.</em> But others with genre tags that still mentioned things like incest were left untouched, spreading confusion about where exactly Valve was drawing the line. It was also unclear why Valve was only taking action now despite this type of porn-slop, including some truly vile sounding games, have routinely crept onto the storefront. Instead of Valve banning a sexual assault sim called <em>No Mercy</em> earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725">it was voluntarily withdrawn</a></span> from Steam by its creators.</p><figure id="" data-id="70e31955596f463b5ce3ab176f0a5ea1" data-recommend-id="image://70e31955596f463b5ce3ab176f0a5ea1" data-format="png" data-width="1533" data-height="818" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an explicit game bundle on Steam.

Does it review games for infringing content first? Does it ban things based on how they look or sound and then wait for the creators to appeal later? And is it working off of clear guidelines from payment companies? It’s that type of moderation mess that risks censoring various game-based works of art simply because someone in a position of power might go “ick,” or, even worse, they saw someone making noise about it on social media and didn’t want to get caught up in the drama.</p><p>That’s certainly the approach that the owners of <em>Vice</em>, which originally broke the story on Collective Shout’s relationship to the changes, appears to have taken. Savage Ventures, which invested in Vice after it went bankrupt, was accused by Valens of being behind the removal of two of her articles about the topic. “Vice’s owner Savage Ventures has requested the removal of my Collective Shout articles,” she posted on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky over the weekend</a></span>. “This is due to concerns about the controversial subject matter—not journalistic complaints.”</p><p>In the meantime, Collective Shout cofounder Melinda Tankard Reist <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MelTankardReist/status/1946147654616104963&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MelTankardReist/status/1946147654616104963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is calling</a></span> those critical of Valve’s decision “porn sick brain rotted pedo gamer fetishists.” While the organization’s initial letter accused Steam of hosting hundreds of games that would “breach Australian classification laws,” Collective Shout has so far declined to name any specific examples. “Most of the content found within the games, including the graphics and the developers descriptions, are too distressing for us to make public,” it wrote. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-sex-censorship-hentai-gta-5-collective-shout-1851786636]]></content:encoded>
