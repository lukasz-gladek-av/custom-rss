Whether it’s new ideas springing from the deep recesses of his dreams (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/watching-inception-in-fortnite-is-weird-but-doesnt-mak-1844175790&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/watching-inception-in-fortnite-is-weird-but-doesnt-mak-1844175790"><em>Inception</em></a></span>) to his own takes on comic book icons (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/batman-best-keaton-nolan-pattinson-movies-1851660049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/batman-best-keaton-nolan-pattinson-movies-1851660049"><em>Batman</em></a></span><em> </em>trilogy) and figures from history, you can expect elite filmmaking. But that doesn’t mean the director isn’t capable of surprises.</p><p>Across his illustrious body of work that includes two Academy Awards, a Golden Globe, and billions at the box office, Nolan’s movies typically deal with damaged and haunted individuals who develop borderline unhealthy obsessions, and his stories encompass ideas like time, memory, perception, and sometimes most of all, guilt. These are often reflected in the meticulously methodical structure of his movies; most of Nolan’s movies are plotted all over the place, breathlessly zig-zagging between past and present. But, like the insides of a Swiss watch, every piece plays a part that contributes to a unified whole. </p><p> All of this results in a director who doesn’t seem to have a capital-B Bad movie in his career of two and a half decades. You can debate preferences and question his creative choices, but there aretsi few filmmakers alive whose output is as consistent as Nolan. With news of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/christopher-nolan-matt-damon-oppenheimer-2026-1851669014&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/christopher-nolan-matt-damon-oppenheimer-2026-1851669014">new Nolan joint</a></span> now in the works, let’s look back and rank the director’s movies from “worst” (a relative term, admittedly) to best.</p></div></div><div><p>Excluding his shorts, like the surreal <em>Doodlebug</em>, you’ll not find Christopher Nolan in a rawer state than his 1998 film <em>Following. </em>An impressive debut from an artist still finding his voice, <em>Following </em>centers on a nameless writer (Jeremy Theobald) whose habit of following strangers in London gets him dragged into a serial robber’s schemes. It is a lean and mean 70-minute neo-noir, one that “represents the peak” of what he could do “using [my] own resources,” according <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/jUpA7Qma_9E?si=eHfuivTzfow8Pn_3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/jUpA7Qma_9E?si=eHfuivTzfow8Pn_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to Nolan in a 2014 <em>VICE</em> interview</a></span>.</p><p><em>Following </em>sees Nolan as his own cinematographer, relying on natural lighting and employing an abundance of close-ups and vérité movement – techniques evocative of the French New Wave than the studio formalism he’ll come to have. <em>Following</em> may not blow anyone away with the power of a thousand suns, but it’s undeniably the work of a storyteller already assured in themselves to draw in attention. </p></div><div><p>Inspired by frosty brilliance of the original 1997 thriller <em>Insomnia</em>, Nolan got behind the wheel of the official American remake with Al Pacino. Beyond the finer details getting domestic relocations – Pacino’s sleepless cop now hails from L.A., and his new surroundings are now rustic Alaska – <em>Insomnia</em> sees Nolan waddle deep into the dadcore genre territory.</p><p>Its central story, laced with taboo and marinated in regret, is intriguing but ultimately just functional. If not for its actors like Pacino (who plays “exhausted” so well you’re almost convinced he’s really an insomniac), Hillary Swank (as a local cop whose wide-eyed enthusiasm becomes squinting suspicion), and Robin Williams (playing against type as a middle-aged creep), <em>Insomnia</em> would be indistinguishable from other middling HBO prestige dramas. It scratches nearly all the itches for those who devour dog-eared hardboiled paperbacks, and to be clear, it’s very good. But one might expect it would be better than the sum of its parts. </p></div><div><p>It’s a fine finale to a seismic trilogy, but <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is not without chinks in Batman’s Nomex suit. The follow-up to 2008's smash <em>The Dark Knight</em> and conclusion to all that began with 2005's <em>Batman Begins</em>, <em>The Dark Knight</em> <em>Rises</em> sees Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) come out of self-imposed exile to stand up to Bane (Tom Hardy), a swollen masked warlord who overtakes Gotham City. Woven into the story is Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman, a femme fatale thief who initially antagonizes before aiding Batman.</p><p>While echoes of DC’s comics lore are more present than ever, namely Frank Miller’s <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em> and the multi-author storylines “Knightfall” and “No Man’s Land,” <em>Rises</em> remains a Nolan special, a superhero event film steadfast in its War on Terror and Occupy era verisimilitude. But it’s not invincible. Its poorly-aged finale features cops in a ground war, and Bane’s falsehoods about his populist messaging (plus his fingers on a nuclear trigger) don’t make his cause in toppling the elite class any less unsavory. And sure, there’s endless opportunity for nitpicking. (How <em>does</em> Bruce get back to Gotham from The Pit?)</p><p>But <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is triumphant in its Pyrrhic victory, a story of legacies made immortal in ideas over people. When Bane scorns to Batman, “Peace has cost you your strengh. Victory has defeated you,” it is perhaps Nolan’s most self-reflective moment yet. After 2010's <em>Inception</em>, Nolan was a newly-minted auteur. <em>The Dark Knight Rises </em>is Nolan striving to say he’s not a fluke, that victory hasn’t defeated him, and his work bends over backwards to the point of breakage to prove it.</p></div><div><p>When the enemy is unseen, you can be certain they’re always closing in. Nolan’s 2017 war drama <em>Dunkirk</em> takes after Operation Dynamo where over 330,000 Allied soldiers escaped the beaches of Dunkirk, France – fated to suffer full Nazi occupation – between May and June 1940. Through Nolan’s eyes, however, absent are the sepia-hued heroisms and noble sacrifices of standard-issue World War II dramas. Instead there’s selfish desperation, the brutality of survival, the urgency of a ticking clock (quite literally <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVWTQcZbLgY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVWTQcZbLgY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">underscored by Hans Zimmer</a></span>), and the ever-dwindling light of hope. All the more interesting that not once are the words “Nazi” or “Nazi Germans” said aloud, an intentional choice.</p><p>Opening with a soldier whose name we barely know (played by Fionn Whitehead), <em>Dunkirk</em> takes a disorienting view through several perspectives to bear witness to a wartime miracle. Light on dialogue and character and very heavy on suspense, <em>Dunkirk</em> is a sobering portrait of a war rendered too familiar by countless stories and retrospective fetishizing. It’s only really questionable that Nolan’s continued love affair for the spectacle-oriented IMAX format is deployed in a movie that’s not one for spectacle at all.</p></div><div><p>It’s hard to remember the eye-opening revelation <em>Batman Begins</em> was in 2005. It is in large part Nolan’s doing. In a time when the superhero genre still had new frontiers and when “gritty origin stories” were novel, Nolan’s <em>Batman Begins</em> ventured beyond its contemporaries to redefine its subject IP. Sure, Batman had many movies under his utility belt, and Tim Burton already drenched the Caped Crusader in shadows back in 1989. But <em>Begins</em> was a different beast, essentially <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> in a cape.</p><p>With Bale in the lead role, a new, modernized Batman swooped into post-9/11 theaters like a tactical ninja, driving around a “Batmobile” that wrecked cop cars with the rolling thunder of army tanks. Yet Nolan’s grounded interpretation of the World’s Greatest Detective – a man so traumatized by his family’s murders he goes to train at a monastery – is hardly embarrassed by its source material. For better or worse, <em>Batman Begins</em> shaped the modern superhero tentpole for the next ten years, maybe more. </p></div><div><p>Nolan’s sophomore movie <em>Memento</em> officially put him on the map. Even now, it is arguably his definitive treatise on memory, trust, truth, and identity. Conceived over a road trip with brother Jonathan Nolan (himself a successful TV producer whom he’s collaborated with across his work) <em>Memento</em> traces the tense efforts of an insurance investigator (Guy Pearce) to piece together who killed his wife while suffering from a rare form of amnesia.</p><p>When all laid out, as others have – like Andy Klein in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.salon.com/2001/06/28/memento_analysis/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.salon.com/2001/06/28/memento_analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a memorable 2001 article</a></span> for <em>Salon</em> – its non-linear plot with alternating color and black-and-white scenes (<em>Oppenheimer</em> says hi!) come across like a comically advanced class in neuropsychology. But past its Byzantine nature is a storyteller afforded far more resources than he had on <em>Following</em>. Nolan takes advantage of his upgraded arsenal, especially a roster of studied Hollywood actors like Pearce, Joe Pantoliano, Stephen Tobolowsky, and <em>The Matrix</em>’s Carrie-Ann Moss, which crucially demonstrate the <em>other</em> puzzle piece that’s made his career so prolific: getting the best performances out of his actors. It’s one thing to make a good, cerebral movie like <em>Following </em>your first one. It’s another to do it again, with even more eyes watching you.</p></div><div><p><em>Tenet</em> revolves around John David Washington’s “The Protagonist” (cue cheers), a CIA agent recruited into a mission to prevent World War III. He is armed with some unique tools, primarily the inverted entropy of objects, but also a friend named Neil (Robert Pattinson). Though <em>Tenet</em>’s inversion motif is hammered at every way (see: the title), it was a balm for anyone fatigued by hegemonic tentpoles. It is opaque, obnoxiously so, and buoyed by the machismo of its exhilarating physics-be-damned set-pieces which come off like <em>Call of Duty</em> by way of Andrei Tarkovsky. </p><p>But the movie’s silver bullet rests in the melodrama of Kat Barton (Elizabeth Debicki), a key character dead set on escaping her abusive marriage to a criminal oligarch (Kenneth Branagh in a Cold War-era Russian accent). Through her, <em>Tenet</em> turns transformative, serving up a story that blurs determinism and free will to posit that whatever we must do, we’re already capable of. <em>Tenet </em>is a James Bond-style summer action thriller, and a good one that comes sharply dressed in arthouse themes.</p></div><div><p>Filmmakers are like magicians. Both practice deception and illusion entwined with vision. One year after blowing up the box office with <em>Batman Begins</em>, Nolan reunited with Christian Bale and Michael Caine and mused over this parallel with <em>The Prestige</em>. Based on the 1995 novel by Christopher Priest, the movie follows rival magicians (Bale and Hugh Jackman) in an escalating and eventually lethal game of one-upmanship in late Victorian London.</p><p>Nolan goes meta with the help of Caine, who narrates in character (as a stage engineer and pseudo-mentor to the main protagonists) and verbally outlines the three-act execution of a magician’s – <em>and </em>filmmaker’s – “magic trick.” No spoilers, but even the first five minutes are deceptive, making repeat viewings both rewarding and almost necessary. Years on, out of all of Nolan’s films, <em>The Prestige</em> has mysteriously fallen off most people’s memories. But it deserves recognition as one of Nolan’s better offerings, being an overall magnificent production for grown-ups that illuminates the director’s increasing maturity and refinement of his voice at the studio level. <em>The Prestige</em> may be one big bag of tricks, but don’t say you weren’t fooled.</p></div><div><p> Purposefully designed as Nolan’s homage to Michael Mann’s <em>Heat</em>, <em>The Dark Knight</em> synthesizes Nolan’s artistic influences with the seminal Batman graphic novels <em>The Long Halloween</em> and <em>The Killing Joke</em> to become its own sweeping crime epic that wholly defined the late-aughts zeitgeist. This time, the Batman teams with principled district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to stop The Joker (Heath Ledger) who burns down Gotham’s criminal underworld.</p><p>Ledger’s death undoubtedly lent a macabre aura to his mesmerizing performance. But <em>The Dark Knight</em> is a monumental feature from top to bottom. It’s evidence that 21st century box office juggernauts can still deliver the heat and have a thing or two to say about domestic terrorism, the chaos of vigilantism, and the failures of government institutions to keep order. Amid the uncertainty of the global financial crisis, the world flocked to theaters for safety in Batman’s shadows. You couldn’t make another movie <em>The Dark Knight</em> anymore – not because the people don’t want one, but because no one can repeat its magic again. Not even Nolan could. </p></div><div><p><em>Interstellar</em>, Nolan’s ninth film, is easily among his best. Matthew McConaughey takes lead as a widowed NASA pilot who, in our desolate future, rediscovers the agency’s remnants and is tasked with leading a mission to find humanity’s new home.</p><p>Between its holy depictions of space and black holes, and an all-time score by Hans Zimmer, <em>Interstellar</em> is an achievement in its marriage of science and art. It’s a movie brimming with urgency about our climate apocalypse while insisting we take pause and look up at the sky to wonder what else we’re meant to see. It is also his most romantic movie to date, even though that’s not what it sounds like. As verbalized by Anne Hathaway as Dr. Amelia Brand, who utters the greatest line in any Nolan movie: “Love is the one thing we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can’t understand it.”</p></div><div><p>Imagine <em>you </em>are Christopher Nolan, pitching Warner Bros. to give you millions to make <em>Inception</em>. How would you describe it? “<em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> meets <em>The Matrix</em>”? Maybe. The point is that <em>Inception </em>is a film where words fail to properly describe its brilliance because we know now what finely-executed masterclass it is. We have the benefit of making sense of Nolan’s otherwise incomprehensible screenplay because we’ve literally <em>seen</em> his vision.</p><p>Conceived by Nolan over a decade, but possible only after he’d worked on big budget productions, <em>Inception</em> is a heist set in the world of corporate espionage and in the more endless realms of dreams. Leonardo DiCaprio, at this stage matured as an actor whose involvement implies faith in the material, stars as the troubled extractor Cobb who just wants to get back home to his kids. <em>Inception </em>is, in hindsight, Nolan’s true coming-out party. It’s a cerebral genre-bender – including faint whispers of its original intentions as a horror movie – that rocked audiences en masse without intellectual property branding. </p><p>If it’s been awhile since you’ve seen <em>Inception</em>, go back to it. You might be taken surprise by clear, concise, and even playful it remains.</p></div><div><p>All those “Barbenheimer” memes were good fun. Pastels, hot pinks, and Ryan Gosling’s singing canceled out whatever pitch-black moods were wrought by <em>Oppenheimer</em>. But no movie by Nolan feels as contemplative and introspective yet simultaneously so expansive quite like his biopic of the man who built the atomic bomb.</p><p><em>Oppenheimer</em> casts recurring Nolan collaborator Cillian Murphy in the title role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the real-life physicist who oversaw the making of the atomic bomb that ended World War II – and subsequently spent his life trying in futility to halt the nuclear arms race. In his main character, along with antagonistic Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) whose perceived sleights against him drives the movie’s conflicts, Nolan unspools the United States’ aggressive evolution into a global superpower. A whole nation mistaken in its notions that peace is achievable only when it holds the biggest guns towards everyone else’s heads.</p><p>Boasting all of Nolan’s hallmarks, includinnon-linear plotting, expressionism mixed with hyper-realism, anxious concerns for time and timing, and obsessions that breed destruction, <em>Oppenheimer</em> often feels like Nolan’s style perfected at the molecular level and refined to a single shell. I could keep going with bomb metaphors, but the simple truth is that <em>Oppenheimer</em> is a modern masterpiece that shoulders so much more than the life of one complicated man who seeks to reconcile his actions with his intentions. Even if it didn’t sweep the Oscars, <em>Oppenheimer</em> is an overwhelming experience that leaves all shocked and awed. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The interconnectivity of video games is greater than it ever has been. Marvel Rivals is the definition of a AAA blockbuster in gaming, and having some kind of crossplay, cross-progression, or cross-platform integration would be ideal.</p>



<p>Growing up, I hated the fact I couldn’t play with or against my friends who had different consoles. It also sucked that if I owned a game on two consoles, I couldn’t carry my progress across. In 2024, this ideology is practically redundant as most online multiplayer titles have some form of cross-platform capabilities.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> isn’t just an online multiplayer hero shooter, it is shaping up to be one of the most prominent and significant in recent times. Having cross-platform functionality can only improve the overall experience, and I have some interesting news for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-crossplay">Is Marvel Rivals Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PlayStation, Xbox, and PC come together? Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is set to feature fully integrated crossplay at launch, allowing players on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC to play with each other.</strong></p>



<p>The news was confirmed by Rivals’ executive producer Danny Koo in an interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-qa-netease-talks-about-the-heroes-hybrid-roles-opposed-to-hard-tank-dps-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wccftech</a>. Discussing crossplay, Koo reiterated Marvel Rivals is coming to “PC, Xbox, and PlayStation,” and when queried on “cross-platform play between them,” Koo replied, “<strong>Yes, and we’ll be cross-play in beta as well.</strong>“</p>



<p>The beta—in the aftermath of this interview—did indeed feature crossplay, meaning it’s <strong>all but confirmed we’re getting Marvel Rivals crossplay when the hero shooter goes live on Dec. 6.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-does-marvel-rivals-have-cross-progression">Does Marvel Rivals have cross-progression?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, Marvel Rivals likely won’t support cross-progression—at least in its launch phase.</strong></p>



<p>In an Oct. 17 interview, this time with game director Guangyun Chen, for <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-devs-still-dont-know-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, he said “<strong>For now, we have no cross-progression.</strong> As we only have around two months to go global launch, we are doing the final tech check to see what we can do and how we can process it. The workload is a lot more than we thought at the beginning.”</p>



<p>Chen later confirmed cross-progression is one of the most sought-after features by the community, and the team “are still having internal discussions.” For now, we’ll go on the assumption Marvel Rivals has no cross-progression at launch. Do keep checking back for the latest developments on the topic though, as it could be added as a last-minute surprise—or as a post-launch update.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s good news on the crossplay front at least. Are you disappointed there’s probably no cross-progression in Marvel Rivals? Will it put you off buying the shooter?

            <p>
Open world pocket monster survival game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> will gain a major new update in December, that adds its largest new landmass yet. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld has also announced the game's first big brand crossover, too - a tie-up with hit indie crafting game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a>. Exactly what this will entail remains to be seen, but artwork posted to social media this week shows characters from the two games interacting ahead of the crossover happening at some point in 2025.

<p>
Before that, December's content update will add a new island to Palworld, that's "the largest, harshest, and most mysterious new island" yet, according to a social media <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861922963936923656">post</a> by developer Pocketpair. </p>
<p>For scale, the area will be "about six times more than Sakurajima!!!" the company continued. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld is also currently 25 percent off, presumably in time for Black Friday, and before Nintendo's lawsuit risks the game getting shut down.

Of course, all of this is happening while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo readies its legal might to take on Palworld and developer Pocketpair</a> over claims the latter has infringed on a number of gameplay patents. These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">patents include recently-filed designs that cover the throwing of a Pokéball-like object to capture a creature</a>, something that both Pokémon (obviously) and Palworld both contain.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">seeking injunction against Palworld's sale (at least in Japan) plus a fine and damages</a>, Pocketpair itself stated earlier this month. Pocketpair has said repeatedly it will fight the case.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-gran-turismo-7-pssr-8k/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/">Gran Turismo 7</a> implementation of the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler is among the best we have seen to date, despite some issues, a new analysis revealed.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> shared their analysis of the PlayStation 5 Pro patch of the latest entry in the series by Polyphony Digital, going over all the enhancements, which include full ray tracing support for both races and replays, PSSR implementation, an 8K mode and a slew of PS VR 2 improvements. Interestingly enough, users are limited to using the PSSR upscaler only if they want to experience ray tracing in cockpit view, most likely due to how demanding it is. In every other scenario, users can either use PSSR or the original TAA option with or without ray tracing.</p>
<p>With the PlayStation 5 Pro exclusive upscaler, the image is reconstructed to 4K resolution from resolutions that can go as low as 1080p, producing a good result but not the best possible one, as, for example, thin objects show additional shimmering and noise, which can be distracting. In some scenarios, image quality takes a big hit due to visual artifacts, such as tail lights with ray tracing enabled getting rendered in a noisy mess. TAA shows none of these issues, delivering a slightly better image quality overall.</p>
<p>Where the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler seems to deliver in Gran Turismo 7 is in the 8K mode. In this mode, the image is reconstructed from a 4K resolution to an 8K resolution, delivering very solid results that further highlight how the higher the base resolution is, the better the upscaler works. Given how an 8K screen is required for this mode, not many users, however, will be able to experience this mode.</p>
<p>The Gran Turismo 7 PlayStation 5 Pro patch analysis by Digital Foundry also covers the aforementioned new ray tracing features, which greatly elevate the visual experience, and the PS VR 2 enhancements, which further improve what is still the killer app for the headset. You can watch the analysis in full below.</p>

<p>Gran Turismo 7 is only one of the games that benefits from the PlayStation 5 Pro's increased power over the base model and its exclusive features.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cloud-imperium-games-lets-go-some-staff-following-citizencon.1047399/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-layoffs-report/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following a hectic period before Citizencon, during which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staff were mandated to work 7-day work weeks</a>, Cloud Imperium Games have just reportedly laid off some of its staff.</p>



<p>The information comes from an <a href="https://x.com/Gillyburd1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ex-CIG employee</a>, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to say that their former employer “is letting a lot of staff go over the last two days with zero compensation right after working them to the bone without even much as a thanks,” and that a “formal announcement” should be “soon.”</p>



<p>Speaking with our own sources, we can confirm that Cloud Imperium Games has been letting some of its staff go these past couple of days, but we’re currently unable to verify the extent of the layoffs. At the time of writing, several sources said the layoffs have mainly affected the studio’s QA department and that the number of those laid off isn’t as large as initially made out to be, with one source estimating around a dozen currently affected (around 1% of its total workforce). </p>



<p>That being said, it’s still early days fairly early days yet, and Cloud Imperium Games has a history of laying off its staff over an extended period. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CIG quietly laid off an estimated 100 or so staff members</a> at its Austin and LA offices which took weeks and  even making affected employees sign NDAs to prevent them from talking about being laid off.</p>



<p>Cloud Imperium Games has yet to make an internal or public announcement to its staff on the layoffs and any possible restructuring. </p>



<p>We will update this article as we hear more.</p>



<hr>



<p>Both current and former employees of Cloud Imperium Games can contact me securely and anonymously at&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="e0948f8d948f8d88858e848592938f8ea090928f948f8e8d81898cce838f8d">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&nbsp;as I continue to investigate the company’s issues.</p>

The game quickly settled on the dreaded ‘overwhelmingly negative’ Steam user review rating, a clear sign to anyone who visited its Steam page that something was very wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Guildford, England-based Hello Games has continued to update No Man’s Sky over the years, improving player sentiment to the point where it is now considered superb. It took two years to hit ‘mixed,’ then another three to hit ‘mostly positive.’ At the time, five years after launch, Tim Woodley, Head of Publishing at Hello Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-gets-mostly-positive-steam-review-5-years">explained how hard it was to claw back Steam user reviews from such a low base</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Over the last five years we've moved from 'overwhelmingly negative' to 'mostly positive,’ it's an incredible achievement for the team,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Moving to 'mixed', which may seem funny to celebrate, took two years of hard work. Moving from ‘mixed’ to ‘mostly positive’ has taken the last three years (knowing that any small mistake along the way may result in backlash and negative reviews).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In some ways, it's easy to dismiss Steam reviews, it's a bit of meme to share the silly ones, but as a developer, they are undeniably meaningful. For five years now if someone bought No Man's Sky they had to do it in spite of a red or yellow warning symbol beside our name (and affecting the likelihood algorithm in charge of displaying the name in the first place).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The team is really chuffed today at hitting this milestone but we also owe a huge thank you to the community, the players, but also folks like yourself who continue to support us to do this work we enjoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each percentage point becomes exponentially harder to earn as you move up the ratings. Moving from 20% positive to 21% positive may only require a few hundred positive reviews whereas moving from 69% to 70% needed 10,000 positive reviews. This is why it's so rare for games to change their All-Time rating and why we'd assumed that we might never be able to."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, three years after that milestone, No Man’s Sky is on ‘very positive.’ Next stop, ‘overwhelmingly positive?’</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/hQcPpQ8ILM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/hQcPpQ8ILM</a> <a href="https://t.co/69AjoB48NY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/69AjoB48NY</a></p>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1862085950181892131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Games chief Sean Murray, who had come under fire upon Hello Games’ launch for failing to deliver on features he’d talked up in pre-release interviews, hailed the game’s new Steam user review rating. “Holy shit you guys - it happened,” he tweeted. “ALL REVIEWS: Very Positive.

Target is one of the most popular retailers for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Black Friday</a>, and one thing I've learned over the years of finding deals is that it knows how to put on a good sale. This year, Target has come out the gate swinging with outstanding Black Friday deals on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPbP6W?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNDPKE?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5 consoles</a>, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDPMO?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Meta Quest 3S VR headset</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rayban-meta-wayfarer-smart-glasses-black-friday-deal-2024">Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer smart glasses</a>. It's also a great one-stop shop for holiday gift ideas like a new Apple iPad or a pair of AirPods, Pokemon TCG sets, LEGOs, toys, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Target is one of my favorite shopping sites, both in-store and online. Its prices are very competitive, its return policy is generous, and it has plenty of retail locations so that buying online and picking up in-store is a convenient option. Target offers great exclusive discounts via its <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6nPw?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target Circle membership</a>, and best of all, joining is free. There is a paid upgrade that's worth it for regular Target shoppers similar to Amazon Prime or Walmart+, and it's on sale for Black Friday as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update: Target's most popular deals, like the Nintendo Switch bundles and Apple devices are going out of stock quickly. I expect some (but not all) of these deals to return on Black Friday, if not sooner.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Friday is like a bonus holiday for Pokémon TCG fans. We're talking about deck building, chasing rare cards, or just stockpiling boosters for a rainy day.

We've added all of the ones that are shown in the ad scan that have been discounted, but expect to see even more sets on sale in the coming days. The best deal right now - a LEGO City Space Science Lab for only $19.99 (originally $35) - would make a great gift for kids. At an average cost of a mere 3.5 cents per brick, this deal is a phenomenal value.</p></div><p id="lego-sets"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="LEGO Sets">More Black Friday LEGO Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="19e8ee55-2ffc-4ace-a6aa-1417133b8b05" id="211553"><div id="211553" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Console</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony released their entire set of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">Black Friday PlayStation deals</a> last week and most major retailers have followed suit. The best deal is definitely on the consoles themselves: the PS5 Slim Disc Edition has dropped to $424.99 (originally $500) and the PS5 Slim Digital Edition has dropped to $374.99 (originally $450). I would choose the Disc Edition because it's only $50 more and then I have the option to buy (and later sell or trade) physical disc media. Target doesn't carry the "Fortnite Cobalt Star" bundle but all that includes is a couple of Fortnite skins and in-game currency. If you want to save some money and go the Digital Edition route, I would suggest getting the NBA 2K25 bundle, which also includes a game.</p></div><p id="playstation-5-console"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="PlayStation 5 Console">More PlayStation Black Friday Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="56b24fb1-b74e-4b45-8835-20eee9ba9746" id="211428"><div id="211428" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Outlaws was released only 3 months ago, and it's already 33% off for Black Friday.

Alas, Target (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-breaks-nintendo-amazon-freeze-black-friday">but not Amazon, due to their supposedly shaky relationship</a>) has just knocked another $75 off the price tag.

This is Apple's best watch, with a titanium case that's more rugged and corrosion resistant than the softer aluminum casing found in most Apple Watches. Pure titanium (not titanium "coated") metal is considerably more expensive and is one of the main reasons why the Apple Watch Ultra commands a high price tag. The size of the case is also larger at 49mm (compared to 41mm-45mm for the Series 8). Other upgrades over the Series 8 include a brighter display protected by a scratch resistant sapphire crystal face, a precise dual-frequency GPS, beam-forming triple microphone array, dual speakers, up to 36 hours of battery life, up to 100m (300ft) of water resistance, a customizable physical action button next to the crown, and a built-in Oceanic+ app that literally puts a dive computer on your wrist. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/28/steam-autumn-sale-black-friday-best-deals/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The traditional <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-sale">Steam Autumn Sale</a> is now on, coinciding with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> sales bonanza that everyone is throwing right about now, and there’s thousands of games now on offer with discounts from a token 10% off through to huge 90% off firesales.</p>
<p>You can just<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/"> head to Steam</a> and see what they proffer up on the homepage for you, but you’d absolutely be forgiven for finding the offerings quite underwhelming. A decade ago we might be able to grab games that were barely a month or two old for £20, but now in 2024 the starting RRP of big budget games is higher, and it feels like publishers are staying fairly constrained with their percentage discounts for games that are less than five years old now.</p>


<p>That means you’ve got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/?snr=1_4_660__629">Space Marine 2 only dropping to £44 (a 20% saving)</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/?snr=1_4_660__629">Ghost of Tsushima</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?snr=1_4_660__629">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> doing the same to £40, and even though <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2679460/Metaphor_ReFantazio/?snr=1_4_660__629">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> has chopped 25% off the price, that’s still £45. Still, Metaphor is barely a month old, and it’s one of the hottest games out there.</p>
<p>but there are plenty of bargains to be found on Steam, if you know where to look. Valve prominently highlights <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/special_deals">a selection of Deep Discounts</a> many of which are 90% off and include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/812140/Assassins_Creed_Odyssey?snr=1_614_615_specialdeals_100703">AC Odyssey for £5</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172380/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Fallen_Order?snr=1_614_615_specialdeals_100703">Jedi: Fallen Order for £3.50</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379430/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance?snr=1_614_615_specialdeals_100703">Kingdom Come Deliverance for £2.64</a>. There’s also preset categories for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=ut1&amp;category1=998&amp;os=">Games Under £7</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=ut2&amp;category1=998&amp;os=">Games Under £4</a>, though you can just use the handy price slider for yourself.</p>
<p>Here’s some highlights that we reckon are worth considering, though:</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-piracy-members-subreddit/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-has-found-new-targets-in-its-war-against-piracy-including-members-of-a-certain-subreddit.1047330/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-piracy-members-subreddit/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo is about to pursue some new targets in its fight against piracy, and according to a new report, not even members of select subreddits are safe from the Japanese company.</p>
<p>As reported on <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/after-inc-plague-inc-ndemic-pandemic">Game File,</a> in a recent filing in federal court, the Japanese company revealed that its investigation against Switch modder James Williams, also known as Archbox, has given it some new targets. During the investigation, Nintendo became aware of multiple other online actors who appeared to have a role in the Pirate Shops operation conducted by Archbox, and as such, is now seeking the go-ahead from the court to subpoena business records from internet domain companies Name Cheap, Go Daddy and Tucows, Cloudflare, GitHub, Discord, Google and Reddit to identify anyone who helped the modder with their illicit activities.</p>
<p>In Reddit's case, Nintendo outright mentions a specific subreddit called SwitchPirates, which was moderated by Archbox and currently has over 200,000 members. The Japanese company also has reason to believe that the modder had multiple accounts involved with the subreddit and that other prominent members played a role in the modder's activities. Once these people have been identified, Nintendo will use the obtained information to pursue infringement claims.</p>
<p>Nintendo has been waging its war against piracy for a very long time, but its activities in this regard have been ramped up recently. This year, the Japanese company shut down the most popular Nintendo Switch emulators, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/">Yuzu</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">Ryujinx</a>, possibly to prevent the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rom-emulate/">Nintendo Switch 2 from being emulated soon after its release.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it.1047327/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We started <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-reportedly-still-due-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting</a> over a year ago that Microsoft would build an Xbox mobile store to launch this year, following rumors from The Verge's Tom Warren. Shortly after, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-looking-to-build-xbox-mobile-store-with-the-help-of-some-partners-phil-spencer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the plan was real.</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced Xbox mobile game sales via Web in July, but the real plan was to sell games directly through their Android app. Xbox president Sarah Bond previously said the goal was to start in November, but that did not happen, and the executive has now revealed why in a series of messages <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bondsarahbond.bsky.social/post/3lbxhvggn7d2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent on Blue Sky</a>.</p>
<p><em>At Xbox, we want to offer players more choice on how and where they play, including being able to play and buy games directly from the Xbox app. I recently shared our ambition to unlock these features first with the Google Play Store on Android devices in the U.S. while other app stores adapt to meet consumer demand. Due to a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts, we are currently unable to launch these features as planned. Our team has the functionality built and ready to go live as soon as the court makes a final decision. We are eager to launch and give more choice and flexibility to players.</em></p>
<p>Essentially, Google is trying to block the launch (following Judge James Donato's ruling that Android is an illegal monopoly) of this feature on the Xbox app with a temporary administrative stay ahead of their appeal. However, the Android company has shared a statement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307867/microsoft-google-xbox-game-store-android-purchase-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with The Verge</a> to illustrate its own perspective:</p>
<p><em>Microsoft has always been able to offer their Android users the ability to play and purchase Xbox games directly from their app – they’ve simply chosen not to. The Court’s order, and rush to force its implementation, threaten Google Play’s ability to provide a safe and secure experience. Microsoft, like Epic, are ignoring these very real security concerns. We remain focused on supporting an ecosystem that works for everyone, not just two of the largest game companies.</em></p>
<p>Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1861995680752918586?t=ImJiuaUBU2BX0SLRle_Ezg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was quick to jump on this response</a>, attacking Google in the process:</p>
<p><em>Google’s statement is deceitful. Shame on them. They well know that the 30% cut they demand is far more than all of the profit from game streaming. They know this because they blew hundreds of millions of dollars building the failed Stadia game business themselves.</em></p>
<p>Sweeney was, of course, leading the charge against both Google and Apple in an effort to open up their respective app stores for everyone. The Epic Games Store <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on mobile in August, bringing back Fortnite to iOS (only in Europe for now) after a lengthy and costly legal fight.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/man-in-charge-of-diablo-thinks-we-should-start-calling-games-that-he-thinks-are-like-diablo-diablo-likes.1047324/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/man-in-charge-of-diablo-thinks-we-should-start-calling-games-that-he-thinks-are-like-diablo-diablo-likes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The genre of 'Action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-best-class">Diablo 4</a> and similar games, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile">Path Of Exile</a>, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.</p>
<p>It’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Ferguson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is "like the game I make, but a bit crap".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Feels like the genre of "ARPG" is starting to mean a lot of different things," Ferguson <a href="https://x.com/RodFergusson/status/1859753130172482003">wrote on X</a> - thanks for the spot, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/diablo/diablo-boss-gets-ratiod-for-saying-we-should-normalize-diablo-like-for-arpgs-that-follow-the-diablo-formula-much-like-souls-like-and-rogue-like/">GamesRadar</a>. "Much like "Souls-like" and "Rogue-like", I wonder if we could normalize "Diablo-like" for ARPGs that follow the Diablo formula..."</p>
<p>This caused a bit of uproar in the comments, but it’s Da Musk Zone - everything from saying you like waffles to recognising the existence of trans people causes an uproar these days. One point of contention I’m a bit sympathetic to, though, is that Ferguson's suggestion does place the Diablo series in a sort of progenitor role that also assumes a level of quality. One which many don’t seem to think it deserves any more, even if the original games undoubtedly pioneered what we might call a genre.</p><p>Anyway, as usual, the one who has to step in to clear up is this mess is old muggins over here, and I say this: If it’s an RPG that features action like the action you’d find in an action game, it’s an 'Action RPG' (ARPG for short). But! If it’s an action game that features RPG elements like those you’d find in an RPG, that there is an 'ARPG', also known as an 'Action RPG'. Note, however, that neither of these describe Diablo, which has demons in it - and is therefore a Doom Clone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From teaser videos and screenshots, below, we can see a remarkable likeness to Guerrilla Games’ Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West, complete with robot beasts and a female character who weilds a bow and arrow, all in what looks like a familiar post-apocalyptic setting and art style.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Light of Motiram Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rebuild a new civilization and battle, befriend and raise various mechanimals alone or with friends in a sprawling hostile world,” Light of Motiram’s description continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked both Tencent and Sony for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horizon isn’t the only game Light of Motiram is being compared to. Given its base building, survival mechanics, and resource gathering gameplay, as well as the ability to tame "mechanimals," many are pointing out similarities with Pocketpair’s smash hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a>, which itself was accused of "ripping off" Pokémon. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company eventually launched a lawsuit against Pocketpair accusing the company of patent infringement, legal action Pocketpair has vowed to fight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Can I be the first to say it???" one Steam user said. "hahahh I mean it's obvious right? I don't need to say it. This is Palworld all over again."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I honestly think this is far more blatant than even Palworld," said another. "Horizon 3 - let’s go!" said an X / Twitter user. "Disgusting rip-off," <a href="https://x.com/Maanlosi/status/1862086620561789224" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added another</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/28/h-lol-1732793707107.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Light of Motiram. Image credit: Polaris Quest.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Light of Motiram is also being compared to Capcom's Monster Hunter and a number of other games that feature a similar aesthetic and gameplay mechanics. The inevitable question Sony and Tencent face now is whether the PlayStation maker will take any action against Light of Motiram. Guerrilla is of course working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">a multiplayer, live service Horizon game</a>, which you wouldn't be surprised to see look like Light of Motiram when Sony eventually makes its announcement. In that context, Sony probably won't look too kindly upon what Tencent is doing here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Light of Motiram is due out on PC and mobile at some point in 2025. It will be free-to-play and playable solo or with up to nine other friends per server, with full crossplay enabled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 to Be Revealed in January for a March 2025 Release – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-to-be-revealed-in-january-for-a-march-2025-release-%E2%80%93-rumor.1047306/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console will be unveiled sometime in January and will be released only two months after its reveal, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported in a new video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintyPrime">Nintendo Prime</a>, a rumor discovered on Weibo suggests the new Nintendo console will be finally revealed in January for a March 2025 release, possibly towards the end of the month. As for production and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-shipments-7-million/">shipment of units</a>, over 650,000 units have already been shipped in various regions, and a huge quantity of components has been produced since September.</p>
<p><iframe title="RUMOR: Nintendo Switch 2 is Releasing in March 2025!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tItqYDzDoIE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While a random post on a Chinese forum is generally not a very reliable source, things are different in this particular case. As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1h1bmwo/update_on_the_rumor_switch_2_will_be_revealed_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, this user got a lot of Nintendo announcements right before they were made in the past and has since deleted all of their posts. Some of the announcements that were gotten right were pretty difficult to guess, such as The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky The First remake announcement, so it definitely looks like this user has access to insider information in some way.</p>
<p>Despite the source of the rumor looking reliable, we have to take what they have revealed about the Nintendo Switch 2 with a grain of salt until the system is finally revealed and dated, which shouldn't take too long if these rumors are correct. We will keep you updated on the matter as soon as possible, so stay tuned.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-when-doctor-doom-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/do-we-know-when-doctor-doom-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals.1047303/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-when-doctor-doom-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Victor von Doom is just as menacing as his name suggests, and the villain—sometimes anti-hero—is a natural fit for Marvel Rivals. We already know the imperious presence of the doctor is confirmed, so let’s check out the latest on his arrival and see if he needs an appointment.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has a blockbuster, star-studded cast of characters befitting of a Marvel shooter. Meaning, that it makes sense to have (arguably) one of the most influential and memorable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-characters-are-in-marvel-rivals-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters</a> in the biggest attempt to date to bring the epic universe to games.</p>



<p>It’s no secret Doctor Doom is coming to Marvel Rivals, that much is certain. However, a lot of confusion is directed toward his potential debut—let’s take a look.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-doctor-doom-coming-to-marvel-rivals">When is Doctor Doom coming to Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The faces of evil. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Neither NetEase nor Marvel has given an official launch date for Doctor Doom in Marvel Rivals—and there aren’t even any leaks to give us a glimmer of hope.</p>



<p>The lack of a Doctor Doom announcement is bizarre given the character’s eponymous trailer back on July 26: “Marvel Rivals | Cinematic Trailer | No One Rivals Doom.” While the majority of the trailer features an array of the Rivals stars fighting each other, the main focus is on Doctor Doom.</p>



<p>Curiously, he doesn’t feature on the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes/index.html?heroId=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals hero page</a>—despite his trailer—and if he doesn’t appear at launch, I’d expect him to be the focal point of at least one of the first two seasons.</p>



<p>If anything spells bad news, it’s two Doctor Dooms, and yet we’re here unable to verify the launch date of one—keep checking back as we wait for official confirmation from either developer or publisher on the character’s Marvel Rivals launch.</p>

<h2 id="h-who-is-doctor-doom-in-marvel-rivals">Who is Doctor Doom in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>Doctor Doom’s origin story is as sinister and foreboding as any: His mother was taken by Mephisto, and his father succumbed to death as an indirect effect of someone else’s actions. Cue the warpath of the vicious Victor von Doom. His brilliant use of magic and a mind for inventing and creation makes Doctor Doom one of the most-feared villains in Marvel—and history, to be honest.</p>



<p>He’s a genius, and Fantastic Four lovers will be intimately acquainted with Victor as they regularly clash. Hardened fans will debate for weeks on end who the greatest supervillain in the Marvel universe is; however, you only need to check different ranking lists to see Doom’s name appear at the top—in many cases <em>the </em>top spot.</p>

<p>Do you think Doctor Doom is the greatest Marvel villain ever? Or does someone else breed evil that tiny bit better?

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> development studio Polaris Quest has announced Light of Motiram, an open-world survival crafting game with mechanised animal-like creatures which - no matter which way you shake it and squint - looks remarkably similar to Guerrilla's Horizon series, but with some additional <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> elements thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>"In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses," reads the game's official description.</p>
<p>"Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy the machination, survive with Mechanimals."</p>

<p>Light of Motiram itself promises realistic physics-based building, co-op and cross play, precise combat and "epic" fights. But, there is no denying its overall look is incredibly 'Horizon'. One image shows humans in tribal gear using bows and spears to fight off an advancing Tremortusk-like creature.</p>

<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Sony, Tencent and Pocketpair for further comment on today's announcement. Light of Motiram doesn't have a release date yet, but is coming to PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/light-of-motiram-094dff">Epic</a>.

<p>As for Guerrilla, the Sony developer seems to be done with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone">Killzone</a>, instead now favouring its Horizon series.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, art director Roy Postma said Guerrilla's decision to start working on the Horizon series was a conscious choice by the studio, and one which would see it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/killzone-developer-done-with-series-guerrilla-says-of-switch-to-horizon">move away from the darker and more violent Killzone games</a> the team was initially known for.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Microsoft says its plans to let users buy and play games directly via the Xbox app on Android are being held up by a new legal issue.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, Xbox chief Sarah Bond blamed the hold-up on "a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts". 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-games-will-soon-be-available-to-purchase-in-the-xbox-app-on-android-in-the-us">previously said it would launch the functionality</a> before the end of the month.

<p>
"At Xbox, we want to offer players more choice on how and where they play, including being able to play and buy games directly from the Xbox app," Bond <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bondsarahbond.bsky.social/post/3lbxhvgggek2k">wrote</a>. "I recently shared our ambition to unlock these features first with the Google Play Store on Android devices in the US while other app stores adapt to meet consumer demand.
</p><p>
"Due to a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts, we are currently unable to launch these features as planned. Our team has the functionality built and ready to go live as soon as the court makes a final decision. We are eager to launch and give more choice and flexibility to players."
</p>
<p>
The legal issue in question appears to be <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/">Google's 16th October appeal</a> against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-wins-major-google-lawsuit-further-opening-up-android-phones-to-third-party-stores">changes to Android and its Google Play store ordered as a result of the Google vs Epic Games lawsuit</a>.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games successfully argued that Google operated an illegal monopoly via its smartphone app store. Last month, a judge ruled that Google would now have to allow third-party storefront apps in the US next year other than the Google Play Store, and that Android users be able to pay via alternate means, rather than just Google Play Billing.
</p>
<p>
Google said it would appeal the decision as it appeared to contradict the ruling of Epic's less-successful Apple trial, that because Apple existed it did not have a monopoly, and because the changes would make Android less safe and secure for users.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Google for more.
</p>
<p>Separately, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-open-web-based-mobile-game-store-this-summer">Microsoft is also working on its own web-based Xbox mobile game store</a>, which was set to launch in the summer. In August the company stated testing had begun, but it's still unclear when it will properly launch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzards-old-manual-art-is-a-real-nostalgia-trip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzards-old-manual-art-is-a-real-nostalgia-trip.1047285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzards-old-manual-art-is-a-real-nostalgia-trip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-2-tides-darkness">Warcraft I &amp; II</a> remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, and the world will feel my pain. </p>
<p>Anyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a>, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of <a href="https://www.frazettamuseum.com/collections/framed-art">Frank Frazetta</a>'s style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">his excellent Space Marine piece</a>. </p>
<p>Anyway, a valued RPS community member <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rockpapershotgun">on the Discord</a> shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's the piece in question. Shout out to CMaster on the Discord. </p>

</figure>
<p>Thing is, I've most definetely seen this piece before, because the original <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/misc/StarCraft.PDF">Starcraft manual</a> that houses it was primo toilet reading back in the day. But it was still a shock seeing it again, especially considering how different it is to the style I associate Blizzard with currently. Here's a few more for the Zerg and Protos.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/starcraft-manual-zerg.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

The mutalisk, especially, isn't worlds away from some of Starcraft II's art. But things get really interesting when you look at a few bits from <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/misc/Warcraft%202%20Battlenet%20edition.PDF">Warcraft II's manual</a>.

</p><figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/warcraft-2-manual-orcs.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Blizzard</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure><p>

In contrast, here's a more recent orc from <a href="https://blizzard.gamespress.com/World-of-Warcraft/Focus/Warlords-of-Draenor-concept-art">Blizzard's archives</a>. As far as I can tell, it's a concept piece from the 2014 expansion Warlords Of Draenor. 

</p><figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Durotan.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Blizzard</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you prefer this more recent piece, I absolutely get it. While I'm not a fan of the softness and stylisation myself, it's very distinctly a Warcraft orc. This could just be an effect of familiarity, sure, but you could identify that as Blizzard immediately, while the older piece could be from any number of DIY, grungy OSR manuals. Personally, though, that's why I love it.</p>
<p>Here's a human. Sorry about the text. Bloody love their text, humans do.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Blizzard</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Anyways, that's it, that's the post! As I said, figured a few of you might get a kick out of seeing the old art, especially if it's your first time. Also, I'm contractually obligated to write 'orc' at least twelve times a week.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tencent have announced with developer Polaris Quest that it will be releasing a new game called ‘Light of Motiram’ for PC which looks awfully like Horizon Zero Dawn.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://lightofmotiram.com/EN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> came yesterday (first spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/mechanimal-open-world-survival-crafting-game-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>), revealing that the game will launch for PC on Steam and the Epic Games Store, but the publisher did not give an official release date.</p>



<p>The game has already been ripped apart on social media for being a fairly blatant Horizon Zero Dawn ripoff, but we’ve attached some images below to make up your own minds.</p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>The summary of the Light of Motiram reads,</p>



<p><strong>A Mechanimal-Ruled Open World<br></strong><br>“Earth and human civilization as we once knew it are gone. Across untamed wilderness, giant mechanical beasts roam freely, while humanity struggles to rebuild from the dawn of a new primitive era.</p>

Having cleared their names and saved the city during the Zero Day Affair, DedSec continues its mission to expose the truth.

The first instalment in Ubisoft’s tech-centered franchise told the story of Aiden Pearce, a hacker with the ability to manipulate technology in the environment around him. A sequel located in San Francisco was released in 2016, but the franchise most recently delivered a London-set entry with Watch Dogs: Legion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-announces-maintenance-scheduled-for-playstations-30th-anniversary-and-as-youd-expect-fans-are-struggling-to-cope<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Brace for disappointment!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> announced a surprise server maintenance that coincides with PlayStation’s 30th anniversary, and it’s fair to say fans are struggling to cope with what it all means.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware’s much-loved action game launched on PS4 in 2015 and has never received an official next-gen update for PS5, or even a hint at a PS5 remake or PC release. Fans desperate for an announcement from Sony have so far fed on scraps from director Hidetaka Miyazaki, who is asked about the prospect of more Bloodborne pretty much every time he’s interviewed by press.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, in February, ahead of the launch of FromSoftware’s Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">M<u>iyazaki said that because the developer doesn’t own the Bloodborne IP</u> he couldn’t speak about its future</a>. He did, however, admit Bloodborne would benefit from releasing on more modern hardware.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS4 Games (Summer 2020 Update)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the release of the PS5 Pro brought little cheer to Bloodborne fans, who have reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps5-pro-can-you-see-the-difference">Sony's $700 mid-gen console upgrade barely improves the game at all</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, fans have the surprise in-game server maintenance notice, which just so happens to coincide with PlayStation’s 30th birthday on December 3. Why would Bloodborne undergo server maintenance now, nearly a decade after its launch? And why would it fall on PlayStation’s 30th birthday, which Sony is already celebrating with a number of initiatives?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are debating this now, but amid the frenzy of speculation there are messages of caution. “Friendly reminder that they’ve periodically done server maintenance before and that’s exactly what it’s always been: server maintenance,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/1h1b8nf/comment/lzabylz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned redditor amygdalapls</a>. “Not a new patch, not an update, not anything along those lines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do wish it was more but alas. Brace for disappointment!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Bloodborne server maintenance seems designed to coincide with potentially big announcement events, just to mess with fans. In 2022, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/zeqdf2/bloodborne_undergoing_maintenance_during_the_game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloodborne underwent server maintenance on the same day as that year’s The Game Awards</a>, sparking a similar cacophony of speculation and excitement we’re seeing today. Then… nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does add a dash of spice to the debate this time around is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-confirms-sonys-buyout-intent-but-insists-no-decision-has-been-made-at-this-time">Sony’s confirmed attempt to buy FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a> as part of a deal that could be confirmed imminently. That acquisition, should it go through, sparks all sorts of questions of its own, including whether Sony would seek to make FromSoftware’s future games PlayStation exclusive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, though, it seems more Bloodborne disappointment is on the cards, and the wait for that elusive 60 frames per second next-gen upgrade will continue — perhaps forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

But if you want to save some money and go the Digital Edition route, I would suggest getting the NBA 2K25 bundle (see below), which also includes a game.

IGN's Tristan Ogilvie gave it a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">7/10 review</a> which is still good, but I've beaten the game and immensely enjoyed it, so I would give it an 8, myself.

Otherwise you might have to wait until next Black Friday to get another shot at the deal.</p></div><p id="lego-deals"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="LEGO Deals">More LEGO Black Friday Deals</h3></p><p id="xbox-360-replica"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Xbox 360 Replica">The Coolest Toy for Gamers</h3></p><div catalogid="71c42985-9d8c-4c5d-a28d-7485a219d539" id="211751"><div id="211751" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MEGA Showcase Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One deal you might have missed is this really awesome <a href="https://zdcs.link/92bRpM?object_uuid=5df8a364-5c42-4b70-8566-334ca9ab558b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MEGA Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-is-getting-cross-play-photo-mode-and-12-new-subclasses-in-patch-8.1047261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/28/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-cross-play-photo-mode-and-12-new-subclasses/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/baldurs-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> will be getting full cross-platform multiplayer and progression, a big new photo mode and a new subclass for all 12 character classes in the game – including a Drunken Master Monk! All of this will be arriving with Patch 8 sometime in 2025, though Larian will open the floodgates for a stress testing phase before then to try and iron out as many issues as possible.</p>
<p>Stress testing Patch 8 will hopefully begin in early January, with more details to come in their next Community Update post and a sign-up process. This will hopefully avoid rapid hot fixes after the update’s release.</p>


<p>We’re a few months on from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4593196713074709213">the last patch for Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, and while Larian said at the time that they would move away from big feature updates to their smash hit RPG, there were still a good few things left on their to-do list. Cross-platform multiplayer and photo mode were stated at the time, but new subclasses are a real surprise.</p>
<p>Cross-platform multiplayer – AKA cross-play – will allow all players across PS5, PC, Mac and Xbox to party up using the Larian Network that was established for Divinity: Original Sin 2. The bonus to this is that it will also introduce full cross-platform progression as well, so you can bounce back and forth between console and computer. Lovely!</p>
<p>Then there’s a proper Photo Mode coming in Patch 8 that will basically let you do whatever the heck you want. You can toggle this from the HUD by the minimap or with F9 on PC, or by clicking in both sticks on a controller, at which point you can then set the stage with character positioning, funny poses, switch up your party, and even include summons and Wild Shapes.</p>

<p>Photo Mode will have lens settings for FoV, exposure, depth of field and focus; scene settings to toggle characters on and off, so you can remove NPCs, and to select from 40 static and animated poses, each with variations and facial expressions; post-processing for colour-grading, contrast, saturation, highlights, brightness and vignette; frames to decorate the shot; stickers with over 300 available including emojis, icons, blood splatters, textures, objects and items, and cat ears.</p>

<p>And then there’s 12 new character subclasses, which Larian describe as follows:</p>
<h3>Bard – College of Glamour</h3>
<p>As a College of Glamour Bard, you’ll find you have the power to heal friends and command enemies in equal measure. Cast Mantle of Inspiration to bestow your allies with 5 temporary hit points. And should an enemy attack while it is cast, they’ll find themselves Charmed. Play your hand correctly and you’ll be able to use this to your advantage with Mantle of Majesty. Target Charmed enemies and you can command them to flee, move closer, freeze, drop to the ground, or drop their weapon.</p>
<h3>Barbarian – Path of Giants</h3>
<p>Opt for the Path of Giants, and your newfound giant strength will make it easier for you to yeet friend and foe alike. Forget chugging potions to pump those muscles, these Barbarians benefit from the Giant’s Rage passive that grants both strength and size – allowing you to deal additional damage with Throw attacks. Pockets weighing you down? Not for you and your increased carry capacity!</p>
<h3>Cleric – Death Domain</h3>
<p>As a cleric of death, you’ll find a few dark new tricks up your sleeves – from spells that specialise in necrotic damage to three new necromancy cantrips. This includes Toll The Dead, a cantrip that causes 1~8 damage when your cleric rings the bell of impending doom – a number that scales if your target has already been damaged. We’ve also added the homebrewed ability to explode nearby corpses, damaging enemies.</p>
<h3>Druid – Circle of Stars</h3>
<p>These Druids look to the stars for answers, accessing powers beyond those offered through the classic wildshapes. Taking on one of three Starry Forms for their power – the constellations of the Archer, Chalice, and Dragon. Each one favours a different play style and strategy – the Archer dealing radiant damage with astral arrows, the life-giving Chalice restoring hitpoints to you and others nearby, and the wise Dragon, allowing you to deal damage with an added bonus to constitution rolls. The Starry Forms offer not just a celestial aesthetic, but practical, powerful options to enhance your role as a healer, fighter, or strategist.</p>
<h3>Paladin – Oath of the Crown</h3>
<p>You’ve been sworn to uphold the principles of law. Stay true to your oath and you’ll be rewarded with the power to aid your allies and disrupt your foes. Guide your companions in battle with Righteous Clarity, taunt enemies with strategic interrupts, and keep your party standing strong with Divine Allegiance, absorbing their damage while restoring their health.</p>
<h3>Fighter – Arcane Archer</h3>
<p>Mastering the dual arts of magic and marksmanship, the Arcane Archer subclass offers unique skills on top of new shooting animations. Banish foes to the Feywild, removing them from the battlefield for a turn, or unleash Psychic damage that forces enemies to make a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the start of their next turn.</p>
<h3>Monk – Drunken Master</h3>
<p>Putting the brew in homebrew, as the Drunken Master, you have the ability to consume alcohol straight from your inventory, as well as drink from bottles you see around the Sword Coast, in order to recover Ki. By sharing the bottle with your enemies using Intoxicating Strike, you’ll generate a buff towards your Armour Class and your Chance to hit Drunk targets. Drunk enemies are also susceptible to the Drunken Masters’ other abilities, like Sobering Realisation – which sobers up drunk targets, dealing physical and Psychic damage.</p>
<h3>Ranger – Swarmkeeper</h3>
<p>The Swarmkeeper subclass provides Rangers with three kinds of deadly swarms to assist them in combat. The Cloud of Jellyfish deals extra lightning damage – potentially shocking your enemy. The Flurry of Moths deals Psychic damage, giving you the potential to Blind your enemy. The Legion of Bees deals piercing damage and forces the enemy to make a strength-saving throw or be knocked back 15ft. Each swarm also has the ability to provide you with teleportation capabilities!</p>
<h3>Rogue – Swashbuckler</h3>
<p>This Rogue subclass introduces a range of new actions fit for the piratical life. Play dirty by tossing sand at enemies to Blind them. Flick your weapon at a target to Disarm them. Or use your new Fancy Footwork passive while meleeing your enemy to ensure they can’t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p>
<h3>Sorcerer – Shadow Magic</h3>
<p>As a Shadow Magic Sorcerer, you deal in a form of magic that makes you deadliest in darkness. This subclass gives its sorcerer Superior Darkvision, as well as the ability to Shadow Walk between places of dim light or darkness. It also lets you call forth the perfectly homebrewed Hound of Ill Omen to harass your foes, and use Strength of the Grave to prevent you from being downed – ideal for those attempting Honour Mode runs.</p>
<h3>Warlock – Hexblade</h3>
<p>Hexblade Warlocks make a pact with an entity from the Shadowfell that manifests in the form of magical weapons. Curse your enemies and force their souls to do your bidding. Slay any enemy that isn’t generally an element of nature, construct, giant blob, or already dead, and you’ll be able to raise their spirit from their corpse for ten turns. This new summon can deal necrotic damage and will rip away a chunk of your enemy’s soul to provide your Hexblade Warlock with healing.</p>
<h3>Wizard – Bladesinging</h3>
<p>The Bladesinging subclass merges swordplay with wizardry. Expect new spellcasting animations when casting spells with your weapon, a new Bladesong ability to grant you supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make.</p>

            <p>
The Cabin Factory is described as a horror game but it's sort of about deciding whether you are, in fact, playing a horror game. There is indeed a factory and it does indeed produce cabins - jolly, Center Parcs-style affairs made of big, merry logs, which roll up fully constructed on a conveyor belt. Your job is to enter and inspect them in first-person. What are you inspecting them for? Ghosts.

If you see anything paranormal, scoot on back to the factory floor and hit the red button to condemn the structure. If the building appears normal, press the green one (you won't, seemingly, have to worry about other habit certification requirements, such as checking that all the kitchens have fire blankets - different department, I guess). In the event of a haunting, the predictable complication is that the spooks might not let you leave. Quite why your employer keeps accidentally building haunted houses remains to be seen. Where exactly do they get the logs for those walls?
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in The Cabin Factory partly because it could be an amazing prank. Maybe none of the cabins harbour ghosts! Perhaps the whole thing is a vicious social experiment on the part of developers International Cat Studios, to see how many players can be induced to imagine supernatural antics. 
</p><p>
It would be a neat way to save development resources with regard to ghoulish lighting effects, fraught violin soundtracks and such. Perhaps other self-described "horror" games could follow their example. Imagine a Silent Hill game in which Silent Hill is a perfectly unremarkable town, haunted only by the spectres players bring in with them. Hang on, isn't that what Silent Hill is anyway?
</p>
<p>
The other thing that interests me about The Cabin Factory is the precise level of eerieness that separates a haunted house from a house that just has a lot of shoddy wiring and ill-fitting carpentry. What kinds of layout, atmospheric elements, and special effects will they introduce that provoke alarm but do not kindle the certainty of an eldritch infestation? How do you tune, say, a creaking floorboard so that it sounds almost like the footfall of a poltergeist but, on reflection, is probably just a creaking floorboard? What species of rising damp looks almost, but not entirely like the Babadook?
</p>
<p>

The third thing that interests me about The Cabin Factory is that it could be a commentary on game testing. It gives International Cat Studios a certain leeway when it comes to glitches - that's interference from beyond the grave, not a misbehaving shader! I wonder if there's any odds of a licensed multiplayer mode where they wheel on houses from other, unfinished games and have you comb them for frame-rate drops styled as phantom interventions, using a PKE Meter that actually just shows you a graph of CPU activity.
</p>
<p>
The Cabin Factory is out 13th December. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3311740/The_Cabin_Factory/">read more on Steam</a>. The obvious movie pairing here is Cabin In The Woods.

            <title><![CDATA[Palworld to Get Massive New Island Next Month]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/palworld-to-get-massive-new-island-next-month/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-to-get-massive-new-island-next-month.1047249/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/palworld-to-get-massive-new-island-next-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, PocketPair <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861922963936923656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Palworld will receive a big update next month. Its main attraction is a new and 'mysterious' island, which is said to be six times as large as Sakurajima, the previous island to be added to the game. Players will find 'powerful tower bosses' and many new Pals in this new location, and there will also be a sizable amount of new content. The game is also currently discounted by 25%, making it a great time to jump into Palworld for newcomers.</p>
<p>Moreover, PocketPair has confirmed a collaboration with Terraria, the massively successful indie game released in 2011. This collaboration will take place next year, though there are no further details on what will be included.</p>
<p>Following the incredible success enjoyed at launch, when Palworld surprisingly secured the second place on Steam's all-time concurrent players chart (it would later be surpassed by Game Science's Black Myth: Wukong), the game's development slowed down a bit. However, PocketPair recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-trailer-still-gets-showcased-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> the game on PlayStation 5, welcoming a whole new player base, and it is now being developed for mobile platforms, too, thanks to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-is-coming-to-mobile-with-pubg-publisher-krafton-securing-global-license-for-the-title/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with PUBG's Krafton</a>.</p>
<p>One platform where players will never be able to play this game is the Nintendo Switch. In fact, after much deliberation, Nintendo has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> PocketPair for patent infringement. Recently, the Japanese independent studio <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> more details about the lawsuit. Nintendo alleges that the following three patents were infringed upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patent No. 7545191<br>
[Patent application date: July 30, 2024]<br>
[Patent registration date: August 27, 2024]</li>
<li>Patent No. 7493117<br>
[Patent application date: February 26, 2024]<br>
[Patent registration date: May 22, 2024]</li>
<li>Patent No. 7528390<br>
[Patent application date: March 5, 2024]<br>
[Patent registration date: July 26, 2024]</li>
</ul>
<p>As a remedy, Nintendo asks for an injunction against Palworld (which would remove it from being available to players) and two payments of 5 million yen plus late payment damages to The Pokémon Company and Nintendo Co., Ltd.</p>
