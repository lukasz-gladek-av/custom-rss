			<p>A new Dark Souls 3 mod now in development promises to rejuvenate the game's multiplayer mechanics in the same way a similar mod does in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-now-works-with-shadow-of-the-erdtree-adds-optional-invasions/">Elden Ring.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/lukeyui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LukeYui</a>, the developer behind the Elden Ring Seamless Co-op mod released a while back, is currently working on a similar mod for the third entry in the now classic FromSoftware series, which will allow players to enjoy the entirety of the game together with friends from beginning to end with synchronized progress, no resummoning and optional invasions, essentially removing every vanilla multiplayer restriction. You can check out the seamless multiplayer experience coming in the future to Dark Souls 3 in the video below.</p>

<p>Despite the game having been released a while back, the Dark Souls 3 modding community continues to be extremely active and is continuing to introduce all sorts of improvements to the game. Fromsoftserve, the developer behind the excellent Bloodborne Remastered Project, recently released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-visual-overhaul/">visual overhaul mod</a> that carries over much of the work made on the emulated PlayStation 4 game to offer improvements that are worthy of an official remaster.</p>
<p>Dark Souls 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game by checking out our review.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations-square-enix-says.1103280/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It would appear the stars have aligned, because Square Enix has admitted that one of its games outsold its expectations, a fairly rare occurrence for a studio that seems to want a lot from its releases.</p>

<p>In its Q3 financial results <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Square Enix says that while its numbers are down for the nine-month period between April and December 2024 when compared to the same period last year, the quarter itself saw operating income increase, largely due to&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remaster</em>.</p>

<p>The company says the JRPG remake achieved "stronger sales" than it had "initially assumed", helping to offset newer releases achieving lower sales than tentpole games like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Pixel Remaster&nbsp;</em>series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-battle.jpg?itok=eUQg7jM2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-battle.jpg?itok=m2DDXHdX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>did better than Square Enix expected it to.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Square Enix says its latest games haven't done as well as&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, it's worth remembering the company also said that game, along with&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">didn't meet its expectations</a>.</p>

<p>Square Enix hasn't shared how many sales either of those games achieved (nor, indeed, has it shared specific figures for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>), but the company has something of a reputation for expecting its games to achieve what some might call unrealistic sales figures.</p>

<p>Naturally, the company's nine-month period between April and September also benefited from the launch of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>, although that launch didn't stop net sales and operating income from falling for that period. Instead, it likely just softened the blow.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is, well, the clue's in the name; it's a remake of classic JRPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3&nbsp;</em>using Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" rel="nofollow">trademarked</a> HD-2D style, which combines nostalgic pixel art with chunky 3D.</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701660/DRAGON_QUEST_III_HD2D_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-quest-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/9P5ZQNN9WRL2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> if you want to see what all the fuss is about.

                <p>Krafton has revealed a new name and more details for its first-ever PUBG spin-off. PUBG: Blindspot, which was previously known as Project Arc when it was revealed in 2024, is a top-down shooter launching in beta on Steam later this month.</p><p>Blindspot is a 5v5 tactical shooter that aims to offer a blend of strategy and shooting from a top-down perspective. The mission in the game is to break into a crypt inside a building to install an item called a Decrypter. Players use things like grenade launchers and explosive hammers to crush the building's walls to get into the crypt. Those on the defending team can set up barricades and other preventative measures to try to stop attackers from getting in.</p><p>"PUBG: Blindspot presents real-time line of sight shared with your teammates, which creates immediate, non-verbal cooperation, allowing you to experience fast-paced CQB combat with your teammates in real-time against actual players," Krafton said.</p><p>The game features weapons like the Mk14, AWM, and P90, as well as gadgets like proximity explosives, flashbangs, and smoke grenades, among other things. Take a look at the trailer below to get a closer look at Blindspot.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jP7p9DAKKI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jP7p9DAKKI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A free demo for Blindspot launches February 20 at 8 PM PT / 11 PM ET on Steam--the game has only been confirmed for PC. The developer said it will gather feedback from fans to help "refine and enhance" the game. A release date has not been announced.</p><p>Blindspot is the first PUBG spin-off from the popular battle royale game. It wasn't always going to be the first spin-off, though, as the horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-is-no-longer-a-pubg-spin-off/1100-6503927/" data-ref-id="1100-6503927">The Callisto Protocol was going to be until plans changed.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-battle-of-britain-review-undaunted-takes-to-skies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Undaunted</em> by Osprey Games, is a series heralded as perfectly blending a deck-building game with wargaming elements. The series of games first started in 2020 with <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, and rather than start with a review of the original game, we're working backwards from the latest game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>. This time we're looking at <em>Undaunted Battle of Britain</em>, which takes the <em>Undaunted</em> rules to the sky, and as a previous member of His Majesties' Royal Air Force, one that I'm personally excited to get into.</p>

<p>Although we've only just started covering&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> on the site, we have previously covered several of Osprey Games' titles, including the brand new <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action 3rd Edition</a></em>, copublished with Warlord games, and also some of their awesome supplements for their miniatures agnostic system,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frostgrave-wildwoods-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.</p>

<p>In games of <em>Undaunted</em>, as was the case in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>, players draw 4 cards from their deck each turn and then use those cards to play actions from the tokens they have on the board, such as moving and attacking. Certain cards also allow you to draw more cards from your supply, or move cards from your deck to your supply, allowing you to tailor your deck as you play. Rather than introducing new tokens as cards are added to your deck as the other <em>Undaunted</em> titles we've covered did, in <em>BoB, in&nbsp;</em>certain scenarios, aircraft start grounded and need to take off before they can take actions as normal.</p>

<p>This card system, as well as working for actions, also controls a unique damage system. As a unit takes hits, you must discard a matching card from your hand. If you don't have a matching card in your hand, you discard one from your discard pile, and if there isn't one there too, you discard it from your deck. If you can't find the card at all, the unit is eliminated. This can put real pressure on going first in the turn and focuses you on picking your targets. If a unit you have the card for in your hand is hit, then you discard the card and you might not be able to activate it this turn. It also adds a nice hidden element as you and your opponent try to determine how many cards units have left, and which is the optimum target to hit.</p>

<p>The difference between <em>Undaunted Battle of Britain</em>, and the other <em>Undaunted</em> games, is that <em>BoB</em> is focused on aerial combat and the difficulties that entails. For example, in other games in the series, you don't have to move or worry about the facing of your unit when shooting. In <em>Undaunted Battle of Britain</em>, every time you activate a unit, it has to move, and its directional facing for shooting is shown on the unit's token.</p>

<p>This means that positioning is key over the other <em>Undaunted</em> games, and anyone who's played <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-x-wing-minatures-game-2nd-edition-core-set-review-perfect-time-to-join" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars X-Wing</em></a>&nbsp;will feel right at home. If your fighter flies past your enemy, it's not an easy matter of turning to attack them next turn, aircraft have to wheel around, taking them out of position and circling to face their target again, which can take a couple of turns. This captures the thematic feel of WWII dogfights perfectly, as fighters would zip past each other and then maneuver to get the upper hand.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-6.jpg?itok=3PasnwVG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-6.jpg?itok=_exyIRUj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Battle of Britain </em>replaces the fog of war with discord cards, which fill up your deck if you play a comms card when you're more than a space away from the rest of the squadron.</figcaption></figure><p>Another change from other <em>Undaunted</em> games is that the fog of war has gone. This was a mechanic that as you scouted ahead on the map, you added fog of war cards to your deck (interference in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>). In <em>Battle of Britain</em>, you need to keep your matched units grouped close together when you play communications cards, otherwise you get a discord card added to your deck. Keeping your aircraft together can be challenging, so this mechanic is a great reflection of the radio communications at the time, and the challenges of radio communications in general, and is a great thematic inclusion.</p>

<p><em>Undaunted Battle of Britain&nbsp;</em>features the 2 historical forces that were part of the campaign during WWII, the German Luftwaffe and the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force (RAF). The reality of the war was that the Luftwaffe was coming off the back of a string of victories over most of Northern Europe. Their pilots were experienced and their aircraft were technologically advanced. The RAF was struggling to match production to get aircraft into the sky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To capture this in the game, without making the units vastly different, across the developing scenarios that introduce new units and rules as you progress, the German forces generally have goals to achieve, while the RAF just need to take out Luftwaffe aircraft. It creates a great blend of feeling the pressure, but not making the scenarios too uneven for either side.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-3.jpg?itok=lLWqkUDg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-3.jpg?itok=L1-TvSS1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As the scenarios progress in&nbsp;<em>Undaunted Battle of Britain, </em>further challanges are added.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Undaunted Battle of Britain?</h2>

<p><i>Undaunted Battle of Britain&nbsp;</i>is a fantastic take on the <em>Undaunted</em> mechanics, perfectly blending the great core mechanics with the aerial combat theme. The scenarios are a blast to play through, and both forces feel realistically thematic. The way movement is handled perfectly captures dog-fighting and the change from fog-of-war to discord adds a realistic element to the battles. If I had to pick a criticism, it would be that the aircraft tokens are quite small, which would be fine for a huge map with hundreds of aircraft, but here I would have liked bigger tiles and tokens, but that would also have increased the size of the compact box that stores well.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Undaunted Battle of Britain?</h2>

<p>If you like the <em>Undaunted</em> mechanics and want a new challenge, then <em>Undaunted Battle of Britain</em> offers that, or if you never played <em>Undaunted</em>, but want a great aerial combat game, then <em>U:BoB</em> is fantastic. If you don't like the sound of maneuvering to line up a target for shooting, then consider checking out one of the other <em>Undaunted</em> Games, either <em>Normandy</em> or <em>North Africa</em> for standard troop battles, <em>Stalingrad</em> for campaign play, or <em>2200 Callisto</em> for a futuristic battle with a deeper terrain system.</p>

<p>Commenting on the studio's third-quarter financial results, CEO Strauss Zelnick says the 2025 calendar year is shaping up to be one of his company's strongest, pointing to&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>'s release "in the fall", as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-no-italian-audio" rel="nofollow"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em></a>'s launch in summer and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director" rel="nofollow"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>'s arrival sometime this year.</p>

<p>Zelnick also highlights the launch of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>, which is set to arrive on February 11th, although some players have already gotten their hands on the game in early access (and have made their thoughts on it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">abundantly clear</a>).</p>

<p>Not only that, but basketball game <i>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</i>apparently outperformed Take-Two's expectations, racking up seven million sales in the third quarter and seeing an increase in player engagement as well.</p>

<p>In a followup <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with GamesIndustry.biz, Zelnick shares some of his thoughts about Take-Two's current situation in the industry, as well as wider trends like AI and Donald Trump's recently-introduced tariffs.</p>

<p>Zelnick says he thinks "a world without tariffs is a better place", highlighting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments" rel="nofollow">ESA's opposition to the tariffs</a> and expressing a "cautiously optimistic" outlook regarding the recent postponement of tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports.</p>

On the one hand, he calls artificial intelligence "an oxymoron" and says "machines don't learn", but he also says AI can "help make our business more efficient and help us do better work" (although he's confident it won't lead to unemployment).</p>

<p>If you want to read Take-Two's full earnings presentation, you can <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/0e10c51d-a6ac-469e-86c9-6bc3e265262f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so here</a>. It's chock-full of nerdy stats and facts about the company.</p>

		<p><em>Time marches forward, and while Patrick might still get carded when he orders a beer, let the record show that he has, in fact, been on this planet for 40 years, as of this week. Though birthdays take on less importance as you leave your 30s, the major decade milestones are still a chance to sit, reflect, and consider small but undeniably existential questions, such as "what is happiness?"</em></p><p><em>You know, the easy stuff. What Remap is all about.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>My wife recently went on a trip to celebrate someone’s 40th. Beaches, drinks, days in the sun. It looked like a great time. (My wife told me she avoided sending me photos because she felt bad lol). With the exception of my wife, it was a collection of couples without kids. Solo in a different way! I was, of course, at home. I love extra time with my kids, so I was happy to take on the burden, but I was also humorously waiting with great curiosity when, at some point, I would publish a quintessential half-staged, half-naturalistic “this is 40” photo. It <em>always</em> happens.</p><p>I feel like this is a millennial thing, because we grew up in the age of Instagram? These photos try to capture a kind of rebel attitude that says “40 is the new 30! I’m still out here having <em>fun</em>!”</p><p>Eventually, it dropped. Drink in hand. Beach in the background. No eye contact with the camera.</p><p><em>This is 40</em>.</p><p>I laughed, gave it a like, and moved on. They seem happy, and I am happy for them.</p><p>It’s obviously worth hanging onto the pieces of your life experience that have brought you joy in younger years, whether that’s spending time with specific friends, visiting specific places—whatever, it’s going to mean different things to different people. I am a big nostalgia head when it comes to revisiting old haunts like bars and restaurants! But as I turn 40 years old myself later this week—please, hold your applause for the teenager-looking person turning 40—and realize I’ll turn the clock quietly with a familiar group of friends who will take the great trek of [checks notes] walking down the street, I’m tempted to take my own “this is 40” photo.</p><p>Me, IPA in hand, two children and my wife by my side. This is 40. Not quite the beach.</p><p>There is no real difference between turning 39 and 40, but the milestone years do feel like check-ins with yourself. Is this where you wanted to be? Probably not, but are you happy where you ended up? If you’re not, are there ways you can change that? Maybe, maybe not. There is a different scale to the conversation around “change” when you’re suddenly now middle-aged.</p><p>I am, thankfully, exactly where I wanted to be. I was totally ready to drop going out and other every-single-weekend irresponsible behavior and have kids. I always wanted to make it out to the suburbs and have friends we hung out with down the street, our kids growing up together.</p><p>Is it perfect? No. My house is so damn cold! But if you asked me to sketch out where I’d want to be at 40 when I was 20 years old, I really do think it would’ve been something similar to all this.</p><p>I even got a pool. I gotta be honest: I wish that pool was up. That’s where I’d take my photo.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@lucian_alexe?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Lucian Alexe</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>My parents had a habit, endearing when I was young and grating as I got older, of turning everything into a tradition. I realized later it was their way of trying to bottle happiness, of trying to re-create magical moments in their lives by repeating steps. As the years went on, some of it started to feel more obligatory and burdensome, and I’ve let a lot of those little family traditions lapse, especially because so many of them meant absolutely nothing to MK. But one of them stuck, which is that every Thanksgiving we watch <em>You Can’t Take It With You</em>, which PBS filmed at the end of its revival run on Broadway with Jason Robards in the lead role. It’s a sweet play (and a less good Frank Capra film, which is unfortunately how most people know it) but toward the end Robards asks a question of another character, also in the twilight of his life:</p><p>How many of us would settle, when we are young, for what we eventually get? All those plans, what happened to them? It’s only a handful of the lucky ones who can say they even got close.</p><p>It’s a strange thing to watch a thing every year, from the time you are about seven years old, that builds toward a question about the hopes of youth and the disappointments and resignations of age. At some point as an adult, it became a moment of annual reflection about where I was at with my life. “Have I settled yet? Is it time to give up on the stuff I wanted?”</p><p>But at some point I had to admit that if anything, I was one of the “handful of the lucky ones.” </p><!--members-only--><p>I managed to continue doing the work I loved, with people whose company I enjoy. I get to spend most of my time on things I’m passionate about, and probably the closest thing I have to a job I hate is the parts of this that involve interfacing with state agencies. My day begins and ends with dogs chasing each other through the house and using my sleeping form as the turnbuckle in their private wrestling match. I have very, very few regrets.</p><p>I don’t think most people hit 40 in the place you and I are in. I was not in this place, or anywhere near it, when I turned 30. I remember the rising sense of panic that I needed to figure out how to reinvent myself, change careers, abandon all my intentions just to find <em>something </em>stable. 40 would feel very differently if I were facing all the same stuff (helping care for elderly family members, dealing with other family medical issues, a series of unexpected home repair costs) but I was struggling to get established in a job I had taken mostly for the sake of expediency and survival. More than getting to do what I love, I think I’m aware of the incredible good fortune it represents just to be this age and finding that most of the major things in your life are stable. It’s way better than hitting a milestone birthday and wondering, “How the hell am I supposed to fix this?”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@jonathanborba?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Jonathan Borba</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Part of my ease with letting go of my 20s and 30s, I think, comes back to finding what I wanted to do at such a young age. It’s why I always tell this version of a joke when someone younger asks me how to get a job writing and talking about video games: “Look, simply grow up 20 minutes from where the most popular video game magazine (<em>EGM</em>) is made, accidentally pick the same online chat room where they all hang out, and turn them into lifelong friends.”</p><p>In other words, I found a calling that, like magic, turned into a career. It hasn’t been without its ups and downs over the years, not the least of which was never making any money to do anything more than drink cheap beer in San Francisco and ignore what a “savings account” was supposed to do. But it also meant I found a sense of fulfillment and purpose, a thing people often spend their whole lives chasing after beyond a hobby, at an extraordinarily early age.&nbsp;</p><p>This feels weird to say, but it can make the magical a little mundane? Like, it just becomes a job, even if you enjoy it. You still need to do the work to remind yourself about the magic. It’s a little bit like meeting your soul mate, or however you want to describe the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. (I mean, shit, I met my wife just before I moved to California. A year after turning 21, I’d already checked two life boxes: figured out my job and figured out my wife.)</p><p>Relationships are work, even good ones! Jobs are work, even ones where you’re often having a lot of fun! Which, I think, helps explain why I was always jumping between jobs when I was younger. (Ignoring a desire for slightly higher pay in San Francisco, obviously.) It’s why I started <em>Crossplay</em>. It’s why I had some mild hesitations about <em>Remap</em>. It’s about paths already taken.</p><p>Alongside “I’m one of the lucky ones” is the sentiment that it’s okay to be content? Life does not have to be this continual race towards achieving <em>something</em>. It does not mean you cannot have ambitions or new hobbies or whatever, but there can be a cyclical feeling to life at this age that would be easy to describe as boring when, in reality, maybe you’ve quietly achieved a full life!</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@fabianmardi?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Fabian Mardi</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Right now I’m watching snow bucketing down outside my window. I put on some Christmas music because I didn’t really do much celebrating of the holiday with all the construction going on around my house, so this is actually the most holiday-ish day I’ve had all winter. MK sent me a picture of Tilly lying by the window upstairs staring at the storm, Mina is curled into a blue-gray donut on her dog bed. Life could be more comfortable. It could have more excitement in it. But I am not sure it can be <em>better </em>than it feels right now, home with my family, with the luxury of staying out of the storm, bills paid with a bit to spare. I haven’t seen an eviction warning in almost ten years, or worried about health insurance for seven.</p><p>We should all be so lucky. The standard for what constitutes luck should be higher. But as beautiful as today is, as happy as I find myself right now, I am more aware than ever that we live in a world run by people who want to deny this feeling to others. They want most people to remain in a perpetual state of dread: for their home, for their jobs, for their health, for their money. They don’t want marriages to be held together by bonds of affection and partnership, but by obligation and threat. They don’t want people to have their dream jobs, they dream of a world where their jobs are the ones people are forced to take.</p><p>They are broken in a way few of us can truly understand because it’s so foreign to any definition of normal, pro-social behavior and decency. Blessed with much, the value of their happiness is forever diminished by the thought that it is a commodity that other people still have access to. That for all their money and power, the same breeze cools the sweat on the foreheads of people who should always feel lesser, people who can still know the embrace of a loved one, or enjoy a good joke told among friends.</p><p>For much of my life, I was told to consider the facade placed in front of this ideology. To consider the value of encouraging competition and hard work, of spurring innovation and creativity, of pivoting jobs and skills with the nimbleness of a Spitfire pilot navigating the skies of a peaceful and prosperous global market. But at 40, looking at what we truly treasure, I appreciate the real modesty of what we have asked for. I had to take out a loan on a house to get a fucking dog, man.</p><p>But it’s clear beyond doubt that there are people who want to rule this world who don’t really value or respect hard work, or making things, building things, or improving things. They promote the idea of a world run by the smartest and most capable people, but they hate knowledge, study, and expertise. They hate that people can say things they don’t want to hear, share messages they don’t want others to see, but decry censorship when people decide they shouldn’t have to hear this shit. They claim that the people who make the buses run, keep the water clean, who make sure the nurses taking care of your parents or grandparents keep getting paid are in a conspiracy of freeloaders, but these are people who don’t want to pay anyone their value and who never sold a product without wondering if they could turn it into rent instead.</p><p>I wish we could simply spend the next twenty or thirty years puttering around the house, bothering our loved ones, pursuing little projects. But we live in an era where the inconceivable narcissism and violence of the ultra-wealthy reactionary right is on full display and aimed at anyone who presumes that a society is not something to be granted at the whim of billionaires and their Renfields.&nbsp;</p><p>I say this without fervor or desire for approval, but simply as someone who can connect his daily economic and practical reality to the structures of governance and business surrounding him: the existence of these people and the power they wield is incompatible with living in peace and comfort. Constraint and compromise is not possible for they do not have it in them to regard any constraint as legitimate, to accept in good faith any bargain that places boundaries on their behavior and power. The levers of wealth, influence, and power that enable such repulsive and malformed personalities to make their obsessions into national crises have to be taken from their hands or otherwise disconnected from civic life.</p><p>It’s wonderful to be 40, healthy, happy, and in love with one’s life. I wish you a happy birthday, my friend, and I hope the next decade brings you and your family countless blessings and little grief. I pray when we are 50, we live in a society that fully recognizes the level of selfish cruelty and evil required to wish to deny others these same joys. God willing, when we are 60 we will be discussing the likelihood of a Chicago Bears Super Bowl repeat, and debating whether it is compatible with the principles of Permanent Trans Liberation and Dudes Rock Thought to permit Elon Musk a day’s parole to fly a hobby rocket for his own birthday. Provided his license is in order and he gets the appropriate clearances from the FAA, of course.</p>

Development has cost $100 million already, and it’s still possible the game might not ever ship, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports. </p><p>Rocksteady Studios, meanwhile, is moving forward with development on a new <em>Batman </em>game. Having only just shipped <em>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</em> last year, however, it’s unlikely a new single-player blockbuster—the format the studio is best known for—will arrive anytime soon. And if and when it does, it will be under new leadership following the exit of founders Jamie Walker and Sefton Hill in late 2022. </p><p>There’s also WB Games Montreal, which <em>Bloomberg</em> reports at one point wanted to make a quick “1.5" version of <em>Gotham Knights</em>, the middling multiplayer brawler with remnants of an abandoned live-service model. Instead, it was put to work on supporting other WB projects and is in the midst of pitching a new game based on <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Finally, Avalanche Software is planning to release more content for <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and a sequel, a possible lifeline for the publisher amid all of its recent bad bets. </p><p>Why have things been going so poorly? The <em>Bloomberg</em> report lays some of the blame at the feat of outgoing executive David Haddad (some current and former staff told the outlet he seemed to have little actual familiarity with gaming), as well as the broader tumult at Warner Bros. amid a failed acquisition by AT&amp;T and a chaotic merger with Discovery under CEO David Zaslav. </p><p>For example, WB Montreal was at one point going to work on a Flash game, that was until the DCU movie starring Ezra Miller bombed at the box office. Despite the tumult, the publisher is apparently still focused on converting its existing franchises into hit games, rather than investing in new IP. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rocksteady has a new Batman game in development.</p>
<p>Right at the end of a lengthy report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues">Bloomberg</a> detailing the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a>' position since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">president David Haddad stood down after 12 years in the role</a> comes news Rocksteady is "looking to return to Batman for a single-player game".</p>

<p>Neither Rocksteady nor Warner Bros. have formally announced the Batman sequel, but it doesn't look like it's coming any time soon – according to the report, "the new project is years away from landing".</p>
<p>Reflecting upon the disappointment of fellow live-service hopeful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and the inability for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions to replicate the same success as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, its thought Rocksteady will abandon the live-service template adapted for Suicide Squad and instead refocus on its critically-acclaimed - and, crucially, single-player - Batman series.</p>
<p>WB Games Montreal, however, is reportedly "helping out" on other projects like Wonder Woman, the new action hero game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-is-not-being-designed-as-a-live-service-game">Warner Bros. felt compelled to clarify would <em>not</em> be a live-service game</a>. It is also allegedly working on a pitch for a new Game of Thrones game.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. also recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thats-all-folks-another-warner-bros-live-service-bites-the-dust">MultiVersus' fifth season will be its last</a>. In a post to players, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> team confirmed Season 5 will end on 30th May, although the game will still be available offline "for the foreseeable future".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>During the latest Letter from the Producer LIVE broadcast, the next patch for Final Fantasy XIV was revealed, with the <a href="https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full patch</a> being named Patch 7.2: Seekers of Eternity. In the broadcast, Producer and Director <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-producer-naoki-yoshida-reiterates-the-studios-committment-to-xbox/">Naoki Yoshida</a> walked the audience through the additions that will be released with this patch, including a continuation of the Main Scenario Quests, a new Unreal Trial, and more. Below is an archive of the stream, but it is in Japanese only.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV Letter from the Producer LIVE Part LXXXV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVQWDewBrfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the Letter from the Producer, Yoshida also mentioned upcoming content named Cosmic Exploration, which is a new activity coming to Final Fantasy XIV, which is designed for crafters and gatherers. You can team up with other players and explore uncharted stars together while gathering supplies that you may need. There are also new field operations named the Occult Crescent.</p>
<p>The Occult Crescent is a large-scale battle-oriented duty, where you have to explore unmapped terrain and explore a mysterious isle while having to battle against the inhabitants that live there as you try to uncover the isle's secrets.</p>
<p>This new patch for Final Fantasy XIV is set to bring something for everyone. Whether you're a player who solely does the MSQ or you also like to do some of the more challenging group content, everyone will be well-catered to. Speaking of group content, there will be a new dungeon added in this patch, named The Underkeep. The next tier of the Raid will also be released, called The Arcadion: Cruiserweight Tier. Recollection is the newest Trial to be added to the game, available on Normal and Extreme difficulty if you find yourself wanting a challenge.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new Unreal Trial has been added, where you can revisit Hells' Kier and take on Suzaku, one of the Four Lords at level 100.</p>
<p>While there is a focus on adding new group content to Final Fantasy XIV, there will also be new Allied Society quests, where you'll be able to assist the Mamool Ja. There will also be new Hildibrand quests to take on if you find that you have completed all of the pre-existing ones in the game.</p>
<p>Series 8 of PvP will be beginning in this new patch, including several new actions for large-scale PvP encounters, as well as adjustments to the pre-existing actions. Frontline (Secure) makes a return to the PvP rotation, but this time it comes with some map improvements.</p>
<p>Before this patch goes live, a final minor patch will be released prior, which will be released on February 25. While there is no set date for the Seekers of Eternity patch, it was mentioned by Yoshida that it will be released some time in March.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-25-canceled-sega-to-focus-on-football-manager-26.1103193/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Sports Interactive have announced that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, and that development efforts will now focus on the next game in the series.</p>

<p>In a development <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>website, Sports Interactive said that while development on&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>was progressing apace, the studio realized it wouldn't be able to reach the standard it wanted to in time for the game's already-delayed&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">March release date</a>.</p>

<p>Delays to games aren't uncommon, but&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>, like many yearly sports titles, is a special case; delaying the game beyond March would mean the game would launch "too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year", as Sports Interactive says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-25-canceled-menu.jpg?itok=SOmCykVa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-25-canceled-menu.jpg?itok=fy5GCFKQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ignore the "Work In Progress" label on this menu, because, well, it isn't.</figcaption></figure><p>Sports Interactive says that despite the "phenomenal efforts" of its development team, various areas of&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>, like its "overarching player experience and interface", aren't where the studio wants them to be for how far along in development the game is.</p>

<p>As such, the decision was made to cancel&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>and to focus on what will presumably be called&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26&nbsp;</em>instead. Assuming it's not subject to delays, that game will likely be released towards the end of the year.</p>

<p><em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>was originally due for release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date" rel="nofollow">in November last year</a>, but it was subsequently delayed to March to give the development team additional time to work on the game. It now seems as though even that extra time wasn't quite enough.</p>

<p>The game was due to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update" rel="nofollow">drop a number of features</a> from previous&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>games, including the Create-a-Club system, Touchline Shouts, and more.</p>




<p>It's likely the work Sega and Sports Interactive did on&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will carry over to&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26</em>, so don't expect those features to suddenly make a reappearance in the series' next major iteration.</p>

<p>This cancellation also hasn't changed Sega's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25" rel="nofollow">stance on a data update</a> for&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24&nbsp;</em>to implement more up-to-date club and player information; Sports Interactive says this would still be a "substantial undertaking" that would "divert critical resources away from the development of the next release".</p>

                <p>Artificial intelligence continues to be a major talking point in the world of video games and beyond, and now the top boss at GTA parent company Take-Two has chimed in with his thoughts. Strauss Zelnick said in an interview that artificial intelligence will be embraced as a digital tool to assist humans and that employment numbers will go up long-term as a result.</p><p>"Artificial intelligence is an oxymoron; there's no such thing. Machine learning... machines don't learn," he told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>. "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever."</p><p>He added: "I have no doubt that what is considered AI today will help make our business more efficient and help us do better work, but it won't reduce employment."</p><p>Zelnick went on to say that history has shown time and again that the arrival of new digital technologies ultimately leads to further job creation, increased productivity, and increased GPD overall. "I think that's what's going to happen with AI. I think the video game business will probably be on the leading, if not bleeding, edge of using AI," he said.</p><p>Others in the video game space, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">EA CEO Andrew Wilson</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">Microsoft's Brad Smith</a>, have admitted that advancements to AI will lead to job losses in the short term while increasing employment rates on a longer-term timeline.</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">overstating the power and abilities of AI technologies</a>. "It's not going to allow someone to say, 'Please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto', and then they just send it out and ship it digitally and that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen," Zelnick said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that AI technologies may be similar to a hand calculator. Decades ago, parents worried that hand calculators would mean children wouldn't need to learn math, but that wasn't the case. "The answer is yes, you still have to learn math, turns out, you absolutely have to learn math, but you have a tool that makes it easier to do. And ChatGPT is the same thing," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Zelnick said Take-Two's efforts in the AI space will not infringe on other people's intellectual properties, as some have been accused of already. OpenAI, for example, is being <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/new-york-times-legal-battle-openai-1236127637/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sued by The New York Times</a> over claims that the AI company used its data to train its large language model. "So of course, we're mindful of what technology we use to make sure that it respects others' intellectual property and allows us to protect our own," he said.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes AI will be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-ai-will-be-an-additive-positive-force-for-video-games/1100-6511913/" data-ref-id="1100-6511913">positive, additive force in gaming</a>. PUBG creator Brendan Greene's new game, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-using-machine-learning-to-create-massive-open-worlds-tech-demo-coming/1100-6495912/" data-ref-id="1100-6495912">using advanced machine-learning to create massive and realistic open worlds</a>.</p><p>Video game voice actors remain on strike over concerns around AI, among other things. One of the more prominent voice actors, Jennifer Hale, has discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">why she believes AI is an "existential" threat.</a></p>

			<p>When I played the first&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/28/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-review/">The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak</a> game, I was so excited to experience a fresh start in an otherwise exhaustively long and inter-connected RPG series. The game introduced a really engaging new setting and cast of characters that I loved, and the incredible blend of hack-and-slash and turn-based combat is something I wish more people talked about. I was excited for the sequel to either expand on the original game with upgraded mechanics and expanded environments or utilize those same tools to take the story to even higher heights. Unfortunately, The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II doesn’t do much of either of those things, instead feeling like an over-indulgent DLC that provides more filler than anyone would be interested in.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II - Opening Movie (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2PqS_5eWb7A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II kicks off just a few months after the end of the previous game, and at first it drops us into a pretty juicy new dilemma for our smooth-talking protagonist Van. A string of sudden murders has occurred in the region of Calvard, and the only suspect is a crimson-coloured spitting image of the Grendel, Van’s transformed alter-ego. There are some further complications when old flame Elaine Auclair shows up in Van’s city, leading the two to reluctantly team up and get to the bottom of a murder mystery that has sprawling implications for plenty of other strange developments.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of the series who’s familiar with all the over-arching lore of the dozen or so entries in The Legend of Heroes that preceded this one, you’ll be excited by some of the directions this story goes. Like Elaine Auclair, a lot of the supporting cast in this game are returning faces or debuting names that initially showed up in Trails into Reverie. As someone with a perpetual issue remembering the lore of this series, I was put off by just how deep into the weeds the last few entries got with the sprawling inter-connected narratives and endless callbacks. The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II does a good job of keeping things comprehensible if you’ve only participated in Van’s story, but it also provides a massively in-depth glossary system that helps shore up some of the muddier memories of prior games or obscure elements of the world.</p>

<p>In between lore-heavy callbacks and hunting for clues to the mysteries our protagonists are chasing, you’ll often end up having your cast of heroes split up and going their separate ways to find their own answers. This leads to a lot of arcs in the game being split into multiple chapters happening parallel to each other, and you’re given the chance to choose which order you play these chapters in as you bounce around the various groups that embody each one. It’s a really satisfying mechanic that keeps the pacing of the story fresh, but also allows the opportunity for characters to come and go in a natural way that’s honestly kind of a rarity for JRPGs. Early into the game, Van tells his incredibly young part-time assistant Agnès Claudel to stay behind and focus on school for a bit while he goes off to investigate things. Instead of the game contriving a call-to-action that forces her to stick with Van anyways, she just listens to him and sticks back to focus on school for that chapter!</p>

<p>Still, for as much fun as The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II has with the way it paces and presents the story, I wrapped up my lengthy playthrough of the game feeling like a vast majority of it didn’t really matter. Several developments throughout the game feel like they’re on the level of anime-filler, or are vaguely interesting ideas stretched out to occupy way more of the game’s runtime than they should have. A “bad-ending” time-loop mechanic introduced early in the story as a fun way to keep you on your toes quickly leads to repetitive and exhaustively frequent interruptions, while the final act of the game is occupied by a strange mind-control plot that rips out a lot of the tension of the experience.</p>
<p>I found myself tuning out from a lot of the story of The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II, which was fine since I still had a blast digging into the incredible gameplay. Combat is largely unchanged from the last game, which I couldn’t be happier about. You’re still able to get into Ys-style hack-and-slash battles as you traverse dungeons, although this time you also get to dish out new special attacks during these moments that keep things even fresher and faster.</p>

<p>You can also transition into turn-based combat at any time, and the real-time transition between the two never gets old. Being a huge fan of the combat, I was especially excited about the new Märchen Garten mode. You can dive into a sprawling series of side dungeons that allow you to mix and match party members who would never normally be able to team up in the story – or even play as characters not featured in the story at all! As you progress and earn currency, you can spend it on a smorgasbord of unlocks that I was dedicated to clearing out.</p>
<p>For all the narrative flaws of The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II, it’s still an incredibly fun JRPG full of charming characters, and it continues to house the most creative and impressive dual-style combat I’ve seen in a JRPG. I just hope the next game in the series – which was initially planned as a third Daybreak entry but has now been changed into an Avengers-style team-up to close the book on many of the franchise’s long-running mysteries – can improve on the lacklustre storytelling and lack of high-energy takes that plagued so much of this game.</p>

			<p>Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has just <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a paywalled report on what's next for Warner Bros. Games, and the article includes updates on the Wonder Woman game in development at Monolith Productions.</p>
<p>The historic development studio of games like Shogo, No One Lives Forever, The Matrix Online, F.E.A.R., Condemned, and the two Middle-earth: Shadow titles announced the game during Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2021. Over three years have passed since, though, and we haven't seen anything more than that teaser trailer, nor do we know anything concrete other than the fact it will be an origin story featuring the Nemesis system that Monolith Productions designed for its most recent games.</p>
<p>According to Schreier's sources, that is because the development of the Wonder Woman project has been troubled, leading to its reboot in early 2024 under a new director. The report also alleges that Warner Bros. Games already spent over $100 million on the game, which makes sense as it's been nearly eight years after the launch of Middle-earth: Shadow of War. Despite all this time and resources spent on it, Wonder Woman is nowhere near ready and will still take years to be released, if that can even happen, according to the report.</p>
<p>This doesn't bode well for the publisher, which had to deal with several blunders after the explosive success of Hogwarts Legacy. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-ends-in-january-2025-offline-mode-and-deathstroke-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flopped</a>, and, as many had assumed, Schreier confirms Rocksteady is returning to its safe haven of making single player Batman games. However, a new game will take years to be developed. Then there's MultiVersus, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is shutting down on May 30</a> after its fifth season.</p>
<p>All these problems led to Warner Bros. Games CEO David Haddad's <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent departure</a>. The publisher is now reportedly facing a 'thin' release schedule in the near future, as most of the next triple-A projects will take time to be crafted. For example, following the release of Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. Games Montreal is said to be helping on the Wonder Woman game while also putting together a pitch for a Game of Thrones game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/shadowveil-legend-of-five-rings-preview-thematic-magic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> (<em>L5R</em>) has been a popular feudal Japanese tabletop setting since the mid-90s as a collectible card game and roleplaying game. Both have seen several iterations and the license has changed ownership from the original developer. Both the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-lcg-review-new-dynasty" rel="nofollow">CCG</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-rpg-review-l5r-rpg-core-rulebook-and-games-masters-kit" rel="nofollow">RPG</a> were unique in that they didn't purely focus on combat, and the social elements played a huge thematic part of the games. They also featured an ongoing narrative, with tournament winners choosing how the story developed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-18.jpg?itok=bMYiZ_ZI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-18.jpg?itok=v6UWts6i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>My retainers brought the chop to the Goblins.</figcaption></figure><p>When I heard that the first <em>L5R</em> video game was being developed, I stepped away from the tabletop, picked up my controller, and stood ready to judge <em>Shadowveil:</em> <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> as only a tabletop gamer could. It must be noted that I've been playing both the <em>L5R</em> card game and roleplaying game since 1995. I've played through all versions (reviewing the latest versions of both here on TechRaptor), and I've read all the published <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/swords-and-spirits-preview-legend-of-five-rings-fiction" rel="nofollow">tie-in fiction</a>, as well as being a huge samurai and ninja nerd (and Japan in general). So I was going to be a tough audience for this.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-4.jpg?itok=eG9ZykLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-4.jpg?itok=sYOshyZb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Our demo brief for the first 2 levels of&nbsp;<em>Shadowveil: Legend of the Five Rings</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As with all my tabletop reviews, I judge theme pretty harshly. If you're going to throw a setting in your title, you better live up to it, rather than it being a paper-thin layer on top. So I was always going to judge it on theme before how good it actually was. If it lived up to the setting, I could forgive poor gameplay, but never the other way around. I got to test <em>Shadowveil</em> with a preview code, so not all elements of the game were available, and some things may change by the time the game releases fully on Mar 04.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-7.jpg?itok=kyroIged 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-7.jpg?itok=WN-VyIAa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kuni Yori is abolsultey as sketchy as he looks.</figcaption></figure><p>My concerns about theme were immediately alleviated, as soon as the first dialogue box opened. The <em>L5R</em> setting features several clans, all vying for power with different strengths and goals. The Crab clan, who are the focus of <em>Shadowveil</em>, guard the rest of the empire against the Shadowlands, a corrupted realm filled with demons, evil spirits, goblins, and other creatures, are unique in their outlook in that they don't care for honor or social politics. Victory is simply everything, and the methods are immaterial.</p>

<p>This stoic realism was captured immediately, and also told me that I wouldn't need to worry about how <em>Shadowveil</em> would deal with the social politics of the different clans, this was going to be war, the part of the empire that didn't care for etiquette or courtly virtues. But that element wasn't written out, as it could easily have been. It's obvious that not all is as it seems as the lead pair of characters, a brother and sister pair of Crab clan samurai reach a walled outpost in need of repair, and some internal politics are obvious from the off.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-8.jpg?itok=4QZwt1UG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-8.jpg?itok=eyTnTtxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I was very pleased to see named characters I recognised from the <em>L5R</em> setting.</figcaption></figure><p>In the full game, you will be able to choose between 2 famous characters from the setting, Hida O-Ushi, a berserker warrior, and her bother Hida Sukune, a more thoughtful and tactical samurai. Our build saw us taking O-Ushi, and leading our warriors to war. The first few dialogue boxes take you through the setting introduction, not drawing it out, but giving those new to it enough to go on, and then you're off on your first outing, beyond the wall, and into the shadowlands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-11.jpg?itok=MToQK16X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-11.jpg?itok=0ooK3cnw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Your choice of deck focuses on a specific class and the berserker choice is about smashing heads.</figcaption></figure><p>After going through the gate, you're into the game, which&nbsp;features roguelike runs, with you choosing the path of progression. You can select cards for abilities and items for your fighters and choose their placement in combat, but the battles happen automatically, with your fighters attacking as per their class. You start off with your main character and 2 basic samurai, but you can unlock other classes like the scout and witch hunter on subsequent runs, along with upgrading your basic samurai into formidable fighters themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-10.jpg?itok=Hq4XR-FD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-10.jpg?itok=L8wGsjQG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The roguelike journey begins with the first step.</figcaption></figure><p>During the run you collect cards, which unlock abilities. These are either generic or class-locked, and duplicate copies can be combined into a more powerful version. You can also collect items and other resources to unlock further elements as you progress. Some only benefit you during that run, like jade, which is used when you rest to heal and gain temporary boosts, others you take back with you, unlocking character classes and items. Side quests are also available, with some key unlocks early in the game's story. throughout it all, your characters gain experience, which levels them up for subsequent run attempts, and later levels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-3.jpg?itok=cpbK406d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-3.jpg?itok=XqwmJf2j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In a true RPG feel, everything here is your choice of upgrade.</figcaption></figure><p>The leveling-up screen gives you a whole host of options, from core stats, specific masteries and traits, unlocking more item and ability slots for cards you collect on the way, and also upgrading the core ability itself. When you upgrade stats, you get several stat package options that allow you to focus the character the way you want. The upgrade package was a lot more detailed than I thought, and really gave me a roleplaying feel that captures the the <em>L5R</em> RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-16.jpg?itok=xIh6G1Ea 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-16.jpg?itok=7LEPwxrd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemy numbers mean nothing when you've invested everything in a run on a single berserker.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;roguelike runs are handled very well, with branching level selects with the side quests highlighted further down the route. Each failed attempt isn't death, but a withdrawal to recuperate and rearm, before heading out again, with some friendly banter from your sibling after your failed run. It took me 4 runs on my first go to finish to defeat the first boss, and I'd unlocked 2 other classes, taking 5 fighters total to battle in the last mission. I focused on gaining command points, which lets you deploy extra fighters, rather than upgrading abilities, but it looks like either option is viable, either taking a small force of starting-level abilities or a couple of super-samurai.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second level was a lot harder, and I hit several walls early on and had to upgrade a couple of times to even make it halfway. Tactical resting became key, and positioning choices at the start of each battle really started to matter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-14.jpg?itok=QybwHeAH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-14.jpg?itok=PEfHKgn3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rest Timing and option selection is as key as to everything else you chose in completing a run.</figcaption></figure><h2>Shadowveil: Legend of the Five Rings Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Thematically, <em>Shadowveil</em> nails it. It captures the setting very well, even with the limited single-clan view, which allows them to focus the gameplay on the combat side of <em>L5R</em> without feeling like it's missing the social side. Yet it still captures the politics, even the internal politics of the very unpolitical Crab clan. The RPG elements had surprising depth, and the blend of permanent development you can control, to the random party development in the runs works very well. As a tabletop gamer of all genres, I love turn-based strategy, but honestly, the auto-battler is doing pretty much what I would be doing only faster, which lets you focus on the overall strategy of the run.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>L5R</em> fans would obviously love to see all of the clans represented, across the full setting with all facets of what we love about the CCG and RPG, but the depth of that game would be huge, and probably not for the mainstream market. What <em>Shadowveil</em> does is capture what's important for <em>L5R</em>, in a perfect mix of theme and gameplay, that while might not be for everyone, looks and plays great and may introduce more players to a deep and incredible setting that tabletop gamers already love.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>developer Firaxis has promised it will implement fixes for some of the most common criticisms being aimed at the game, including its UI, missing gameplay features, and more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/en-GB/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>website, the studio says it's been "poring over" player feedback, including Steam reviews the game has received during the first couple of days of its early access (as opposed to Early Access) period.</p>

<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">picked up a lot of negative reviews</a> from players on Steam since it launched in advanced access yesterday. Players have criticized the game's user interface, as well as what they perceive to be a paucity of features compared to&nbsp;<em>Civilization 6</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-ui-fix-firaxis-tanks.jpg?itok=cGM0YO8k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-ui-fix-firaxis-tanks.jpg?itok=qBCp5QLz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Firaxis says fixes are coming for some of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s issues.</figcaption></figure><p>Firaxis goes on to say that it's identified three core areas in which&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>needs improvement, and yes, the game's UI is one of them.</p>

<p>The studio says the UI is its "top priority", and that fixes will include making the interface "more intuitive", improving readability, and improving polish, among other things. More information will be shared "as soon as [the studio] can".</p>

<p>According to the post, Firaxis' next major area of improvement is implementing community-requested features into&nbsp;<em>Civ 7</em>, including adding teams to multiplayer games, increasing map variety, and enabling the customization of city and religion names. These things will, of course, be included in upcoming patches for free.</p>

<p>The third major area of improvement for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>focuses on quality-of-life improvements, with the first of such features rolling out as part of Patch 1.1.0 in March. That's where you'll find improvements and tweaks to the game's AI, as well as UI adjustments and more.</p>




<p>Firaxis says it will share a development roadmap for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>as soon as it's able, but for now, it wants you to know that fixes are coming for some of the problems you might have been having with the game.</p>

<p><em>Civilization 7</em>'s full launch is scheduled for February 11th, but you can play it now if you picked up the Deluxe or Founders Editions of the game. It's available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sid-meier-s-civilization-vii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

Super Bowl ads tie the year’s biggest sporting event to every facet of our culture, serving as annual conversation pieces thanks to their high-concept ideas, celebrity appearances, and big-budget production value. The event <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nfl.com/news/super-bowl-lvi-total-viewing-audience-estimated-at-over-208-million&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nfl.com/news/super-bowl-lvi-total-viewing-audience-estimated-at-over-208-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">draws nine-figure viewership every year</a></span>, so whether they’re shilling chips, cars, or crypto, Super Bowl ads tend to pull out all the stops. Video game ads during the big game are no exception, and developers and publishers have put out some real standout commercials during the Super Bowl over the years. Let’s look at a few of the best (and worst) video game ads to ever grace a football intermission.</p></div><div><p>When Sony Santa Monica released <em>God of War: Ascension </em>on the PlayStation 3 in 2013, it was during the era when Sony was putting out a lot of high-quality live-action ads that for some reason didn’t actually include any gameplay. But <em>Ascension</em>’s Super Bowl ad still remains one of the most moving live-action trailers for any video game. Set to Ellie Goulding’s cover of “Hanging On,” the trailer shows Kratos’ daughter Calliope running up to her father. When he picks her up, she immediately turns to ash, which is grafted onto Kratos’ skin as a punishment for his crimes. It’s an incredible tone setter for the character, and feels more reminiscent of the prestige storytelling the series would go on to have in the Norse mythology series that began with the 2018 game. <em>Ascension </em>hasn’t had the same shelf life as the rest of the series, as the prequel lacked a lot of the set pieces that have kept the memory of its predecessors alive and well and had a story many found lackluster and superfluous. But this trailer? It’s still a beautiful, tragic take on Kratos’ legacy.</p></div><div><p>Ready at Dawn’s PlayStation 4 exclusive about a steampunk London overrun by werewolves and vampires has largely been lost to time in the grand scheme of Sony’s IP, but there are dozens of us who look back fondly at the game as a strong foundation for a sequel that never came. However, it could have maybe been a more memorable game if its Super Bowl ad hadn’t been so ordinary. Companies are spending millions of dollars to put their products in front of people, and <em>The Order: 1886</em>’s commercial was a pretty bog standard gameplay trailer. Sure, given that the <em>God of War: Ascension </em>and <em>Dante’s Inferno </em>ads have no gameplay whatsoever, there’s merit to trying to show people what they’re actually going to buy, but it’s just missing the pizzazz that makes Super Bowl commercials memorable in the long run. Like the game itself, <em>The Order: 1886</em>’s Super Bowl ad deserved better from Sony.<br></p></div><div><p>The <em>Pokémon</em> ad during the 2016 Super Bowl wasn’t an ad for any specific game, but rather for the series’ 20th anniversary. This was just a few months before the release of <em>Pokémon Go</em>, which would have made for a pretty sensible commercial, but really the <em>Pokémon </em>2016 ad is more about a feeling than it is about any one thing. It shows multiple characters training across different disciplines, including chess, football, and eventually Pokémon battling to be the very best “like no one ever was.” It’s pure hype, and it makes you feel like you can take on the world.<br></p></div><div><p>One of the best examples of a video game company doing more than just advertising its latest thing to buy occurred when Microsoft made an ad for the Xbox Adaptive Controller that showed kids with disabilities demonstrating how the deeply customizable controller accommodates people who weren’t able to play games with a traditional controller. Aired during the 2019 championship, it’s a commercial like any other, but anything that advocates for making video games more welcoming to more people, especially on a stage as big as the Super Bowl, is a-okay in my book. Hopefully when PlayStation releases its upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-project-leonardo-accessibility-controller-1849954609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-project-leonardo-accessibility-controller-1849954609">Project Leonardo</a></span> controller we’ll see more companies advocating for accessibility in games like this.<br></p></div><div><p>If the job of an ad is to sell you on something, Nintendo’s Super Bowl ad for the Switch during the 2017 game was a colossal success, offering a grand tour of why the company’s upcoming console at the time was going to be such a game changer. It demonstrated every perk of a console-and-handheld hybrid device by showing people playing the Switch in bed, while cooking, at the laundromat, in the public library, and at parties, both in handheld mode and on the TV. It does lose points for being set to Imagine Dragons, though. Alas, that was just par for the course for companies looking for music to accompany their commercials in 2017.<br></p></div><div><p>Six years removed, I’m still not quite sure what Wargaming was going for with its 2017 ad campaign for <em>World of Tanks</em>. While some games on this list don’t include gameplay in their ads, they’re at least thematically in-line with the product they’re selling. <em>World of Tanks</em>’ Super Bowl commercials included parodies of reality shows like the <em>Real Housewives </em>franchise and <em>Million Dollar Listing</em>, all interrupted by a tank rolling through them while a voiceover that sounds like something out of a 90s ad for fruit-flavored gummies says the tagline, “Tanks rule.” If it weren’t for the console logos and the ESRB rating, I would have no idea what was happening here.<br></p></div><div><p>The 2010 <em>Dante’s Inferno </em>ad is similar to the <em>God of War: Ascension </em>one, in that it forgoes any gameplay for a very evocative cinematic trailer. It shows Dante jumping down into Hell to save his lover Beatrice, and as he fights all the demons and other ugly beasties in the underworld, Bill Withers’ “Ain’t No Sunshine” plays in the background. Now that I find myself writing about two Super Bowl ads with similar themes, it dawns on me that video games of the early 2010s sure loved to put trailers about man pain on at the biggest sporting event of the year, huh? I guess men brutalizing each other in real life and men in video games brutalizing others make for an effective combination.<br></p></div><div><p>It’s sometimes confusing to me that some people tune into an hours-long sporting event just to watch the commercials. People who do this tell me the ads are funny, but sometimes I see one like the 2024 Paramount Plus ad and think, “Are they funny, or are they just expensive?” This TV spot shows several people and characters featured on the streaming service’s programming, including Knuckles as voiced by Idris Elba from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404">his bad self-titled show</a></span>, and Master Chief <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-tv-show-paramount-canceled-season-3-xbox-1851599347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-tv-show-paramount-canceled-season-3-xbox-1851599347">from the <em>Halo </em>series</a></span>. The group of characters, hosts, and Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa are stuck on a snowy mountaintop and need to throw a rope high enough for them to climb up and escape. Tagovailoa can only throw a football, though. So he’ll need to throw something football-shaped….like the head of Arnold from <em>Hey Arnold</em>. However, it is Patrick Stewart who ends up throwing the classic Nickelodeon character, and then butt-rock band Creed shows up and sings their soaring, vaguely religious anthem “Higher.” Stewart and Arnold sing parts of it, too. This is the kind of shit you dream of when you take an edible before you go to bed.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Discovery has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure contributed to a $200 million hit to its business</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business"><u>MultiVersus added another $100 million on top</u></a>. Warner Bros. Games' only other recent release was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions"><u>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</u></a>, which failed to make an impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav said: "We recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-officially-ends-after-final-update-offline-mode-and-true-ending">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League post-launch content has come to an end</a> with the delivery of its year one roadmap, and Warner Bros. has announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-dev-calls-out-threats-to-harm-following-shutdown-announcement-i-am-in-deep-mourning-for-the-game">the impending closure of MultiVersus</a>. Rocksteady, meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-lays-off-staff-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop">has suffered significant layoffs</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also question marks over Mortal Kombat 1’s financial performance, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-chief-ed-boon-teases-t-1000-fatality-and-future-dlc"><u>NetherRealm chief Ed Boon recently announced over five million sales and teased future DLC following the release of the T-1000 Terminator guest character</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Zaslav said Warner Bros. was doubling down on just four games: Hogwarts Legacy (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines"><u>a sequel is already in the works</u></a>), Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, "in particular Batman."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio," Zaslav added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it may be some time before fans see the result of this work. Bloomberg said Monolith Productions’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wonder-woman-the-game">Wonder Woman game</a> is in trouble after reportedly rebooting and switching directors early last year. It’s already cost more than $100 million and is still years away from release, Bloomberg added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monolith’s reimagined Nemesis system (it developed the much-loved Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel) that would see Wonder Woman befriending enemies has been ditched in favor of a more traditional action adventure game. Its fate “remains in question.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal, meanwhile, pitched a John Constantine game but it was never approved. A Flash game was scrapped after the DCU Flash film bombed. It’s now helping out with other games and is reportedly working on a pitch for a new Game of Thrones game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hogwarts Legacy developer Avalanche is, as officially announced, working on new content for Hogwarts Legacy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-video-game-sequel-hogwarts-legacy-2-one-of-the-biggest-priorities-at-warner-bros">as well as a sequel</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Rocksteady will be excited to hear the studio “is looking to return to Batman for a single-player game,” but according to Bloomberg, it’s years away. There is no word in Bloomberg’s report on what’s next from NetherRealm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of this is Warner Bros. Games has, according to Bloomberg, a refreshed version of Hogwarts Legacy, a Lego game, and a few mobile games in the works for the next two years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Falling out of the governance of the Order of the Deep, these islands have preserved the customs from Rinascita’s Age of a Thousand Islands era, setting them apart from the rest of Ragunna in lifestyle. However, rumor has it a great mystery lies hidden within this secluded paradise…</li><li><strong>Ragunna</strong> – Ragunna City, the administrative center of the Ragunna city-state in Rinascita, is a thriving port city by the sea, its districts linked by winding waterways. The Ragunnesi are devout followers of the Sentinel, who believe Common Echoes to be gifts from the Sentinel carrying Their divine will.</li><li><strong>Whisperwind <a title="Games > Haven [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/haven">Haven</a></strong> – Whisperwind Haven stretches across a vast plain outside Ragunna, adorned with uniquely shaped windmills and babbling streams.

The Oracles carved into the stone and trees have withstood the passage of time, though their messages are now nearly impossible to distinguish.</li><li><strong>Nimbus Sanctum</strong> – The sea of clouds lingering in this place is formed by concentrated Remnant Energy. Local legends of Ragunna speak of a serene, mirror-like area at the heart of Nimbus Sanctum, said to purify the darkest of thoughts and transform them into part of the clouds. At times, a haunting melody can be heard echoing from the depths of the sanctum.</li><li><strong>Averardo Vault</strong> – Built by the Montelli family, Averardo Vault stands like a heavily guarded fortress on the outskirts of the city. Within its walls lies the family’s vast collection of treasures, including precious metals, artworks, and rare Echoes. The vault also provides public services such as secure storage for valuables, appraisals, and acquisition of rare collections.</li><li><strong>Thessaleo Fells</strong> – The rugged mountains of Thessaleo Fells always seem shrouded in the darkness of night, their gloom as deep as the abyssal sea. Once the domain of the Fisalia family, the oldest lineage in Ragunna, this desolate place remains one few outsiders dare to tread.</li></ul><p><strong>Optimizations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Echo Presets</strong> – Echo Presets allow you to easily save and apply customized Echo lineups for your Resonator.

                <p>Rocksteady Studios, the esteemed UK-based developer known for its work on the Batman Arkham series, is said to be returning to Batman for its next project following the dismal performance of its last game, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Beyond that, WB Games Montreal is now believed to be formulating an idea for a new Game of Thrones title. This all came to light in a new report that shed light on future projects said to be in the works at WB's various game development teams.</p><p>A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> said, "Rocksteady is looking to return to Batman for a single-player game." However, the report said the game is "years away." There is no further information to go on at this stage.</p><p>Rocksteady Studios is best known for Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), Batman: Arkham City (2011), and Batman: Arkham Knight (2015). 2024's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was a big shift for the developer with its live-service approach and multiplayer elements. The game failed to find a big enough audience, leading to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/" data-ref-id="1100-6523301">massive losses for parent company Warner Bros.</a> The game recently wrapped up its final wave of content, and many were upset over the game's real ending <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-finale-gives-everyone-a-happy-ending/1100-6528822/" data-ref-id="1100-6528822">revealing major characters who died were actually only clones. </a></p><p>The Bloomberg report also revealed that Batman: Arkham Origins studio WB Games Montreal was developing a live-service Batman game without Bruce Wayne. However, midway through development, plans changed, and the game that came out of it was the cooly received Gotham Knights in 2022.</p><p>After this, the report said WB Games Montreal tried to make a "1.5" version of Gotham Knights that aimed to address some of the shortcomings of the first game. However, sources told the site that higher-ups vetoed this idea and assigned staff to other internal game projects.</p><p>The report went on to say that the team at WB Games Montreal later pitched a Constantine game, and while management was said to be enthusiastic at one point, bosses ultimately suggested the team work on a game based on a more recognizable character. So it was decided to make a game based on The Flash, but that fell apart as well after 2023's Flash, starring Ezra Miller, was a dud at the box office.</p><p>WB Games Montreal is now said to be assisting Monolith Productions on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monoliths-wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">new Wonder Woman game that is reportedly encountering its own issues</a> and is developing a pitch for a new Game of Thrones title. There is no word on what the new Game of Thrones title might be, but given the wording that even a pitch isn't finished, it sounds like very, very early days.</p><p>WB Games focusing on core franchises like Batman and Game of Thrones is no big surprise, as parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-boss-says-it-has-the-best-cookies-talks-about-milking-them/1100-6526460/" data-ref-id="1100-6526460">seek to maximize the chances of success by centering its attention on only the biggest franchises</a>. Beyond Batman and Game of Thrones, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">a sequel to Hogwarts Legacy is in development at Avalanche Software.</a></p><p>This report came out no long after WB Games boss David Haddad departed the company. A replacement has not yet been named.</p><p>Warner Bros. gaming boss JB Perrette admitted to Bloomberg that WB Games is running into some tough times of late, but he believes the company will turn things around in time. "We won't get back to the profitability we want to get back to in the next two to three years. It will take two to three years to rebuild, [and] reset to levels we want to be at, but the bounce back is immediate as far as going from loss-making to profitability," he said.</p>
