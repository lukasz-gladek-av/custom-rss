			<p>Just Cause creator Cristofer Sundberg left Avalanche Studios, which he had co-founded, in late 2020 to create his own company, Liquid Swords. The studio is working on a GTA-like open world game that was first shown to the world last year. Recently, it has shared around ten seconds of new in-game footage to keep players intrigued about the untitled project.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Liquid Swords Untitled Project - Official Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dj03nvr0DiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>However, a few hours ago, Sundberg returned to the topic of Just Cause. In a series of tweets <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1985287755199352973" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on X</a>, he stated that it is unlikely we'll see a fifth mainline installment from Avalanche Studios.</p>



<p><em>Me and my team pitched Contraband back in 2017 to MSFT (and signed it). It's changed quite a lot since then, obviously, but it would have been fantastic to see it being released one day somehow. Just Cause 5 would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.</em></p>



<p><em>It's a qualified guess. The problems with JC4 was partly me (unwillingly) moving away from creative leadership to more corporate crap, publisher problems, team composition and roles and more. Sad, because looking at JC4 now, it shows SO much promise.</em></p>



<p>When a follower told him that Just Cause 5 would save the company, Sundberg replied:</p>



<p><em>I doubt it. They need to find the fire again, take risks, piss people off and make games the rest said was impossible. I started Avalanche to break the mold, not to fit into one. </em></p>



<p>Indeed, the Swedish development studio has fallen on hard times lately. The aforementioned Contraband project was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-stopped-contraband-development-avalanche-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down by Microsoft in August</a>, which led to the closure of the Liverpool office and to layoffs at the Stockholm and Malmö teams. In June 2024, Avalanche Studios had already closed offices in Montréal and New York, laying off another fifty employees. </p>



<p>The last franchise entry to be released is 2018's Just Cause 4, which received mixed reviews. In Wccftech's review, Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/just-cause-4-workmanlike-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ultimately, I found Just Cause 4 was most satisfying when I hopped in a chopper or found a good gliding spot and just took a minute to appreciate the world Avalanche has built. These quiet moments were a nice vacation from the rest of the game, although the fact that I needed that escape maybe isn’t a rousing endorsement.</em></p>



<p>The game also failed commercially. Publisher Square Enix would later admit that its sales did not cover development costs.</p>

            <p>
Marshal, if my hastily scribbled, made-up blackboard equations are correct, we should witness a double event within the next year or two. No, not a double kaiju event. A double kaiju clean-up event. Somewhat to my surprise, job sims in which you dismember dead Godzillas are a thing, now. And by thing I mean that there are at least two of them on the way. 
</p>
<p>
It’s going to be a battle for the ages. Alien vs janitor: whoever wins, we… get to walk around outside without stepping on in puddles of Mothra bile. Please, sir, join me next to this second blackboard full of hastily scribbled, made-up equations while I slap them haphazardly with a cane and shower everybody in spittle.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
On the left here we have Kaiju Cleanup from Brightrock Games and publishers Mythwright. As you can see from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3729700/Kaiju_Cleanup/">the Steam page</a>, Marshall, it’s a satirical fantasy in which you are play a clone butcher, carving up monsters and disposing of their radioactive, acidic or explosive wibbly bits using claws, hoovers, sprays and energy beams. Complete missions and you’ll get the means to upgrade your equipment and customise your base, van, and outfit. Fail and you’ll have to mop up your own corpse.</p>
<p>Along the way, there’s the chance to investigate the origins of the kaiju by collecting audio logs, consulting your codex, speaking to colleagues, and sifting nuggets of total truth from totally truthful radio station InfoBlast. Let us watch the trailer, Marshal. Please pull that lever on the left there. No, not my left - oh god. Never mind, I'll fix it later. Here, permit me.

<p>
By itself, Marshal, the existence of Kaiju Cleanup would be a severe but manageable crisis, perfectly within the scope of a single news article. But Marshal, if this print-out I’m waving rapidly before your face isn't just a random Tescos receipt I've swiped from the trash, the creatures are <em>multiplying</em>.</p><p>Please kindly join me next this third blackboard covered in hastily scribbled, made-up equations, while I pop my monocle and furiously fan myself with a pocket handkerchief. Do you see this arcane chalk diagram? It’s actually the URL for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3688110/Kaiju_Cleaner_Simulator/">the Steam page</a> for Kaiju Cleaner Simulator, which, <em>if you can believe it</em>, Marshal, is <em>also</em> a game about cleaning up dead kaiju. 
</p>
<p>
In the interests of time – no time, no time! – I will focus on what it does differently to Kaiju Cleanup. Firstly, it’s got co-op for up to four. Secondly, it seems both more slapstick and a little more gruesome. You can slice through layers of Rodan offal with actual chainsaws, and kick King Ghidorah hearts around like this is something a normal, well-adjusted person would do.</p>
<p>This one seems to be more about Top Larks with the Boyz than satire, and they’re making a very big deal in the marketing materials of it not having any generative AI. Do you see that large scarlet red button labelled "Trailer" in front of you, Marshal? Press it please. NO, not the crimson one. No, not the cerise one either. Never mind, I can reach it with my cane.

<p>
One kaiju clean-up game, Marshall, may be regarded as a novelty; two looks like a subgenre. I can only speculate as to the causes. Possibly this is all displaced guilt about factory farms. Possibly a couple of sleepless designers watched Kaiju No. 8 at approximately the same time. Possibly this is just the usual creative mitosis where somebody works out that one toolset (cleaning sims) can fit a multitude of subject matters. Possibly it's just an accident. I hate those.</p><p>Regardless, we can only hope that the two kaiju cleaning games pour their energies into defeating each other and leave the rest of us unscathed. We can only hope that they don’t learn to work together. Oh great Scott! Please don't let them do a collaboration with the already existing C<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking">o-op Kaiju Horror Cooking</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A viral Reddit post on the <em>Battlefield</em> subreddit this week gave a lot of angry fans and longtime vets of the series the proof they needed to back up their fears: <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-data-confirms-smallest-maps-franchise-ea-fps-bf1-2000640803"><em>Battlefield 6</em> has the franchise’s smallest maps.</a> The data is clear in showing that the recently released FPS does indeed have a lot of comparatively small maps, but a map being small doesn’t inherently mean it will feel tiny when played. And a past <em>Battlefield</em> game that many, myself included, adore proves this.</p> <p>When digging through the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/updated_battlefield_maps_from_bf3_bf4_bfhl_bfmaps-in-the-series/">newly shared map comparison data from Reddit user ClaratheRed</a>, the part that surprised me the most was learning how <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-1-the-kotaku-review-1788052226"><em>Battlefield 1</em>‘s maps aren’t as big as I expected</a>. If you had asked me, before looking at this data, which <em>Battlefield</em> game had the biggest levels, I probably would have mentioned <em>BF1</em>. Battles in EA’s 2016 WW1-themed FPS felt epic and massive. Yet the data shows that most of the maps in that game were around the same size as what’s on offer in <em>BF6. </em>So what’s going on?</p>

 <h2>Why maps feel bigger in <em>Battlefield 1</em></h2> <p>I think there are two main reasons my memory<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and judging by the comments on Reddit, that of many others as well<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->seems so distorted when it comes to <em>BF1</em>‘s maps. Number one: Combat and transport in <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-year-in-battlefield-1-is-still-going-strong-1820886816"><em>Battlefield 1</em></a> were much slower and more limited due to its WW1 setting. Tanks back then moved slowly, guns were inaccurate at far distances, and aerial vehicles were limited in what they could do. Getting anywhere in that game took time, and fights rarely happened across long distances. This made even “small” maps feel big, and made the few genuinely huge maps in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-1-s-multiplayer-undercuts-its-dramatic-sing-1787804290"><em>BF1</em></a> feel like small countries.</p>

 <p>And that leads me to the second reason <em>BF1</em> and most other <em>Battlefield</em> games feel so massive compared to <em>BF6</em> in my brain: Because they all actually did have some big maps, whereas <em>BF6</em>, at the moment, does not. While <em>BF1</em> arguably only had two or maybe three truly BIG maps, that was enough. These much larger levels provided players with the giant all-out warfare they so craved from <em>Battlefield,</em> and helped obfuscate the fact that the rest of the maps weren’t enormous. And other <em>BF</em> games often had even more really big maps, meaning you spent more time bouncing between small, medium, and big maps.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, when we look at<em> Battlefield 6</em>, our perception of its map size doesn’t benefit from slower, WW1 combat and tech. It’s set in the modern era, with jets, fast tanks, and powerful snipers that can reach out and pop someone from hundreds of meters away. So even the few medium-sized maps in <em>BF6</em> feel tiny, while small maps feel downright cramped. And <em>BF6</em> also lacks the one or two impressively big battlegrounds it needs that would let players really stretch their legs.</p>

 <p>Add that all up, and it means that every time you play <em>BF6</em> you’re playing on maps that feel small, and you never get to experience a bigger area to help cleanse the palette, or to provide those epic memories that get passed around friend groups for years and help a game like <em>Battlefield 1</em> feel bigger than it was.</p> <p>I truly do believe that if <em>BF6</em> had even one actually massive map, a lot of the doom and gloom in the game’s online community surrounding map size would start to go away simply because they’d have something big to break things up. It would also give them the all-out chaos they demand from the series at least once or twice a session. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">And while I really enjoyed <em>BF6</em>‘s next map, which is arriving later this month as part of season one</a>, I’m not sure it will be anywhere near big enough to help win back players who are fed up with all of the shooter’s small warzones. But hopefully, somewhere inside Battlefield Studios, that truly giant map is being designed or built and will see the light of day in a future update.</p>

            <p>
Keanu Reeves has made no secret of wanting to return to the world of Cyberpunk following his role as Johnny Silverhand in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - even though that could be a little tricky given <em>events</em>. However, series creator Mike Pondsmith is on the case, saying he's figured out "ways" to make it happen.
</p>
<p>
Back in September, when asked if he'd be interested in returning for developer CD Projekt's upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, Reeves <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/breathtaking-keanu-reeves-would-love-to-be-johnny-silverhand-in-cyberpunk-2">revealed he'd "love" to play Johnny Silverhand again</a>. That's great news for Reeves/Silverhand fans, of course, but easier said that done given the character's narrative trajectory left him, well, otherwise engaged by the time the credits rolled.
</p>
<p>
But it seems Cyberpunk series creator Mike Pondsmith has risen to the challenge, paving a way for a potential return. "Not that long ago," he revealed in Cyberpunk 2077's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc?si=Ta51TFmBnop3th3L">recent anniversary livestream</a>, "I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again."
</p>
<p>
"I have ways to do that, Keanu," he continued enigmatically. "Contact me." Of course, given Pondsmith's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">admission</a> he's "not as involved directly" with Cyberpunk 2 compared to 1, CD Projekt might already have different ideas.
</p>
<p>
To date, little has officially been revealed about the sequel, beyond the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-a-new-name-as-pre-production-phase-now-officially-underway">pre-production is underway</a>. In May, CD Projekt confirmed around 100 developers were working on the project, with the bulk of the studio focused on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. That doesn't mean it remains a complete mytery, however.
</p><p>
Earlier this year, Pondsmith <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">claimed Cyberpunk 2 will feature a second city</a> - in addition to Night City - that's like "Chicago gone wrong". That's perhaps not a big surprise, though; Cyberpunk 2077's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion features a possible ending set several years later, after the Transcontinental Maglev Network project referenced in the base game - one linking Night City with Chicago - is revealed to be complete.

<p>Out on both Switch 1 and Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior">Dragon Quest I</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior_ii">Dragon Quest II</a> are much-expanded compared to their original releases.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yuji-horii-dragon-quest-state-honor</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-creator-yuji-horii-awarded-with-japans-third-highest-state-honor.1342372/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>creator Yuji Horii has been recognized by the Japanese government with its third-highest state honor, becoming the first video game designer to be recognized in this way.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dragon-quest-designer-yuji-horii-becomes-first-game-designer-named-in-japans-autumn-honors/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, Horii has received the Order of the Rising Sun, which is only third to the Order of the Chrysanthemum and the Order of the Paulownia Flowers in terms of Japanese state recognition. These two honors are usually reserved for politicians and statespeople.</p>

<p>Despite Japan's rich and illustrious video game history, Horii is the first designer from his industry to be awarded the Order of the Rising Sun. Let's hope he serves as a precedent for more designers and developers to be awarded the honor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-yuji-horii-state-honor.jpg?itok=M-YKD0x1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-yuji-horii-state-honor.jpg?itok=kDyOuNTj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest</em>'s Yuji Horii has been awarded a prestigious Japanese state honor.</figcaption></figure><p>In characteristically humble fashion, Horii said that it was "not just [his] own efforts" that created the games in which he's involved, but also "the staff who helped [him] make it, and the users who have always supported [him]".</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>series began all the way back in 1986, and since then, it has seen eleven mainline entries released, as well as plenty of spinoffs and tie-in media.</p>

<p>The earliest entries in the series are also the most recent thanks to a spate of remakes in Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" rel="nofollow">trademark HD-2D visual style</a>, with the latest,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>, launching just last week.</p>

<p>Discounting those, however, the latest mainline&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>game remains 2017's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest XII&nbsp;</em>is currently in development, along with a newly-revealed remake of the seventh main game in the series.</p>




<p>As well as creating&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>, Horii is also known for his work on&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger</em>, having served as one of the writers and designers on the iconic 1995 RPG.</p>

<p>Horii is also the writer and designer of&nbsp;<em>The Portopia Serial Murder Case</em>, an influential 1983 game that served as one of the first ever visual novel adventure games. It was followed by&nbsp;<em>The Hokkaido Serial Murder Case: The Okhotsk Disappearance</em>, which got itself <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2920390/The_Hokkaido_Serial_Murder_Case_The_Okhotsk_Disappearance_Memories_in_Ice_Tearful_Figurine/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a remake just last year</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-employee-firings.1342369/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar, the studio behind the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, has been accused of union-busting after firing a number of employees who were purportedly involved in union activity.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Rockstar fired between 30 and 40 employees late last week. According to a spokesperson for the UK's Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), all of the fired employees were either members of the IWGB or were attempting to organize.</p>

<p>IWGB president Alex Marshall called the firings "one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry" and accused Rockstar of holding "flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rockstar-union-busting-allegations-gta-6.jpg?itok=6B9rf7dm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rockstar-union-busting-allegations-gta-6.jpg?itok=36sDyfnI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>studio Rockstar has been accused of union-busting by the UK's IWGB union.</figcaption></figure><p>Rockstar parent company Take-Two claimed that the layoffs were due to "gross misconduct" on the part of the employees, and that the company "fully support[s] Rockstar's ambitions and approach". No further explanation was given regarding the nature of said "gross misconduct".</p>

<p>Of course, Rockstar isn't the only company to be accused of anti-union activity (although I'm sure that won't come as much comfort for the studio). It joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-accused-of-trying-to-stifle-albany-union" rel="nofollow">Activision</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-accused-of-anti-union-practices-in-nlrb-complaint" rel="nofollow">Nintendo</a>, both of whom have had their union policies called into question.</p>

<p>Despite major companies' best efforts, studios and workers continue to unionize, with developers like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-zaum-union" rel="nofollow">ZA/UM</a>&nbsp;and Blizzard workers on games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-overwatch-union" rel="nofollow">Overwatch</a>&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union" rel="nofollow">World of Warcraft</a>&nbsp;</i>forming unions in the last couple of years.</p>

<p>Rockstar's layoffs come as excitement reaches fever pitch regarding&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">officially unveiled back in December 2023</a>. The game, which is currently scheduled for release on May 26th next year, will mark the first mainline&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>entry in almost 13 years.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see whether&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>lives up to expectations, although I think it'd probably need to somehow cure all known diseases and solve world hunger to do that. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What is DeAndre “SouljaBoy” Cortez up to these days? I’m not sure anyone’s asking that in the Year of our Lord 2025, but if they were the answer would probably surprise them. According to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQlFjCpgLDq/">latest post on Instagram</a>, the rapper behind the 2007 hit “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” is once again trying to hawk someone else’s retro handhelds under his own own made-up brand.</p> <p>SouljaGame Flip appears to just be a Retroid Pocket Flip 2, except that it costs more than double ($435 vs $210) and will be shipped to you from some other warehouse. “Not a single gamer buying this. Especially at that price,” one person earnestly responded on Instagram. “Play some games on it. Where’s the gameplay? Is it an emulator??? Rather get a Steam Deck for less that does more.”</p>

 <p>The Instagram post promoting the scalper performance art was spotted by<em> Retro Dodo</em> <a href="https://retrododo.com/souljaboy-reveals-new-handhelds-exact-clones-of-retroids/">which proceeded</a> to ask the company that makes Retroid about it. “I didn’t know about this,” a representative told the site. “This is not any kind of official licensing deal. He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own. The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the U.S by ourselves.”</p>   <p>This is far from the first time that Soulja Boy has pulled this stunt. In 2018 he started flipping other <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/soulja-boy-new-console-appears-to-have-stolen-games/">Chinese-made retro emulation devices</a>, only for some of them to come installed with ROMs for Nintendo games. The infamously litigious Mario maker did not take it well. He claimed Nintendo wouldn’t sue. “I had to boss up, I didn’t have a choice,” he <a href="https://x.com/souljaboy/status/1079141002198347782">posted on X</a> after being threatened.</p>

 <p>But that hasn’t stopped him from returning every couple of years with a new fake Soulja Boy handheld. In 2022, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUEntvOmk70&amp;t=293s">he was pushing</a> another stolen Game Boy knockoff. The retro handheld market has only gotten bigger in the years since. That makes getting in on the action more lucrative than ever, but also more likely to get called out.</p> <p>“[Soulja Boy] has been rebranding consoles before Xbox did with the ROG Ally X,” wrote one person on Instagram.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Few things are worse in <i>Arc Raiders</i> than a crushing defeat that sees you lose some of your best gear. Losing it fair and square is all part of the compelling, sometimes heartbreaking push-and-pull of the genre, but some players in <i>Arc Raiders </i>have lost their hard-earned gear due to encounters with cheaters. Fortunately, developer Embark Studios is keeping an eye on <i>how</i> you died in a match and, if it’s determined it was the result of cheating, you’ll get your stuff back.</p> <p>As folks are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olbx4i/i_didnt_know_we_get_refunded_is_someone_cheats_o/">sharing on Reddit</a> (<a href="https://gamerant.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-unfair-play-items-stolen-refund/">h/t <i>The Gamer</i></a>), <i>Arc Raiders</i> is happy to step in and return your loot if the game detects any cheating was at work. “Your items were lost due to unfair play, but we managed to get them back for you!” reads an example of the prompt rewarding players with their ill-received losses. “We’re committed to building an environment where gameplay is about skill, teamwork, and fun, not unfair advantages.”</p>

   <p>Preventing cheaters has been a complex struggle in online games, especially on PC, where many developers are choosing to implement aggressive anti-cheat features that demand excessive control over your machine. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olbx4i/comment/nmgy4l6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one Redditor put it</a>, “fighting cheaters will unfortunately always be an uphill and reactionary battle, unless the game goes full invasive mode and acts like a computer virus having more access than it should and we all know no one wants that.”</p>

 <p>That said, cheating doesn’t appear to be a rampant problem in <i>Arc Raiders</i> right now. As more and more folks chime in on the thread documenting <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ item refund policy, few of them mention having actually encountered cheating in-game themselves. I myself have invested just under 50 hours in the game so far and haven’t seen too many shenanigans.</p> <p>Now, Embark, if you’re willing to refund me that really nice Vulcano I lost because of a pair of aggressive Hornets, that’d be real swell. I hope whoever found that gun is enjoying themselves. So happy for you.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Server Status—Is ARC Raiders Down Now?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-server-status-down-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-server-status%E2%80%94is-arc-raiders-down-now.1342351/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is an online-only game, and that naturally comes with some issues when the network falters. If you’re trying to get into ARC Raiders but are being met with a server queue, or if you’re being forced out of the game by a network error, you might want to know what’s happening and what the ARC Raiders server status looks like.</p>



<p>That’s natural – after all, you’ve paid to get the game, and it’s only fair for you to want your money’s worth! In this guide, I’ll help you understand whether ARC Raiders is down <strong>now</strong>, and if it’s not undergoing a severe outage, what you can do to figure out your ARC Raiders error or concern.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-arc-raiders-server-status">How to Check ARC Raiders Server Status</h2>



<p>Embark Studios has developed and published ARC Raiders in-house, but the team hasn’t provided a way to check the game’s server status. There are no <strong>official methods </strong>to check if ARC Raiders is having network issues.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean you’re out of luck. Here are a few ways you can check the server status of ARC Raiders:</p>



<h3 id="h-use-a-network-checker-service">Use a Network Checker Service</h3>



<p>If you use a service like <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DownDetector</a> or <a href="https://status.technobezz.com/arc-raiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBezz</a>, you can see if other users are pinging an error in ARC Raiders. If there’s a widespread issue preventing connections to the game, other gamers will go online to the sites and paint a perfect picture of where they’re having their problems.</p>







<p>If you’re on social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter (X), Instagram, or even in an ARC Raiders-related Discord server, you can run a search for the game’s server status or for any like-minded players sharing information about outages. It’s a little loose, but it works, as people often take to social media immediately when an ARC Raiders server issue starts.</p>



<h3 id="h-use-player-count-trackers">Use Player Count Trackers</h3>



<p>This is a <strong>very unreliable </strong>method to check the ARC Raiders server status, but you can use a real-time player count tracker service like <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. If the player count in the last few minutes has plummeted, it’s a clear sign that something might be wrong and that thousands of people are being kicked from the game or are failing to connect.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-fix-arc-raiders-network-error-is-arc-raiders-down">How to Fix ARC Raiders Network Error—Is ARC Raiders Down?</h2>



<p>If you’re stuck in an ARC Raiders queue or suffering under the weight of an error code, you don’t have to panic.</p>



<p>There are some general network fixes you can apply to try ‘working around’ the core problem impacting the ARC Raiders servers.</p>



<ul>
<li>Restart your router or modem to refresh your internet connection</li>



<li>Power cycle or restart your console or PC, and reopen the game</li>



<li>Verify your game’s integrity or reinstall it entirely (it’s only a small game; it won’t take long)</li>



<li>Disable any VPN or proxy services you have live</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re wondering how long the ARC Raiders queue is, well, you’re also out of luck. Embark Studios has implemented a server queue feature in ARC Raiders, but hasn’t given any indication as to how long the queue is when you’re in it.</p>



<p>If you’re suffering from any ARC Raiders server errors on any platform, let us know about it on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>The UK's House of Commons has debated the need for improved video game consumer protections as well as video game preservation. In this debate, Concord's sudden shutdown was used as an example of a game shut down suddenly, and the requirement for strong consumer protections in such a case.</p>
<p>One MP stated in their statement: "A recent example is Concord, a game released for PlayStation 5 and Windows in August 2024. Following a disappointing launch, Sony Interactive Entertainment made a commercial decision to shut it down. To their credit, they did refund all purchases, but this isn't always the case.</p>
<p>"I know the honourable members will agree that where publishers fail to make the life span of a game clear at the point of sale, they must be held accountable. That's why I welcome the strengthened consumer protections, including the digital markets, competition and consumers act 2024, which came into force earlier this year. This legislation rightly requires traders to provide clear, timely, and accurate information to consumers, including the longevity and functionality of digital products."</p>

<p>Other games of note mentioned as examples of games made unplayable, including The Crew as well as Anthem, the latter's servers will be shut down later this year.</p>
<p>The debate was had today in the UK House of Commons, in which MPs discussed the issues raised by the Stop Killing Games consumer movement. MP Ben Goldsborough led the debate, making the argument for further consumer rights in regard to live service video games.</p><p>Goldsborough noted that the video game industry provided both £7.6bn and 75,000 jobs to the UK. He noted in his opening statement: "Gamers still feel the deep sense of personal possession, because they invest more than money. They invest time, effort, imagination, and friendship. When a game shuts down without notice, that investment is lost."</p>
<p>He also urged funding partnerships, and sector support to make sure we maintain a library full of significant games. Goldsborough said:  "This is about fairness, responsibility, creativity, and protecting a cultural legacy [...] of which the United Kingdom should be proud."</p>
<p>There were issues raised with the suggestion, with one MP noting that when games are acquired or shut down altogether the responsibility to provide such support for preservation efforts or online support. This was countered by the claim that there's a need for "natural justice", that if someone has paid for a product they should be able to use it for as long as they like.</p>
<p><a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0195/">The UK government has stated it has no intention of changing consumer laws</a>, in spite of the overwhelming amount of pro-consumer and pro-preservation sentiment from the MPs present in today's governmental debate.</p>

<p>You want to know what's better than 30fps?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>GameMill Entertainment has today announced that the family-friendly co-op RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nicktoons_and_the_dice_of_destiny">Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny</a> will be landing a free Switch 2 upgrade on <strong>5th December</strong>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version will run at 60fps, with a crisp 1240p resolution. There's a bunch of other visual good stuff to look out for too, including improved anti-aliasing, particle effects, lighting and more.</p>
<p>All those with the Switch 1 version of the game (which launched back in September), can upgrade to the Switch 2 version completely free. Alternatively, the full Switch 2 edition will be available on the Switch eShop for <strong>£39.99 / €49.99</strong>, or physically via a Game-Key Card.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the Switch 2 version in action:</p>

<p>If this one hasn't entered your sphere yet, the Dice of Destiny is an ARPG inspired by fantasy tabletop adventures. You'll put together a band of familiar Nickelodeon faces like SpongeBob, Danny Phantom, Jimmy Neutron, Susie Carmichael or Katara, and use each character's special skills to take out enemies in a magical land.</p>
<p>There's every chance that this one slipped under the radar for you back in a busy September period, and the new early-December release date falls in an equally jam-packed week, but hey, at least it gives everyone another chance to check it out.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-ultimate-game-of-the-year-award-major-indies-stacked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/golden-joysticks-ultimate-game-of-the-year-2025-nominees-stacked-with-major-indie-titles.1342324/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the beginning of last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-leads-the-golden-joystick-awards-2025-nominations/">GamesRadar revealed the nominees for its 2025 Golden Joysticks Awards</a>, though one category, the Ultimate Game of the Year Award, was left out of the list. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/">As of today, the shortlist</a> for the most significant Golden Joysticks Award has been revealed, and it is stacked with games from independent developers making up most of the list, including Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, and Peak.</p>



<p>It's the first major awards event to reveal a Game of the Year list, and while it has 12 games listed in total, which is more than you'd see for other major awards events, it really shows how despite 2025 having more than its fair share of big triple-A releases from major developers and publishers, the games that had the most impact came from independent studios.</p>



<p>In some cases, those independents did have major publisher support, but out of the seven games nominated made by independent studios, five of those games were made by smaller indie teams without a major publisher's support.</p>



<p>Here are the nominees for the Golden Joysticks 2025 Ultimate Game of the Year Award: </p>



<ul>
<li>Blue Prince</li>



<li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li>



<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>



<li>Peak</li>



<li>Hades II</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>



<li>Silent Hill f</li>



<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</li>



<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li>



<li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li>
</ul>



<p>While you might not agree with every game on this list, it's undeniable that this is a list of 12 of some of the best games released in 2025 (even though technically one of them was released at the end of 2024 and just didn't make it out in time for awards season).</p>



<p>Blue Prince, Hades II, Peak, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Hollow Knight: Silksong were all major indie titles from this year without a major publisher's support, and they are each, for their own reasons, more than fair candidates for 2025's game of the year. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Split Fiction were both made by independent teams but published by major triple-A studios, but the point that independent teams are making the biggest impact in 2025 still stands.</p>



<p>Major titles from triple-A developers and publishers, including DOOM: The Dark Ages, Borderlands 4, Assassin's Creed: Shadows, Monster Hunter Wilds, Avowed, The Outer Worlds 2, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and Battlefield 6, are all absent from this list. </p>



<p>You might disagree with some of those absences, but the impact of indies in 2025 cannot be denied. As always, the Golden Joysticks Awards are decided entirely by public vote following a jury selecting the nominees. Voting on the Ultimate Game of the Year<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/"> is now live,</a> if you want to add your voice to the conversation of which games deserve a big spotlight in 2025.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
I'm sure I don't need to tell you that a majority of the data that various AI models train themselves on do so without getting any sort of permission to do so. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, as they say, though in the case of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, they probably shouldn't have taken that lesson to heart. That's because Japan's Content Overseas Distribution Association (CODA) has requested that the AI developer stops using Japanese media to train its text-to-video model Sora.
</p>
<p>
A touch of context: CODA is a Japanese trade association that represents some of the biggest media businesses in the country. It has a big focus on anti-piracy measures, particularly to do with anime and manga, but in general is about protecting the copyright of Japanese media. You'll be no stranger to some of the names on the list, as it includes the likes of Bandai Namco and Square Enix, as well as for anime companies like Toei Animation and Studio Ghibli.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, that request! In a <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">post shared last week</a> (thanks for the spot, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japanese-publishers-like-bandai-namco-and-square-enix-are-requesting-sora-2-is-no-longer-trained-on-their-creative-works">Eurogamer</a>), CODA wrote that they have "confirmed that a large portion of content produced by Sora 2 closely resembles Japanese content or images. CODA has determined that this is the result of using Japanese content as machine learning data."
</p>
<p>
It goes on to note that Sora 2 operates on an opt-out system, meaning a company has to put in a request if it wants its intellectual property removed from the dataset. The issue is that Japan's copyright system doesn't work like that, as you need to get consent before you use any copyrighted works.
</p><p>
CODA's requests are twofold. First, "In the operation of Sora 2, CODA requests that its members’ content is not used for machine learning without their permission," and second, "OpenAI responds sincerely to claims and inquiries from CODA member companies regarding copyright infringement related to Sora 2’s outputs."
</p>
<p>
I feel it's important to note that this isn't saying CODA or any of the companies they represent are anti-AI, and that this is more a concern over the use of their respective bits of copyright. Even before AI, you've likely seen fan games and the like receive takedown notices because of their potential to misrepresent a particular work. But something like Sora 2 allows this to be done at scale, so even if you and I know that copyright just exists to protect the interests of big businesses, you can at least see why this is being done.

</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Since <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s beta, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-season-one-small-map-battle-royale-reactions-negative-review-ea-2000639948">fans have complained</a> that EA’s online FPS has smaller maps than those found in previous entries. And when the game finally launched last month, these complaints only grew as it became clear that <em>BF6</em> still lacked truly giant battlegrounds. Now, a fan has crunched the numbers and done the hard work to accurately compare the maps here to past maps from the main series and confirmed that, yeah, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">Battlefield 6′</a>s</em> collection of maps is the smallest.</p> <p>On November 2, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/updated_battlefield_maps_from_bf3_bf4_bfhl_bfmaps-in-the-series/">Reddit user ClaratheRed posted an image</a> showing a visual size comparison of some of the many maps from <em>Battlefield 3, 4, BF1, Hardline, 2042</em>, and the recently released <em>BF6</em>. (<a href="https://imgur.com/bV0bq9m">Higher res version here</a>.) And a quick glance confirms what many fans have complained about since launch: <em>Battlefield’s</em> largest maps are pretty small when compared to some of the truly giant warzones found in past games.</p>

   <p>In fact, according to ClaratheRed’s data, <em>BF6</em>‘s largest map is Operation Firestorm, which is ironically a remake of a <em>Battlefield 3</em> map. And even <em>BF6</em>‘s largest map doesn’t crack the top 30 biggest maps in <em>Battlefield</em> history. Meanwhile, most of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-is-very-bad-2000639647"><em>BF6</em>‘s other maps</a> are actually some of the smallest according to ClaratheRed’s data. Keep in mind, though, that this comparison post doesn’t seem to include games released before <em>BF3</em>, and doesn’t include <em>BFV</em>, so, it’s not a perfect, all-encompassing data set. Still, even with that caveat, ClaratheRed’s data is interesting and revealing. (They also showed their work, which leads me to believe this data is, if not 100 percent accurate, close enough.)</p> <p>The reality is that, yeah, <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s maps are, generally speaking, some of the smallest maps in the game’s history.<a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1985317825490153604"> One of <em>BF6</em>‘s maps, Saints’ Quarters, is actually the second-smallest map according to this data</a>. So if you wanted proof that <em>BF6</em>‘s maps are small, here you go. You can share this link and the Reddit post with friends to settle debates or win some internet arguments. And while the game’s smaller maps aren’t stopping me from enjoying it, I do miss the truly giant locations found in past games and hope they return in a future season.</p>

<p>Five games, including Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, are leaving Xbox Game Pass in November 2025. </p>



<p>All of the games, which you can see below, will be removed on November 16. That means not only will they not be available for subscribers, but the ability to save money on a purchase will be gone, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-games-leaving-xbox-game-pass-in-november">Games Leaving Xbox Game Pass In November</h2>



<p>As mentioned, five games are set to leave the Xbox Game Pass catalog later this month. In addition to Stalker 2, other games leaving the service include Football Manager 24, Football Manager 24 Console, Blacksmith Master (Game Preview), Frostpunk, and Spirittea.</p>



<p>Football Manager 24 is leaving as the latest installment, Football Manager 26, releases on November 4. The original Frostpunk also makes sense, as Frostpunk 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/frostpunt-2-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined the catalog</a> on September 18.  Lastly, Stalker 2’s departure comes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-new-game-releases-for-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just days before its launch</a> on PlayStation 5 on November 20. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned, the games are set to leave on November 16. Game Pass Subscribers can save up to 20% on the games, should they want to buy them. </p>

                <p>Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith has discussed the possibility of Johnny Silverhand actor Keanu Reeves returning to the character, asking The Matrix star to get on the phone and call him.</p><p>Appearing in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REDstreams broadcast</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/contact-me-cyberpunk-creator-mike-pondsmith-tells-keanu-reeves-he-has-ways-to-bring-johnny-silverhand-back-from-the-dead-for-cyberpunk-2?utm_source=instagram,threads,twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN</a>, Pondsmith said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-would-come-back-for-cyberpunk-2/1100-6534536/" data-ref-id="1100-6534536">saw the headlines</a> where Reeves himself said he would be keen to come back to play Silverhand again in a future Cyberpunk project, whether that's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a> or something else.</p><p>"I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again. I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me," Pondsmith said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIcTM8WXFjk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qIcTM8WXFjk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Silverhand is a former rockstar who appears in the game in the form of a digital engram long after his physical body dies. The character's fate at the end of Cyberpunk 2077 can depend on the ending that players receive. Given that, it appears possible that he could return in Cyberpunk 2, but that's far from a guarantee that it would happen, as that would depend on a countless combination of factors.</p><p>Pondsmith also discussed how maybe it could be possible for yet another celebrity to appear in a Cyberpunk project, following on from Reeves and Idris Elba, who played Solomon Reed in the popular Cyberpunk 2077 expansion, Phantom Liberty.</p><p>"What's next? Scarlett Johansson?" Pondsmith said. "Scarlett, you know, I have roles for you. You can do anything."</p><p>There is no release date set as of yet for Cyberpunk 2, but no one should expect it soon. As for CD Projekt's other upcoming games, the company is making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> and is co-producing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher game</a> with developer Fool's Theory.</p>

                <p>Without the Witcher novels by Andrezj Sapkowski, there wold be no hit series on Netlflix or even the video games that revitalized the property a decade ago. According to Sapkowski, he's happy with his arrangements with CD Projekt Red, even though the devs don't ask him many questions anymore.</p><p>While promoting his latest novel (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-author-has-an-excellent-deal-with-the-witcher-4-devs-but-its-rare-for-cd-projekt-to-ask-him-for-advice-anymore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), Sapkowski noted that CD Projekt Red used to approach him about additional info about the characters and the world he created. Now, he says it's "so rare" for CD Projekt Red to ask him any advice.</p><p>When Sapkowski originally signed withe CD Projekt Red to let them adapt his novels, he took an upfront payment instead of royalties. Sapkowski subsequently sued the developer to get a better deal after the blockbuster success of The Witcher 3. Terms weren't disclosed, but the case was settled. Now, Sapokowski describes his relationship with the devs in more glowing terms.</p><p>"The contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now," said Sapokowski. "Let's hope it stays that way."</p><p>Netflix recently debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-liam-hemsworth-as-geralt-in-new-witcher-season-4-trailer/1100-6535277/" data-ref-id="1100-6535277">The Witcher Season 4</a>, which will have a fifth and final season to wrap up the show. Meanwhile CD Projekt Red put <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/" data-ref-id="5000-561041">The Witcher 4</a> into active development last year. The game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-to-state-of-unreal-event-tomorrow-heres-how-to-watch/1100-6531983/">featured at Epic's State of Unreal event</a>, and it looked impressive. However, the developers subsequently described the demo as a technical demonstration, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">rather than a preview of the game itself</a>, which doesn't currently have a release date. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is also expected to get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-3s-last-patch-is-delayed/1100-6535045/" data-ref-id="1100-6535045">one final patch in 2026</a> that will enable mod access on consoles.</p>

                <p>Video game remakes and remasters have attracted impressive player numbers and generated substantial consumer spending, research shows, although full-on remakes may have a slight edge.</p><p>Research firm Ampere Analysis tracked data from January 2024 to September 2025, looking at 42 re-releases (specifically, 15 remakes and 27 remasters). These releases accumulated 72.4 million players across Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam, with consumers spending $1.4 billion from purchasing these games and related in-game monetisation.</p><p>Overall, the average remake produced 2.2 times the amount of consumer spending as remasters did during that time frame. For instance, while the Gears of War: Reloaded remaster had a similar peak monthly active user count as the Silent Hill 2 remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the latter two titles far surpassed Gears of War in consumer spending.</p><p>The one outlier is The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which peaked at $180 million in consumer spending and pulled in 7 million monthly active users, far and above every other remaster and remake included in the study.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4595155-image%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4595155" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4595155-image%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4595155"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4595155-image%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>The data goes to show the power of a popular IP like The Elder Scrolls, even though overall, remakes resulted in higher consumer spending and player engagement. This research also highlights the differences between remasters and remakes, both of which are prevalent strategies employed by major game publishers.</p><p>While remakes might yield greater returns and player counts, they are more costly and take longer to develop, as they are built from the ground up. A benefit of remakes is that core gameplay can be completely refigured to be up-to-date with modern sensibilities. Remasters, on the other hand, are typically fresh coats of paint on existing assets and systems, requiring less time and fewer resources; however, outdated gameplay design may still be evident.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/report-finds-nearly-all-gamers-have-played-a-remaster-or-remake-in-last-year/1100-6534807/" data-ref-id="1100-6534807">separate report in September</a> showed that the vast majority of people who play video games have engaged with remakes or remasters, with most of them not even playing the original version of the game.</p><p>It's hard to throw a dart at a release schedule and not hit a re-release, with just this year's schedule including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/" data-ref-id="1900-6418396">remakes of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-remake-review/1900-6418433/" data-ref-id="1900-6418433">first two Dragon Quest games</a>, along with remasters of Donkey Kong Country Returns and several Tomb Raider games.</p><p>This study from Ampere Analytics has some interesting data to chew on--it'll be interesting to see where the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-1-remake-saw-every-asset-get-attention-to-bring-it-up-to-modern-standards/1100-6535744/" data-ref-id="1100-6535744">remakes of the Halo: Combat Evolved campaign</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-launch-by-march-2026-ubisoft-says/1100-6531547/" data-ref-id="1100-6531547">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> would fall on that graphic.</p>

After a successful run of the Persona Live Tour across Asia, a modified version of the concert is coming to Los Angeles, California, next year on January 24, with just two shows that day.&nbsp;</p><p>Persona Live 2026: Awakenings is the first U.S. show of the Persona Music Experience series, according to Sega, and it will include the "full cast from Japan" when it debuts at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. As someone who lives in Florida, I'm hoping the word "debut" implies that this two-concert series is a test run for a wider U.S. tour. If you live in Hollywood or are willing to travel there for this concert, the first concert will begin at 3 p.m. PT on January 24, followed by a second concert at 8 p.m. PT.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>All of the notable Grand Theft Auto games have been set in fictional versions of American cities, but there was once an expansion pack that showed us a glimpse of somewhere else. Somewhere, if you're me, very close to home: London.</p>
<p>In 1997, an expansion pack was released for the original Grand Theft Auto game that remade its world to look like London in the Swinging Sixties - specifically, in 1969. Cue lots of colourful Minis and mini-skirts and mods and bob haircuts and garish pastel colours. It was fun, and it was enough of a glimpse to keep the question of whether Rockstar might ever return to London, for a full-fat GTA instalment, alive for many years after.</p>
<p>But that dream-balloon has popped now, with <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=tLh2Pqo2iIIJZ4as">Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser telling Lex Fridman</a> that the Grand Theft Auto series has become too characterised by Americana to be set anywhere else.</p>
<p>"There's a reason why GTA kept coming back to Miami, New York, Los Angeles," Houser said. "They're all very good for what you laid out..." Houser was referring to Fridman's description of Miami being a place where huge wealth exists next to extreme poverty, of it being a place of everything: glitz, glamour, immigration, drugs and organised crime - the whole lot. A melting pot.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZHrrLPk2S4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>London arguably has that but it doesn't have other important ingredients. One of those ingredients Houser described as larger-than-life characters, because GTA games, he said, are exaggerated slices of life. A GTA experience would be like "a psychotic version of a Dickens book", he said, smiling. But a bigger problem is a lack of available guns here - a weapon Grand Theft Auto games depend upon.</p><p>"For a full GTA game: we always decided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else," Houser said. "You needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective, but that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't have really worked in the same way elsewhere."</p>
<p>Dan Houser left Rockstar in 2020 to create a new studio called Absurd Ventures, which is making a couple of open-world video games - one set in a science-fiction world called A Better Paradise, and the other within a comedy satire setting. A Better Paradise book has been released but other than that, we don't know anything about these games.</p>
<p>Given how long ago Houser left, he has had nothing to do with the making of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which will be a notable change for the GTA series. Houser was usually the person who'd come up with the story the games would be based on, then hold the team to that creative vision as the game went forward.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I find it fascinating to hear Houser reflect on past GTA projects, particularly on the pressure the studio felt making them, because Rockstar often projects an aura of invincibility at the time.</p>
<p>"GTA 4 was very pressured because there had been all this pressure on the company - the company nearly imploded several times due to Hot Coffee," Houser said, referring to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/who-spilled-hot-coffee">the infamous reinstated-by-modders sex mini-game that people found in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a>. "It was extremely tough. So I think that felt very stressful. GTA 3, the company was basically broke, but I was young and I didn't really care. I wasn't living in the grown-up world yet. All of them had their own pressure."</p><p>But even years later in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, the company's most recent major work, there was enormous pressure on Houser and the studio. "With Red Dead 2, we were behind schedule, we were over budget so much I didn't want to think about it, and you're making a game about a cowboy dying of TB, and the game's not coming together," he said. "Turns out a lot of people doubt you at that moment; it's not a lot of fun. That was a lot of pressure."</p>
<p>I suspect that therein lies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">the reason he ultimately left Rockstar</a>, after taking an extended break following completion of the Red Dead Redemption 2 project. His brother Sam Houser, however, remains there, as president of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>.</p>

            <p>
Original Saints Row design director Chris Stockman has revealed he wants to revive the open-world crime series following the poorly recieved 2022 reboot, and claims publisher Embracer Group has reached out to hear more.
</p>
<p>
Stockman departed developer Volition (which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">closed in 2023</a> as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-has-reduced-its-workforce-by-over-1800-people-in-the-past-year">devastating layoffs across Embracer</a>) in 2007, shortly after Saints Row 1's release. Following stints at Human Head Studios and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/zynga">Zynga</a>, he founded VR-focused studio Bit Planet Games, known for the likes of Ultrawings and The Battle of Sol. But nearly 20 years after Saints Row 1's release, Stockman reckons he still knows what makes the series work - and it wasn't in the recent reboot.
</p>
<p>
"There's a level of expectations for a Saints Row game, and [developer Volition's reboot] missed the mark on all of them", Stockman <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi">recently told Esports Insider</a>. "When I found out that they were rebooting Saints Row, I spoke to an old friend of mine who was my old boss for Saints Row 1. He was the producer, and I was learning about what they were doing, and I thought, 'Man, this is a terrible idea.' What is it trying to be? You're rebooting it, but why are you rebooting it? There's a lot of characters in the series that people love. It wasn't Saints Row at all. Just call it something else at that point."
</p>
<p>
In the same interview, Stockman encouraged Saints Row owner Embracer to reach out, saying, "If you're listening to this, contact me. Let's go. I can bring much of the old band back together who worked on Saints Row 1. I could turn that IP around with a decent budget. They don't even have to fund it. I could get other outside people to fund it. I could turn the franchise around. I know I could." And it seems Embracer is curious to learn more.
</p><p>
"Guys and Gals, I have hopeful news!," Stockman <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1ok2dh3/ive_been_asked_to_a_create_a_pitch_for_a_saints/">wrote on the Saints Row subreddit</a>. "I've been asked to create a pitch for a Saints Row reboot! I can't say anything more than that but my dreams for this game just became a little more than just dreams!" Stockman <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/saints-row/prequel-pitch-original-director">later told PCGamesN</a>, he'd contacted Embracer himself after the original interview "created a bit of a fervour", and discovered "there is interest" within the company. "A pitch has been requested."
</p>
<p>
As for what Stockman has in mind for a potential revival, he "won't say much" at this point as he want to "keep my cards close to my chest, for now." However, he's keen to "bring the Saints Row franchise back to its roots", believing it has "strayed way too far away from that." He's also confirmed he's not envisaging it as a VR game and that he won't be bringing back the series' (at this point pretty iconic) giant dildos if Embracer bites. "I would've never put that abomination of a weapon in", he added on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
And despite Stockman's current caginess, his earlier Esports Insider interview might reveal a little of what he's got in mind. "What I would have done [for the reboot] was to take the franchise back to the 70s and do a period piece," he explained, "a prequel of how the gangs from the first one started. You're running around with a crew of teens that ended up as the main characters for the first game. You could really go all in on the 70s theme with big Afros, bell-bottoms, and the music of that whole period. I'd have taken it into a different direction so you’re not competing with the modern-day GTA games."

<figure data-uuid="2c81f39347cf8"><a title="Bandai Namco And Square Enix Join Other Japanese Publishers In Uproar Over OpenAI's Sora 2 Video Generation Tool 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2c81f39347cf8/bandai-namco-and-square-enix-join-other-japanese-publishers-in-uproar-over-openais-sora-2-video-generation-tool-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>Japanese video game giants Bandai Namco and Square Enix have joined other companies such as the Sony-owned Aniplex, Studio Ghibli, Square Enix, Kadokawa and Shueisha in requesting that OpenAI refrain from training its Sora 2 Generative AI model on their content.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">announcement</a> was made via Japan’s Content Overseas Distribution Association (CODA), which represents anime, game and manga publishers from the country (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sonys-aniplex-bandai-namco-and-other-japanese-publishers-demand-end-to-unauthorized-training-of-openais-sora2-through-coda/">Automaton Media</a>).</p>
<p>CODA's statement insists that Sora 2 has been trained on copyrighted works from Japanese publishers, and that this “may constitute copyright infringement."</p>
<p>OpenAI has an opt-out system in place and has already had to change the way Sora 2 works in order to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y0g79xevxo">avoid certain content from being created</a>. However, CODA claims this approach is incompatible with Japan’s copyright laws and that prior permission is required.</p>

<p>CODA is now asking OpenAI to immediately stop using copyrighted content, and urges the American company to “respond sincerely to claims and inquiries from CODA member companies regarding copyright infringement related to Sora 2’s outputs."</p>
<p>Sora 2 launched at the end of October and immediately came under fire for allowing users to create videos containing a wide range of copyrighted material and characters, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">including those of Nintendo</a>.</p>
<p>Established in order to build "safe and beneficial" AI systems, OpenAI has increasingly become embroiled in controversies over its use of Generative AI technology.</p>
<p>In 2024, Hollywood megastar <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm559l5g529o">Scarlett Johansson</a> accused the company of using her voice without permission.</p>
<p>Beyond copyright infringement, OpenAI has openly admitted that some of its users <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yd90g0q43o">exhibit psychosis or suicidal thoughts</a>, and is currently being sued by the parents of 16-year-old <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgerwp7rdlvo">Adam Raine</a>, who allege that its chatbot, ChatGPT, encouraged him to commit suicide.</p>

			<p>Wicked: For Good, the highly anticipated part two of the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Wicked, is arriving in theatres on November 21, 2025, and there is reportedly a very good Mario-themed reason to go see it. According to <a href="https://x.com/MyTimeToShineH/status/1985029599063843018">X (formerly Twitter) user My Time to Shine</a>, which has a reputation for publishing scoops within the movie world, the first proper trailer for the Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be shown at screenings of Wicked: For Good.</p>



<p>"<em>The Mario Galaxy trailer will be attached to Wicked For Good meaning it will release online before November 21st</em>," My Time to Shine writes on their X (formerly Twitter) post.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">This past September</a>, we learned that the sequel to the Super Mario Bros. The Movie would be called 'The Super Mario Galaxy Movie,' and it would be arriving in theatres on April 3, 2026. With a release date set for next Spring, it makes a lot of sense that it would have a new major trailer debut with one of the last major box office debuts left in 2025.</p>



<p>And as My Time to Shine points out, with the trailer making its way to theatres before the end of this month, that means it'll likely appear online within the coming weeks.</p>



<p>When the title and release date were revealed for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, we got a very short teaser trailer that briefly showed the Mushroom Kingdom, following a golden yellow butterfly through the kingdom and into the sky for the title reveal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ever since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>players found out the rare, alternate-colored monsters known as “shiny” Pokémon </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142"><span>don’t despawn in this game</span></a><span>, the shiny hunting meta has been rapidly evolving to take advantage of this new change. Some players devised ways early on to farm these rare spawns </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-shiny-despawn-afk-exploit-wild-zone-2000636610"><span>without touching their controller</span></a><span>, and now that many players have reached the post-game, some have concocted a method to hunt not only shiny Pokémon, but also the large, powerful, aggressive Alpha Pokémon that are also rare spawns in the game’s world.</span></p> <p><span>This method seems so busted, I wouldn’t be surprised if Game Freak patched it out in a future update, but for the moment, players have a really elaborate way of hunting up to six shiny Alpha Pokémon at a time if they’ve seen the credits (the real credits, not </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>the fake ones</span></a><span>). YouTuber Austin John Plays demonstrates the elaborate but effective strategy, which requires you to mess around with and essentially break the Alpha Pokemon in Wild Zone 20’s spawn area so you can trick the game into bringing out more monsters in the area than it’s supposed to. The full method requires you to aggro the Alphas in Wild Zone 20 until they’re near the edge of the fenced-off area. By leaving the zone while these Pokémon are near the edge of it, you’ll make their spawn area essentially reset to the position they were in when you left, meaning the game will trigger </span><i><span>new </span></i><span>Alpha spawns in the center of the zone. If you do this successfully enough times without dying, you can get several Alphas spawning in the zone, and because shiny Pokémon won’t despawn, you can enter, exit, or reset the area by resting on a bench until all six spawned Alphas are shiny.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The whole thing is pretty complicated and requires some precise positioning and saving, but it seems to work. Check out Austin John Plays’ tutorial below:</span></p>  <p><span>I’m always amazed by the commitment shiny hunters bring to breaking the game to find these guys. So far, I’ve stumbled upon two shinies during my playthrough without looking for them, which is more than I typically find in these games. Both the </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> games have made spotting shinies easier by adding a visual and audio indicator when one is in the overworld, so I’ve gotten two in both </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span> without even trying.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/a-surprise-departure-shows-the-problem-with-the-game-pass-backlog-2000640806</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-surprise-departure-shows-the-problem-with-the-game-pass-%E2%80%98backlog%E2%80%99.1342267/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are two major knocks against Game Pass these days. The first is the new $30 price point for access to day-one releases. The second is the fact that you’re basically just renting and don’t actually own any of the games you play. The surprise departure of <a href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-review-buggy-janky-impressions-xbox-pc-fps-1851705232"><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em></a> in November really drives that home.</p> <p>Subscribers noticed a new notification this month that the post-apocalyptic immersive sim will be part of the batch of games leaving the Netflix-like service in the weeks ahead. The others include <em>Football Manager 2024</em>, <em>Blacksmith Master</em>, and <em>Frostpunk</em>. What caught some players by surprise is just how brief <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>‘s tour on Game Pass has been. The game only released a year ago and has still been receiving <a href="https://support.stalker2.com/hc/en-us/articles/39316885098257-Update-1-6-Night-of-the-Hunter-is-live">substantial updates</a> to improve performance and fix bugs. Some people no doubt expected they had more time to go back and finish the grueling but rewarding shooter.</p>

 <p>“I think it’s a really bad precedent that a game stays shorter in Game Pass than we had to wait for it to launch, beyond waiting MONTHS to become properly playable patch after patch,” one player wrote in <a href="https://x.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1984925333204689052">a thread on X</a> that gained traction over the weekend. “The game hits PS5 before it even leaves Game Pass.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">STALKER 2 got announced in 2020 at the Xbox Showcase in August.</p> <p>STALKER 2 took 4 years to develop beyond announcement and officially dropped in November 2024.</p> <p>STALKER 2 will leave Xbox Game Pass in November 2025.</p> <p>I think it’s a really bad precedent that a game stays shorter in… <a href="https://t.co/TZg486uoeg">https://t.co/TZg486uoeg</a></p> <p>— Kloot (@ZakkenKloot) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1984925333204689052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The sentiment was echoed on the Game Pass subreddit. “It’s really frustrating seeing Stalker 2 leave Gamepass,” a player there <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1omcjg9/stalker_2_leaving_game_pass/">wrote</a>. “Game is still a buggy mess, so for those who were waiting on this game to be patched, I guess we’re screwed. lol.” Others argued that no one is “screwed” because you can still go and buy the game at any time, but it does cut against some of the perceived value of Game Pass.</p>

 <p><em>Payday 3</em> was a more <a href="https://kotaku.com/payday-3-starbreeze-flop-ceo-removed-fired-low-sales-1851329780">egregious example of this day-one issue</a>. The launch was a mess, lots of things were broken, and lots of fans went back to playing <em>Payday 2</em> until the sequel improved. But the day-one Game Pass release only stayed on the service for a year. Anyone who bounced off during that early window only to come back closer to its departure might have felt like they were getting a raw deal.</p>

 <p>This is the double-edged sword of the value proposition at the center of Game Pass. One the one hand it’s a massive buffet where power-users can super-sample tons of great games to their heart’s content, from blockbusters like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> to small indie games like <em>Minami Lane</em>. If you spend a lot of time playing lots of different games each week, you can actually get&nbsp;<em>more</em> than your money’s worth out of Game Pass.</p>

 <h2>Game Pass’ airline economy problem</h2> <p>But if you actually want to finish a lot of games, or play certain ones more deeply, it doesn’t always make a lot of sense. <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> is a good example. It can take 40 hours just to beat, or around 70 hours if you finish all of the side content. There’s a lot of trial and error and un-directed exploration. It’s great for getting lost in, but not for trying to breeze through on your way to other parts of the Game Pass library. It’s a perfect candidate for that backlog game you forget about until it’s not longer on Game Pass. If you’re only playing a couple of games a month, you’re better off buying them outright than renting them for a limited time.</p>

 <p>NYU business professor Joost van Dreunen recently called this Game Pass’ “<a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/game-pass-or-fail">airline economics in reverse</a>” problem. “On Game Pass, every user effectively flies business class while paying economy prices, creating an inherently margin-thin model in which heavy users consume disproportionate resources without proportional revenue,” he wrote. Basically, anyone who&nbsp;<em>did</em> spend months finishing <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&nbsp;</em>via Game Pass is just subsidizing the cost of the service for everyone who samples dozens of new games each year. The recent price hike is one way of rebalancing that math, Dreuen argues.</p> <p>Put another way, Game Pass gets way too many <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ljaff3/day_one_gamepass_additions_for_2025/">day-one releases every year</a> for any regular person to actually finish most of them. It’s a service for people who like to graze and keep trying new things, not people actually intent on clearing stuff from their backlogs. Anyone who leans closer to the completionist camp should be buying their games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has offered the best explanation yet for why the developer's open-world spy thriller <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/agent">Agent</a> fell by the wayside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Agent is the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption developer's long lost spy game, which was announced as a PlayStation 3 exclusive in 2009 but has since disappeared. Rockstar has never officially canceled the project, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-images-of-rockstars-spy-game-agent-appear" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>images leaked in 2015</u></a> showed some of its levels, and while some hope remained due to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/23/take-two-extends-agent-trademark-again"><u>renewed trademarks</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/26/rockstar-abandons-its-agent-trademark"><u>this was eventually scrapped in 2018</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-agent-website-disappears-no-trademark"><u>its website was shut down in 2021</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what happened to Agent? Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption writer Dan Houser, now of Absurd Ventures, has finally offered fans a detailed explanation in <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=VGcoI-t_nP8M1L65" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview on the Lex Fridman podcast</a>. According to Houser, despite multiple versions of Agent being attempted at Rockstar, the game never came together, and that’s because, fundamentally, an open-world spy game simply doesn’t work.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We worked a lot on multiple iterations of an open-world spy game, and it never came together,” Houser began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It had about five different iterations. I don’t think it works. I concluded — and I keep thinking about it sometimes, I sometimes lie in bed thinking about it — and I’ve concluded that what makes them really good as film stories makes them not work as video games. Or we need to think through how to do it in a different way as a video game”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The version of Agent Rockstar announced was set in during the Cold War in the 1970s, but Houser revealed this was just one version of many Rockstar tried and failed to turn into a fun video game. Indeed, there was a version set in the modern day that also failed to go anywhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That was one of the versions,” he said. “There was another one that was set in the current… we had so many different versions of this game, we worked with so many different teams.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Espionage, assassinations… I don't know what it would've been because it never really… We never got it enough to even doing a proper story on it. We were doing the early work as you get the world up and running. It never really found its feet in either of them. And I sort of think I know why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because in one of those films, they're very, very frenetic and they beat to beat to beat — you gotta go here and save the world, you gotta go there and stop that person being killed and then save the world. An open-world game does have moments like that when the story comes together. But for large portions, it's a lot looser, and you're just hanging out and you’re just doing what you want. And I want freedom. I wanna go over here and do what I want, and I wanna go over and do what you want. That's why it works well being a criminal, because you fundamentally don't have anyone telling you what to do. We try and create external agency through these people kind of forcing you into the story at times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But as a spy, that doesn't really work because you have to be against the clock. So I think for me, I question if you can even make a good open-world spy game. So lots of things would work as open-world games, but I don't know if a spy does.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/03/agent-1762181214091.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A screenshot from the cancelled Agent.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, former Rockstar Games technical director Obbe Vermeij said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-sheds-light-on-long-lost-game-agents-development-troubles">pressure from Grand Theft Auto 5's development contributed to Agent eventually switching studios before being scrapped altogether</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We really got going on this one and worked on it for over a year. I remember working on a downhill skiing chase scene with guns for instance," Vermeij said of Agent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game wasn't progressing as well as we'd hoped. It was inevitable that eventually the whole company would have to get behind the next Grand Theft Auto. We tried to cut the game down in an attempt to get the bulk of it done before the inevitable call from New York would come. We cut out an entire level (I think Cairo) and maybe even the space section.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It became clear that [Agent] was going to be too much of a distraction for us and we ditched it. I think it was handed over to another company within Rockstar but never got completed." Half of the Rockstar North team was working on Grand Theft Auto 4 DLC and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/16/grand-theft-auto-v-review"><u>Grand Theft Auto 5</u></a>, while half was set to work on Agent before the importance of its premiere franchise took over.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/03/gettyimages-2237849657-1762181394170.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dan Houser at 2025 Los Angeles Comic Con.

"There was a French Mediterranean city, a Swiss ski resort, Cairo, and at the end there would be a big shootout with lasers in space. Classic James Bond. The vibe was very cool."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar was kept busy otherwise with smash hits GTA 5 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review"><u>Red Dead Redemption 2</u></a>, releasing in 2013 and 2018 respectively. GTA 6 is set to follow next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Houser went on to say that rockstar also “played around with the knights concept,” following Agent’s demise, “trying to do a version of a mythological game that could have been fun.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Still love that idea, but never went very far with it,” he explained. “It never got to writing any of it. Just did some backstory and played around with a few ideas. But it was always something I thought I would never do, and then kind of fell in love with it a little bit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Agent is dead, IO Interactive’s promising 007: First Light is due out next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Netflix's The Witcher is heading into its final seasons, and not all fans are happy. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witchers-liam-hemsworth-says-he-was-reluctant-to-take-over-for-henry-cavill/1100-6535733/" data-ref-id="1100-6535733">With Liam Hemsworth taking over as Geralt from Henry Cavill in Season 4</a>, some viewers have criticized the show for straying from Andrzej Sapkowski's beloved books. But showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich wants fans to remember that there’s more than one way to enjoy The Witcher.</p><p>"One of the things that I've talked a lot to the author about and a lot to fans about is that the books still exist. No one is taking the books away. No one is taking the video games away," she said, talking to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/why-the-witcher-wont-make-game-of-thrones-ending-mistake-netflix-3276622/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>. </p><p>Hissrich also stressed that the Netflix series will not make the same mistakes as the Game of Thrones adaptation. "We lucked out because I said very early on, 'We're not going to go past the books,'" she explained. Seasons 4 and 5, filmed back-to-back, will adapt the final three novels: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. Geralt's origin story was explored in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-book-series-crossroads-of-ravens-novel-box-sets-reading-order/1100-6532972/" data-ref-id="1100-6532972">Crossroads of Ravens</a>, which was released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crossroads-Ravens-Witcher-Andrzej-Sapkowski/dp/0316597732?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">back in late September</a>. </p><p>"We lean so hardcore into fantasy at the end in wonderful ways that Sapkowski introduced us to. So we knew the stories that we needed to end with," she added. </p><p>The showrunner acknowledged the challenges of balancing fans of the books, the video games, and new viewers who discovered the world through the Netflix show. "You have book fans, you have video game fans, and then you have fans that knew nothing about this world until the show existed. The truth is, we can't choose one audience," she said.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher/">The Witcher video games</a>, developed by CD Projekt Red, have been hugely influential, offering players a richly detailed world and an alternate take on Geralt’s adventures that differ from both the books and the show.</p><p>Hissrich framed the Netflix series as one version of a larger universe. "I think everyone can have their version of The Witcher, and this is this version," she said. Season 4 premiered on October 30, while fans can continue to explore Geralt’s story in Sapkowski’s novels or through the critically acclaimed Witcher games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/" data-ref-id="1900-6416135">including The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, which many consider a modern gaming masterpiece.</p><p>While we're still a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">few years away from The Witcher 4</a>, the footage that has been released so far <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-the-witcher-4-footage-looks-ridiculously-good-on-ps5-but-theres-a-caveat/1100-6532024/" data-ref-id="1100-6532024">looked really impressive</a>.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Everybody <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loved</a> <em>Blue Prince</em>, and at this point it feels like everybody has finished (or, “<a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finished</a>”) <em>Blue Prince</em>, but I’m still here thinking “boy, I really should get back to <em>Blue Prince</em>” while knowing there’s a good chance I won’t. As much as I liked what I played, it just <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-beginner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t get its hooks in my brain</a> the way it did with others, and it’s the kind of game that needs passion to see it through. But I have finally found my sicko mode, “can’t stop thinking about it and need to talk to everyone about it” puzzle game: <em>The Seance of Blake Manor</em>.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395520/The_Sance_of_Blake_Manor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Seance of Blake Manor</em></a> casts you as Declan Ward, a detective in 1890s Ireland who’s been called to a mysterious manor hotel to investigate the disappearance of a woman named Evelyn Deane. A diverse crew of guests has gathered at the manor to attend a seance, and it quickly becomes clear that they all have their reasons to wish Deane harm. You have the weekend to figure out what happened to Deane and who’s responsible before the seance occurs on Sunday night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Séance of Blake Manor | Release Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QF8sknUZUW4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The time limit can feel pressuring, but time only passes when you undertake certain clearly-marked actions, such as examining objects, questioning guests, and attending events like meals and lectures. An important first step in solving the mystery is filling your timetable with the weekend’s activities and guests’ schedules, so you’ll know who will or won’t be where every hour. The latter is particularly helpful; one fruitful avenue of investigation is to break into everyone’s rooms and go through their stuff, and you definitely don’t want to get caught. Ask me how I know.</p><figure><figcaption>Analyzing a character tells you more about them and gives you topics to discuss (Spooky Door)</figcaption></figure><p>Every guest and staff of the hotel has a backstory, motive, and relationships with other characters. And they’re not just cursory stuff for atmosphere; I almost immediately forgot about the game’s central mystery as I dug into secret love affairs, thwarted career ambitions, cryptic plots, mystical societies, class and race tensions, failed romances, and people struggling to square their faiths with a changing Ireland and with the popularity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritualism_(movement)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spiritualism</a>, a 19th and early 20th century movement to communicate with the dead that threatened much of society’s <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/419656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">status quo</a>. (Spiritualism is one of my top <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025072830/https://kotaku.com/the-real-fakery-of-the-ouija-board-1819805308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">niche interests</a>, and I’m also currently learning the <a href="https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Irish language</a>; the fact that there’s a game about both is <em>very</em> exciting for me specifically.) To add to the plot stuff, the game is also full of things to learn about the history of the manor, Chrisitian gnosticism, and Irish folklore, politics, and history–a lot of this information is kept in the manor’s library, where you can research plot-essential stuff, but also browse the shelves for more detail on a topic. I’ve spent way more time doing this than I have actually trying to figure out what happened to Deane; I’m currently just before Saturday dinner and feel like I have no hope of solving her mystery <em>and</em> preventing whatever horrors it’s hinted will happen at Sunday night’s seance. With over 20 characters to learn about and whose problems to solve, I’m constantly panicking about the time limit, though players who’ve beaten the game tell me not to worry and that they ended things with time to spare.</p><figure><figcaption>The library (Spooky Door)</figcaption></figure><p>The game has a robust set of menus to help you keep track of all this and figure out what to do next. When you talk to characters, available topics are represented by icons to choose from, and while characters will only talk about certain topics so you don’t fritter away your time too badly, not all of them are essential for your investigations. Discovering more about the topics that <em>are</em> important places those topics on a mind map/ conspiracy board that shows how they’re connected and paints an overall picture of a character and their story. (I’d show you images, but they would be full of spoilers; you can see a glimpse of this in the trailer above.) When you’ve connected enough bits of information, you’re given a Mad Libs-style screen in which to create a hypothesis by filling in words from your conspiracy board, and then you can confront that particular character about it. I found these Mad Libs a little fiddly on occasion to express my hypothesis exactly how the game wanted me to, but it’s a fun mechanic with a lot of guardrails to make sure you know what’s going on. So far, some of my confrontations have wrapped up a character’s story, while others have introduced actions I need to take to fully resolve things, which means more investigating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The game menus do their best to keep everything organized for you and to nudge you about where to go next, but I haven’t always found it to be quite enough, so I also keep a notebook beside me while I play. Occasionally I’ve been frustrated when I feel like I know enough to confront a character but haven’t discovered all the things to let the <em>game</em> know I know them, but those instances have been pretty rare. My main problem is that everything is so interesting that I’m constantly getting off track, suddenly remembering that time is ticking down and I’m no closer to putting my top priorities to bed.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Story cutscenes are told through dialogue and static images (Spooky Door)</figcaption></figure><p>For me, <em>The Seance of Blake Manor</em> echoes <em>Blue Prince</em>’s interlocking mysteries and sense of place without having to contend with its life-eating RNG and open-endedness (I’ve also seen some players compare the two game’s art styles.). There’s some <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> vibes too (a game I actually <em>did</em> <a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finish</a>!), and I’ve wrestled with wanting to start again to introduce the game to the <a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-laser-eyes-tips-steam-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">friend</a> I played <em>Lorelei </em>with, and not wanting anything to come between me and seeing its end. But at the same time, I’m tempted to start again just so there’ll be more game to play, even though I have a full in-game day and evening left; like a good book, I both want to know what happens in the end and to never be done with it.</p><p>It sucks to be writing about <em>Blake Manor</em> on a Monday morning because now I want to be playing it but a whole work day stands in the way. There is just <em>so much</em> in this game, all of it given so much detail and attention that I’m thoroughly lost in it, while still providing enough guidance to keep me from getting totally washed away. It’s captured the obsession and passion of all those puzzle games I couldn’t get into this year, while still being a constrained experience I can actually tackle, with that time limit bringing a tension that feels essential to the game’s story and atmosphere. There’s a free demo on Steam if you want to get a feel for it first; you should do this not just because the game is good, but because then I’ll have more people playing alongside me to talk about it with.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance"><h3>And Also, Who Even Cares About Halo And Lord Of The Rings These Days</h3></a><p>"All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-grind-jp-mandalia-plains"><h3>I Will Grind In Final Fantasy Tactics Every Single Time And You Cannot Stop Me</h3></a><p>Final Fantasy Tactics without grinding Mandalia Plains is like a day without sunshine.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-halo-dhs-ice-trump-flood"><h3>Not Commenting Is Commenting</h3></a><p>'Microsoft does not have anything to share on this matter'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/seance-of-blake-manor]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ahead of 'Wicked: For Good'</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="706d691edd75b"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/706d691edd75b/super-mario-bros-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Universal Pictures</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're itching to see what <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> will actually look like, then you might not have much longer to wait.</p>
<p>According to movie scoops outlet <a href="https://x.com/MyTimeToShineH/status/1985029599063843018">My Time to Shine</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-next-mario-galaxy-movie-reveal-is-reportedly-coming-very-soon/">VGC</a>), the next trailer for the upcoming flick will be presented before showings for <strong>Wicked: For Good</strong>. If accurate, this presumably means that the trailer will get its debut either on <strong>21st November</strong>, which is when Wicked: For Good releases, or at some point beforehand.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn't sound like a very Nintendo move to just let the trailer play in theatres without any kind of build-up, so we'd imagine that there would be some sort of Direct showcase in which Miyamoto reveals the trailer himself, followed by Chris Pratt reiterating how much he just loves to stomp those darn Koopas.</p>

<p>Whether this claim is accurate or not, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is releasing on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>, so Nintendo and Illumination will likely want to kick off the marketing campaign pretty soon.</p>
<p>The upcoming movie is a direct sequel to <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>, which released back in 2023. Actors Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black, Charlie Day, Keegan-Michael Key, and Kevin Michael Richardson are all set to reprise their roles.</p>
<p>The movie's title was revealed during the most recent Nintendo Direct, during which the 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> was recognised with several key announcements.</p>
