            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/16/dead-by-deadlight-gets-lara-croft-survivor-today-2v8-mode-and-cross-progression-on-the<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tomb Raider Chapter</h2>

<p>Lara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here's an explanation of each per DBD's website:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Finesse:</strong>&nbsp;Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.</li>
	<li><strong>Hardened:</strong>&nbsp;When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.</li>
	<li><strong>Specialist:</strong>&nbsp;When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.</li>
</ul><p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVtkcHfHcNc" width="640"></iframe></p>



<p>On July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCumCxtPTew" width="640"></iframe></p>

<h2>Cross-Progression</h2>

<p>Cross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Today, NVIDIA released a new GeForce Game Ready driver, version 560.70, available via the official website, GeForce Experience, or the new NVIDIA app. This driver is optimized for three upcoming game launches: A44's Soulslite <a href="https://wccftech.com/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-hands-on-preview-enjoyable-soulslite-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a>, Mithril Interactive's first-person 'extraction fantasy dungeon crawler' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2448970/Dungeonborne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dungeonborne</a>, and Frost Giant's Warcraft-inspired real-time strategy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-inspired-stormgate-rts-is-well-on-its-way-to-become-the-biggest-kickstarter-game-campaign-in-a-while/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stormgate</a>.</p>
<p>All of these games support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation. Interestingly, NVIDIA also revealed that Flintlock: The Siege Dawn uses the AI-based Audio2Face technique to create facial animation and lip-syncing based on audio files.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also shared some benchmark data for Dungeonborne. DLSS 3 (Super Resolution and Frame Generation) can accelerate frame rates by 3.3x on average at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled. The RTX 4090 graphics card registered nearly 190 average frames per second, and even the RTX 4060 was over 60 frames per second.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>GeForce RTX 40 users will also be able to try two NVIDIA DLSS in two upcoming beta tests: <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-f2p-mmorpg-launches-on-september-17-on-pc-and-consoles-with-cross-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Throne and Liberty</a> (July 18-23) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-games-announces-marvel-rivals-closed-beta-with-cross-platform-capabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> (July 23-August 5).</p>
<p>This GeForce Game Ready driver also introduces fourteen new G-Sync Compatible displays, which are listed in the table below.</p>

As one might expect from a newly opened Discord server, the chat was also peppered with racist, sexist, and homophobic language, edgy memes, and even an allegation of grooming, but its primary function, at least for a while, was as a space for <em>The Boys</em> cosplay.</p><figure id="" data-id="1b93e38219e63896e51fd6a180f8f5c8" data-recommend-id="image://1b93e38219e63896e51fd6a180f8f5c8" data-format="png" data-width="280" data-height="347" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the DC Official Discord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the DC Official Discord." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Discord / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b93e38219e63896e51fd6a180f8f5c8" data-recommend-id="image://1b93e38219e63896e51fd6a180f8f5c8" data-format="png" data-width="280" data-height="347" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the DC Official Discord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though there were certainly members pretending to be other fictional characters and real-life people, including one person claiming they were the Green Goblin who implored people to buy his <em>Fortnite</em> bundle, and another with the username OJ Simpson, by and large the DC Official Discord was a <em>The Boys</em> roleplay session for over 12 hours. This is at least somewhat appropriate considering the comic is published by DC, but was taken to the extreme by the server’s members. Dozens changed their names to characters from the series or variations of those characters (including “gay Homelander”) and sent messages in the chat as if they were actually those people.<br></p><p>A Billy Butcher roleplayer (played by Karl Urban in the show, but probably not the Discord) wrote out all their words with an obvious Cockney accent, while someone pretending to be Kimiko (a non-verbal character who communicates via her own version of sign language,played by Karen Fukuhara) sent only hand signal emojis in the chat. Someone pretending to be Frenchie, the character with a close relationship to Kimiko and the only one who can understand her signing, occasionally responded to her with hand signal emojis. </p><p>At one point, a Homelander roleplayer quoted a line from a recent episode from <em>The Boys</em> in which the evil-Superman-coded character demanded one of the other superheroes fellate the other. “Vought [the evil in-universe corporation tied to the superheroes] will now take control of this server. Do not worry, America. The Seven will safely moderate this server from here,” wrote another Homelander at 4:52 p.m. ET.</p><figure id="" data-id="f7e2de72370baca484d5bb0a2bdd000e" data-recommend-id="image://f7e2de72370baca484d5bb0a2bdd000e" data-format="png" data-width="618" data-height="306" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shot from the DC Official Discord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen shot from the DC Official Discord." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Discord / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7e2de72370baca484d5bb0a2bdd000e" data-recommend-id="image://f7e2de72370baca484d5bb0a2bdd000e" data-format="png" data-width="618" data-height="306" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shot from the DC Official Discord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At around midnight ET, a moderator dropped a message in the general chat that read:<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Hi everyone!<br>-No inappropriate memes/jokes are allowed<br>-No RP or Parody accounts are allowed<br>- We’re muting/banning people who do not follow the rules<br>-Please notify the Mod Team of anything weird</p></blockquote><p>Someone replied, “Half the server is getting banned.” Another member, who appeared to have been cosplaying Frenchie at one point, sent an approximation of the word “Frenchie” spelled out in American Sign Language along with the message, “we aren’t allowed to roleplay.”<br></p><p>Despite the warnings, the roleplaying continued—at 6 a.m. ET, a person pretending to be <em>The Boys</em>’ vice presidential candidate who can explode people’s heads with her mind, Victoria Neuman, asked “where’s Homelander?” A Butcher cosplayer replied, “with me,” while several other users claimed the flying hero “landed at home.” Several people changed their name to “Not Homelander” or “Not Billy Butcher” in an attempt to circumvent the anti-RP rule. Not Homelander had a profile pic of his actor, Anthony Starr in-character with a mustache Photoshopped onto his face. </p><p>The anti-RP message was shared around a dozen times by more than one moderator, the latest of which was sent at around 11 a.m. ET. As of the time of publication, the roleplaying has almost completely ceased, but many are unsurprised a DC-focused server would descend into chaos so swiftly. <em>Kotaku</em> reached out to an Official DC Discord moderator for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 5, Season 3, is set to be a blast from the past as the game brings back beloved weapons with its latest unvault announcement. The return of fan favourites like the Flint Knock Pistol and the Mammoth Pistol will surely stir up some nostalgia among players. Be sure to check out all the weapons that Fortnite has unvaulted and vaulted this week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite Reload, the new fast-paced battle royale mode, will see the most new weapons arrive. As revealed by the Fortnite Status account, the weapons that have been unvaulted for the Reload mode include the Thunder Pump Shotgun, the Twin Mag SMG and the Mammoth Pistol. On the other hand, the Lever Action Shotgun, the Tactical Submachine Gun and the Hand Cannon will be vaulted going forward.</p>

<p>A reliable source of Fortnite leaks, ShiinaBR, has revealed that a classic Fortnite weapon has been unvaulted. The Flint-Knock Pistol, fondly known as the ‘Yeet Pistol’ (courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=b6yDfg1y-fA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lazarbeam</a>), has been unvaulted for Fortnite Battle Royale.</p>

<p>On the topic of Fortnite, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pirates-of-the-caribbean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cursed Sails Event arrives on July 19th</a>, kickstarting the highly anticipated Fortnite x Pirates of the Caribbean collaboration. The event was available earlier due to a bug, and many could grab the Jack Sparrow skin beforehand. Now, the pass is officially arriving for the others to acquire the skin of the iconic pirate. The Pirates of the Caribbean crew will be sold through the item shop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, someone recently got the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-can-run-the-original-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original Doom</a> to run in Fortnite. Also, Fortnite made changes to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-disables-vehicles-nitro-fists-and-more-for-ranked-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked mode loot pool</a> earlier, which you can read about here.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Black Ops 6 - Vault Edition Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_5">What to expect from Season 5</h2><p dir="ltr">A new season of Call of Duty means a brand-new battle pass is on the way, which usually introduces at least one new operator for MW3 and Warzone. New seasons typically include two or three weapons in the free tiers of the battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">The past few seasons of MW3 have included several events for unlocking free cosmetic items, such as camos, weapon blueprints, and calling cards. The only event confirmed by Activision is the upcoming collaboration with the WWE. Nothing specific is detailed for the WWE crossover event, but there will likely be free rewards to earn as well as shop bundles for operators.</p><p dir="ltr">It was previously suggested by leakers that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-might-include-a-deadpool-wolverine-crossover-in-season-5/1100-6524622/">Deadpool could crossover to Call of Duty</a>, as data mining allegedly revealed a series of potential finishing moves with poses and mannerisms reminiscent of Marvel's "Merc with a Mouth." It's possible these over-the-top finishing moves are related to a WWE superstar instead, but Season 5's launch does closely match up with the release of Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, so a Marvel crossover event does fit the timeline.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Activision has teased the return of the Superstore point of interest, which was one of the most-popular landing spots on the Verdansk map. Superstore will arrive to Urzikstan sometime in Season 5.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer announcement for the Superstore POI also includes a first look at potential weapons and cosmetics coming to the game. One operator has a guitar on their back, which could mean it's a new melee weapon or a cosmetic variant of an existing melee weapon included in an upcoming operator bundle.

<p>The attention to detail in display refers to the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It's unlikely that the in-game moment will mimic real-life events--<a href="https://english.news.cn/20240713/e40351d7ff064bde8ff811dc2d0b418a/c.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">exploding rockets</a> might be a bit too distracting--but it's nice to see either way.</p><p>Cape Canaveral has been on the news lately with the first-ever <a href="https://www.space.com/news/live/boeing-starliner-live-updates" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starliner astronaut mission</a> for NASA on behalf of Boeing. The mission, which started on June 6 and was initially set as a 10-day flight, has been extended indefinitely. The crew has been in orbit for more than a month now. In a <a href="https://www.space.com/boeing-starliner-no-return-date-from-iss" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press conference</a> on July 10, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program Steve Stich said that the capsule experienced helium leaks and thruster issues during the trip. As engineers continue to look into the cause of the problem, the Starliner has yet to be cleared for departure.</p><p>College Football 25 might not have NCAA, but it does have NASA. Another thing lacking from the game, at least for the time being, is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-team-builder-isnt-live-at-launch/1100-6524983/" data-ref-id="1100-6524983">Team Builder</a> feature. If you're wondering what to expect, we have a dedicated guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-team-builder-in-ea-sports-college-football-25/1100-6524992/" data-ref-id="1100-6524992">how to use Team Builder</a> once it launches.

<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-rpg-review">Super Mario RPG</a> was initially released in 1996 for the SNES, and over two decades later, a remake has been released for Nintendo Switch. Super Mario RPG for Switch is an excellent game, even being a great entry point into the world of RPGs. As one of the wackiest <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-mario-games-on-nintendo-switch">Mario games on Switch</a>, there are dozens of unique characters to discover who have never appeared outside of this title.

Some of the biggest changes available in these remakes are a re-recorded original soundtrack, online versus play, and the massive shift in art style from 2D to 3D. Overall, this collection is an excellent way to revisit one of Nintendo's most beloved strategy titles. <h2>Cuphead for $24.99</h2><div id="203272" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Cuphead - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div>

The Nintendo Switch version of the game is excellent with 60FPS support, fitting right at home as a platformer on the console.<h2>Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles for $29.99</h2><div id="203278" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div>
<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-the-hinokami-chronicles-review">Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles</a> is still the best Demon Slayer game out there. The flashy title features over 30 characters, with the story covered through the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/demon-slayer-season-2-premiere-entertainment-district-arc-review">Entertainment District Arc</a>. You can dive head first into Adventure Mode and relive the major story moments of the hit manga, or you can choose to battle it out against others in Versus Mode. Explore unique matchups that were never before possible, like Rui vs. Tengen. Let your creativity run wild!<h2>Super Mario Bros. Wonder for $56</h2><div id="203265" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div>Per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-review">IGN's 9/10 review</a>, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is one of the best games available on the Nintendo Switch, period. As the console's first new 2D Mario title, over 150 different levels are available in this co-op game, with plenty of secrets and challenges to uncover as you play through the story. One of the new features of Wonder is the Badge system, which allows you to grant characters unique abilities to use throughout levels. At $56, the price is likely to drop even lower, but this is a Mario game you do not want to pass up when its on sale.<h2>When Are Switch Games On Sale? </h2><p>The Nintendo eShop pretty much always has digital versions of Switch games on sale, which you can find in the "Great Deals" section of the app on your Switch. While you can't really predict what games you'll find on sale when, you may be able to find a new third-party gem. If you're looking for physical Switch games, whether to manage your console's storage or to add to your collection, you should check out big shopping events like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-vs-black-friday-deals">Prime Day or Black Friday</a>. </p><p>One of the best Switch deals is grabbing a special edition Nintendo Switch, like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-nintendo-switch-lite-deal-of-2024-is-available-ahead-of-prime-day">Animal Crossing Switch Lite</a>, which includes a free Nintendo game. That said, it may be worth waiting for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo Switch 2</a> if you're looking for a console upgrade. </p><p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has announced its&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>release date, and the narrative-focused&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff is set to arrive on PC and consoles this fall.</p>
<p>You can expect to get your hands on&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>on September 3rd, when it'll land on PC via both Steam and the Epic Games Store, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Development on the game is being handled by none other than Supermassive Games, the studio behind narrative horror adventures like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/quarry">The Quarry</a>&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Man of Medan&nbsp;</em>series, as well as&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date-body.jpg?itok=lXPhv758 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date-body.jpg?itok=SCb0KPt8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Casting of Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>is a more story-focused&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff launching in September.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>sees four budding filmmakers taking a trip to the town of Cedar Hills in order to shoot a horror movie known as&nbsp;<em>Murder Mill</em>, and as that name suggests, things don't quite go according to plan for them.</p>
<p>If you're a Supermassive Games fan, you'll probably know roughly what to expect from&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone</em>; it'll feature a branching narrative in which your decisions have an impact on the direction the story takes, and it'll be pretty light on conventional "gameplay".</p>
<p>Set during the 1980s,&nbsp;<em>Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>looks like it's tailor-made for fans of both&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>itself and&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things</em>, as well as the works of Stephen King (for such a recommendation must inevitably follow after a&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>mention).</p>
<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p>If you're of a mind, you can pre-order&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>via <a href="https://thecastingoffrankstone.com/pre-order/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the official&nbsp;website</a>, and if you do so, you'll gain access to the Plunderer's Instinct bonus, which helps to highlight collectibles in the game's world.</p>
<p><em>Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>is part of Behaviour Interactive's&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs">anniversary celebrations</a>; the studio is also celebrating the game's eighth birthday with&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>crossovers, as well as a new game mode for&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>
<p><em>The Casting of Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>launches on September 3rd across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2223840/The_Casting_of_Frank_Stone/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/the-casting-of-frank-stone/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-casting-of-frank-stone/9pg0pmb5q0gt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/16/the-casting-of-frank-stone-terrorizes-players-this-september<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/the-casting-of-frank-stone-is-supermassives-single-player-horror">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>, Supermassive Games’ single-player narrative-driven horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe, has a release date. This intriguing horror collaboration will arrive on September 3, and a new trailer provides a proper introduction of the main cast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Developed by Supermassive (Until Dawn, The Quarry) and published by Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive, The Casting of Frank Stone stars five teenagers – Christine Gordon, Jaime Rivera, Linda Castle, Robert Green, and Bonnie Rivera – who film their own horror movie in an abandoned steel mill. Unfortunately, this mill has ties to a notorious murderer named Frank Stone, and the youth’s innocent art project goes horribly wrong.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6FODK6lwtM" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>We still don’t know much about the narrative other than that it is set within the world of Dead by Daylight and takes place in the town of Cedar Mills during the summer of 1980. Gameplay-wise, The Casting of Frank Stone follows a similar blueprint to Supermassive’s previous horror titles in that it’s a choice-driven adventure where characters can be permanently killed off based on your decisions. You can check out a recent gameplay trailer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/14/dead-by-daylight-spin-off-the-casting-of-frank-stone-gets-chilling-gameplay-trailer">here</a> to see it in action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Casting of Frank Stone is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p>
