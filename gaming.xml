			<p>For years, telling friends about The Legend of Heroes games has felt less like recommending a cool new RPG and more like assigning Summer homework. Hyping up a game in this franchise comes with the caveat that you need to play every entry in order so you can fully understand the story, but when you’re talking about over a dozen 80+ hour JRPGs, that isn’t an easy ask. It’s why I’ve been so excited for The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak to get an English release, and so frustrated that it’s taken so many years for it to happen. In a world where games that were once niche Japan-only titles now get synchronised global releases, the delayed release of this new entry point in a long-running franchise has likely lost much of its momentum for a potential global audience. That isn’t fair at all, when this is one of the most engaging and enjoyable new JRPGs I’ve ever played.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzbJsCpSZEE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak takes place in the Republic of Calvard, a country far east from the main locales from the last handful of The Legend of Heroes games. You won’t be expected to know what happened in previous games, who their protagonists were, or what the dozens of characters in those games may or may not be up to when you start this one.</p>


<p>You’re given a clean slate in the form of new series lead Van Arkride, who works a day-job as a humble Spriggan. Essentially, he’s Columbo with a license to kill – clients come to him looking for a detective, a bounty hunter, or a combo of the two. When a young girl by the name of Agnes Claudel comes to him seeking help in tracking down seven mementos from her great-grandfather, Van ends up taking her in as an assistant and the two of them set off on a conspiracy-unfurling journey through the seedy city of Edith and beyond.</p>
<p>Typically,&nbsp;protagonists in The Legend of Heroes live up to that “hero” moniker, with a lot of them being plucky young swordsmen with a lawful moral compass and plenty to learn about the dark secrets of their world. Van isn’t like that at all, and it ends up being such a breath of fresh air to play as a protagonist who isn’t just bucking the trends of his franchise, but of the JRPG genre as a whole.</p>


<p>Working as a detective-slash-fixer means that Van knows every dirty little secret about the city of Edith and the people who occupy it’s seedy underbelly. He has connections to secretive factions like Oroboros, and no qualms with taking on jobs that are slightly on the wrong side of being illegal. At the same time, he does his best to protect Agnes and his other inexperienced companions from being too exposed to the shadier sides of his business. Striking that balance as he tackles underground mafias and scientific conspiracies is incredible storytelling, and it’s a thrill whether you’re a longtime fan or fresh to the franchise.</p>
<p>A lot of other aspects of The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak are a fresh glow-up from prior entries. This game utilizes a brand new engine, resulting in lots of much-needed improvements to the gameplay experience. Character models look better than ever, and the dynamic cutscene animations we had just a taste of in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/30/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-into-reverie-review/">The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie</a> are dialled up even further in this game. There’s a much better sense of connectivity and seamless exploration to the game, too – you’ll encounter far fewer loading screens than usual as you run around the streets of Edith, and you can enter and exit houses or stores seamlessly without any loading screens. It’s small stuff, but stuff that has been long overdue for a franchise that’s been running on dated technology for so long.</p>

<p>Most exciting to me of all the changes and upgrades in The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, though, is the combat. There are two different combat modes in the game – real-time action combat like you’d experience in modern Ys games, and positional turn-based battles that feel just like combat from prior entries in the series. You can choose to use one mode or the other as much as you want, with the exception of boss battles that are only turn-based in nature.</p>
<p>The game smartly rewards you for swapping between the two regularly styles – damaging enemies enough in real-time combat will stun them, and if you switch into turn-based battle from there they’ll take increased damage and have delayed turns. It’s something I genuinely wish other JRPGs could implement. I’m a massive action-combat fan, and I also appreciate turn-based battles, but in long games they can both get a little repetitive. Having the ability to swap between the two so often kept me on my toes and excited to play all the way until the credits rolled.</p>

<p>Inevitably, a sequel to The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak will require some knowledge of prior games to fully appreciate the narrative web they’re weaving. As far as this title alone, goes, it’s an amazing starting point for anyone, and a genuinely captivating and exciting JRPG in its own right. It isn’t just easy to recommend this game because it’s a standalone adventure – it’s easy to recommend because it’s just that good.</p>

            <p>
The developer of Concord, Sony's upcoming PlayStation 5 and PC hero shooter, has discussed how it will handle the game's monetisation - and why the game requires a PSN account log-in on PC. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell earlier this month, Concord developer Firewalk explained the game's relatively cheap £35/$40 price point, and said it was a fair proposition for the amount of content the title contained. 
</p>
<p>
"When you buy the game, you get... the 16 characters, 12 maps, six modes," Firewalk's director of IP Kim Kreines said. "Every season, all that seasonal content, that's all free.

<p>
"There's additional cosmetic-only customisation options where you can further personalise your characters' looks - this isn't gameplay, this is only cosmetic - that you can purchase, and that will come out seasonally as well."
</p>
<p>
Seasonal content will remain free for the time being, with added characters, maps, modes and worlds, and weekly cinematic shorts expanding the game's lore.
</p>
<p>
Concord was fully detailed at Sony's State of Play last month, where its five-versus-five PVP gameplay was first glimpsed. A hero shooter like Overwatch, it has a narrative style and colourful cast of characters that seems influenced by James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy.
</p>
<p>
A cross-platform game for both PC and PS5, Concord will once again feature a PSN account requirement on both platforms. This has been a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">point of contention</a> for past PlayStation-published releases, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-official-review-bomb-cape-seemingly-gets-an-airing-as-psn-drama-subsides">most notably Helldivers</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-developer-wants-you-to-know-you-can-play-it-on-steam-without-linking-to-a-psn-account">Ghost of Tsushima, meanwhile, will let you play without a PSN account as long as you're offline</a>. So what were the reasons behind it being necessary again here?
</p>
<p>
"That allows us to have cross play, that cross progression, that's that's an important piece of it," Kreines said when asked.
</p>
<p>
"The goal is for players to come together," lead character designer Jon Weisnewski added. "And so for us to have PC players and PlayStation 5 players together, for that cross-play and cross-progression to work, that's a layer that needs to be there - just on a technical level. So the goal is we want to get players together, to have fun and play together, this is part of that experience."
</p>
<p>
"Concord feels like a load of brilliant games combined - but is that enough?" our Chris Tapsell wrote after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">hands-on with the game</a>. "My fingers are crossed for this one being given enough time to find its identity on the fly."

In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, YouTube spokesperson Nicole Bell wrote, “We have suspended monetization on DrDisrespect’s channel for violating our Creator Responsibility policy.” Bell also wrote that Dr Disrespect has been suspended from <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">YouTube’s partner program</a> “following serious allegations against the creator.”</p><p>The allegations refer to multiple reports that the streamer, whose real name is Guy Beahm, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">was banned from Twitch in 2020</a> due to inappropriate messages sent to a minor through Whispers, a Twitch communication app. When Beahm was banned, neither he nor Twitch explained the reason, leaving it a mystery for four years. Late last week, however, Cody Conners, a former Twitch employee, <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">posted on X the alleged reason for Beahm’s ban</a>. “He got banned because got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product,” Conners wrote. “He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon.”</p><div><p><em>The Verge</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">was able to corroborate Conners’ post with information from a second ex-Twitch employee</a> who was on the trust and safety team at the time of the incident. In a <em>Bloomberg</em> report, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-25/youtuber-dr-disrespect-was-allegedly-kicked-off-twitch-for-messaging-minor?sref=9YEaDeJj">two more Twitch employees also came forward</a> to corroborate the allegations.</p></div><p>After Conners’ tweet, Beahm <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804337822415097955">denied the accusations</a>, posting on X, “This has been settled, no wrongdoing was acknowledged and they paid out the whole contract,” referring to a financial dispute Beahm settled against Twitch back in 2021. However, as multiple brands including <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-dr-disrespect-fallout-continues-as-2k-games-turtle-beach-the-nfl-and-others-cut-ties-with-the-disgraced-streamer/">Turtle Beach</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24185172/dr-disrespect-midnight-society-termination">Midnight Society</a> — a game studio Beahm co-founded — began to distance themselves from the creator, Beahm took to social media again to defend himself. </p><p>“Were there Twitch whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017?&nbsp;The answer is yes,” <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089">Beahm wrote on X</a>, saying that those messages, “sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate.”</p><p>Beahm closed the statement by saying he planned to take an extended vacation but would eventually return to streaming. After getting banned from Twitch, Beahm started a YouTube channel in August 2020 that currently boasts over 4 million subscribers. In <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/dr-disrespect-inappropriate-messages-minor-twitch-1235048071/">a report for <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, Ryan Wyatt, former head of YouTube’s gaming partnerships, said that YouTube declined to give Beahm a partnership deal when he joined the platform because of the rumors surrounding his exit from Twitch. Partnership deals, like the kind enjoyed by other YouTube creators like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves">Valkyrae</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal">DrLupo</a>, would have granted Beahm access to special YouTube resources and monetization features as well as ad revenue sharing.</p><p>“Because of those rumors, there was no reason to entertain doing any deal with [Beahm],” Wyatt said to <em>Rolling Stone</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24187720/the-boys-hughie-simon-pegg-dad<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ORTzcw"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24176428/the-boys-season-4-review-new"><em>The Boys</em></a> is full of death, but little grieving. Since season 1, Homelander has laser-blasted bystanders, punched Vought underlings through the chest, and ripped apart fellow supes nearly once an episode. The violence is so over the top that the loss of innocent life never really sinks in beyond “Good lord, someone needs to stop that guy!” It’s a bit of a miracle; each week, showrunner Eric Kripke and his team of writers and directors ride the edge(lord) between gleeful shock value and grotesque reality. There is no show that has made me yelp out loud more times than <em>The Boys</em>.</p>
<p id="H9YDUo">Which is why season 4 episode 5, “Beware the Jabberwock, My Son,” floored me. The episode is full of standard <em>Boys</em> absurdity, from the Marvel-at-Comic-Con parody of the V52 Expo to a standoff against Compound V-enhanced sheep. But through the mayhem, writer Judalina Neira and director Shana Stein swerve into a grim scene: Hughie (Jack Quaid) discovering that his estranged mother injected his dying father, Hughie Sr. (Simon Pegg), with stolen Compound V. Hughie almost gave the shot himself, a last-ditch effort to save his dad through superhuman means, but in the end threw the dose away, knowing long-term consequences all too well. His mom didn’t — and despite Hughie Sr. bouncing back for a moment, all hell quickly breaks loose.</p>
<p id="KeU6X9">Pegg’s screen time only amounts to 15 or 20 minutes of an hour-long episode, but it feels painfully long, in the way that standing by a declining loved one in those final years, months, or even days can feel. The Compound V causes Hughie Sr. to immediately lose control of his body, but instead of breaking a hip or having an accident, he teleports into a nearby patient’s torso, exploding blood and guts around the room. Hughie Sr. phases in and out of awareness of his actions. When he’s on, he’s in shock — <em>how did he wind up holding a human heart?</em> Hughie, who has seen these horrors before, remains calm… until it dawns on him that he’s never seen <em>this</em> horror before: his father, a simple but healthy man up until this point, completely breaking down.</p>

<p id="aiCxkj">A few weeks before <em>The Boys</em> season 4 premiered, my own grandmother’s years-long descent into dementia and pain ended with an abrupt bout of pneumonia that I can only imagine ended her suffering. The road to getting there was filled with unending care from her family and friends, who wanted to give her all the time she deserved, and many bumps in the road that could have very well been the end. So I was in A Helluva Place when I turned on “Beware the Jabberwock, My Son” and saw the entire saga of elder care flash through the mania of <em>The Boys</em> — and felt very terrifyingly right. Nothing prepares you for the shock of someone you’ve known for your entire life forgetting your name. </p>
<p id="BK9ehG">Pegg spent most of season 4 lying unconscious in a bed, breathing through tubes. At first I thought this was a cheeky gag for a franchise always willing to honor the actor. Pegg, after all, was <em>The Boys</em> comic artist Darick Robertson’s inspiration for the original Hughie, and his role in the show was stunt casting at its best. But Hughie Sr. popping back to life in “Beware the Jabberwock, My Son” is another cruel and familiar tease — there is no hope ahead in these circumstances. This was Pegg’s sendoff. </p>
<p id="ss1Chi">As the guy constantly shrieking while covered in blood, Jack Quaid doesn’t get enough credit for processing the ethical dilemmas of <em>The Boys</em> with a lighthearted touch. Next to Pegg, who’s never been so vulnerable on screen, Quaid tenderly reframes a question his character considers throughout the season: Will Hughie take a life to solve a problem? Most episodes, Hughie’s weighing the assassination of overpowered superheroes. In “Beware the Jabberwock, My Son,” he’s confronted with euthanizing his own father. Based on what he witnesses, there is no hesitation.</p>
<p id="om8KgU">“If we don’t do this,” he tells his mother, “then he spends the rest of his life scared and confused or in prison or an asylum or he kills more innocent people.”</p>
<p id="o4jMc2">The subplot isn’t Michael Haneke’s <em>Amour</em>, but it lands thanks to the ethereal quality of Pegg’s performance and Quaid’s commitment to playing all the sides of Hughie as Hughie. This is neither actor’s waterworks-cranking Oscar clip moment. It’s <em>The Boys</em>, subdued, and most important of all, a true end-of-life experience — one person fading away, and his family wondering where they go from there. There’s a whole Vought nightmare out the hospital door for Hughie; he feels it as he delivers a fatal injection to his father. But for one second all the chaos of <em>The Boys</em> fades away, and two men have a moment. A death with just a little grieving. </p>

<p>With the instability and uncertainty in the gaming industry still at an all-time high, another game studio is trying to unionize. In a series of <a href="https://x.com/OneBGS_MTL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posts on Twitter</a> earlier this week, Bethesda Game Studios Montreal has announced its intention to form a union with help from the Communications Workers of America (CWA) Canada.</p>



<p>Along with the general announcement, the studio workers laid out their reasons for filing for the certification with the Quebec Labor Board.</p>



<p>“As a union, we will strive to make BGS a supportive workplace that fosters creativity and talent,” they said. “This will allow us to keep creating some of the best video games in the industry in the jobs and at the studio we all love.”</p>



<p>They continued: “Having a seat at the table will ensure job security as well as improve transparency, accountability, flexibility and more. We aim to make sure everyone receives fair compensation for their work and the value they provide.”</p>



<p>By forming a union, they said, it will allow them to work to “push for the changes that reflect the needs and the wants of all developers.”</p>



<p>As of publishing, Zenimax nor Microsoft have commented on the unionization efforts. Bethesda Montreal joins other unions within Microsoft and Zenimax.</p>

        <p>Divestment was announced to shareholders in May, transaction has completed today</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Thunderful's restructuring continues as the group divests all of its distribution businesses to become a "pure-play games company," with a newly-incorporated iteration of Bergsala picking up the affected subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Bergsala NDP AB has acquired Amo Toys, Bergsala Aktiebolag, Thunderful 1 and Thunderful Solutions from the group. The deal was announced to shareholders and investors on May 21, and has been completed today.</p>
<p>This version of Bergsala is owned by Owe Bergsten, Thunderful's largest shareholder and board member.</p>
<p>It means the remaining Thunderful company is comprised solely of games businesses, including developers Coatsink, Jumpship, and SteamWorld creator Image &amp; Form, as well as publisher Rising Star Games, and investment firm Robot Teddy.</p>
<p>The divestment follows Thunderful's announcement in January that it would be <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-announces-restructuring-that-will-cut-20-of-its-workforce">restructuring the company, including cutting 20% of its workforce</a>. It has already <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-selling-headup-for-500k">sold German developer and publisher Headup</a> for €500,000, as well as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-selling-nordic-game-supply-to-distributors-acting-ceo">Nordic Game Supply</a>, which was another of its distribution businesses.</p>
<p>The Thunderful Group was formed in December 2019 by merging Thunderful with Bergsala. The latter is best known as Nintendo's exclusive distributor for the Nordic and Baltic regions – a deal that has been <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-extends-distribution-agreement-with-nintendo">extended to March 31, 2026</a>.</p>
<p>Weaker sales of Switch hardware as the console nears the end of its lifecycle were <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-ceo-says-restructure-is-off-to-a-good-start-as-it-reports-full-year-loss-of-60m">cited as a key factor</a> in Thunderful Group's full-year loss of SEK 609.4 million ($57 million). However, prior to this, Bergsala's Nintendo revenues were a major contributor to the group's success.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mika-and-the-witchs-mountain">Mika and The Witch's Mountain</a> appears to be an unofficial video game adaptation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bG17OYs-GA">Kiki's Delivery Service</a>, which is a Studio Ghibli film about a witch who decides to go postal, but not in the Running with Scissors sense. Created by developers Chibig and Nukefist, it's a "mini open world" game about carrying packages by broomstick while investigating the titular mountain, flying through hoops a la Pilotwings, and savouring the balmy inconsequentiality of an island that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. It also now has an early access release date, 21st August, and a charming new trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The early access build (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1819460/Mika_and_The_Witchs_Mountain/">Steam page here</a>) will ship with the full main story of the game, encompassing 36 individual deliveries and 18 sidequests. That's around five hours of play, with 18 main characters. You can also customise Mika with different outfits, and accessorise her broom with charms and trails. I, for one, would like to equip a siren and a disco ball. The broom can't be weaponised, but it can be upgraded, and upgrade it you must if you want to reach the mountain's summit.</p>
<p>The press releases promises that if you pull off "perfect deliveries" you will receive "unimaginable treasures". I don't know mate, I can imagine a lot of crazy things. For example, a broomstick with a siren and a disco ball. </p>
<p>The developers are also planning a free update which allows you to pet animals (a black cat, surely), go fishing while flying around, and participate in some kind of Churro Express minigame. We can also expect additional sidequests and dungeons which will flesh out the "hidden side" of the mountain.</p>
<p>Kiki's Delivery Service aside, Mika And The Witch's Mountain puts me in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-brew-barons-is-a-sumptuous-ghibli-inspired-flight-sim-thats-also-a-brewing-sim-for-some-reason">Brew Barons</a>, in which you are an utter maniac who insists on doing every single thing using aeroplanes.</p>

In previews and trailers leading up to its release, HoYoverse has emphasized the game’s combat as the biggest draw. The recent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACgiN-216s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACgiN-216s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-release special program</a></span> went deep on combat and showed off just how spectacular it looks. As opposed to the real-time action of <em>Genshin Impact</em> (which can be pretty simplistic), <em>ZZZ </em>looks to offer a more in-depth battle system with normal, special, sub, combo, and assist attacks that let players mix and match their party makeup to deal massive damage. Without getting into the nitty gritty, it seems like a welcome upgrade to the combat of<em> Genshin Impact </em>and comes just in time to compete with the combat prowess of gacha competitor<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wuthering-waves-gacha-impressions-mobile-pc-1851507263&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wuthering-waves-gacha-impressions-mobile-pc-1851507263"><em>Wuthering Waves</em></a></span>.</p><p>Alongside its focus on combat, HoYoverse also wants players to be able to progress through <em>ZZZ</em>’s story<em> </em>at a brisker pace than they often can in the company’s other games. Typically in those games, you constantly need to do daily quests to gather upgrade materials to make your characters more powerful before you can take on the newest story quests. (Of course, this is by design, so that players are tempted to spend money and make the upgrade process faster.) The <em>ZZZ </em>team, however, is making some big promises about how it will avoid the usual <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-enjoy-mobile-game-gr-1822341702&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-enjoy-mobile-game-gr-1822341702">gacha grind</a></span>, a move rooted in two big design decisions. </p><p>The first is the removal of the stamina system which was present in earlier betas. This system made it so you could only do so many story missions in a day, creating an artificial hard limit on how far players could progress. Thankfully that is now removed (as noted by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/oh-no-zenless-zone-zero-is-good-now&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oh-no-zenless-zone-zero-is-good-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span><em> </em>in its most recent preview). More notable is a character trial system that will give players access to properly leveled party members for story missions. This removes the need to always have your collection of characters perfectly upgraded and equipped with the proper gear. </p><p>With this system, it sounds like players will essentially be able to play through the story like you can in a typical, non-gacha game. I’m reminded of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/honkai-impact-3rd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/honkai-impact-3rd"><em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em></a></span>, another HoYoverse game that implemented story trial characters later in its life to great effect. Just a week ago, <em>ZZZ</em>’s producer Zhenyu Li talked about not punishing players who want to take a break from the game. “Maybe the team will try to get some new ways to let [returning players] experience the latest content without finishing some pre-conditioned missions,” Li told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vg247.com/zenless-zone-zero-lets-you-take-breaks-from-the-daily-grind&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vg247.com/zenless-zone-zero-lets-you-take-breaks-from-the-daily-grind" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VG247</em></a></span>. These systems seem to allow for precisely that.</p><p>Some might wonder how a simplified path through the story can exist alongside the traditional gacha mechanics. However, with a high emphasis on combat intricacies in moment-to-moment gameplay, I think most players will still find upgrading and unlocking new characters to be its own satisfying loop, even if they can run through the story at their own pace. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We didn't get to Sandfall and Kepler Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> while covering Microsoft's summer showcase a couple of weeks ago. If memory serves, when they ran that particular trailer I was busy sponging swampwater out my eyes after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witchy-swampy-action-adventure-south-of-midnight-gets-a-proper-gameplay-trailer-with-island-sized-alligators">writing up South Of Midnight</a>, while Nic had become so vociferously agitated over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-the-dark-ages-comes-rampaging-in-on-a-chainsaw-shield-next-year">the debut of Doom: Dark Ages</a> that he was no longer solid and tangible enough to operate a keyboard. Graham, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/perfect-dark-reboot-resurfaces-with-stealth-parkour-and-spy-gadgetry">had absconded with Joanna Dark to Immersive Sim Land</a> and Matt, poor Matt, had fallen into a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-of-war-e-day-takes-the-series-back-to-the-start-of-the-locust-war-complete-with-a-nod-to-mad-world">Locust sinkhole</a> while "omnimanouevring" around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-a-release-date-for-the-end-of-october-open-beta-on-the-way">Black Ops 6</a>. But if one of us had been free and willing we might have had enthusiastic thoughts about this "evolution of JRPGs", in which you are trying to thwart a self-serious artist who is about to magically murder everybody over the age of 32. It is, alas, too late for me.</p><!--more-->

<p>"Once a year, the Paintress wakes and paints upon her monolith," goes the Steam blurb. "Paints her cursed number. And everyone of that age turns to smoke and fades away. Year by year, that number ticks down and more of us are erased. Tomorrow she'll wake and paint '33.' And tomorrow we depart on our final mission - Destroy the Paintress, so she can never paint death again. We are Expedition 33." Excellent! This is the kind of early-thirties moxie and momentum that saves a world, though I would quite like to play a spin-off game starring the sprightly firecrackers of Expedition 69 and the embarrassing midlifers of Expedition 39.</p>
<p>Expedition 33 takes place in a world inspired by Belle Époque France - the period approximately running from 1871 to 1914, when you couldn't move for art nouveau, cabaret dancers and Baudelairean ennui. It was during this period that the Eiffel Tower was built - you can see it in the screenshot there, though it seems to have melted. Doubtless that Paintress is to blame. She's incorrigible!</p>

</figure>
<p>As for how you go about nobbling the Paintress, this is a blend of party and turn-based combat with certain actions seemingly performed in real-time - a performance that reminds me of Lost Odyssey, and which threatens to invoke the dread word "QTE". There's a world map with locations including the Island of Visages and the Forgotten Battlefield, which have hidden quests and other secrets to discover. While there are named story characters - Gustave and Maelle appear to be the stars - you'll also get to recruit "special companions" and "allies of fortune", while following in the footsteps of previous expeditions.</p>
<p>My reservations about the tightrope the combat is walking aside, I think this looks hella swank and damnably cool. You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/">the Steam page</a> - it doesn't have a release date yet.</p>

<p id="v8mps9">The lo-fi roguelike<em> Loop Hero</em> distills the hours-long gameplay loops of most RPGs into a few utterly intoxicating minutes. As your chosen hero travels automatically along a preset path, they’ll automatically battle monsters that award loot that you apply between encounters. Each completed trip gives you an opportunity to return with your resources or press onward to encounter tougher enemies for greater rewards. —<em>AJ</em></p>

<p id="oAVgv8">A grim, sci-fi roguelike full of interesting, weighty decisions, <em>Crying Suns</em> feels like a more narrative-driven version of perhaps one of the best sci-fi roguelikes ever, <em>FTL</em>. You take on the role of an admiral who’s emerged from stasis to find the empire they once served in shambles. Take control of the last remaining ship of your fleet as you balance your resources while attempting to outrun those responsible for this galactic collapse and piece together what happened. —<em>AJ</em></p>

<p id="Fy2IE8">Simply put, <em>Krispee Street</em> is a hidden object game — its crowded visuals hide lots of little details to seek out, some of which tell little stories within the contained worlds. There’s so much to love about the silly, colorful art style and the characters that inhabit the world, which is based on a webcomic. (I hadn’t heard of the webcomic before getting into <em>Krispee Street</em>, so don’t let unfamiliarity scare you off.) Despite <em>Krispee Street</em> being visually chaotic with hundreds of things — characters and objects — to find within its margins, I would describe the experience of playing the game as anything but.</p>

<p id="UpcX3x">I saw someone <a href="https://twitter.com/folly_studio/status/1725116076223307808">describe <em>Gubbins</em></a> as “<em>Scrabble</em> on acid,” and yeah, that checks out. Studio Folly’s word game is a more laid-back version of <em>Scrabble</em>, but with pesky little creatures — the gubbins — that help or hurt the board. Like in <em>Scrabble</em>, you start with a bunch of letters (using them reveals more letters, until you run out) to lay out on your board to make words for points. You want to amass a lot of points by using your letters (and gubbins) creatively. Some of the modifiers will fill in letters automatically, for instance, or lock up parts of the board. It’s one of those games that’s easy to play but harder to master, making it a mobile game that I often come back to. Plus, the colors and music simply rule. —<em>NC</em></p>

This <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23702693/honkai-star-rail-funniest-joke-trash-can-meme">goofy sci-fi RPG</a> has turn-based combat that feels great on my phone’s small screen.

<p id="Ac0U8L"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> has charming characters and stunning graphics that look surprisingly great on my phone. It turns a lengthy bus ride into the perfect opportunity to catch up on an event or finally finish a quest I’ve been putting off. <em>—Ana Diaz</em></p>

<p id="VTiWjt"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Available on iOS via Apple Arcade</p>
<p id="Rdj9dl">Game Freak, best known for Pokémon, has a less iconic game that should be more well known: <em>Pocket Card Jockey</em>. It was released originally on Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2013 and came to English-speaking markets in 2016. But the game’s found new life on Apple Arcade with <em>Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On!</em> The premise is the same as the original, but with a 3D twist on the horse racing element. You see, <em>Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! </em>is both a horse racing role-playing game and collection game where races include fast-paced rounds of solitaire. It’s delightful — just look at these little horses. —<em>NC</em></p>

<p id="E5PGD3"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Available on Android and iOS</p>
<p id="OHgxR5"><em>Two Dots</em> is a classic that stands the test of time. Though it was released in 2014, <em>Two Dots</em> still gets updates and more levels, where you’re tasked with meeting objectives by connecting colored dots. There are a surprising number of different ways for these levels to play out, meaning a ton of challenges. But <em>Two Dots</em> also has a hidden object mode, too, to add in a bit more diversity in the gameplay. —<em>NC</em></p>

<p id="DU6Y1Q"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Available on Android and iOS via Netflix Games</p>
<p id="Q2eeTn"><em>Laya’s Horizon </em>fits a whole dang open-world exploration game onto your phone. The game was created by the developers of the viral hits <em>Alto’s Adventure</em> and <em>Alto’s Odyssey</em>, and sends players on a full 3D adventure where you explore by gliding through the sky. What really makes this an easy recommendation for me is that it pairs a simple but beautiful polygonal art style with a touch control scheme that actually makes it feel good to fly. Add the fact that this it’s just a nice, relaxing game to play and you’ve got the recipe for a refined mobile game. <em>—AD</em></p>

<p id="wxGB7i">Tower defense is a classic genre, but <em>Bad North: Jotunn Edition</em> gives it a roguelike, real-time strategy twist. That’s a lot of jargon to explain it, but the premise is simple: Viking invaders are attacking your island, and you’re the one tasked with leading the defenses against the invaders while evacuating everyone else. Each quick round takes place on a procedurally generated island, meaning that’s a ton of variation between rounds. The aesthetics of the game look quite simple, but beyond that facade is a deep strategy game. —<em>NC</em></p>

<p id="IMkhdU"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Available on iOS via Apple Arcade</p>
<p id="58fVF4">The general audience for <em>Sneaky Sasquatch </em>will likely skew young, but there’s a reason it’s such a widely beloved and highly rated game on iOS. You play as a sasquatch that rummages through trash and campsites to find food and useful items. The beginning of the game emphasizes stealth elements as you evade the eyes of fearful campers, but this game contains so much more. You can fish, play minigames, race cars, get a job, dress up, and even decorate your home. RAC7 still releases regular updates with new content, too. Before long, no one will be able to stop the sasquatch’s meteoric rise to become mayor of the town. <em>—AD</em></p>

<p id="23BWMz">You’ve heard of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a>, but maybe you haven’t realized that it’s still going strong, with regular updates and tons of Pokémon to catch. If you’re somehow not familiar, <em>Pokémon Go</em> is a mobile-only game developed by Niantic; you walk around your neighborhood — or farther! — to seek out and catch Pokémon. Beyond that basic premise, there’s also a battle system for holding on to gyms and battling your pals. If you’re someone with that “gotta catch ’em all mentality,” you won’t be able to put <em>Pokémon Go </em>down. —<em>NC</em></p>

<p id="1ej7e5">Another classic mobile game, <em>Jetpack Joyride</em> is what it says on the tin: It’s an endless runner where you’re jetpacking instead of running, dodging obstacles in increasingly difficult levels. It was first released in 2011 by Halfbrick Studios, but it’s still going strong with gameplay updates. <em>Jetpack Joyride</em> has a sequel, <em>Jetpack Joyride 2: Bullet Rush</em>, which is available on Apple Arcade, but the original is still worth keeping downloaded on your phone. —<em>NC </em></p>

Despite Radahn’s return, his fight at the end of the DLC is entirely different and he boasts an entirely new moveset that has made him a real pain in the ass for players to overcome. Of course, he’s no match for this chosen Tarnished though, who manages to deal with Radahn as if they were a pesky bug needing swatting.</p><p>Before entering the boss arena, the player clearly stacks up on spells that’ll help them accomplish the tremendous feat of not using healing flasks, blocks, or dodges throughout the fight. These elements are crucial to the game, let alone its numerous harrowing boss fights, so to manage without them shows an impressive understanding of the rest of the game’s mechanics and skills.<br></p><p>Among the skills used are two incantations, Blessing’s Boon and Golden Vow, which heal the player over time and boost their damage and defense, respectively.

The one used here is a very familiar mixture featuring the opaline and crimson bubbletears, which grant a one-hit invulnerability and the restoration of a significant chunk of health once you’re near death.</p><p>At that point, the player goes into the fight and simply demolishes Radahn. As one person put it in the Reddit comments, “I think this was Radahn’s boss fight against you, not the other way around.” Not only are they passively healed the entirety of the short fight, but anytime they do damage, they regain a good amount of health, too. The player’s almost consistently above the 50 percent mark of their own health bar the entirety of the encounter thanks to the use of the previously mentioned incantations, and at a few points in the fight they can even be seen swapping talismans to mitigate damage even further. I was awestruck watching someone exercise such command over the fight considering the fact that they’re often supposed to have the player on their backfoot, not the other way around.</p><p>At the very end, they also use the Endure skill—which increases your poise and absorbs a certain amount of damage—as well as a damage-reducing aromatic, to stand there and take Radahn’s ultimate meteor attack, and you can see the player’s health bar jump all over the place as their abilities work <em>overtime </em>to passively restore them. They make it with just enough health to land the killing blow and just like that, the DLC is done and dusted; the last boss reduced to an utter joke.</p><p>If recjawjind_fmfb can manage all of that by doing the utmost, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-steam-reviews-difficulty-1851561745&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-steam-reviews-difficulty-1851561745">rest of us lowly mortals</a></span> can probably squeeze by on the bare minimum, especially considering the DLC got <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-dlc-patch-realm-blessings-1851561110&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-dlc-patch-realm-blessings-1851561110">patched to become easier recently.</a></span> So if you’re thinking that <em>Elden Ring </em>or its DLC are too hard, here’s proof positive that you <em>can </em>reduce this game’s bosses to absolutely nothing with a bit of gumption, ingenuity, and a few skill points dropped into the faith stat.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve been waiting for your chance to play Delta Force: Hawk Ops, that time is finally coming soon. Developer Team Jade has announced that the Delta Force: Hawk Ops PC Alpha will start on July 18.</p>



<p>There was no end-date announced for the Alpha, signaling that it will be a “play it by ear” type of situation for Team Jade. In addition to the alpha date announcement, a new CG trailer was also released for the game.</p>



<p>“The Delta Force: Hawk Ops PC Alpha Test officially kicks off on July 18, 2024,” the description reads. “Get hyped with our new CG trailer, featuring G.T.I. operators utilizing their unique strengths to complete their mission successfully…”</p>



<p>As far as what’s going to be playable in the alpha, that wasn’t confirmed just yet. It’s unclear if it will be a look at the full game or just specific areas. That information, however, should be revealed over the next couple of weeks.</p>

                <p>Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect, a streamer with 4.7 million subscribers on YouTube, has had his channel demonetized by the platform. This is the latest fallout from the revelation that Dr Disrespect's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dr-disrespect-is-now-streaming-on-youtube-claims-h/1100-6479050/" data-ref-id="1100-6479050">2020 Twitch suspension</a> was due to inappropriate messages that he sent to a minor through Twitch's Whispers feature.</p><p>A YouTube spokesperson released the following statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youtube-suspends-monetization-on-dr-disrespects-channel-following-serious-allegations" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that confirmed the company's decision: "We have suspended Dr Disrespect’s channel from the YouTube Partner Program following serious allegations against the creator. This action means the channel is no longer able to monetize on YouTube."</p><p>Prior to this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dr-disrespect-addresses-misconduct-allegations-after-turtle-beach-ends-partnership/1100-6524501/" data-ref-id="1100-6524501">Turtle Beach ended its partnership</a> with Dr Disrespect, who was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dr-disrespects-twitch-ban-was-reportedly-due-to-messaging-a-minor/1100-6524455/" data-ref-id="1100-6524455">kicked out of Midnight Society</a>, a gaming studio that he co-founded in 2021. Despite initially denying the reports that he had done anything wrong, Dr Disrespect subsequently admitted to messaging a minor. However, the streamer stressed that he did nothing illegal.</p><p>"Were there Twitch Whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017? The answer is yes," Dr Disrespect wrote on <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805662681778765949" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. "Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not. These were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more. Nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed, I never even met the individual."</p><p>Although Dr Disrespect still has a very sizable number of subscribers on YouTube, his inability to use the platform to make money may force him to seek a new streaming home, if he can find one that's willing to take him on despite the ongoing controversy.</p>

How did we get here? Well, our country’s two-party system is so absolute that people looked at these two geriatrics who can barely string two sentences together and thought, “One of these two people should have the most powerful seat in the country’s government again.” Meanwhile, the average citizen looking for a third option that might actually fix anything in this collapsing country is left to stare around themselves, wondering what they’re supposed to do now.

We got memes and shitposts aplenty. We had guffaws and chortles galore. Most of the jokes focused specifically on Biden’s behavior, as the man is clearly too goddamn old for the position and was spacing out, speaking nonsense, and even Trump who has very few coherent thoughts to his name was able to call him on it. But we also got video game-related jokes specifically, and that means we get to write about it here at <em>Kotaku</em> period com, where we cover video games and the ways they intersect with culture, art, and politics. So join us in laughing as the ship sinks around us.</p><p>See friends, we just have to laugh through the pain of knowing that our nationwide political elections are based on an undemocratic electoral college system operating a binary, two-party system that allows no nuance and try not to fall into despair. Remember: The key to real change is being active in your local community instead of only caring about politics when these barely functioning old dudes are wheeled out every four years for a presidential election.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold ahead of it’s July release. To celebrate, developer A44 Games has released 20 minutes of new Flintlock gameplay for players to get a glimpse of what to expect when they start playing.</p>



<p>“This shows the gameplay and quests that take you through the majestic City of Sybil,” the description reads. “The current seat of Dukmar’s power, Sibyl was once one of the most powerful city-states in the world, the seat of learning and commerce alike. </p>



<p>“The dethroning of its king allowed for its borders to finally be opened to outsiders and its Library and Eternal Archive were considered among the greatest marvels of the world, until Dukmar and his legion shut the doors.”</p>

<p>Astro Bot is one of the more anticipated games coming to PlayStation 5 (PS5) later this year after being revealed during Sony’s PlayStation State of Play in May. Now, thanks to a post on social media, it appears we know exactly what size Astro Bot is and how much space you’ll need on your PS5 in order to install the game.</p>



<p>According to a post from Genki on Twitter, Astro Bot comes in at 66GB. For comparison sake, Astro’s Playroom took up just 11GB on the console.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Admittedly this 600% increase in size comes due to Astro Bot being a much larger game in nature than the previous title. Developer Asobi even called Astro Bot <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-biggest-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the studio’s “biggest game ever”.</a></p>



<p>“This is really about going up one notch — really several notches — and having Astro’s big story,” Nicolas Doucet of Asobi said in a recent interview. “We call it&nbsp;Astro Bot&nbsp;because we treat this as a new beginning. That’s a really, really big game. I think for us, that’s the biggest game we’ve ever made.”</p>



<p>According to Asobi, Astro Bot will feature 150 cameos from the history of PlayStation will be in the game. It’ll also feature six galaxies and 80 levels to explore.</p>



<p>Astro Bot launches exclusively on PS5 on September 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Zenless Zone Zero: The Final Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-the-final-preview.914445/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At this point, Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail have firmly created the expectation that when developer HoYoverse sets out to make a new game, it's going to be both like and completely unlike what it has done before. Fans of the studio's games will know how getting new characters and eventually building them will work (different names, same structure), but the action and tone vary quite significantly. This is once again true for Zenless Zone Zero, HoYoverse's next project that swaps out its larger sandboxes for stylish streets with even more stylish characters and flashy action combat.</p><p>I played Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ) for the first time briefly in its second closed beta test, and again for about four hours at a media event hosted by the studio. The long and short of it is that in my brief time with it, I feel that ZZZ is the most "mobile game" of HoYo's most recent releases. I don't mean that in a bad way; what I mean is that almost everything can be done in quick encounters – think 15 minutes or less. Whether you're diving into a story beat, a character quest, or just completing side activities, ZZZ seems to take a bite-sized experience approach to most things it offers. Not that some don't go longer (and I didn't have a chance to play everything, after all), but that seemed about the average.</p><p>What I like about that is that while I can see myself spending hours helping complete missions for folks around the city of New Eridu or taking on repeatable combat challenges on PS5 or PC, it'll be just as easy to sneak in a few activities on my phone in between other obligations. And based on how much fun I had during my playtime, I know I'll certainly want to when ZZZ is out soon on July 4.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>A Colorful Apocalypse</h2><p>In ZZZ, the apocalypse struck with the appearance of expanding, dangerous bubble realms known as Hollows. The space-warping zones are filled with dangerous creatures that can afflict humans with a deadly disease that may just kill them or, worse, transform them into monsters. Rather than relocate far away from these Hollows, the citizens of the city New Eridu have developed tools to explore them for treasures and resources.</p><p>While I can't speak to how interesting ZZZ's story is, as I was thrown into the game at a point where the chapters had already been completed (replaying the campaign missions was something I could seek out, but I opted to explore other challenges), I do already appreciate ZZZ's tone. It's incredibly goofy. For instance, while roaming around a construction site I found a Bangoo (small helper robots that fulfill all sorts of roles in New Eridu), Catloverboo, lovingly watching over a cat that was burying its business in a pile of sand. When I asked the Bangboo what the heck it was doing, it went on and on about how nice cat paws smell, and sharing in its enthusiasm got me a few resource rewards. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>ZZZ's lighthearted tone creates a welcoming atmosphere.</p></div><p>Delightfully, that goofiness persisted. From misunderstood affection causing multiple characters to be flustered by a robot-lover's advances at robots to cheeky text messages from other characters, ZZZ's lighthearted tone creates a welcoming atmosphere. It's as though the people of New Eridu's attitudes reflect the city's fun and vibrant design rather than the collapse of society at large. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>It's a Team Effort</h2><p>Zenless Zone Zero's playable characters are divided in an interesting way. The protagonist siblings Belle and Wise are "Proxies," individuals who have the technology and know-how to direct others in navigating the winding paths in Hollows. They don't go in physically themselves and instead guide Agents on their dives into the dangerous realms. One selected sibling is playable during city exploration while the Agents are playable in Hollows. The 15 currently playable Agents are split among various factions often associated with their jobs, from groups like a housekeeping company to a construction company. </p><p>Whether diving into combat from the campaign, a side quest, or by choosing to run through one of the many various combat challenge modes, three Agents and (depending on the situation, though it wasn't clear to me when they were or weren't allowed) a combat Bangoo make up a team. Like with other HoYoverse games, team composition is critical. Every character has a combat specialty type (like defense, stun, or attack, among others) and a damage affinity (like physical, fire, or ether), both of which need to be taken into consideration when building a team, especially for more difficult encounters like boss challenges. Pairing at least more than one member from the same faction on the team awards each of those characters an extra ability too. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/27/zzz-blogroll-1719527848016.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The members of Belobog Heavy Industries.</figcaption></figure></output><p>I like that the Bangboo, which acts independently of the playable team and attacks on their own, can fill in for a damage type if you don't have a particular character ready to take on that role or don't want to swap any one of your favorite characters out. I spent a lot of time using members of the Belobog Heavy Industries and lacked a character that could build up an ether debuff on enemies, so I trained up the one Bangboo in my arsenal that did use ether attacks to help out and it worked remarkably well. Though ZZZ isn't focused on elemental combinations like Genshin Impact, considering affinities and enemy weaknesses still matters.</p><p>The combat itself is a ton of fun, and I appreciate that certain encounters have a regular difficulty and a hard difficulty for players looking for extra challenge. Encounters take place in dungeon-like areas that seem to be procedurally generated and in most situations, you can't revive a character on a team once they've fallen. Engagements are flashy and fluid; players can hack-and-slash their way through, but those who take time to learn attack combos and make use of the dodge counters and the chain attack will see their efforts rewarded. Plus, it's fun to learn how to optimize a team's combat. </p><p>Switching characters at just the right time can lead to a special follow-up attack, and ZZZ helps players learn this by initiating a callout on the side of the screen. The aforementioned dodge counters award, as noted in the game, "a brief moment of invulnerability and deals high damage and interrupts the target." This too is signaled well with colored flash and specific noise before an enemy attacks, making what could be perceived as complex combat rather learnable for anyone getting into more intense action games for the first time. Getting the hang of these plus executing other combos makes the combat delightfully hypnotic. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/27/ellen-combat-1719528705474.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It's not only the basic mechanics that need to be learned; each character's playstyle was different too. For instance, The Belobog Heavy Industries crew has a great bear character, Ben, whose dodge is a pitiful scoot to the side and a shuffle forward for his sprint, so learning how to swap him in and out at the right time was essential for fights that required faster movement. I look forward to getting to see which characters pair best together, regardless of the group they're from.</p><h2>The Other Half of Exploring Hollows</h2><p>When I first played ZZZ I was most surprised by its Hollow Deep Dive System, the other part of combat exploration that doesn't really have all that much combat involved. Rather than navigating repeating combat paths, ZZZ pulls players back a layer into what could be considered an imagined top-down view of the Hollow represented through TVs on a board (as shown below). Here, additional combat encounters can be found along with navigation puzzles and rewards on hidden paths. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/27/hdd-tv-board-1719528557349.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>This view most clearly represents the Proxy's perspective of the Hollows. Paths unseen by the Agents on the ground, but easy to navigate for those beyond. This board system is intertwined with combat in the campaign. For players who don't favor it and just want to get into the action, though, there are specific "Combat" and "Exploration" divisions at the Hollow Deep Dive menu that separate missions based on the kind of experience players will have, with the Exploration selection filled with the Hollow TV board. </p><p>When I played a random puzzle mission listed in the Exploration section, I was disappointed with how easy it was. In fact, in one mission the memory puzzle was solved for me. I hope these were one-off instances and not representative of the Hollow Deep Dive exploration system as a whole. If there's no challenge to navigating these boards, then what's the point of having them? </p><p>Character dialogue is another issue in the Hollow Deep Dive exploration. Maybe it's not so bad on a mobile device or other small screen, but all dialogue boxes in this mode are relegated to the top right corner of the screen. On a regular PC screen, it was easy to miss when dialogue started and awkward to pay attention to longer conversation points. Given that these "exploration" boards are part of the campaign, it makes me worried that I'll miss out on lore or good conversations between characters. Overall, though, I think the board system could add an interesting mix to ZZZ's gameplay, but I do hope it poses more of a challenge.</p><h2>Walking the Streets of New Eridu</h2><p>Exploring New Eridu is limited. ZZZ isn't an open-world game and it doesn't pretend to be. Instead, players can explore multiple streets connected by an in-game menu. Once at the chosen destination, running through the entirety of a street and its side paths doesn’t take long at all, though I found quite a number of people to talk to and various activities to do. Many of the NPC shop owners have stellar designs and I was delighted to see that playable characters can be freely found around the city for conversations and side quests. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/27/zzz-drive-tuning-demo-1719529091528.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>An important exploration aspect of ZZZ is its in-game clock. Days are split into four segments; morning, afternoon, night, and late night. As the time of day changes so do the city streets, making certain individuals unavailable at a time of day. As far as I could tell, the most meaningful changes at a particular time of day on a specific street are shown in an easy-to-access clock menu, so I wasn't at risk of missing anything too critical. According to the in-game handbook, things like completing story and side mission tasks and resting advance time rather than your real clock. I'm curious to see how this mechanic plays out in the long term, but in my playtime, it only mattered to me when scheduling a meetup with an NPC for a side quest and for opening the video shop.</p><p>There are plenty of other activities other than digging into combat, like running the protagonists' video shop. This is more of a quick optional task to kick up at the beginning of each day where you're asked to stock three tapes based on customer genre preferences. The better your choices, the better the revenue. More videotapes are acquired through exploring, side missions, and running the shop. Once a promoter is selected to run the shop for the day (new promoters can be hired too), you let them do the work, though you can also interact with customers throughout the day while the shop is open. This is just one of the few fun side activities I found that enrich the time of being in New Eridu.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/27/sixth-street-1719528749065.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Other activities included things like minigames in the arcade (anyone up for competitive Snake?) and helping the street-based Officer Mewmew with his list of side missions for residents of the street. There are also functional activities like grabbing a daily coffee (in-game daily, not actual daily) from the cute coffee shop for buffs and a refill on rechargeable energy used for specific combat encounters to earn materials for character upgrades. While New Eridu might not be sprawling now, it's easy to see how HoYoverse can expand the city with new streets, shops, activities, and characters in the future. </p><p><em>Miranda Sanchez is the executive editor of guides at IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-review.914439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Starting a fresh chapter in a long-running video game series must be a daunting endeavor for a developer. How do you follow up 20 years of worldbuilding and deeply intertwined stories with a new setting and cast? It’s a tough question that The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak answers confidently, kicking off an exciting new arc that both newcomers and veterans can equally enjoy after 2023’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-into-reverie-review">The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie</a> brought the series’ previous saga to a satisfying conclusion. With an updated combat system that fuses turn-based battles with some new real-time elements, an engaging story, and a charming cast of characters, Trails through Daybreak shines as yet another great RPG in a year packed full of them.</p><p>Daybreak follows a mercenary named Van Akride who finds himself on a grand adventure that’s noticeably darker in tone than previous Trails arcs. He takes on the dirty jobs local law enforcement aren’t able to handle, and sometimes even work from underground organizations – things like negotiating deals with shady middlemen or hunting bounties. That’s a welcome change from the series’ past protagonists, who have tended to be a bit unrealistically altruistic. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The story itself effortlessly weaves topical themes into your actions, with shadowy figures taking advantage of anti-immigrant sentiment to gain power and the meteoric rise of a new mafia group threatening the status quo of the underground world. These themes aren’t entirely apparent early on in Van’s journey, but he eventually starts to realize just how much influence the different factions of this world have, making Daybreak feel more like an engrossing political drama the deeper you go.</p><p>This is a great jumping in point for the Trails series, free from the shackles of having to directly connect to  previous games, but Daybreak does also treat longtime fans like myself by incorporating lore from them when it suits the story. For example, it takes place in the Republic of Calvard, a place referenced in previous Trails games but never actually shown. Similarly, when Van fights against the local mafia early on, they take performance enhancing drugs to get an edge on him, and he deduces that they may be similar to the ones that the local gangs in Crossbell took, referencing both Trails from Zero and Trails to Azure. It’s a fantastic way to keep this universe interconnected while creating a blank slate to work with for new stories.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The smaller cast means each character gets more room to grow.</p></div><p>The lovable, tight-knit cast of main characters helps set the stage, too. Some standouts include a young girl named Feri Al-Fayed, who Van takes in after she is exiled from her village, slowly growing to accept her teammates as her second family throughout the story. A personal favorite of mine is the fun Grimcat, who is clearly an homage to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-royal-review">Persona 5</a>’s Ann, wearing a skintight suit and cat mask. (Grimcat even calls herself a “phantom thief.”) Her strong willed personality amusingly contrasts with her role as the comic relief – she’s a terrible liar and often slips up when trying to talk her way out of a situation, which is not something you’d expect out of a supposedly slick trickster. </p><p>It’s also great that Daybreak’s comparatively smaller cast means each character’s development is much more focused. They’re able to get more attention throughout the story and have room to grow, which is something the Cold Steel arc in particular had trouble handling as its storyline progressed and its cast ballooned. Veterans will catch a few character cameos from the previous Cold Steel, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/04/04/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky-review">Sky</a>, and Crossbell arcs in supporting roles as well, but they’re smartly placed so as not to steal the spotlight or alienate newcomers. </p><p>When you’re not tied up in the political intrigue of the main story, you’ll be completing various side quests that can earn you points towards Van’s Law, Gray, or Chaos stats. These are framed as a sort of morality system, but they operate more similarly to the way Persona handles its social stats. Certain side quests give out predetermined values for these stats, and you can see which will increase before accepting them – however, they’re all worth accepting and completing anyway, as having a high level in one alignment doesn’t lock out the benefits from the others. This approach offers a greater degree of freedom since you won’t feel like you’re being railroaded into one single morality path. </p><p>It also adds an extra layer of depth to Van’s personality and influences how he handles certain encounters outside of his default cool, bad-boy demeanor. Some quests let you decide how they end, providing extra points to a certain alignment based on your choice. For example, one quest has you chasing down a cashier who is stealing money from his job, but it turns out he was being extorted by someone else: You have the option to encourage the cashier to return the money and come clean as the Law approach, or take the Gray route and return the money but keep it a secret. Because I didn’t feel pressured into following a strict path like with the morality systems of some other games, I loved that I could pick the decision that I would most likely do if I was in Van’s shoes. (If the money is back where it belongs and the business is still running, no one is hurt and ever has to know, right?)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Daybreak’s quests also provide great worldbuilding.</p></div><p>Daybreak’s quests also provide great worldbuilding. One particularly fun one has Van’s party travel to a secluded island to clear its monsters so tourists can safely explore. In an amusing twist, a tour guide appears and gives the party a guided expedition while they’re busy fighting. They’ll periodically stop at certain points to describe local legends, but while the party keeps hoping to learn fun facts, each of the tour guide’s stories instead involves something horrifying, such as people getting devoured by monsters when a high tide occurs or a certain cavern being named “Death’s Head” because it was littered with human remains. The length and effort that these side quests go to in order to make them genuinely entertaining is one of the best aspects of the series.</p><p>Later on, depending on how high Van’s morality is in certain alignments, you can choose to team up with certain factions. While picking any given faction doesn’t change the overall story, Van’s decision can make battles easier for that specific chapter. Some factions have stronger playable characters that can make the enemy encounters and bosses a cakewalk while you have access to them. On the flip side, the faction I picked had two purely AI-controlled characters, so sometimes it was frustrating not being able to give them direct commands when I needed to. Choosing certain factions over others also leads to unique character interactions, which adds some fun replayability for future playthroughs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One of the biggest gameplay changes in Daybreak is its battle system, which is now a hybrid between real-time and turn-based combat. On the field, you can run up to enemies and start hitting them, but you can also initiate turn-based combat at the press of a button any time. By breaking their shields first, you’ll start the turn-based portion in an advantageous state, with enemies dazed and unable to act for a short time. Unfortunately, these real-time elements are very rudimentary; normal hits and charged attacks that stun enemies are all you can do besides dodging. It gets incredibly repetitive over a 50-plus-hour RPG, and I wish more options were introduced throughout the campaign to keep the real-time moments from stagnating.</p><p>However, the turn-based combat picks up the slack thanks to some noticeable improvements over its predecessors. Loading screens are gone outside of boss battles, so fights in Daybreak transition seamlessly from the field to battle. It’s so much smoother now that the party isn’t magically whisked away to a separate dimension just for battles; the battlefield is the same exact size as the room Van was in when he encountered an enemy. </p><p>This battle system also sees the return of the series’ timeline mechanic, which is relatively unchanged but just as great as ever. Bonuses land in random spots in the action timeline, so if you see that a critical hit bonus is going to land on the enemy’s turn, you can cleverly manipulate the order by using an attack with the Delay effect, pushing the enemy’s position and hopefully having the icon land on one of your allies instead. This makes for some incredibly engaging battles since it’s important to take advantage of these bonuses whenever you can, especially during boss fights and other high difficulty moments.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Free movement opens up a whole new aspect of tactical gameplay.</p></div><p>Another welcome change is that characters are no longer required to use up their turn to simply move around the battlefield, and can instead roam freely within a certain movement range. While moving your party into advantageous positions before attacking isn’t exactly a new RPG concept, this tweak opens up a whole new aspect of tactical gameplay when combined with Trails' already excellent combat mechanics.</p><p>For example, Van’s Stun Slash has the Impede effect, which can disrupt enemies in the middle of casting spells, but it also does more damage when Van hits an enemy from their flank rather than the front or back. That gives it a dual purpose, letting you choose whether to increase your damage by prioritizing positioning with your new movement options, or utility by focusing on manipulating the order of the timeline. It helps some attacks stay useful even when their primary effects don’t apply in certain situations, which wasn’t always the case in previous Trails games since moving around counted as its own action. </p><p>Daybreak’s customization system offers plenty of flexibility in how you build out each character’s stats and abilities with different gems. What’s great about the customization is that it can be as straightforward or as complex as you want it to be. Every gem has an element associated with certain stats and abilities, which can then be placed in any of the four customization lines of each character: Weapon, Shield, Drive, and EX. For example, red gems are associated with the fire element and have traits that benefit physical attackers, as well as give them fire-based attributes when placed in certain lines.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Best Game Order to Play the Trails Series</h3><p>This is the best order to play the Trails games in to best understand the events taking place in the Zemuria saga.</p></div><p>It’s all fine and dandy if you simply want to slot in the red Attack +1 gem in any available slot as the character will get the attack stat boost no matter what. If you want to take it a step further, however, you need to be strategic in where you place your gems. Daybreak introduces Shard Skills, which act like passive buffs influenced by the different line options. Placing a red gem in the Weapon line has a chance of adding fire elemental damage to normal attacks, while putting them in the Shield line boosts your chances of avoiding the Burn status. Knowing how to utilize these passive buffs can be the difference between winning and losing, especially during late-game boss battles and when playing on higher difficulties</p><p>The way gems and Shard Skills synergize also makes customization fun. Activating more powerful Shard Skills requires meticulous gem placement. Burst Gain, for example, has a chance of recovering HP when attacking, but requires both a red gem and water-based blue gem in the Weapon line to unlock. I could happily lose track of time optimizing each character and trying different combinations.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Some minigames from past entries are conspicuously gone.</p></div><p>Bonding events called Connections make a return in Daybreak, letting your protagonist casually hang out with other characters during their free time, which is always a lot of fun – especially for returning fans. In one standout scene, Van catches up with Rene, his friend inside Calvard’s intelligence division, and ends up discussing a double agent of theirs who also happens to be working for a key political figure from the Cold Steel and Crossbell games. So not only are these bonding moments entertaining and well-written, the Trails series is able to use its extensive history to incorporate past events for even more impressive worldbuilding, which is something that games with similar features can’t go nearly as in-depth on. </p><p>Other features from past entries are conspicuously gone, though. Minigames in previous Trails RPGs that were entertaining distractions, such as the card games Vantage Masters and Blade, aren’t in Daybreak at all, and there’s nothing new to fill the void they’ve left when I’m between missions and looking for a change of pace. Cooking has also been drastically limited, with each party member now only able to cook a few select dishes rather than having their strengths and weaknesses within the full menu. For example, if someone was strong in the curry recipe, they had a chance to create an enhanced version that restored more HP than usual, while a weaker curry cook could potentially screw up and give you a dish that could be detrimental. That variety added personality to characters outside of battle, so it’s a little disappointing that each character only cooks their specialized recipes without fail here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Fishing is missing, too, which is surprising given it had previously been included in every single mainline Trails game – though that’s not to say that Daybreak is lacking in content. There’s an enormous amount of stuff to do and see between all of the side quests and the morality system, but the absence of these traditional Trails minigame staples does make Daybreak just a little bit less charming.</p><p>And while it can’t make up for everything, Daybreak’s soundtrack is <em>excellent</em>. It incorporates the rocking guitars and melodic piano that the series is known for, and while both the opening theme and the song that plays as the credits roll sound a bit more laid back compared to past games, that’s a fitting reflection of Van’s personality. As always, the battle themes are explosive and designed to get you in the mood to fight, and the lively tunes in the metro areas make exploration fun.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s sequel--known as Project Orion--is currently in development at CD Projekt Red's new Boston-based studio, and the developer is hoping the new locale will give the sequel a more authentically American flair.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think Cyberpunk is obviously a uniquely American story," acting executive producer Dan Hernberg explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBpEDCZMvo">a recent episode of the AnsweRED podcast</a>. "It's got a lot of like, punk energy, and [the tabletop game] was written by an American, so it just seems right to do it in America."</p><p dir="ltr">The first game--along with its highly praised DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/">Phantom Liberty</a>--was developed at CD Projekt Red's studio in Wrocław, Poland. This apparently led to some unforeseen complications when it came to creating Night City, which is canonically located in California and is essentially a futuristic version of Los Angeles. One example of the game's setting getting lost in translation is an issue referred to internally as "the manhole debacle."</p><p dir="ltr">"There was this post [on Reddit] with the guy saying that there is this immersion-breaking bug in Cyberpunk, and the bug was about the fact that the covers for manholes for a sewer were the manholes that you use normally in Europe, in Germany, for a pavement," associate game director Paweł Sasko said on the podcast. "Those are not manholes that you normally cover in America on the streets."</p><p dir="ltr">"When you go to America, there's things like [fire] hydrants, where they are placed and how they look like," Sasko continued. "The street lights, the positions of that, the trash bins, right? They're in the front of the house, right by the street. In Poland, in Europe, you don't see it almost anywhere. There's so much nuance. Dan, when we talk about it, he calls it 'the Americana.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Hernberg then added, "Our curbs are different, our color is different on all of our signs. Everything's just slightly different. It doesn't break immersion, but it's just that little thing where you're like, 'Well, maybe this wasn't made by people who live here or people who fully understand all of American culture.' I also think that [the studio] being in America, it allows us to have those cultural touchpoints with the larger American, you know, kind of influence with Hollywood. Obviously, Cyberpunk 2077 took place in LA, and so there's just kind of all these cultural touchpoints and things that we can kind of interact with, whether that's from music or story or just different parts of America that are interesting to explore."</p><p dir="ltr">But Project Orion isn't entirely made in America--CD Projekt Red's Vancouver studio is also pitching in on the sequel, and Hernberg says the Canadian studio is currently working on some "really cool stuff" for the upcoming game.</p><p>The game is currently in the early stages of development, so there's no telling when players can expect to get their hands on the sequel, but the good news is they won't have to wait for the next entry in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/">The Witcher</a> series to release first, as the new Boston studio was created specifically to allow CD Projekt Red to work on both Project Orion and the next Witcher game simultaneously. CD Projekt Red has also stated that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-aims-to-increase-the-cadence-of-game-launches/" rel="nofollow">it's working to increase the pace of its game launches</a>, so hopefully, players won't have to wait too long to return to Night City.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-june-28th</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-week-in-gaming-business-change-is-everywhere.914409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-june-28th<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a week of change in the gaming industry. Unfortunately, we've seen yet more layoffs and studio closures this week, but this week has also yielded a major acquisition, a newly-unionized studio, and some contract alterations from big companies.</p>
<p>Here's what's been happening on the business side of the gaming industry this week!</p>
<h2>More layoffs and closures</h2>
<p>It wouldn't be a gaming business roundup without layoffs and closures, or so it seems. This year's layoff total has, after all, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-saunas-and-shutdowns">already beaten last year's</a>, and there are still six months of the year to go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/second-wave-challengers-gaming-business.jpg?itok=Fav98LJN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/second-wave-challengers-gaming-business.jpg?itok=epjsg1Rm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Challengers, we hardly knew ye.</figcaption></figure><p>This week sadly saw Korean studio Challengers <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/second-wave-developer-folds-after-missing-wage-payments-and-amassing-1-7m-in-debt#close-modal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">closing</a>&nbsp;after building up $1.7 million in debt. CEO Koji Tamura said the studio hadn't managed to attract enough publisher or player interest for its projects to continue.</p>
<p>On the layoffs side, GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-of-mass-layoffs-at-gameloft-toronto" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported this week</a> that Gameloft had laid off "the majority" of its Toronto studio, a report that Gameloft itself later confirmed to the publication.</p>
<p>Chinese news platform The Paper, meanwhile, reported (according to machine translation) that&nbsp;<em>Tower of Fantasy&nbsp;</em>developer Perfect World has supposedly been <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_27838848" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hit by large-scale layoffs</a> across multiple departments. Those layoffs remain unconfirmed at time of writing.</p>
<h2>Cygames' parent company buys&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>dev Nitroplus</h2>
<p>Nitroplus, the studio known for the likes of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fate/Zero</em>, was <a href="https://x.com/nitroplus_staff/status/1805851928569544964" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bought this week</a> by Cygames parent company CyberAgent.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steinsgate-nitroplus-gaming-business.jpg?itok=fhagyoPu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steinsgate-nitroplus-gaming-business.jpg?itok=ZrysPhRI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Original&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>co-developer Nitroplus has been bought up by Cygames' parent company.</figcaption></figure><p>According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nitroplus-to-be-acquired-by-cygames-parent-and-resume-work-on-games-abandoned-due-to-lack-of-resources/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">additional reporting by Automaton Media</a>, a PR <a href="https://www.cyberagent.co.jp/way/list/detail/id=30416" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interview</a> accompanying the announcement of the purchase reveals that CyberAgent will be helping Nitroplus to "pursue projects it had abandoned due to a lack of resources".</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what those projects might be, but if you're a fan of Nitroplus' visual novels, it's a happy day for you.</p>
<h2>People Can Fly and Square Enix reach new&nbsp;<em>Project Gemini&nbsp;</em>agreement</h2>
<p>Square Enix and People Can Fly reached a new agreement this week regarding the ongoing development of upcoming title&nbsp;<em>Project Gemini&nbsp;</em>(almost certainly not its final name).</p>
<p>The project ran into trouble earlier this year when around 30 employees were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outriders-developer-people-can-fly-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs">apparently laid off from the project</a>, with a further 20 being moved from&nbsp;<em>Gemini&nbsp;</em>to other People Can Fly projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/people-can-fly-bulletstorm.jpg?itok=3GOd27Z1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/people-can-fly-bulletstorm.jpg?itok=g2tIYDRe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bulletstorm</em>&nbsp;dev People Can Fly has worked out a new approach for&nbsp;<em>Project Gemini&nbsp;</em>with Square Enix.</figcaption></figure><p>The new contract appears to stipulate a more stripped-back development model for&nbsp;<em>Gemini</em>; it states that "future revenues" obtained by People Can Fly for&nbsp;<em>Gemini&nbsp;</em>will "only cover the direct costs" incurred for development.</p>
<h2>Another ZeniMax studio unionizes</h2>
<p>The unstoppable march of gaming unionization (hopefully) continues, as another ZeniMax studio revealed its intention to unionize earlier this week.</p>
<p>Bethesda's Montreal branch <a href="https://x.com/OneBGS_MTL/status/1806001296593346639" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced a few days ago</a>&nbsp;that it has filed for certification with Quebec's Labor Board "with the intention of unionizing" and joining with the wider Communications Workers of America union.</p>
<p>The studio says its union is intended to make Bethesda "a supportive workplace that fosters creativity and talent" and that its "seat at the table" will ensure job security for employees, as well as promoting transparency, accountability, and flexibility.</p>
<h2>SAG-AFTRA announces new indie contract tier</h2>
<p>Media union SAG-AFTRA announced this week that it will introduce a new tier for its Independent Interactive Media Agreement, with a new budget range now being included in the agreement.</p>
<p>As reported <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-announces-fourth-tier-to-new-indie-dev-contract" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, projects with budgets between $15 million and $30 million will now benefit from SAG-AFTRA's union protection, as well as "provisions against AI" and access to unionized performers.</p>

<h2>CD Projekt is a big contributor to the Polish economy</h2>
<p>We end on a story that demonstrates just how important gaming can be to national economies, and that's been illustrated this week by none other than&nbsp;<em>The Witcher&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>studio CD Projekt.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1806341488114073695" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) earlier this week</a>, CD Projekt revealed that it was solely responsible for an impressive 1.75% of Polish exports to the US last year.</p>
