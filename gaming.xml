            <p>
As part of its latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/presentations/?presentationtype=webcasts">financial earnings report</a>, developer CD Projekt has shared progress updates on its numerous Witcher and Cyberpunk projects, as well as confirmed a partnership with Saudi-back mobile developer (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">new Pokémon Go owner</a>) Scopely to create a game.
</p>
<p>
As far as the Scopely project goes, there's not much to report at present. CD Projekt merely confirmed it had "entered into a strategic partnership with Scopely to develop a game set within one of CD Projekt's IPs." And while it seems reasonable to assume that's pointing toward some sort of mobile game set in either The Witcher or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> universes, we won't know for sure until more is revealed.
</p>
<p>
Away from Scopely, CD Projekt also spent some time offering progress updates on the various titles it's previously confirmed to be in development. Work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> continues apace, for instance, but CD Projekt's other Witcher games have seen some adjustments. Witcher spin-off Project Sirius - which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-sounds-like-its-being-rebooted-from-scratch">rebooted several years back</a> - remains in pre-production, and CD Projekt says it's now merged developer The Molasses Flood with the CD Projekt Red team to "ensure even better alignment in the scope and direction of the project".

<p>
Additionally, CD Projekt's Witcher 1 remake, which was announced back in October 2022 as part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">studio's ambitious development roadmap</a>, is still in the concept phase. Furthermore, the studio says that due to "production process dependencies" related to assets and technology, it has decided to "temporarily integrate its development with ongoing work on The Witcher 4". As a result, a "small portion" of developer Fool's Theory is currently supporting the Witcher 4 team, with the aim being to "have the necessary assets, tools, and pipelines ready for more efficient development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-remake">The Witcher Remake</a>."
</p>
<p>
Moving on from The Witcher, CD Projekt's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiplayer-being-considered-for-cyperpunk-2077-sequel-says-cd-projekt">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> - currently known as Project Orion - is said to be nearing the end of its concept phase and will be entering pre-production "in the coming weeks". Additionally, development of the studio's new IP, known only as Project Hadar at present, continues. "The vision of Hadar has progressed over the last year, becoming more detailed," CD Projekt explained. "Internal assumptions and ideas have been forged into main pillars that guide us forward [and] the team's focus is on further developing the IP and the game's story, while prototyping some gameplay solutions specific to Hadar."
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt also reiterated it has a number of other undisclosed projects in the works, including another from Fool's Theory, and once again drew attention to its still-mysterious new Netflix Cyberpunk 2077 animation, which is currently "under development".
</p>
<p>
The Witcher 4 did, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">see its long-awaited reveal at the end of last year</a>, with CD Projekt finally confirming Ciri would be the focus this time around - although Geralt of Rivia (once again voiced by Doug Cockle) will also return in some capacity.

Here's our staff's list of the 25 best games on the Xbox Series X|S – meaning they were either released directly for this generation of Xbox consoles <em>or</em> have been updated to take advantage of their improved resolution, frame rate, and other features. Note that to avoid the scourge of recency bias, we’ve cut off new additions as of the end of September 2024, since anything more recent than that is still a bit too new to rank. But don't worry, they’ll be considered for future rankings!</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is NOT an attempt at an “objective” ranking.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But what do we mean by “best?” To be very clear, this is not an attempt at an “objective” ranking that will indisputably line up with the tastes of gamers of all types. That, sadly, can never exist; when one person’s epic RPG masterpiece is another’s boring and impenetrable slog, they’ll never see eye to eye on where that game should rank against others of different genres. Even the personal lists of two people who love the same types of games will rarely line up exactly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, this is a list of games that IGN’s crew of Xbox gamers recommend as a group, with major re-ranks using our Face-Off tool so that everybody got to weigh in equally on which games they thought should be placed above others. It’s presented in the spirit of recognizing games we love, and encouraging others to try them if you haven’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With only 25 slots to fill, there are tons of amazing recent games that didn’t float to the top – but that doesn’t mean we don’t think they’re awesome, too! Everybody who participated in voting has a long list of personal favorites that didn’t gain quite enough traction with the group to make the cut, which is inevitable when there are this many games and so many different perspectives. We encourage you to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist">make your own Playlist</a> of your favorite Xbox Series X|S games and share it in the comments below!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Most recent game updates were made on March 25, 2025.</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>More on the best of Xbox:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-xbox-series-x-and-xbox-series-s"><u>Where to buy an Xbox Series X</u></a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-one-games-2"><u>Best Xbox One Games</u></a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-25-xbox-360-games-4"><u>Best Xbox 360 Games</u></a></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>25. Resident Evil 2</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Resident Evil Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the remade version of Resident Evil 4 is the IGN staff’s favorite in the series, Resident Evil 2 isn’t far behind. It's absolutely gorgeous to look at and contains some of the legendary zombie-slaying series' best moments to date. This modernization brings all the best parts of classic Resident Evil games to newcomers, letting us experience the original’s characters, enemies, and locations with features like ammo crafting, an over-the-shoulder camera, and expandable inventory slots. For series veterans, it feeds off your familiarity with the iconic RPD and subverts expectations in unique and horrifying ways, plus Easter eggs are sprinkled throughout the Racoon City Police Station. The tension created by Mr. X chasing you is palpable, creating some of the series’s best unscripted scares. His presence alone keeps additional playthroughs from getting repetitive and maintaining the horror. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>24. Hitman: World of Assassination</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing as it collects all of the deviously designed scenarios from Io Interactive’s recent Hitman trilogy under one banner, Hitman: World of Assassination is too good to pass up. With all of the rich, rewarding, and highly replayable sandboxes at your fingertips, there’s virtually no end to the cold-blooded and often hilarious trouble you can cause as Agent 47. Tracking down a multitude of surprising and imaginative assassination opportunities requires examining every nook and cranny, carefully observing every NPC’s behavior, and making full use of every piece of gear and weapon – and getting away with a perfect hit with no one even knowing you were there is one of gaming’s biggest and most satisfying thrills.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>23. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Delivering an unexpected but extremely welcome sequel to Relic Entertainment's 2011 Warhammer 40K Space Marine, Saber picked up the chainsaw sord and ran with it, smashing through waves of Tyrannid enemies in a highly satisfying way. Its slow but steady third-person action has clear roots in the classic Gears of War games, but this is no cheap knock-off: it makes those ideas its own by facing you and your co-op squad off against enormous hordes of enemies and encasing everything in Warhammer 40K's distincitive look and feel (which itself influenced just about every power-armored space marine design from the past several decades).</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>22. Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screens  -  Wolfenstein: The New Colossus </h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">BJ Blazkowitz’s 2017 alternate-history Nazi curb-stomp romp was updated to run in its full glory on Xbox Series X, and it absolutely holds up. Between the giddy joy of blasting away with a machine gun in one hand and a shotgun in the other, some fantastic locations across fascist-occupied America, and an absolutely diabolical villain to go up against – General Engle has some pretty jaw-droppingly sadistic moments – this is an absolutely non-stop shooter the likes of which we haven’t seen in recent years. It doesn’t seem like the kind of game that could have a heart under it all, but the story also does a great job of establishing its supporting cast, and even humanizing even a killing machine like BJ.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>21. Unicorn Overlord</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The first thing that will stand out with starting Unicorn Overlord is the striking 2.5D art style, with characters appearing to almost float through through storybook backgrounds. While it almost deserves to make this top 25 list on looks alone (shout-out to the best looking food in gaming), it is paired with an excellent squad-based combat system that blends traditional turn-based strategy gameplay and RTS mechanics as you explore a tabletop-inspired overworld, gather resources, and discover secrets to rebuild the war-torn nation. The tactics come in as you decide how to move your squads across some of the best and most creative maps in strategy games and work out what type of squads to create and deploy. There’s a huge amount of build variety available, with 40+ classes and 70 characters to choose from to form your specialized squads. These diverse characters come from a variety of backgrounds and races, from the more mundane humans and elves to werelions, giants, and angels, and that’s the basis for the strongest moments in the story. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>20. Marvel’s Midnight Suns</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title"> Every Character in Marvel Midnight Suns</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">XCOM developer Firaxis’s take on Marvel superhero combat is challenging and refreshing thanks to its deckbuilding approach to turn-based brawls. Crafting a set of cards that allows heroes to work as a team by combining their signature moves and taking down supernatural-infused enemies keeps things fresh, evolving, and unpredictable over the course of an epic-length campaign. It looks great, too, and bashing enemies into things for increased damage is endlessly entertaining. If you’re into the Persona-style relationship-building conversations there’s a lot there for you to uncover as you chat with Iron Man, Captain America, Spider-Man, and many more favorites between battles – if not, you can skip most of that and jump back into the action.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>19. Doom Eternal</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Is Doom Eternal better than 2016’s Doom? That debate will rage on for eternity, but for this list it doesn’t matter because Doom (tragically) was never updated for the Series X/S. That makes Eternal the champion of this generation by sweet, sweet default. The current standard-bearer for the revitalized first-person space-demon-mulcher series is fast, punchy, gloriously gorey, and easily one of the best single-player shooters in years. Loaded with excellent weapons, abilities, secrets, and enemies, this is a game that continually teaches you how to play faster, smarter, and more efficiently, with lots of options at every step of the way to tailor fights to your preferred slaying style, and it’s an absolute blast along the way.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>18. Resident Evil 4</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Simultaneously one of the newest games on this list and also the oldest, the 2023 remake of 2005’s Resident Evil 4 took everything that made the original a standout action-horror classic and modernized it to thrill present-day gamers just as much as it had those who always saw it through rose-tinted glasses. Rebuilt from the ground up, it builds tension with high-intensity combat against a ferocious cast of creatures and brings the Resident Evil world to life with rich detail as the story rapidly guides you through a series of unwaveringly impressive action sequences. There’ve been many games that have attempted to evoke RE4’s style over the years, but none that nailed it quite as well as this.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>17. Persona 3 Reload</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A stellar visual overhaul and countless small changes and additions beyond it leave a significant impact, making Persona 3 Reload a more fully realized version of a beloved RPG. Although still dated in some respects next to Persona 5, quality of life improvements and new features refresh its exciting turn-based combat and add depth to its touching story moments. Through an incredible new voice cast that embodies these unforgettable characters and an endearing soundtrack to reforge its identity, Persona 3 Reload tells a powerful, timeless story of tragedy and hope with sharp emotional sincerity over the course of its meaty 70-hour campaign. This is the kind of remake we always hope for.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>16. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems like every other game that comes out these days has at least a bit of Metroidvania design in it, so it’s rare for one to stand out in such a crowded genre. And yet Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown absolutely nails everything you could want in a side-scrolling platformer that has you piling on abilities to reach new areas on a truly massive map. It has all the standard moves and features (double jump, dash, equip-able amulets), plus lots of fun innovative ones – like the ability to teleport across the room to avoid death during the tough-but-fair boss fights. It introduces those moves at a satisfyingly steady pace, so by the time you reach the late-game bosses and teeth-clenching environmental challenges you’re basically an expert, navigating obstacles like a virtuoso playing an instrument and making it all look easy.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>15. Devil May Cry 5</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with all of its imitators, there’s still nothing quite like a Devil May Cry game, and Devil May Cry 5 stands tall not only as not only one of the best in its own series but one of the best character action games ever created – full stop. No other game offers the same level of creativity and expression through its combat, whether you’re playing as Nero and bouncing foes around in the air with your Gerbera Devil Breaker, slashing them while precisely timing revs of your sword to charge up your Exceed meter; or chilling out as V while your summoned familiars fight all around you; or hot-swapping between an entire arsenal of weapons and fighting styles as Dante. The depth of DMC5’s combat is near bottomless and endlessly fun to play around in, with finely tuned difficulty options to meet you wherever your skill level is at.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>14. Assassin's Creed Odyssey</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the three (soon to be four) Xbox Series X-generation Assassin’s Creed games, Assassins’ Creed Odyssey stands head and shoulders above the rest. This epic takes Origins’ combat style and focus on roleplaying, adds some extra ingredients to the mix, then sets it all against the sprawling backdrop of Ancient Greece – a world aflame with the war between Athens and Sparta. It’s an enormous, vibrant game, with some of the most stunning vistas we’ve seen in the series both at land and sea (yes, naval warfare is in the mix, and it’s wonderful).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its distinctive spin on Assassin’s Creed’s notoriety system sees you hunted across these environments, in a series of cat-and-mouse chases that set a new standard for the series, while the nation struggle system sees you fighting large-scale battles in the name of your chosen faction. It’s also got a relatively compelling story for a game that can take 60-odd hours to beat, with some eccentric sidequests that’re fronted by a genuinely charismatic protagonist (whether you play as the male or female version). Even after you finish Odyssey’s main story, there’s still so much to plunder and discover, and it’s a delight to simply exist in its meticulously recreated historical world.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>13. Forza Horizon 5</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Forza Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-review"><u>Forza Horizon 5</u></a> isn't just the<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2021"><u> best game of 2021</u></a> (as IGN's 2021 Game of the Year winner), it's also the best car game, period, of at least the last decade. The difference between Horizon 5 and other racing games (not named Forza Horizon) is that it is, in fact, a driving game. And yes, there's a difference between a driving game and a racing game. Driving can include racing – and FH5 most certainly does – but perhaps the greatest of its many triumphs is successfully tapping into someone's love for cars. You don't need to be a gearhead with a nose for adjusting tire temperatures and maximizing downforce, as you do in simulation racers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, there's quite literally fun around every corner, whether it's trying to best your buddy's photo radar speed, busting through one of the countless billboards scattered around Horizon's gorgeous fictionalized Mexico, entering proper Horizon Festival events, or just doing goofy multiplayer events. Forza Horizon 5 is as chill and casual or as serious and hardcore as you want it to be, and that's a near-impossible feat for any car game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>12. Alan Wake 2</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It took Remedy 13 years to get the sequel of its cult-favorite thriller<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-review"> <u>Alan Wake</u></a> off the ground, but it was worth it. Billed as Remedy’s first true survival horror game, the studio best known for its high-concept, cinematic approach to games takes a similarly filmic view to the new genre by creating a terrifying chapter in Alan Wake’s — and new protagonist Saga Anderson’s — stories. Fans of horror will find a tense, scary experience, but those of you waiting to learn what happened to Wake all those years ago will want to check out Remedy’s sequel immediately.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>11. Remnant 2</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">“Dark Souls with Guns” was the theme of the first Remnant, and Remnant 2 doubled down on that idea with more guns, classes, and more enemies to blast to pieces, all while also delivering extremely challenging and rewarding bosses and a major twist to its design. Remnant 2 is different each playthrough thanks to the way it randomizes most puzzles, bosses, and events each time you replay it. And you will probably want to replay Remnant 2 a lot, because sometimes you will need to defeat bosses in multiple ways to get its most enticing rewards. The fact that two players can finish the campaign and fight different bosses along the way (or maybe they see the same bosses but get different rewards) makes it almost as much fun to talk about as it is to play. Since launch, it’s added two sizable DLC packs with more storylines, weapons, classes, gear, and crazier bosses. Remnant 2 is one of those games that always has us coming back for more thanks to its high replayability, creative design, fun gameplay, and ability to easily play with friends. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>10. Halo: The Master Chief Collection</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review"><u>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</u></a> now collects six Halo games all under one digital roof – everything except<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/halo-5-guardians-review"><u> Halo 5: Guardians</u></a>. It's been torn down to the studs and rebuilt in grand fashion, and even better, it's been upgraded AGAIN for Xbox Series X with support for 120fps gameplay.

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Respawn’s sequel to the hit Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order continues the journey of Cal Kestis as he makes his way through the galaxy and fights the Empire.<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review"> <u>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</u></a> improves on almost every element of the first, refining the level design and combat to its sharpest point yet.

See our list of the<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-games"> <u>best Star Wars games</u></a> to see where it ranks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>8. Hades</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hades is the current gold standard of the roguelite genre, and it isn’t even close. From its exhilarating combat, to its incredible soundtrack, to its clever and well written narrative with characters that seemingly never run out of meaningful things to say, all the way to its deep and innovative post game that keeps you wanting to come back for more even after beating the last boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be incredibly difficult, but it never feels punishing in defeat. Dying is part of the fun, and actually comes with its own rewards in the form of new conversations with its fascinating cast of characters, new opportunities to purchase game changing upgrades, and an opportunity for a brand new run with a completely new set of godly boons that dramatically alter how you approach combat. Hades is a masterclass of roguelite design, and just another example of how Supergiant Games just doesn’t miss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hades 2 Early Access is available now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>7. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Complete Edition</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher 3 Sex and Romance</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the greatest RPGs of all time is better than ever thanks to the graphics overhaul from<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review"> <u>The Witcher 3</u></a> Complete Edition. While fans of 4K graphics can now play the game in higher fidelity, the performance mode might be the way to go as it smoothes over all the rough frame-rate patches in this massive game, making this 100+ hour adventure as smooth as butter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>6. Cyberpunk 2077</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-review"><u>Cyberpunk 2077</u></a> stumbled out of the gate at launch on consoles specifically. While the RPG has always been a state-of-the-art marvel on PC, it took CD Projekt Red a few years to optimize the game for consoles like the Xbox Series X|S. After cutting out the last-gen systems and a series of free updates, Cyberpunk 2077 and the newly released expansion,<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review"> <u>Phantom Liberty</u></a>, finally shine bright on Xbox. With best-in-class presentation, a deep and rewarding RPG system, and one of the best stories CD Projekt ever created, now is finally the time to hack into Cyberpunk 2077.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. Grand Theft Auto 5/GTA Online</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every GTA Game Ranked</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto 5’s sprawling yet meticulously detailed map is still the high bar to which most open-world games aspire. Not only is it huge, it’s incredibly dense with excellent content – not just the driving and shooting and three-protagonist story that make up its campaign, and not limited to the numerous side activities, but all the sights, sounds, and bustling activity you'd expect to find in a city teeming with humans – seedy underbelly included. With so much to do, explore, and play with, both as a single-player game and Grand Theft Auto Online, it’s truly amazing on multiple levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what’s next, Rockstar has officially confirmed GTA 6 will be released in 2025. It will feature a return to Vice City and star the series' first female playable character in a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-inspired adventure. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Describing Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth sounds a bit like a fever dream: it's a collection of minigames stuffed inside of larger activities inspired by classics like Crazy Taxi, Pokémon Snap, Pokémon, and Animal Crossing… and all of that is wrapped up inside of a life simulator, which is itself inside of a 50-hour turn-based RPG. Miraculously, this somehow all works together and balances honoring the roots of the Like a Dragon/Yakuza series while continuing to propel it forward. This can be seen in almost every aspect, most obviously that a huge portion of the story takes place outside Japan, and instead has you exploring Hawaii. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, turn-based combat makes a return from Yakuza 7, boasting even more jobs (tennis ace OP!) and a ton of small refinements that vastly increase the amount of control and customization in combat while remaining true to Yakuza's traditional beat em' up style. In a series known for heartfelt stories, Infinite Wealth’s is arguably the most emotional, paying homage to the franchise’s classic characters with a plot driven by the values and actions of the new cast. Mixing the old and new characters is something that often backfires in a long-running series, but RGG Studios expertly blends Kiryu's and Ichiban's stories, pulling off one of the best legacy stories anywhere.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Persona 5 Royal </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 5 Royal would have very little true competition in the contest for the title of best Japanese RPG of all time. Its endlessly stylish art and unforgettable, jazzy soundtrack create a vibe it's hard not to fall in love with. And that's before we even get to the cast of iconic, endearing characters and an unexpectedly deep, thought-provoking story that only grows more relevant with every year since it was originally released in 2016. Nobody does this style of turn-based, small-party combat better than Atlus, and P5R is the ultimate refinement of everything great about the franchise's earlier adventures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that could be said of the original 2016 version, too, but with Royal, just about everything – from the dialogue to the story to dungeon exploration – has been made bigger and better. It's far from just a remaster with some neat extras; it's almost like getting another entire game on top of an already fantastic one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. Baldur's Gate 3</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review"><u>Baldur’s Gate 3</u></a> is easily the best computer RPG of any generation thanks to its robust storytelling and nearly limitless player freedom. Whether that’s romancing a Mind Flayer or convincing a squirrel to go into battle, the ability to play through the world of Baldur’s Gate on your own terms is the reason why Larian Studios' latest RPG has captivated so many players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cast of characters, in particular, shines in this party-based RPG. Your companions in this game are some of the most fun, fully-realized characters in any RPG and although Baldur’s Gate 3 is already hundreds of hours long, you’ll want to re-roll new characters to try and mine as much as you can from this deeply rich fantasy world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Winner of multiple<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2023-winners-the-full-list"> <u>Game of the Year awards</u></a>, Larian Studios has single-handedly revitalized the computer RPG genre and showcased that ingenuity and smart game design can triumph over the mightiest graphics.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Elden Ring</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're a longtime fan of FromSoftware's notoriously challenging games or intrigued by the constant buzz, Elden Ring is a fantastic starting point for seeing what the soulsborne genre is all about. Its streamlined introduction, versatility in accommodating your choice of playstyle, and open-world design all work to alleviate the “brick wall” dilemma of getting stuck on a difficult boss in Dark Souls games. It's that elasticity that makes this FromSoftware adventure a (slightly) friendlier one, while still being full of godlike bosses looking to snuff out your life, threateningly large maps, and intriguing NPCs rife with charm, mystery, and tragedy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s since been kicked up a notch thanks to the outstanding Shadow of the Erdtree DLC expansion, which serves as a condensed version of the main game that’s absolutely jam-packed with secrets, valuable treasures, ultra-challenging boss battles, and horrific monstrosities to face of against at every turn. When you stack that on top of the main game, it’s an incredible quantity of high-quality tests of your soulslike mettle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Upcoming Xbox Series X|S Games in 2025</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">April 2025:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>The Renovator: Origins</strong> - April 4</li><li><strong>South of Midnight</strong> - April 8 </li><li><strong>Commandos: Origins</strong> - April 9</li><li><strong>Descenders Next</strong> - April 9</li><li><strong>Monster Energy Supercross 25</strong> - April 10</li><li><strong>Promise Mascot Agency</strong> - April 10</li><li><strong>Big Buck Hunter: Ultimate Trophy</strong> - April 11</li><li><strong>Lost Records: Bloom and Rage Tape 2</strong> - April 15</li><li><strong>Lushfoil Photography Sim</strong> - April 15</li><li><strong>Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</strong> - April 17</li><li><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> - April 24</li><li><strong>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</strong> - April 24</li><li><strong>Sunseed Island</strong> - April 24</li><li><strong>Yasha: Legends of the Demon Blade</strong> - April 24</li><li><strong>MotoGP 25</strong> - April 30</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">May 2025: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Metal Eden</strong> - May 6</li><li><strong>Doom: The Dark Ages</strong> - May 15</li><li><strong>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</strong> - May 16</li><li><strong>Fantasy Life i: the Girl Who Steals Time</strong> - May 21</li><li><strong>Onimusa 2: Samurai's Destiny</strong> - May 23</li><li><strong>To a T</strong> - May 28</li><li><strong>Elden Ring: Nightreign</strong> - May 30</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What New Games are Available on Xbox Game Pass in March 2025?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 18, 33 Immortals (Game Preview) launched on Game Pass.

            <p>
Fancy a bit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> in your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>? Oh, well that's convenient, as the game's Nightmare and Visions update just dropped today, adding in Mortis Trials, a new wave-based game mode. The wave-based nature really is what it says on the tin: scores of enemies come after you round after round, but in this mode you'll get Indulgences, which is just lorespeak for upgrades you can unlock on different runs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You'll also start with an archetype that lets you deal elemental damage like electricity or fire, while doing more damage to electrified or burning enemies. Another archetype simply lets you switch or reload weapons faster, and you get a second small buff for the second wave (there's a total of 12 to get through, which doesn't sound easy, but I suppose that's the point). There are also objective waves that take place on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th waves, but you'll have to play to find out what those are like.

Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fatsharkgames">Fatshark</a> released the <a href="https://www.playdarktide.com/news/nightmares-visions-patch-notes">full patch notes</a> for the new update earlier today too, and if you want me to list out every single change, you can jog on, because it's massive. There are a few changes I'll highlight though, just to help you out a bit. For one, Havoc is receiving campaigns, with plans to release new ones with "different mutators and a rotating mission pool" alongside major updates.
</p>
<p>
There's some quality of life changes too, like DLSS 4 support now being a feature in the game, and there's been a bunch of weapon balance tweaks too - possibly worth having a closer look at if your weapon of choice has been affected.
</p>
<p>
It's also worth noting that Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/">half off on Steam right now too</a>. Quite convenient with this new update, 'ey?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-teases-venom-twerking-emote-as-in-game-event-reward/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hold onto something solid, because the next Marvel Rivals patch might give players what they want: Venom twerking. Get ready for a surge in Venom’s pick rates, as players look like they’ll finally have the chance to throw it back as the symbiote.</p>



<h2 id="h-this-better-not-be-an-april-fool-s-day-joke">This Better Not Be an April Fool’s Day Joke</h2>



<p>Between April 1st and April 4th, Marvel Rivals players that complete the board in the Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure event will be able to claim a special reward. This “special April Fool’s Easter Egg gift” will unlock a “hidden twist surprise,” but the icon on the board on the game’s website has hinted at what the surprise is. Instead of a question mark, which currently appears in-game in that spot of the event page, the official game site shows an outline of what very much looks like Venom throwing it back.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While the outline technically only shows a large, muscular frame with a prominent set of glutes, many players are zeroing in on it being Venom. The “Venom twerk” emote has been a running gag amongst Marvel Rivals players, with many fans online requesting it. Many didn’t think Netease would actually implement it, but some are still skeptical, believing this to just be an April Fool’s Day prank. Still it would be cruel to promise such a cosmetic and not deliver. In order to be eligible to receive the reward, whatever it is, you’ll have to collect all rewards from Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure board.</p>



<p>Cosmetics overall <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launching-perfect-couples-costumes-on-valentines-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been the major focal point behind Marvel Rivals’ live-service business model</a>, especially the hero costumes. While not all of this is directly attributed to Marvel Rivals, Netease said in February that it saw <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/marvel-rivals-40-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.9 billion revenue</a> during the previous financial quarter, up 1.5%. An estimate from Chinese outlet Gamelook from January said that the game alone had brought in around $136 million.</p>



<p>If the Venom twerking emote is real, will you be picking it up? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

The entire staff at the time of the shutdown will return, and, after the contents of its website were <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completely taken offline</a>, the Game Informer site is back online too.&nbsp;</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoVfBvxKdm0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a>, executive editor Kyle Hilliard says that the returning staff includes “production, design, video, editorial–everybody.” The team has also regained access to Game Informer’s social media and video accounts, and the website currently hosts new articles written during the site’s hiatus, as well as older pieces. Staff say the magazine will be coming back in both print and digital. Game Informer will have “memberships and subscriptions,” with more information forthcoming.&nbsp;</p><p>Game Informer was purchased by <a href="https://gunzillagames.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gunzilla Games</a>, though staff say it operates as a separate entity. In a <a href="https://gunzillagames.com/en/news/63-Gunzilla-Games-Acquires-Game-Informer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, Gunzilla writes that "Game Informer remains completely editorially independent," with CEO Vlad Korolov saying,“We are proud to welcome the talented voices behind Game Informer in the Gunzilla Games family, and join their fight to preserve the heart of video game journalism in what has been a tumultuous time for the industry."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Game Informer Is Back And The Entire Team Has Returned" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eoVfBvxKdm0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p> “Editorial independence has been foundational for Game Informer ever since it was started back in the 90s, and it will continue to be a sacred element of our operation going forward,” says executive editor Brian Shea in the video.&nbsp;</p><p>Editor-in-chief Matt Miller says that “all of Game Informer’s editorial content is 100% selected by our editorial team without any outside influence, including from the new owners.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-co-founder-opens-new-studios-with-loads-of-ex-blizzard-folks">Back in 2020</a>, co-founder and former CEO of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/blizzard">Blizzard</a> Mike Morhaime formed Dreamhaven, essentially Blizzard 2, albeit a bit more explicit in the fact that it has different studios working under it. One of said studios, Secret Door, is currently working on co-op strategy game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sunderfolk">Sunderfolk</a>, and today as part of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uwjr0raU7k&amp;ab_channel=thegameawards">showcase</a> presented by The Game Awards, the other studio Moonshot Games revealed its first title: Wildgate, a sci-fi shooter that sees you piloting ships around space looking for loot as you face off against other players.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The way it works is that in each match, you and crews of other players are after an artifact, each of you with your own ship you use to get to your destination. Sometimes you'll have to use said ship to fight against other players, though while the reveal trailer offered a look at space combat, it wasn't too detailed. It looks like all the ships have shields and turrets to shoot at each other with, and you can even disembark your own ship to go and board an enemies' one. Looks pretty neat honestly! Not sure how I feel about it being match based, but hey, can't win 'em all.

<p>
Your crew is made up of prospectors, like that one guy voiced by Kelsey Grammer in Toy Story 2, all of which have different abilities and tools, typical hero shooter kind of thing. It looks like there's a few different gun options, and even tools to put out fires on your ship. 
</p>
<p>
Again, it doesn't look like there's necessarily anything massively unique on the shooting front, there's only so many different ways you can do a shooter, but it looks fun enough, and I like the character designs. One prospector looks like some kind of axolotl thing in a fishbowl with robot limbs? That'll probably be my main day one.
</p>

Wildgate doesn't currently have a release date other than sometime this year, i.e. 2025, but you can <a href="https://playtest.playwildgate.com/signup/communitypreview/account">sign-up to playtest it</a> if the trailer piques your interest.

And keep in mind, that’s just the earliest possible release window.<em> The Witcher 4</em> could slip into 2028 as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-cyberpunk-2077-cdpr-crunch-open-world-rpg-1848688469&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-cyberpunk-2077-cdpr-crunch-open-world-rpg-1848688469">CD Projekt tries to avoid crunch and overworking its developers</a></span>.</p><p>If <em>The Witcher 4</em> is not arriving until 2027 or later, that means it’s very likely that it will launch on a new generation of consoles.<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Windows Central</em> previously reported</a></span> that Microsoft was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-handheld-pc-gaming-next-gen-series-x-microsoft-1851768903?_gl=1*qcquck*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjkzNDM1OC4zMy4xLjE3NDI5MzQ1MjIuMzYuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-handheld-pc-gaming-next-gen-series-x-microsoft-1851768903?_gl=1*qcquck*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjkzNDM1OC4zMy4xLjE3NDI5MzQ1MjIuMzYuMC4w">tentatively planning to launch its next-gen Xbox in 2027</a></span>. And considering that in the past, both Xbox and PlayStation have released their new consoles in the same time period, it stands to reason that Sony is likely eyeing 2027 for the PS6 as well. So<em> The Witcher 4</em> could be an early RPG success on the PS6, though I’d expect that it would be a cross-gen game, too. </p><p>For now though, we all have a lot of waiting to do before we can play either a PS6 or <em>The Witcher 4.</em> Perhaps read a book or learn a new hobby to pass the time.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We had both the tabletop and digital versions and would regularly play together. There was something so intriguing about playing through an imaginary "Game of Life" and all of the challenges that came with it. Now that I'm an adult living <em>through</em> the game that is life, I find myself less entranced by the concept.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is probably why this collaboration with Jurassic Park exists in the first place. The Game of Life Jurassic Park Edition is less about living your best life and more about holding onto it. The overall theme of this board game is really quite interesting, and with the price reduced under $20 for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-spring-deal-days">Amazon's Spring Deal Days Sale</a>, it's definitely worth considering adding to your collection.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Game of Life Jurassic Park Edition Is On Sale Today</h2><div catalogid="292a2064-5743-4d4c-816f-7c9fa568207e" id="217105"><div id="217105" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Game of Life Jurassic Park Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Amazon discount, the Jurassic Park edition of this game actually drops below the price of the original. At just under $20, it's a great price for an officially licensed board game. While this isn't the lowest price we've ever seen on this board game, it is the lowest price we've seen in 2025 so far. If you have $20 burning a hole in your pocket and are looking for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">fun family game</a> to play, this is a great option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The general theme of this game is very different from the original Game of Life. The goal is to hop into your all-terrain vehicle and race your way around the island collecting dinosaur eggs and park rangers before the hurricane hits. Instead of normal life obstacles, you'll be faced with hungry dinosaurs scattered across the board. The first one to make it all the way around the island and escape wins, and the rest are left to get eaten.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the original Hasbro board game, the Jurassic Park version is meant to be played with 2-4 players. It also has a suggested age rating of 8+, likely because of the whole getting eaten by dinosaurs aspect of the game.

          <p>Nvidia has seen its fortunes soar in recent years as its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">AI-accelerating GPUs</a> have become worth their weight in gold. Most people use their Nvidia GPUs for games, but why not both? Nvidia has a new AI you can run at the same time, having just<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-assist-ai-companion-for-rtx-ai-pcs/">&nbsp;released</a> its experimental G-Assist AI. It runs locally on your GPU to help you optimize your PC and get the most out of your games. It can do some neat things, but Nvidia isn't kidding when it says this tool is experimental.</p>
<p>G-Assist is available in the Nvidia desktop app, and it consists of a floating overlay window. After invoking the overlay, you can either type or speak to G-Assist to check system stats or make tweaks to your settings. You can ask basic questions like, "How does DLSS Frame Generation work?" but it also has control over some system-level settings.</p>
<p>By calling up G-Assist, you can get a rundown of how your system is running, including custom data charts created on the fly by G-Assist. You can also ask the AI to tweak your machine, for example, optimizing the settings for a particular game or toggling on or off a setting. G-Assist can even overclock your GPU if you so choose, complete with a graph of expected performance gains.</p>

      Nvidia on G-Assist.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Nvidia demoed G-Assist last year with some impressive features tied to the active game. That version of G-Assist could see what you were doing and offer suggestions about how to reach your next objective. The game integration is sadly quite limited in the public version, supporting just a few games, like <em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>.</p>
<p>There is, however, support for a number of third-party plug-ins that give G-Assist control over Logitech G, Corsair, MSI, and Nanoleaf peripherals. So, for instance, G-Assist could talk to your MSI motherboard to control your thermal profile or ping Logitech G to change your LED settings.</p>

A new report has highlighted the "havoc" <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>'s lack of a release date is causing among game publishers, as they attempt to draw up launch plans for their titles that won't put them on a collision course with Rockstar's all-consuming sequel - with one executive reportedly saying, "We don't want to be anywhere near that."
</p>
<p>
Following comments made by EA's Andrew Wilson earlier this year suggesting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">the publisher would be willing to shift the new Battlefield's release in order to avoid GTA 6</a>, journalist Christopher Dring spoke to a number of industry executives to understand how Rockstar's game was impacting their own decision-making behind the scenes - with the responses he received reflecting those previously expressed by Wilson.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games">newly launched The Game Business podcast</a>, Dring shared a quote from the boss of "one of the biggest games publishers in the world", who didn't want to go on record. "Rockstar games always suck a lot of money and, more importantly, time out of the market," the executive told Dring. "We don't want to be anywhere near that. We're working up multiple different plans for our title."

<p>
Another senior executive from a different publisher shared similar sentiments, telling Dring, "Even without GTA, it's immensely difficult to find free time for new games to shine. Time is the real scarcity for us, not money. It's tough out there."
</p>
<p>
A third senior executive - the European boss of an unnamed triple-A publisher - highlighted additional concerns, specifically around the "fall" launch window previously touted for GTA 6's launch by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>. "We don't want to launch just before or just after the game," the executive explained. "If it arrives in late October, that means you either have to launch early - which a lot of people seem to be doing with the recent glut of summer release dates. Or go later, putting you up against the Black Friday sales."
</p>
<p>
"If we move out of 2025," the executive continued. "what if Rockstar do too? Will we have to push our game up or will we have to delay further? It's proven to be very stressful."
</p>
<p>
Dring said these kind of considerations are currently "causing a bit of havoc" across the games industry, and it's not just a problem for publishers looking to launch new releases; GTA 6's arrival is likely to impact the fortunes of live service games too. One "top 10 live service games" developer told Dring, "GTA 6 is basically a huge meteor and we will stay clear of the blast zone. We will nudge our updates back or forward three weeks to avoid it. Of course, the problem is everyone is going to do the same. So three to four weeks before or after GTA 6, you're going to get a load of live service games dropping content in what they believe will be the safe zone."
</p>
<p>
"It's obviously going to get a little bit messy," Dring observed. But as he also highlighted, history suggests publisher have good reason to be concerned. Looking back to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s launch in September 2013, Dring explained, 50 percent of the month's game revenue was for Rockstar's title - despite it only releasing half-way through September. As for GTA 5's launch week in the UK, Rockstar's game reportedly accounted for 89 percent of all games sold and 94 percent of all video game revenue - and the the title is also said to have accounted for two thirds of all games sold in the UK during the three-week "blast zone" following its release.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two has been doggedly sticking to the same non-specific <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">"fall" launch window for Grand Theft Auto 6</a> since announcing it last May - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">despite persistent reports of a potential delay</a>. But as noted by Game File's Stephen Totilo during The Game Business podcast, there seems to be one relatively safe spot on the 2025 calendar right now: it's unlikely GTA 6 will release on or during the weeks surrounding 23rd September - given that's the launch date <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-gets-new-trailer-and-a-release-date">Take-Two reserved for Borderlands 4</a> earlier this year.

Furthermore, Gunzilla also rehired the entire team of folks working at Game Informer prior to its closure. Miller stated that because of this rehiring, the team is confident that they can maintain an "unbroken identity of who we are and what we represent."</p><p>Gunzilla, which is currently working on upcoming battle royale game Off the Grid, reportedly assured Game Informer staff that the company will operate independently of the studio, with "100 percent of the decisions around what we cover and how we do so" coming from the site's editorial team. According to Miller, Gunzilla Games sees "the same potential in Game Informer as our team does, and their encouragement to do so ethically and free of outside pressure is laudable."</p><p>In addition to Game Informer's website--which already includes many years of back content in addition to new posts and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/24/every-review-from-game-informers-hiatus" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reviews</a> of games that released while the site was shuttered--the outlet has confirmed that its print magazine is returning as well. Miller said the company's intent is to "bring back the magazine bigger and better than it was before, and add a host of membership and subscription benefits, including an expanded scope to our videos, streaming, and feature coverage, while also broadening the range of experts and partnerships we tap to bring you those perspectives." Miller ended the blog post by stating that additional information regarding membership and subscription options is coming, and encouraged those interested to create a new Game Informer account to stay up to date on details.</p><p>Prior to its closure last August, Game Informer was one of the longest-running video game outlets in North America, having launched in 1991. The company was shut down by former parent company GameStop (the video game store, not us!) in a decision that reportedly surprised its entire staff, as they were currently "70% done" with the outlet's next issue.</p>

We've seen a huge amount of workers, both creative, administrative, and technical, suffer massive layoffs and restructurings. Even the teams behind hugely successive games—like the Seattle-based team responsible for part of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-lays-off-marvel-rivals-seattle-developers">Marvel Rivals</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-lays-off-marvel-rivals-seattle-developers">—</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">have been laid off.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's part of the reason why Retora Games founder and adjunct professor Tyler Coleman has been creating unique class exercises and role play scenarios to help his students think about what sort of problems they might run into after they graduate.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The best lessons come from failure, so how do we teach that in a hands-on way to our classes?" Coleman said, posing a question to an audience at his Game Developers Conference talk. "By not teaching them [these things] we are not preparing our students for the worst."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coleman has run some of his classes through one of four different experiments, each spanning a the majority of the school term, to prepare students for handling the tough environment of the gig economy, negotiating with unreasonable publishers and clients, dealing with the variety of hardships studios often experience, and handling the emotional toll of being laid off.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Forcing failure with care">Forcing failure with care</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/achieving-creative-sobriety-in-game-design" target="_self" data-discover="true">Achieving 'creative sobriety' in game design</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One point Coleman emphasized before diving into each hands on exercise is that he was looking for feedback and ways to improve. These experiments had "mixed results," according to him and he was wary of negatively impacting his students and the way they viewed their own work.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Forcing people to fail should be treated with care," he said. "As you do run a risk of creating real trauma if not planned carefully."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experiment that stood out most was Coleman's Rapid Prototyping class, which had a group of students produce multiple small games in various groups throughout the school term. The program ended with the entire class working together on one project, with separate groups of students within the class representing different teams within a AAA studio.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The whole thing was doomed from the start," Coleman said. "They were using a 5 year old version of Unity they hadn't worked with before. The teacher (me) was intentionally bad with communicating design and intent. We had regular unexpected changes in the design bible."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coleman had meant for his teams to fail and he—posing as a senior figure in this fictitious studio —was the main antagonist for this experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the end of the program, Coleman held a meeting with all the teams and told them that they were being let go. All the work they produced was owned by the fake company that employed them. He posed a question to his students, what would you do if you couldn't use any of the work from this past term? In reality the work was owned by the students, but he challenged them with a scary possibility that may very well hit them one day.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Pros and cons">Pros and cons</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Several elements of the experiment went well, according to Coleman. Some of his students felt the emotional toll of losing their jobs. While stressful, it helped them understand that situations like that are often completely out of their control. There was nothing they could have done differently to prevent the layoffs. Many students reacted poorly to the news, but Coleman believed it was good for them to experience it in this type of situation rather than in the real world where they'd have to pay rent and other bills.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It also led them to update their resumes and LinkedIn profiles," he said, emphasizing that he wasn't pro-layoff in any way. "It helped them understand that the best thing you can do is connect to everyone else and build a network."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other elements didn't go as well. Several students thought they had failed the class, which made them panic. The bombshell of the layoff also happened at the very end of the quarter, which completely killed any excitement the class had heading into the end of the term. Luckily the class didn't fail, they received "severance A," according to Coleman. He plans to clearly communicate that the students could not fail this experiment going forward.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-civilization-vii-s-powerful-narrative-system-helps-players-experience-unique-parts-of-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Civilization VII's powerful narrative system helps players experience unique parts of history</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experiments that Coleman ran were unorthodox, but quite relevant in an industry that's repeatedly shown that its workers can be let go at a moments notice to help improve quarter over quarter fiscal showings.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coleman detailed a few things that he'd like to do differently going forward, including making some sort of time for actual lecturing as several of his experiments involved his students roleplaying. Those sessions could take hours and often ended up leaving no time for him to talk to his students directly at length about what they were doing, how they felt about it, and what he hoped they would learn.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game design professor also plans to possibly change the schedule of when he plans to "lay off" his students, making sure that it's midway through the term so that he can leave time for retrospectives and feedback and simulate what comes after a layoff—which is usually other opportunities and work.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
