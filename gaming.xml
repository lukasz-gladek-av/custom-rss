The device is called Alarmo, and it “responds to your movements,” which means you can snooze it with a gesture, or stop it by actually getting out of bed. It costs $99.99 and will be available in early 2025, though Nintendo says Switch Online subscribers can <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311%2F">purchase it early right now</a>.</p><p>It appears this is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251736/nintendo-mmwave-device-24ghz-fcc-filing">the mystery Nintendo gadget</a> that hit the FCC last month, which revealed that the device features a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi radio and a 24GHz mmWave sensor.&nbsp;In addition to the motion features, a big part of the device appears to be its immersive sounds, which are pulled from five different Switch games: <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Pikmin 4</em>, <em>Splatoon 3</em>, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>. There are 35 audio “scenes” in total, though you can also connect the alarm to your Nintendo account for more pulled from <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizon</em>s and <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, which will be free updates coming later.</p><p>There are some sleep tracking features as well. Here’s how Nintendo describes them:</p><div><blockquote><p>You can also check Records to see how much you move around in your sleep, set an hourly chime themed to your chosen title, and change between Steady or Gentle Modes for your morning alarm. In Steady Mode, the alarm will gradually get more intense the longer you stay in bed, whereas Gentle Mode offers a more consistent intensity level. There’s also Button Mode for a more traditional, tactile “hit the snooze button” alarm clock experience. You can even use sleepy sounds to wind down with soothing music and sounds at your set bedtime.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>The announcement comes at a time when Nintendo seems to be focused on everything <em>but</em> its next console.

And if they hear you, they come for you. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/19/17253262/a-quiet-place-sound-design-eric-aadahl-ethan-van-der-ryan-interview">Just like in the movie</a>!</p><p>The microphone part is optional, though I’d definitely turn it on myself. While Saber says giving the game access to your microphone could mean that the game’s monsters can “detect every sound you make in real life,” it appears from the trailer that even your controller vibrating or your dryer running could put you in danger. </p><p><em>A Quiet Place </em>is far from the only game to use a microphone as part of play — heck, it’s not even <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.g2a.com%2Fnews%2Ffeatures%2Fhorror-games-that-use-your-mic%2F">the first horror game</a>.

Tempering recipes can drop from enemies, just like other loot types. Use them (right click, if you are using mouse and keyboard) in your inventory to add them to your Blacksmith ‘Tempering’ menu, then you’ll be able to select from new bonus pools the next time you Temper an item.<br></p><hr><p>With this new system, you’ll be able to tailor random drops far better to suit your specific build, and to improve any dodgy stats they may come with. No more sighing and selling!<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bethesda-bioware-naughty-dog-near-studios-hawthorn<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of ex-BioWare, Bethesda, and Naughty Dog veterans have banded together to create a new US-based studio called Near Studios, and it's already hard at work on its first project.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bethesda-bioware-and-naughty-dog-alumni-form-near-studios" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Near Studios is currently working on a project by the name of&nbsp;<em>Hawthorn</em>, which will, according to early players of the game cited by the studio itself, combine "an intimate&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>&nbsp;</em>sandbox" with "a&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>&nbsp;</em>village simulation".</p>
<p>Near Studios will be headed up by CEO Heather Cerlan, whose previous experience includes work with the likes of Wizards of the Coast, Naughty Dog, and EA, as well as Amy Hennig's Skydance New Media.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hawthorn-near-studios-chopping.jpg?itok=Wlw75Rtv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hawthorn-near-studios-chopping.jpg?itok=OF_jobfa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Near Studios is comprised of industry veterans, and it's already working on a cozy sandbox game.</figcaption></figure><p>Other staffers at Near include ex-Funcom and BioWare staffer Jason Richardson, who'll serve as&nbsp;<em>Hawthorn</em>'s game director, as well as Bruce Nesmith, the lead designer on&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>.</p>
<p>Richardson says that&nbsp;<em>Hawthorn&nbsp;</em>revolves around "a living village of NPCs and your co-op friends", and that the goal with the game is to "evoke the nostalgic joy and wonder of shared adventures".</p>
<p><em>Hawthorn&nbsp;</em>will take place in a location called Windermere Valley, and you'll play as a tiny little woodland creature looking to build a life for yourself in this idyllic rural pasture. To do so, you'll recruit villagers, explore the world around you, and build up your village by harvesting crops, fishing, and farming.</p>

<p>Near Studios promises the ability to solve conflicts without resorting to violence, as well as "random events that make each player's sandbox story unique", an "enchanting yet believable world", and "memorable NPCs" with their own personalities and backstories.</p>
<p>If you're (quite reasonably) morally opposed to AI art, you may want to note that&nbsp;<em>Hawthorn&nbsp;</em>will use AI-generated art "significantly edited by humans" for its "placeholder 2D art and iconography" during its pre-alpha development stage.</p>
<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Hawthorn&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3078150/Hawthorn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> if you want to keep up with its progress. It doesn't have a release date or window as yet, so we'll likely hear more in the coming months.</p>

But following its launch last month, things haven’t gone to plan.</p><p>Sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new intellectual property in years and its first mainline single-player game since Microsoft bought parent company ZeniMax Media in March 2021. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review"><u>Starfield review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist.”</p><p>A year later, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield-shattered-space">Shattered Space</a> has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam, as Starfield players complain about everything from a lack of value to boring quest design.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Now, Emil Pagliarulo, studio design director at Bethesda Game Studios, has responded to one fan’s concern about not just Starfield and Shattered Space, but the direction Bethesda is headed. This concern was prompted by a <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/players-can-explore-like-they-used-to-in-fallout-and-skyrim-how-shattered-space-brings-the-bespoke-goodness-of-past-bethesda-rpgs-to-starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar interview</a> with Pagliarulo who enthusiastically bigged up the expansion. This, the fan said, suggested Bethesda was dismissive of community concern around Starfield.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/Dezinuh/status/1843657966702207366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a series of tweets</a>, Pagliarulo responded directly to this suggestion and more generally to the ongoing discourse around Starfield and Bethesda. “My optimism is in no way meant to be mud in the eye of any dissatisfied fan,” Pagliarulo insisted. “That's not how it works.”</p><p>Pagliarulo went on to say “I’m also very proud of Shattered Space. We all are,” and confirmed that most of the quests and levels in the expansion were developed by designers who worked on previous Bethesda games and DLC, going all the way back to 2002 masterpiece Morrowind. “They’re good at what they do, and it shows,” he added.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If folks have played Shattered Space and still don’t like it, that makes me sad, honestly.</p></div><p>“If folks haven’t played Shattered Space, and they like Starfield, I think they’re missing out,” Pagliarulo continued. “If folks have played Shattered Space and still don’t like it, that makes me sad, honestly. Just know that we’ve also been hearing from plenty of people who love it.”</p><p>Pagliarulo offered an explanation of sorts for this apparent disconnect between the way he views Shattered Space and how fans have reacted to it. “Maybe it’s a game of expectations,” he suggested. “Fans want a lot, and we do all we can to accommodate them. Here’s what I can tell you – nobody, and I mean nobody, at Bethesda is patting themselves on the back while ignoring our players.”</p><p>Now Shattered Space is out, fans have wondered what’s next for Starfield. In June, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2">Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the company was committed to supporting <u>Starfield</u></a>, which has seen 14 million players across PC and Xbox Series X and S, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. Howard said Bethesda is aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p>Pagliarulo reiterated this commitment of support, saying Bethesda will continue to address community concerns and make fixes while “listening to our fans every step of the way.”</p><p>“Starfield is a massive game, and it takes time for us to address things,” he explained. “We move as fast as we can, as safely as we can. Game development is always tricky, but with a game as big as Starfield, every fix could potentially break something else.</p><p>“To close, let me just say… I love games. I love Bethesda’s games. I’ve been playing them since the Terminator days. All I or anyone here wants to do is make those games and then make them better. No ego. No arrogance. Just a lot of hard work, and appreciation of our fans.”</p><p>It’s a busy time for the 450-person Bethesda Game Studios, which currently operates five teams: Starfield; Elder Scrolls 6; Fallout 76; mobile; and external development partnerships. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>It’s working on the aforementioned Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>, ongoing content for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76"><u>Fallout 76</u></a>, various mobile games, updates for older games, and, eventually, the next Fallout.</p><p>But will Starfield see a sequel? If it does materialize it may be some time before we see anything of it, with Elder Scrolls 6 expected no earlier than 2028 and another Fallout game set to follow.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shroud-fronted-spectre-divide-isnt-dead-ceo-insists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"The servers aren’t shutting down, and the updates aren’t going to stop."</h2></div><section><p>The CEO of the developer behind <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/spectre-divide">Spectre Divide</a>, a new free-to-play competitive multiplayer shooter fronted by streamer Shroud, has insisted the game isn’t dead despite low player concurrent numbers.</p><p>Spectre Divide launched early September on PC via Steam, where it saw an encouraging 30,971 peak concurrent players. But that concurrent figure has fallen steadily since on Valve’s platform where it has a ‘mixed’ user review rating. Yesterday, October 8, Spectre Divide had a peak of 2,769 concurrent players.</p><p>Now, a month on from launch, Mountaintop Studios CEO, Nate Mitchell acknowledged the discourse around Spectre Divide low player numbers, but vowed to stick with the game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s true that Spectre’s concurrent player count is lower than we’d all like.</p></div><p>“Some folks out there have declared Spectre ‘dead,’ mostly as a result of low concurrency,” Mitchell said. “It’s true that Spectre’s concurrent player count is lower than we’d all like.”</p><p>Mitchell admitted that a PvP game like Spectre Divide needs lots of players for healthy matchmaking, and that without them, players will experience longer queues and less fair matches.</p><p>“With that said, I can assure you that Spectre isn’t going anywhere,” he added. “The servers aren’t shutting down, and the updates aren’t going to stop.</p><p>“If player count drops from here, we have strategies for bringing players together, like combining the matchmaking queues. And we'll continue working toward bringing new players in. We love this game – we’ve poured our heart and soul into it these past four years – and we’re just getting started.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Mitchell explained that Mountaintop is an independent studio with a small team, but “we have the funds to support Spectre for a long time. And I promise: We’re going to make Spectre awesome together.”</p><p>As for the future, Mitchell said the developers need some time “to go heads-down, improve the game, and tackle some of your bigger asks,” with Season 1 set to kick off in December or January. Priorities include client performance, ping and server regions, anti-cheat, and game stability.</p><p>Last month, shortly after Spectre Divide launched, Mountaintop cut 13 staff, with Mitchell saying at the time that the layoffs "make sure we're set up to support Spectre and its community for the long term."</p><p>Expanding on the reasoning now, Mitchell said: “We made the difficult decision to reduce our monthly spend to make sure we were set up to support Spectre for the long term. In the run up to launch, the studio grew from more than 85 devs to support a bigger live service roadmap. We’re now back to around 75 full-time devs, but we have plenty of firepower to bring our plans to life.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/09/gettyimages-1054359868-1728470825455.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Michael 'Shroud' Grzesiek in 2018. Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p>As for Shroud’s ongoing involvement, Mitchell said Mountaintop is still working with the streamer on future design iterations, “and he’s been helping us think through ways to make Spectre as compelling as possible for both community members and streamers.”</p><p>But, Mitchell stressed, Spectre Divide does not belong to Shroud, as some had assumed. “The reality is that Mountaintop has been bringing Spectre to life since 2020, and the game belongs to Mountaintop,” he said.</p><p>Spectre Divide launched amid a tumultuous time for the video game market and in particular live service games. 2024 has seen a number of high-profile live service missteps, including the failure of Rocksteady’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and Sony’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a>.</p><p><em>Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Universal have announced that they're working on a movie based on ninja platformer series&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>, and the project has already scored a director and writer.</p>
<p>Per an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/segas-shinobi-is-getting-a-film-adaptation-from-the-director-of-extraction" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN report</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>movie will be directed by&nbsp;<em>Extraction&nbsp;</em>helmsman Sam Hargrave, who's also a stuntman himself, although it's not clear whether he'll be providing any stunts for this movie.</p>
<p>Writing duties on the project will be handled by Ken Kobayashi, who's worked as a writer on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Hit-Monkey&nbsp;</em>and the Apple TV+ show&nbsp;<em>Sunny</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shinobi-movie-return-of-the-ninja-master-shot.jpg?itok=OQJ-_3u5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shinobi-movie-return-of-the-ninja-master-shot.jpg?itok=eS4rCuju 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>series is getting a movie adaptation.</figcaption></figure><p>Right now, details about the project are thin on the ground; we don't know if it'll serve as an adaptation of a particular&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>game or base itself on an amalgamation of the series as a whole.</p>
<p>Casting for the movie also hasn't been announced, so we don't know who's playing series lead Joe Musashi (if, indeed, the movie features him as its protagonist; it could just as easily tell the story of Hotsuma, the main character of the 2002&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>reboot).</p>
<p>As announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2023-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals">during the Game Awards last year</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>is one of the IPs Sega is planning to revive in the coming years, along with&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>,&nbsp;<em>Golden Axe</em>,&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>.</p>
<p>In the case of&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>, Sega seems to be reviving it as an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo">open-world game with persistent online multiplayer</a>, but we don't know what's in store for&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>just yet.</p>

<p>Last month, we got our first look at the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>movie (although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer">you might wish we hadn't</a>), and the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movies are still going strong as well, with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-keanu-shadow">third installment due out later this year</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens with the&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>movie, as well as the upcoming video game revival. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> won't be an "open sim" like the 2004 original game, according to Paradox Interactive. Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been "mythologised" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply "wouldn't fly today".</p>
<p>All this comes from my interview with Lilja at Paradox's Media Day - unofficial working title, Please Stop Poking Us - last week. To recap <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">my previous article about Life By You</a>, Paradox have spent much of the past two years pushing back release dates, cancelling things, publishing other things in a less-than-satisfactory state, and closing or parting ways with developers - a regular conga line of mishaps that have contributed to a 90% drop in operating profit for the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2 in particular has long travelled under a cloud of bats. It was announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the wheel and the original game's lead writer Brian Mitsoda as narrative director. "This is the sequel you have been waiting for," he said at the time. "It is going to be Bloodlines, as you remember it. But better." Alice B (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview">thought the preview build she saw in 2019 looked ace</a>, offering a familiar morass of factions and approaches but slathered in high-end visuals, with spruced-up combat. I liked what I saw of it myself at the company's PDXCON expo. But then came <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-into-2021">delays</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">Mitsoda's abrupt firing</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">change of studio</a> in 2021 that led to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-devs-hit-with-layoffs">layoffs</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-been-delayed-again-this-time-until-the-first-half-of-2025">more delays</a>. So how confident are Paradox that Bloodlines 2 will stick the landing, at this point? The answer, more or less, is "quietly", but it won't be the "same but better" sequel elder Nosferatus are hankering for.</p>
<p>"With Hardsuit Labs, we agreed on a vision of what they were gonna make, [and] they had a problem delivering on that," Lilja told me. "We were in agreement, we moved [development] to The Chinese Room and we said, this is the vision and this is what Hardsuit Labs have made. And of course, we gave them quite a lot of freedom to interpret the vision, based on what Hardsuit Labs had made, or change or remove whatever they didn't like. </p><p>"We have a high trust in The Chinese Room, given what they've done," he went on. "We've announced again a delay, into the first half of next year. I would stand by that. I'm pretty confident that that's going to work. I've seen the game now. The Chinese Room is really invested in it. They're taking a lot of initiatives. They like some things that Hardsuit did, they're changing some other things, and they're making their own game, that's still the vision that we had.</p>
<p>"So it's going to be an action-RPG in the World Of Darkness. If you've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes The Deep</a>, they know how to do story-driven action games with good voice-acting, all of that, which is basically what we're looking for in this game. I hope and feel that we will be able to deliver a game that puts you in the World Of Darkness."</p>
<p>Those gifted with preternatural vision may detect a careful qualification there. Not "a sequel to Bloodlines" but "a game that puts you in the World Of Darkness". And indeed, Lilja downplayed associations with the original game when I asked whether Bloodlines 2 would still be some kind of immersive sim (piggybacking on a comment made to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/rebooted-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-wont-be-an-immersive-sim-the-chinese-room/">TheGamer</a> in 2023). He also suggested that Bloodlines hasn't aged all that well, and that taking inspiration from it too zealously could be counter-productive.</p>
<p>"It's about setting the right expectations," he said. "The first Bloodlines game - it is what it is, and people who've played it recently will see that it's a game from 2004, that is now patched so that it works. But there's also a lot of ideas about what that game was, that are more, not to offend anyone, mythical. </p><p>"I like the first game as well a lot, but we want to clarify what this game is, so people have a clear understanding of what they're buying, so they don't come in with weird expectations - because we don't want that, we want them to understand that this is an action RPG with a storyline that is more fixed. It's not the open sim it maybe shouldn't be compared to. Again, we want people to understand what they're getting into."</p>
<p>I'm sympathetic to the idea that older games tend to disappear beneath a cloud of nostalgic make-believe - we're seeing it right now, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-silent-hill-2-remakes-wikipedia-page-briefly-got-transformed-into-a-phantasmagorical-reflection-of-the-psyches-of-idiots-unable-to-accept-reality">certain chunderhead reactions</a> to Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake. So which aspects of the original Bloodlines does Lilja think people are mythologising? Sadly, he didn't go into much detail.</p>
<p>"I actually played Bloodlines 1 quite recently, and it is a good game, but it is also an old game, and there are many things that would not fly today," Lilja said. "But I understand why people were super psyched by it in 2004, because it had a lot of cool [elements], and the feeling of being a vampire is really strong, regardless of other features. But I think people, they remember their feelings about it. And if they replayed it, I think they would see that it's a competently good game by 2004 standards, now that it's patched.</p>
<p>"But mainly we want to clarify that we're making a spiritual successor, not an actual same blueprint type of game, so people don't get disappointed and feel cheated," Lilja went on. "We really don't want that."</p>
<p>If Paradox have learned anything from the past few years of delays and cancellations, it's that making or publishing games outside their traditional grand strategy dominions is a risky business. During our chat, Lilja spoke at length about the need to refocus and make smaller bets on projects in future. With regard to Bloodlines 2, we shouldn't expect another action-RPG from Paradox in the near future, though Paradox do expect the game to at least break even.</p><p>"We do expect it to recover its investment," Lilja said, somewhat to my surprise. "But also saying that, it has changed studios, been in production a long time. My expectation is we will release a good game." He added, however, that "the continuation of this type of games for Paradox should probably be done in a different setup - again, going back to taking risks, how to invest when we're not sure that we exactly know what we're doing."</p>
<p>Fingers crossed that Bloodlines 2's most recent delay is the final delay, and that it doesn't immediately turn to dust on arrival. I'm disappointed that it won't be the frothing cauldron of vampire variables we were promised in 2019, but The Chinese Room do fine work - if nothing else, Bloodlines 2 should have atmosphere and sense-of-place in spades.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Yesterday, several former developers from studios such as Bethesda, BioWare and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> revealed their upcoming game - the rather delightful looking Hawthorn.</p>
<p>Hawthorn is coming from brand-new indie developer NEARstudios, which boasts some impressive talent including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> and The Last of Us veterans, as well as Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith.</p>
<p>Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised by Nesmith's new position at the studio, though. Afterall, Hawthorn really does look like a charming combination of Skyrim and village simulation games such as Animal Crossing and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>. I am talking about mice chopping down crops that are several times their size, before preparing a nice meal for top hat wearing otters, all in a very Skyrim-fantasy style setting.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for Hawthorn below.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time, woodland creatures built a trading post in forgotten Windermere Valley, but now it is the haunt of varmints, fairy lights, and mysterious rumours about why this village was abandoned," reads the official blurb below the trailer.</p><p>"To you, however, this is a hope for a new life. Recruit villagers and grow a community. Defend against the elements and forest tricksters. Thrive and celebrate the seasons’ traditions. Rebuilding won’t be easy, but you and your newfound friends are up to the challenge."</p>
<p>On its release, you will be able to experience Hawthorn in single-player and co-op. It doesn't currently have a release date, but you can add to your Wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3078150/Hawthorn/?utm_source=press&amp;utm_term=Eurogamer">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>
Ex-Humble Games staff made redundant in July have formed a fresh indie publisher, Good Games Group.
</p>
<p>
The company, lead by former Humble Games bosses Alan Patmore and Mark Nash, will now work with some of the development teams that its staff previously collaborated with back at Humble. 
</p>
<p>
Intriguingly, this means also working with Humble Games owner Ziff Davis once again - just months after its layoffs left the entire Humble Games team out of work. (Ziff Davis is also the parent company of IGN Entertainment, which owns this website.)
</p>
<p>
Back in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">Humble Games staff reported that Ziff Davis had made all 36 team members redundant</a>. At the time, the plan was reportedly for any remaining publishing projects to be finished by an outside consultancy firm, The Powell Group. 
</p>
<p>
Fast forward three months and it seems at least some of that former Humble Games team are back, albeit now working independently, under their own banner.
</p>
<p>
"Good Games Group's mission is to bring exceptional indie games to the global gaming community," said Alan Patmore, Good Games Group CEO. "Partnering with Ziff Davis allows us to continue working with the amazing indie developers we collaborated with at Humble Games, while also allowing us to chart a new course for the future."
</p>
<p>
There's no detail yet on which developers the company will be working with, but artwork on the Good Games Group website shows various titles published by Humble Games previously, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maps-and-cards-the-connected-worlds-of-carto-and-myrioramas">Carto</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-like-temtem-ditching-monetisation-in-june-ahead-of-one-last-major-patch">Temtem</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/midnight-fight-express">Midnight Fight Express</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-not-selling-out-failure/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is not selling as well as the base model did four years ago, but this doesn't mean that the console will fail on the market.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their<a href="https://youtu.be/gxwB2f5s850?si=dCYmbNVMorOSZrPN&amp;t=6154" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> weekly podcast</a>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on the mid-generation system's pre-orders, highlighting how a system not selling out at launch before the pandemic, which was the norm, did not mean that sales were disastrous. For a certainty, demand will be softer compared to the demand for the PlayStation 4 Pro and the Xbox One X, mostly due to the fact that the previous-generation refresh systems were being sold for the launch price of the base models. The supply chain has likely been improved over the base model, as the system's node, for example, was much more competitive in 2020 but not as much anymore, so there could be more than enough supply to meet whatever demand there is for the system at launch.</p>
<p>Even if demand is not particularly high, Sony is most like fine with not selling a huge amount of PlayStation 5 Pro units, as the Japanese company seems to be more focused on the health of the PS5 family of systems. The company has higher margins on the Pro system as well, further highlighting how the console doesn't need to sell a lot to be successful for Sony. Hopefully, the tech experts added, the system will sell well enough to incentivize developers to create good PS5 Pro versions of their games that fully utilize the system's unique features.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #183: Until Dawn Has Issues, Nintendo Ryujinx Takedown, UE5 MegaLights, FF16 Xbox?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxwB2f5s850?start=6154&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Speaking about PlayStation 5 Pro versions of already available games, Digital Foundry had the chance to go hands-on with the game that has kind of become the best showcase of the system's capabilities: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. In their hands-on session, the tech experts noticed how the game features some image stability issues, mostly noticeable in foliage and distant geometric objects. Despite lacking the same image stability featured by a native 4K resolution and TAA experience, image quality is still fine, especially compared to the horrible quality of Performance Mode on the base model. Unfortunately, it seems like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth won't see other visual improvements, as it has been confirmed that the PS5 Pro mode features the same visual settings as the base model's Graphics Mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265946/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-alpha-test<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is holding a technical alpha later this month for the upcoming <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> release. The technical alpha <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/join-us-for-the-microsoft-flight-simulator-technical-alpha-in-october/">will be held</a> over an unspecified weekend in October to test the game’s core services ahead of its debut on November 19th. Participants in the test phase will need a capable PC gaming rig to try out <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 </em>before its release, as this alpha test won’t be available to Xbox players.</p><p>Free flight and a limited amount of career, challenges, and discovery will be accessible during the technical alpha, alongside a limited number of aircraft. “The technical alpha has been designed to gather feedback on specific areas and features, and the scope of what is available is limited,” says the <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator </em>team. You can <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/join-us-for-the-microsoft-flight-simulator-technical-alpha-in-october/">sign up for the alpha test here</a>. </p><p>The current version of <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> is already a demanding game on PC, and this 2024 edition looks set to raise the PC requirements even further. The <a href="https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-pc-system-requirements/655399">recommended specs</a> include 32GB of RAM, an Intel Core i7-10700K, and an RTX 2080. Ideally though, Microsoft says you’ll want up to 64GB of RAM, an RTX 4080, and an Intel Core i7-14700K if you want to play at max settings.</p><p>Once <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> releases next month, you’ll be able to fly an air ambulance, be part of a mountain rescue team, or act as search and rescue. There’s even VIP charter services, skydive aviation, air racing, and hot air balloon trips.</p><p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248947/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-cloud-release-date">also getting smaller</a>, with the install size reduced to around 30GB. Microsoft is using its latest cloud streaming technology to stream high detailed areas on a flight path, reducing the amount that needs to be preinstalled. Testing this cloud streaming technology is a big part of the <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> technical alpha later this month.</p><p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> debuts on PC and Xbox Series S / X on November 19th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-player-numbers-inflated/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-responds-to-report-that-claims-it-inflates-player-numbers-by-up-to-42.1004736/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-player-numbers-inflated/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Roblox has responded to a report that claims the company inflates its player numbers by as much as 42%.</p>



<p><span>A </span>report from Hindenberg Research (via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/short-seller-hindenburg-says-roblox-inflates-user-metrics-compromises-child-safety-92c77b5e?st=NV9qAB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wall Street Journal</a>) claims that Roblox has been inflating its player numbers by as much as 42% since 2021. The firm states that its research is based on interviews with “multiple former Roblox employees.”</p>



<p>Hindenberg’s research also reveals that Roblox’s moderation systems to keep children safe from adult content does not work. This included the research firm creating a new account and listing their age as “under 13”, but found that the Roblox search bar still allowed the user to find adult content easily by just searching for “adult”. The firm says that it found one group “openly trading child pornography and soliciting sexual acts from minors.”</p>



<p>In response to the report, Roblox issued the following <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/984876518/files/doc_news/2024/Oct/08/hindenburg-statement-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>,</p>



<p>“Safety and civility have been foundational to Roblox since the company’s inception nearly two decades ago, and the company has invested heavily throughout its history in its Trust &amp; Safety efforts. Every day, tens of millions of users of all ages have safe and positive experiences on Roblox, abiding by the company’s Community Standards. Roblox takes any content or behavior on the platform that doesn’t abide by its standards extremely seriously, and Roblox has a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent malicious or harmful activity on the platform.”</p>



<p>On the claims of Roblox inflating its player numbers, the company said, “The financial claims made by Hindenburg are misleading.” The statement continues to say that, “the authors are short sellers and have an agenda irrespective of the substance of Roblox’s business model and results.”</p>



<div><p>Roblox also provided an example of how its key operating metrics are calculated.</p><p><strong><em>“We define a DAU as a user who has logged in and visited Roblox through our website or application on a unique registered account on a given calendar day. If a registered, logged in user visits Roblox more than once within a 24-hour period that spans two calendar days, that user is counted as a DAU only for the first calendar day. We believe this method better reflects global engagement on the platform compared to a method based purely on a calendar-day cutoff. DAUs for a specified period is the average of the DAUs for each day during that period. As an example, DAUs for the month of September would be an average of DAUs during that 30 day period.”<p>“Because DAUs measure account activity and an individual user may actively use our platform within a particular day on multiple accounts for which that individual registered, our DAUs are not a measure of unique individuals accessing Roblox. Additionally, if undetected, fraud and unauthorized access to our platform may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement of DAUs. In many cases, fraudulent accounts are created by bots to inflate user activity for a particular developer’s content on our platform, thus making the developer’s experience (which refer to the titles that have been created by developers) or other content appear more popular than it really is. We strive to detect and minimize fraud and unauthorized access to our platform.”</p></em></strong></p></div>

Their fiercest battles were with the United States, as the new nation pushed westward. Seeking to build a coalition of indigenous people to form a united front, the Shawnee established a settlement at Prophetstown, but the U.S. Army loomed on the horizon.</blockquote><p>Speaking to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/civ7-shawnee-tecumseh-firaxis-civilization-32ca02931e9cdeb024a9a0abb7081d2a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a>, producer Andrew Frederiksen revealed that developers from Firaxis had asked the Shawnee to imagine a Shawnee university or library of the future and to create new Shawnee words to describe futuristic concepts for use in the hotly anticipated 4X game.</p><p>Shawnee Tribe Chief Ben Barnes, already a fan of 1999’s Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri, jumped at the chance to be involved with Civilization 7 after Firaxis said it wanted to make a playable character out of their famous leader Tecumseh.</p><p>“Firaxis was asking questions about language we never would have thought to ask,” Barnes said. The partnership also involves a donation of hundreds of thousands of dollars in language revitalization programs and facilities.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/09/screenshot-2024-10-09-105324-1728467619167.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: 2K Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>According to Firaxis, Tecumseh, "the one who leaps across the great expanse," was a Shawnee chief "who challenged the westward expansion of the early United States. Together with his brother Tenskwatawa, he spread a message of unity and resistance among indigenous people. Although Tecumseh was killed during the War of 1812, his vision of cultural persistence lives on."</p><p>Firaxis historian Andrew Johnson revealed that academics had warned the studio against including Tecumseh as a playable leader, but got in touch with Shawnee leaders directly to find out what they thought. “I think so often you get people assuming that representation in Civ is a reward of some sort. It’s not,” Johnson said.</p><p>“This is a company and we’re selling a product and we’re using an image and likeness to make a profit. And getting your ‘civ’ in Civilization doesn’t really help you very much if you’re struggling to preserve your culture.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>AP said the partnership comes after an acknowledgement from Civilization creator Sid Meier and other Firaxis executives of "past missteps in the Civilization franchise’s casual treatment of history, including how it incorporated Indigenous groups and colonization more broadly."</p><p>The report mentions that Firaxis ditched its plan to add a historical Pueblo leader in 2010 after tribal leaders objected, and that the studio faced public criticism in Canada for including a Cree leader in Civilization 6.</p><p>In 2018, a prominent Cree leader complaining that it "perpetuates this myth that First Nations had similar values that the colonial culture has, and that is one of conquering other peoples and accessing their land. That is totally not in concert with our traditional ways and world view."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We always kind of felt, 'Here's a way that you can change history.' Maybe we can make Stalin a good guy. But that might have been stretching things a little too far.</p></div><p>Meier talked about the early Civilization games’ inclusion of Indigenous leaders such as Montezuma of the Aztecs, as well as the likes of Josef Stalin and Mao Zedong. "We never realized people would take it as seriously as they do," Meier said. "We always kind of felt, ‘Here’s a way that you can change history.’ Maybe we can make Stalin a good guy. But that might have been stretching things a little too far.</p><p>"We learned a lot as time went on. It is now a badge of honor for a nation to be included in Civilization. We’ve been lobbied by different countries, et cetera.”</p><p>In Civilization 7, Tecumseh specializes in diplomacy and defense. His unique ability, Nicaakiyakoolaakwe, increases food, production, and combat strength based on the number of allied city-states. Shawnee as a civ excel at utilizing natural resources. Their unique ability, Nepekifaki, gives more food for settlements built on river tiles but slightly reduces food for any cities not built on rivers. Its associated wonder is the Serpent Mound.</p><p>The Shawnee civilization is part of the Tecumseh and Shawnee Pack DLC, which is included in the Deluxe and Founders Editions of Civilization 7. It is not included in the Standard Edition of Civilization 7, but is available as a bonus offer for pre-orders of the Standard Edition until February 11, 2025, and will be available for separate purchase thereafter.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>PC players are already busy modding <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, reverting the game to something more akin to the original release.</p>
<p>The series as a whole is known for its persistent fog, but some of the most striking mods on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/mods/thisweek/">NexusMods</a> are those that remove the fog entirely, turning the game into a completely different experience.</p>
<p>For instance, modder FrancisLouis has created the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/mods/2">Silent Hill 2 HD Collection mod</a>, in a cheeky nod to the widely-criticised collection that removed much of the trademark fog.</p>

<p>In fact, the same modder has gone a step further with their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/mods/47">Sunny Hills mod</a> that - you guessed it - bathes the game in sunlight, with the added ability to remove fog (it's a little <em>too </em>bright otherwise).</p>

<p>You could even throw in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/mods/28">NorskPL's mod</a> that replaces protagonist James Sunderland with the model from the 2001 game.</p>

<p>Once the fog has been removed, you could then install this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/mods/29">flycam mod from KeinZantezuken</a> to really get a good look at the town of Silent Hill.

<p>Perhaps the cheekiest mod of all, though, is replacing the James Sunderland model with that of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/mods/63">Leon Kennedy from rival survival horror Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>. I guess James was too busy at bingo to find his missing wife.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-break-stuff<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The high-flying comic book action doesn’t stop with two new character packs coming to <i>Marvel Crisis Protocol</i> - including the infamously devilish Mephisto, the behemoth Abomination, and the wily Wrecking Crew! I’m currently really loving the game, with my recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-review-howling-good-time">review of the Monsters Unleashed character pack</a> and my <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/apocalypse-unleashed-marvel-crisis-protocol-figure-and-terrain-review">review of the Apocalypse pack and associated terrain</a>. So let’s see how these newest packs stack up in my Marvel Crisis Protocol - Mephisto, Abomination, Wrecking Crew Review!</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-mephisto-close-up.jpeg?itok=hYvFywBR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-mephisto-close-up.jpeg?itok=9cAPowbW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>What Mephisto Does Best: </i>Mephisto is, much like the character in comics, a very tricky individual. Firstly, he’s interested in making your opponent make hard decisions - many of his tactics cards involve you presenting a choice to your opponent, both of which kind of benefit them, but definitely benefit you. And the more “Devil’s Deal” tokens you acquire, the stronger you become (especially with your “Termination Clause” special Beam 4 attack - which adds dice to the attack equal to the “Devil’s Deal” tokens you have).&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>How To Run Him: </i>With Mephisto, while he might be interesting to splash into a tricky group, I think you’ll get more mileage out of him by using his “Devil’s Reckoning” card, which allows you to turn an unaffiliated group containing Mephisto into his own Legion of the Lost affiliation (kind of like Dracula who we talked about last week).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-mephisto-cards.jpg?itok=HntbfH-f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-mephisto-cards.jpg?itok=yGRMYkpW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you do this, your opponent will have to choose one of their characters to give the incinerate condition to, and two of your characters gain one power. It’s a nifty trick if you don’t want to put him in the other affiliations he can rock with: Cabal and Criminal Syndicate.</p>
<p>His “Meet My Associate” superpower is also going to be very crucial to keeping him alive, as his defenses aren’t necessarily awesome for a 5 threat character. But the ability to swap a helpful ally in and soak up damage that would head his way is very useful. All in all, he’s one of those characters whose flavor outweighs their usefulness, even though I still think a lot of fun can be had by list-builders out there better than me. I’m just - at current - not seeing enough synergies to want to run him beyond the novelty of the character.</p>
<h2>Abomination</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-abomination-close-up.jpeg?itok=-nIU78Jb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-abomination-close-up.jpeg?itok=1mJQQe50 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>What Abomination Does Best: </i>Abomination, aka Emil Blonsky, is all about two things: Hitting hard and poisoning his enemies. It’s a <i>really</i> fun combination, and if Mephisto was a tricky character, Abomination is… not. But in my opinion, that’s not a bad thing! The simplicity of Abomination is what makes this character truly shine, as it strikes really hard, can throw size 4 or less terrain Long distance, and can blast enemy characters around him with poison (or deal out two free damage to already poisoned opponents).</p>
<p><i>How To Run Him: </i>Get him in the fight! Don’t be worried about keeping him close to other allies like Mephisto. Abomination wants to go out and crush his enemies like little bugs - so who are we to stop him?</p>
<p>He only has two tactics cards - one of which “You Will Do As I Say, Monster” is <em>actually</em>&nbsp;not even his card, but a card for George Tarleton (aka M.O.D.O.K.), which allows him to throw Abomination Medium distance (for five power). I don't think we've seen a combo card like this in a while, the most recent one I remember seeing coming with Iceman allowing Emma Frost to work w/ him.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-abomination-cards.jpg?itok=UCXrzD31 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-abomination-cards.jpg?itok=AmT73qK1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>His other tactics card, “Gamma Burst,” costs three power and pushes any enemies with a poison counter on them away from Abomination, not bad if things get a little stickier than you’d like. But I gotta be real, with his tough hide (which reduces all incoming damage by 1), I don’t think things are going to get too sticky for our good friend Emil here.</p>
<h2>Wrecking Crew</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-wrecking-crew-close-up.jpeg?itok=XkREt5mb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-wrecking-crew-close-up.jpeg?itok=RLaBmy4g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>What Wrecking Crew Does Best: </i>The Wrecking Crew, made up of Brian Calusky, Dirk Garthwaite, Eliot Franklin, and Henry Camp (gotta be the longest secret identity in the game), are best at <i>exactly</i> what it sounds like they’d be best at: wrecking things! Two key abilities, “Bulldoze,” and “Wrecking Bar Fling” really interact with terrain in a satisfying way, and they’re key to understanding how to use Wrecking Crew.</p>
<p>For “Bulldoze,” a three power superpower, you can push Wrecking Crew Medium, and any size 2 or smaller terrain doesn’t stop it (and is destroyed), then, if you reach an enemy character, they immediately take 1 damage and you stop moving. It’s a great way to scoot across the battlefield and get in close to use your other attacks.</p>
<p>“Wrecking Bar Fling” is an attack that costs no power, and it’s a Beam 4 attack which gains an attack die (it starts with 4) for every size 2 or smaller terrain it overlaps with. In other words, you set up this beam - destroy every phone post, car, etc. in its way to power your beam - and unleash the blast on your enemies!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-wrecking-crew-cards.jpg?itok=3EBKfkt1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-wrecking-crew-cards.jpg?itok=2JolFjhQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>How To Run Them: </i>This character has a lot of midrange abilities that can really give them some utility around objectives, as it’s pretty easy to move around the battlefield, and you’re dishing out Stagger and Stun condition tokens liberally too. Get them into the mid-field, lock down and chuck your opponents around, and then blast them with a big beam whenever things line up correctly.</p>
<p>This is also a unit where you really want to think carefully when laying down terrain at the start of the game. Prioritize getting those 1 and 2 size terrain pieces down in advantageous positions, and you could really set yourself up for some major success here.</p>
<h2>Marvel Crisis Protocol - Mephisto, Abomination, Wrecking Crew Review - Final Thoughts</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-atomic-mass-games-image.jpg?itok=f92zX-gS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-atomic-mass-games-image.jpg?itok=Ap5OIZDJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is why it’s so fun for me to review multiple character packs when their embargo opens up on the same day. For one, being able to review different characters who are doing different things allows us to see how they could complement each other, or not. But also, sometimes I just like one model more than others - and it’s fun to get to talk about the high’s and low’s of a release schedule.</p>
<p>And while Mephisto is by no means a “low,” I’m the kind of player who really responds well to the smash-y shenanigans you can get up to with a character like Abomination or Wrecking Crew. While it does seem fun to build around Mephisto offering bargains to opponents (imagine him with some Loki goofiness, I shudder to think), you’ll find me hurling debris and smashing scenery to eke out a victory.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-was-almost-a-fish-em-up-called-like-a-dragon-tuna<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>A new PlayStation blog (thanks cheery fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/the-next-game-in-the-like-a-dragon-series-was-almost-a-fishing-game-i-wanted-to-make-a-game-called-like-a-dragon-tuna/">PCGamer</a> for the spot) has provided some illuminating info on the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</a>, and in many ways, the LAD series as a whole. The biggest takeaway: the fact pirate Yakuza was, at one point, going to be a fishing game called Like A Dragon: Tuna.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Sachie Kobari <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/08/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-interview/">interviewed</a> RGG studio director and LAD executive producer Masayoshi Yokoyama, alongside RGG's chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto, about LAD: Pirate Yakuza's origins. Right from the off, Kobari asks how the game came to be - and the response is gold.</p>
<p>Yokoyama says that once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>'s (Yakuza 8) development came to a close, they wanted to create a "blown-up sub-story" for the game, as a sort of spin-off that stars characters besides the main protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. Turns out that "for quite some time", Yokoyama wanted to make a game called "Like A Dragon: Tuna", where Kiryu, "as a tuna fisherman, sets off to sea to fight against fishing boats". In the end it didn't come about, obviously, but Yokoyama says that words like "ship", "sea", and "fighting" were "engraved in his head". And it's this mixture of themes that eventually bore piracy.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/pirate-yakuza-guns.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>It's interesting that they ditched Kiryu and went with Majima. Presumably, it's because Kiryu stars in a lot of their games - most recently semi-spin-off, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name">Like A Dragon Gaiden</a> - and Pirate Yakuza is an opportunity to give the fans what they want: control over the absolute weapon that is Goro Majima, with his wise-cracking and his stylish moves. He's a cracking character, with some real trauma powering that outward 'madness' and, believe it or not, a soft heart capable of love. All of which we're introduced to in the brilliant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a> and then it's built on slightly in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> with a fateful reunion. Seriously, I don't think I've recovered.</p><p>Pirate Yakuza is hopefully the first of many daft spin-offs. Back in 2018 (or 2021 on PC) we had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judgment">Judgment</a> as the action sidepiece to LAD's turn-based battles, starring a kickass lawyer and his pals fighting crime from the inside. Sadly the Judgment series seemingly came to a halt when the actor Takuya Kimura, who plays the main character Takayuki Yagami, got into some rights issues (Japanese link to those rights issues <a href="https://taishu.jp/articles/-/95672?page=2">here</a>). You know what I'd kill for? A spin-off of the next LAD game, but it's Haruka or <em>anyone</em> pursuing a J-Pop dream. God, that section of Yakuza 5 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-games-need-yakuza-5s-weird-pivot-to-j-pop-sim">was mint</a>.</p>
<p>Oh and also, Kiryu's taxi driver shenanigans in Yakuza 5? Also great. Just spitballing here RGG, but I wouldn't be mad if Like A Dragon went a bit Crazy Taxi.</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption, which first launched all the way back in 2010 across PS3 and Xbox 360, will be making its PC debut later this month, on 29th October.</p>
<p>If you are yet to play the game for yourself, Simon Parkin said "the result is an exceptional Rockstar game, one that successfully re-clothes the Grand Theft Auto framework in an exciting, distinct and expertly realised scenario," in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-review">Eurogamer's original Red Dead Redemption review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-endorse-agenda/">Assassin's Creed</a> series publisher Ubisoft is being sued for sharing user data from its Store and Ubisoft + subscription service with Facebook company Meta.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/ubisoft-shared-gaming-data-with-meta-wiretap-lawsuit-claims" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg Law</a> (Thanks,<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-is-being-sued-for-allegedly-sharing-ubisoft-store-and-ubisoft-user-data-with-meta/"> VGC</a>), the class action complaint reveals that the publisher of some of the most popular gaming franchises still active today has been sharing personally identifiable information with Meta every time a user purchases a game on the Ubisoft Store or subscribes to its + service via the Pixel user tracking software, which isn't disclosed in any way. As such, this data-sharing practice is in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act introduced in 1988, which was created to prevent <em>"wrongful disclosure of video tape rental or sale records". </em>The Act was later amended in 2013 to allow streaming networks to share personally identifiable data, but only with the user's consent.</p>
<p><em>"The Pixel cannot be placed on a website without steps taken directly by defendant or on behalf of defendant (e.g. by a website manager).&nbsp;</em><em>The Pixel cannot be placed on the website by Facebook without the knowledge and cooperation of the defendant,"</em> the class action complaint reads while adding that Ubisoft is clearly not seeking the user's approval to track and share their data with Meta.</p>
<p>The lawsuit has yet to receive a class action certification, but the plaintiffs are seeking a trial and financial compensation for everyone involved. They also want Ubisoft to remove Pixel from its website or seek consent from the users to share their data.</p>
