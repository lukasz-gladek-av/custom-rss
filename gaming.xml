            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/freedom-wars-remastered-review-abductor-slayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In September of last year, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/freedom-wars-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">announced</a>. The circles I frequent online were quite enthusiastic about this, despite me having never heard of the game. I mean, I didn't even own a <a href="https://techraptor.net/platform/playstation-vita" rel="nofollow">PS Vita</a>, it seemed like a completely obscure title. Still, the excitement from my friends piqued my interest, so I had to see what <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> was all about.</p>

<p>It seemed like a weird choice to revive a dormant IP exclusive to the PS Vita, but I'm glad I took the chance to review it. Turns out, <em>Freedom Wars </em><em>Remastered</em> is a quirky and competent take on the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/monster-hunter" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter</a> </em>formula, and that makes for an addicting game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-screenshot-1_1.jpg?itok=BxiFgXLe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-screenshot-1_1.jpg?itok=2Nmk-fdF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I guess I'll take that as a compliment?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Freedom Wars Remastered,</em> a Decade After the Original</h2>

<p>As <em>Freedom Wars</em> is a remaster of a PS Vita title from 2014, you might expect it to look a bit dated visually. The smaller screen of a Vita means lower resolution, so obviously graphics aren't going to be on par with that of consoles.</p>

<p>Still, developer Dimps Corporation makes a commendable effort to revitalize <em>Freedom Wars</em> with this remaster. With upgraded textures and running a higher resolution, <em>Freedom Wars</em> <em>Remastered</em> looks very good considering its origins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=AD2jGueH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=1iW1Ohiw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The squad's here!</figcaption></figure><p>Supposedly, it can run on 4k resolution. I couldn't find any way to tweak graphics on the PS5 version of <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>, so I'll just have to take the developer's word for it. I presume PC versions will have more options to adjust visuals. At the very least, I can say <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> runs at 60 FPS, so it's a smooth ride.</p>

<p>Really, the only issue is some animations look a little janky, especially during dialogue. There's a lot of talking in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered, </em>and facial animations are super rudimentary. It's nothing that'll detract from the experience; in fact, it's usually the only <em>visual </em>reminder that this was once a PS Vita game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay.jpg?itok=nxl8UtQJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay.jpg?itok=8fGmfn3e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's satisfying to drag down a big ol' monster!</figcaption></figure><h2>Fighting For the Cause in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>To put it simply, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> takes the <em>Monster Hunter</em> formula and gives it a gratifying hook (as if <em>Monster Hunter </em>wasn't already addicting). Not only are you acquiring new materials to upgrade equipment, but you also have a million-year prison sentence. As a sinner, you're tasked with working off that sentence by taking on various operations.</p>

<p>Your player character's prison sentence literally looms over your head, and just about every action you do either contributes to or diminishes said sentence. Stand around in one place too long? The game will give you a few decades to think about your ungodly crime.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-sentence-2.jpg?itok=5K79MwUD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-sentence-2.jpg?itok=5slMXScb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just a drop in the bucket.</figcaption></figure><p>And so, that's where these operations come in. Completing various missions, ranging from extermination of "Abductors" (<em>Freedom Wars' </em>version of monsters), rescuing citizens, and donating valuable resources to the cause, all help diminish that prison term.</p>

<p>Watching the prison sentence deteriorate over the course of the campaign and into the endgame is a very satisfying feeling, even if it's an arbitrary number. It's a way to catalog your rank among other players and track your progress. Having this little way to measure your efforts encouraged me to do "just one more mission."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-dragon.jpg?itok=viEelOT3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-dragon.jpg?itok=35ppx2Ns 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We got Rathalos at home.</figcaption></figure><p>This progress is also tracked via online leaderboards. It's a multiplayer game with other sinners, and each sinner belongs to a Panopticon. Think of a Panopticon as your home base. You choose this at the beginning of the game when you're customizing your character, and each Panopticon represents a prefecture of Japan.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this will change once the public has hands on it, but the original version of <em>Freedom Wars</em> split Panopticons as cities around the globe. Though, as far as I know, the only choice now is Japan's prefectures, so I went with Hokkaido.</p>

<p>The leaderboard tallies your contribution both within the Panopticon and against other prefectures, so it's again, a very neat little measure to see how everyone's progressing and incentivizes some friendly competition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-anductor.jpg?itok=PnRJ97GW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-anductor.jpg?itok=3xdoBSgM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes, guns are the best option!</figcaption></figure><h2>On the Hunt in<em> Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>It's in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s combat that many players will find some sort of familiarity with. I don't like to draw comparisons to other games if I can help it, but it's hard to ignore the fact that<em> Freedom Wars Remastered</em> plays a great deal like <em>Monster Hunter</em>.</p>

<p>The whole routine of fighting giant monsters (Abductors), severing parts, upgrading your equipment from said parts, and going back into the fray is the general gameplay loop here. Though, on its own, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> is a competent action game, even if it's a bit light on game mechanics.</p>

<p>There are several different weapon types to choose from, each with its own skillset, as well as firearms. You can equip yourself with two different weapons at once, so that gives room for some versatility. You're also given several AI companions if you're playing solo, as well as your own customizable Accessory -- this is a robot companion that helps you out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-combat-2.jpg?itok=4jYnJyuJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-combat-2.jpg?itok=1BcP709u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once they're on the ground, it's time to lay on the hurt.</figcaption></figure><p>To top it all off, you have a thorn, which makes <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s gameplay quite enjoyable. By shooting a thorn onto a wall or enemy, you can launch yourself to that location and pull off some cool air attacks. It's especially useful against Abductors so you can sever parts that are higher up.</p>

<p>Thorns are super fun to use, launching yourself around gargantuan foes like you're from <em>Attack on Titan</em>. It adds just a bit of extra oomph to the gameplay, though the rest of <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> could do with either new weapons, a few new attacks, or just something else to help it stand out.</p>

<p>Enemy variety, too, is just a bit repetitive. Most enemies come in the form of Abductors, and they increase in power as you progress through the campaign. The thing is, most of them follow the same template of being bipeds, quadrupeds, and the like, and they don't look or act all that different as time goes on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story.jpg?itok=PPPqQDfj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story.jpg?itok=zdJCpUkl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aries, one of the story's several key characters.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Story That Never Reaches Its Potential in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>My thoughts on <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s story are conflicted. On one hand, I really like its premise and setting, but on the other, the way the story is told is not all that great. The setting is, you're in this resource war, as presumably the world's resources are sparse in that day and age.</p>

<p>As such, Sinners are required to gather resources. Regular civilians are kidnapped by rival Panopticons' Abductors, and Sinners have to go save them. Meanwhile, there are various factions working within and outside of your Panopticon with different agendas and motives, most of which remain vague throughout the duration.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story-2.jpg?itok=KXrymuDK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story-2.jpg?itok=Rsv1EFyt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Most of the characters are likable enough.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> ends on an absurdly disappointing note. There are some post-game activities, but as I understand it, the story was supposed to continue in a sequel that never was. It leads to some mysteries that are never solved, which is a shame.</p>

<p><em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> also presents its story in a sloppy way. The start of the game is front-loaded with a ton of dialogue, so it's super slow-going at first and really could do better with its pacing. On top of that, walking around your Panopticon to continue the story is pretty sluggish and doesn't make for exciting gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-customization.jpg?itok=WuNewecB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-customization.jpg?itok=ybAIuWRi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You get to create and customize your own Sinner!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Freedom Wars Remastered </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1OD00IBWxM" rel="nofollow">a few enhancements</a> that returning players will enjoy. Apparently, upgrading weapons has become a more seamless experience. They've added subtle improvements to combat overall, and even a new difficulty mode. These are additions that I initially took for granted, but when I learned about how <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> changed for the better, I was very appreciative of these tweaks.</p>

<p>Despite some problems with <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s story and the lack of depth in its gameplay, I still had a lot of fun with this title. Seeing your sentence diminish as time goes on is a gratifying feeling. Moreover, once it launches for players worldwide, I imagine the conflict amongst other Panopticons will lead to some exciting rivalries.</p>

<p>Who knows, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> might even lead to the long-awaited sequel. I'd absolutely love to see <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s formula expanded upon. More depth in its gameplay and a more developed story in a sequel would make it a strong rival to <em>Monster Hunter</em>.</p>

            <p>The more I tell you about <a href="https://neal.fun/stimulation-clicker/">Stimulation Clicker</a>, the less funny it will be, so let's keep this brief. It's an idle clicker, obviously, which starts with a single button in the centre of a browser screen. The more "stimulation" you accrue through clicking, the more options become available. It escalates. And escalates. And escalates. I found that my feelings of delight grew roughly in proportion to the toll taken on my computer's processor. After 30 minutes, I was huffing and hooting like a drunken horse to a soundtrack of disintegrating laptop fans.</p><!--more-->
<p>Stimulation Clicker angles forward and backward through the history of the internet. On the one hand, it's a merciless piece of trolling that tramples all over nerve endings worn to the hilt by the web 3.0 era of hyper-velocity enshittification. On the other, it's a testament to the expressive power of HTML, a reminder of those glory days 20 years ago when every website was a wishing well full of elusive or hidden moving parts and connections, including digital will-o'-the-wisps called "pop ups" that, back then, were a source of wonder and curiosity. You'd even click on them, occasionally! Awwwwww. I miss the internet being good.</p>
<p>Thanks to reader jamhandy for spotting Stimulation Clicker and chucking it into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-26">the latest Maw liveblog</a>. I'm reviewing an open world game at the minute, and this was exactly the change of pace I was looking for, though I do now have a bit of a complex about owls and the Welsh.

But Ronald appears to want to make a distinction, suggesting the goal of creating a handheld would be to use the company’s expertise gained over decades of making consoles, and bring that to a portable PC. “I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together,” the VP said told <em>The Verge</em>, “because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console.”</p><p>The goal, it seems, is to bring the two together. Or, perhaps more frankly, to make Windows less of a pain in the ass to use on a small screen. It’s something Microsoft hasn’t traditionally been great at. Did you ever own a Windows-based cellphone? I did! Haha! It was so bad. Then remember Microsoft’s last big attempt, with Windows 7's abysmal attempt to become tile-based, compromising its entire UI for the desktops everyone was using it on for the sake of portable devices on which no one was?</p><p>With every tech firm under the sun attempting to ride the success of Valve’s Steam Deck device and launching their own handheld PCs, Microsoft clearly wants a slice of the pie, but perhaps knows that Windows 11 wouldn’t cut it, and that it’d never be able to show its face again if it used a Linux-based interface. That’s likely driving Donald’s declarations of bringing the simpler UX of an Xbox to a Windows-powered portable. However, he’s being coy, telling <em>The Verge</em> “we’ll have a lot more to share later this year.”</p><p>However, what he has to say just now sounds awfully familiar. “I think,” Donald says, “at the end of the day our goal is to make Windows great for gaming on any device.” Which is a refrain we’ve heard countless times across countless iterations of the operating system. Each major new release comes with a major new push to make Windows so great for gaming, and none ever catches on. (Remember when Windows Vista launched, trumpeting a feature that would score your PC’s hardware out of 10, and believed the industry would publish games with a matching score so you’d know if it worked? No? Exactly.) And yet, bizarrely, Windows has <em>always</em> been the default OS for PC gaming, inevitably working far better the less Microsoft has tried to get involved.</p><p>But, as Donald points out, the Xbox OS is sitting on top of a lot of Windows’ code, so it shouldn’t be a herculean task to bring its tiled world across to a handheld device. Obviously it needs to be reworked for a PC such that it never needs a cursor input or a taskbar to be clicked, and sure, the Xbox already manages this, but that’s largely thanks to all the ways it’s defiantly <em>not</em> behaving like a PC, with its incredibly limited settings and locked-down nature. “There’s fundamental interaction models that we’re working on,” says Donald, “to make sure that regardless of the operating system details, it feels very natively like a gaming-centric device and a gaming-centric experience.”</p><p>So, the real message here is, forget about a possible portable Xbox for now, we could well be seeing a portable PC that <em>feels </em>like an Xbox within the year.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Amidst several announcements of new handhelds powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-apus-gaming-handhelds-z2-extreme-strix-z2-hawk-z2-go-rembrandt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD's Ryzen Z2 processor</a>, Microsoft also talked about its upcoming highly anticipated Xbox handheld at CES 2025.</p>
<p>The Verge was able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discuss the subject with Jason Ronald</a>, Vice President of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem at Microsoft. Ronald, who previously led the development of the Xbox One X and Xbox Series S|X console launches, promised that the Xbox handheld would offer users the best of console and PC put together.</p>
<p><em>We’ve been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it’s really about how do we bring those innovations that we’ve incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space.</em></p>
<p><em>I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together,because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console. What we’re doing is we’re really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re focused on really simplifying that and making it much more like a console experience. Our goal is to put the player and their library at the center of the experience and not all the Windows work that you have to do today.</em></p>
<p>The launch of the Xbox handheld isn't quite imminent, but Ronald teased that Microsoft would share a lot more later this year.</p>
<p>There have been rumors about Microsoft's handheld projects for years. Head of gaming Phil Spencer finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed it</a> with his recent comments but also said the handheld is still 'a few years' out. Putting two and two together, it sounds like late 2026 could be a likely release window. The new Xbox home console is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored to debut in late 2026</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bay 12 Games and publisher Kitfox Games have announced that the&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>Adventure Mode will be launching out of beta later this month.</p>

<p>In an update on Steam, Bay 12's Tarn Adams and Kitfox's Alexandra Orlando reveal that Adventure Mode will arrive on January 23rd, having been available as part of <i>Dwarf Fortress</i>' beta branch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/4186734162819864096" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">since April</a> last year.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not aware of Adventure Mode, it's effectively a roguelike-style RPG gameplay mode in which you can explore the worlds you've generated as part of&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress</em>' main colony management gameplay, taking on quests and discovering all manner of exciting things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date-exploration.jpg?itok=yKUTx2CM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date-exploration.jpg?itok=rEgyJLzA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adventure Mode officially lands in&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>on January 23rd.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Adams and Orlando say that focus will shift "back to Fortress Mode very soon", they also promise that Adventure Mode's full release is "not the end" of development for the feature.</p>

<p>Rather, there will be "many updates" for both Fortress Mode and Adventure Mode in future, and the two say there's "more to add" to the roguelike mode as well, so you'll be getting extra features in the months to come.</p>

<p>As well as the Adventure Mode release date announcement, a new&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>beta update has also arrived today. Beta 28 adds tons of new features including new graphics, changes to character creation, and tons of gameplay tweaks.</p>

<p>If you want to read the beta update's full patch notes, then you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/530961267633946651" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so here via Steam</a>. It's well worth checking them out if you want to see some of the super-granular changes Kitfox and Bay 12 have made to the game's beta branch.</p>




<p>If you're somehow not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, it's a colony management sim in which you must oversee a colony of dwarves attempting to survive in a hostile procedurally-generated world.</p>

<p>The game is well-known for its emergent gameplay; the procedural generation and multiple interlocking systems of&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>often allow amusing things to happen, many of which will be unique to each player's playthrough.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>was released all the way back in 2006, but the version being updated today is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-steam-release-date-unleashes-chaos" rel="nofollow">the 2022 paid version</a>, which updates the game's presentation and makes various other quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

If you’re among the new PlayStation VR2 owners, you might feel overwhelmed looking at the over 300 games that are compatible with it. Where should you start?</p><p>There are many gems available via PlayStation VR2, ranging from VR-exclusive games to regular games with immersive VR modes. We could sit here all day listing everything worth playing on the console, but for people who just want to see what Sony’s headset can do, these eight games will offer you some of the best experiences the system has to offer. </p></div></div><div><p>It is literally impossible to make a list of the best VR games without starting with <em>Beat Saber</em>. It is the <em>Wii Sports </em>of VR gaming; it’s easy to learn, hard to master, and is a perfect use of motion-controlled technology. Even those who normally don’t take to VR games can enjoy <em>Beat Saber</em>’s straightforward gameplay, and it’s a surprisingly good workout to boot. I mean, it’s dancing with swords, what’s not to like?</p><p>Alternatively, if you like the idea of <em>Beat Saber </em>but don’t have cash to spend now, <strong>Synth Riders offers a similar rhythm game experience</strong> and is included with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. So if you have Sony’s subscription service and need something to tide you over, be sure to give that game a look.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-call-the-mountain-review-ps5-ps-vr2-forbidden-1850121501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-call-the-mountain-review-ps5-ps-vr2-forbidden-1850121501"><em>Horizon Call Of The Mountain</em></a></span><em> </em>honestly feels like a PlayStation VR2 tech demo, but it’s still really fun to play. As the name suggests, this is more a mountain climbing simulator than a VR-ified version of Sony’s flagship <em>Horizon </em>franchise. However, mountain climbing works <em>very </em>well in VR, especially since you can take in all the beautiful AAA-quality sights and get those tingles in your feet when you look down. I’m deathly afraid of heights and still enjoyed my time with this one.</p><p>It’s not a game that’s worth the standalone price of $60, in my opinion. However, since many Sony PlayStation VR2 headsets currently include this game as a pack-in at no additional cost, you’d be silly to pass it by. I liked it a heck of a lot for free.</p></div><div><p>Look, I get it, not everyone is necessarily chomping at the bit to play racing games unless there are red turtle shells involved. Despite that, you really have to give <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> a try if you’re looking for an immersive VR experience. It’s exhilarating to feel yourself in the driver’s seat as you race at 100+ MPH, and the Dualsense controller makes for a great motion-controlled steering wheel with its haptic feedback.</p><p>There’s never been a better time to try <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstations-gran-turismo-7-is-basically-getting-a-free-1851713486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstations-gran-turismo-7-is-basically-getting-a-free-1851713486">Sony recently released a free VR2-compatible demo of the game called <em>My First Gran Turismo</em></a></span>.

Controlled entirely with your eyes and head movements, <em>Before Your Eyes</em> is both a celebration of life and a somber reflection about how we move forward in the face of tragedy. All I’ll say is that I had to clean the tears off my headset’s lens after I was finished.</p><p>It’s a good experience worth its asking price, but if you can get it for free via PlayStation Plus, this is a no-brainer.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-the-kotaku-review-1830325513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-the-kotaku-review-1830325513"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a></span><em> </em>is already an incredible audio and visual feast for the senses, so you’re doing yourself a disservice if you haven’t played this one in VR.

Especially in this case, because <em>Resident Evil Village </em>actually <em>was</em> designed with a first-person perspective in mind. Key cutscenes will play out in VR, the combat feels simultaneously scary and enthralling, and the interface looks surprisingly natural. I’ve actually never seriously played <em>Resident Evil Village </em>until I tried it in VR, and even people watching me playing asked if the game was VR exclusive. It’s that good!</p><p>I will say the VR mode isn’t a perfect conversion. For example, you can twist your head around during cutscenes and view character models floating around that the player clearly was never meant to see. Still, <em>Resident Evil Village </em>reigns as my favorite experience with the PlayStation VR2, and it’s an incredibly easy recommendation if you want a bonafide adventure in the virtual world. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-devs-reveal-new-parkour-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has just released a new blog post detailing the parkour systems for Assassin’s Creed Shadows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parkour has always been an integral system for every Assassin’s Creed title, and it seems to be a handy tool in Shadows. Parkour will be an excellent feature for exploration and a key tool for stealth and combat. Naoe is the parkour master, and she can quickly scale castles, leap across rooftops and surf the crowds in the streets of Kyoto thanks to her speed and agility. Check out how parkour works in Assassin’s Creed Shadows below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-parkour-inputs-for-assassin-s-creed-shadows-nbsp">New Parkour Inputs for Assassin’s Creed Shadows&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The upcoming game has changed specific inputs to add more mechanics. The crouch and dodge buttons have switched places to add the ability to go prone and let dodge mechanics lead directly to parkour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players will see that dodge and parkour down mechanics have merged thanks to the new input mapping. The new mapping will also disable the stance switch so that you can use any stance when going down from a rooftop. Players will also see new moves with the dodge button, such as acrobatic dodges over railings, jumping out of windows, or new silent drop-downs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-parkour-moves-nbsp">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Parkour Moves&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 id="h-parkour-up">Parkour Up</h3>



<p>Players who have played previous Assassin’s Creed games will know that this mechanic lets players hold a button to scale any building or structure they want, and the same parkour system will make its way to Shadows, too. The mechanic works while running up walls, jumping across gaps and leaping into the void. Naoe is better at jumping further and reaching higher than Yasuke.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-recovery-roll-nbsp">Recovery Roll&nbsp;</h3>



<p>When jumping from a distance, players can use the Igan Recovery Roll by pressing the dodge/parkour down button, considerably softening the blow and reducing the noise.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Parkour Up &amp; Recovery Roll" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/33Yq6RcLE8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-parkour-down">Parkour Down</h3>



<p>Here’s where the new Assassin’s Creed Shadows parkour system comes into play. As dodge and parkour mechanics have blended, players can press dodge near a ledge to transition into a parkour down traversal. Naoe will have acrobatic descents, while Yasuke will have heavy drops. Parkour down will let you access the safest lowest point below your character and avoid the player needlessly jumping into the void.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Dodge to Drop Down" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iZMKe8NZBTI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-sprint-mechanics-nbsp">Sprint Mechanics&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A new system unique to Naoe, the fastest assassin in the franchise, has been introduced. This mechanic allows players to trigger an extended dive roll over smaller objects such as fences, crates, rails, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows also includes two more systems: automated passovers and shoulder tackles. Automated Passovers allow the characters to jump over smaller objects acrobatically. On the other hand, automated shoulder tackle is exclusive to Yasuke, allowing him to bash through enemies or destructive objects while sprinting. If there are non-destructible objects, Yasuke will use automated passover, but it won’t be as clean as Naoe.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Sprint Dodge to Escape" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fm0OssNa4eI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-grappling-mechanics">Grappling Mechanics</h2>



<p>Apart from sprinting and parkour, Assassin’s Creed Shadows players can also access a grappling hook. With this tool, players can perform vertical ascents and hook swings. Naoe can also scale unclimbable walls by wall running and using the grappling hook on a ledge.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Wall Run to Grappling Hook" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/obO-PMO1Tfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-advanced-parkour-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Advanced Parkour in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<h3 id="h-stance-dodges">Stance dodges</h3>



<p>There are three types of stances: standing, crouching, and prone, and each stance has its own way of dodging for Naoe. Yasuke can dodge directionally while standing and crouching; however, only Naoe can dodge directionally while prone. This prone dodge will allow her to move side-to-side, roll forward, or slide backwards.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Prone Assassination" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uTuL0Ob2EnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-wall-run-eject">Wall Run Eject</h3>



<p>Thanks to her acrobatic skills, Naoe can run up any wall. The Wall Eject tool allows her to perform an incredible jump off the wall by pressing the parkour button at the top of the run. If her hands and feet are connected to a surface, Naoe can also use this move while climbing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-parkour-down-backward-dodge-and-high-structure-safety-nbsp">Parkour Down Backward Dodge and High Structure Safety&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Parkour Down Backward Dodge is a new move that allows the character to move while their back is facing the edge. In this position, the player can tap the parkour down button without directional input to cause their character to perform a backward dodge, rolling over the edge and down on the ground with a “muffled landing.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Backward Drop Assassination" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXehGq8UkuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Parkour Down High Structure Safety is a new system that provides safety for the character at heights where fall damage could occur. In this situation, using parkour-down transitions would cause the character to hold on to the edge and hang there. You must press an additional button to make the character drop-down or climb up.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-unclimbable-surfaces">Unclimbable Surfaces</h2>



<p>Lastly, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will have surfaces that Yasuke and Naoe <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4TA6gKaTvtOC1mOjZIxCZd/assassins-creed-shadows-parkour-system-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cannot climb</a> with the help of parkour, as they do not have any physical handholds to grab on. The associate game director, Simon, shared that this move is a big deal for them as they must be “more thoughtful about creating interesting parkour highways.” Additionally, this allows them to have “more control about where Naoe can go and where Yasuke can’t,” adding more contrast to the play style.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the developers have assured that most Assassin’s Creed Shadows areas are “very much climbable,” and even more so with the grappling hook. Players must look for “valid entry points from time to time.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p>AT CES 2025, Microsoft VP of Next Generation Jason Ronald teased a refreshed user experience for Windows handheld gaming PCs: one that could combine the best aspects of its operating system and Xbox. While Windows 11 allows for more choice--users can access Steam, Epic Games Store, and several other marketplaces--it can be a chore to use because it is natively designed for PCs and laptops--not handheld systems with much smaller screens.</p><p>"We've been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it's really about how do we bring those innovations that we've incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space," Ronald said an AMD and Lenovo event (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>). "I would say it's bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together, because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it's really locked to the console. What we're doing is we're really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem."</p><p>Ronald explained that Microsoft aims to bring a console-like experience to handhelds and "make Windows great for gaming" on any device. Microsoft will have more details to share later in the year, Ronald said, adding that the idea is to move away from a Windows desktop setup on handhelds and toward a "gaming-centric" experience.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox chief Phil Spencer has candidly spoken about the idea of a Xbox handheld device for several month, and it has been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-working-on-xbox-handheld-prototypes-report/1100-6522128/" data-ref-id="1100-6522128">Microsoft is currently working on a prototype</a> that is still years away from being released.

                <p>Final Fantasy VII is among the most beloved entries in the series, but could there one day be another film adaptation? Final Fantasy producer Yoshinori Kitase said in an interview recently that, although nothing is "officially planned," he's aware of the game's appeal in Hollywood.</p><p>Kitase told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFpVyK1mOF0&amp;list=PL6131eG2y0-DzWByPNNy2G8sLe2EL12os&amp;index=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Danny Pena</a> that he's "seen and heard about various Hollywood directors and actors playing Final Fantasy VII, and many creators respect the title."</p><p>Kitase added: "I've been hearing things about creators out there who are very interested in the property who love the Final Fantasy 7 universe. And so, yeah, personally, I would love to see something come out of these creators in terms of a cinematic or some kind of visual piece."</p><p>However, he confirmed "no talks have been had" about making Final Fantasy VII into a Hollywood movie.</p><p>Square Enix has already launched a Final Fantasy VII movie, having released the 2005 anime Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Directed by veteran artist Tetsuya Nomura, the straight-to-DVD film takes place a couple years after the events of the game.</p><p>Before this, actor Robert Pattinson said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tenet-stars-robert-pattinson-john-david-washington/1100-6481355/" data-ref-id="1100-6481355">Final Fantasy VII was one of his favorite video games, pointing out how it made him cry</a>.

            <p>
Arcane fans have a five-minute animated treat to enjoy today, in the shape of a new story cinematic released by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> maker Riot Games. 
</p>
<p>
The video is primarily designed to showcase Noxus, the setting for League of Legends' new season which begins tomorrow, and the home of prominent character Mel Medarda.
</p>
<p>
But the video is simultaneously also a continuation of Mel's storyline from Arcane itself, and seems to set up what we may see next in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-cinematic-universe-to-expand-with-three-more-league-of-legends-animated-series">Arcane's upcoming Noxus-based continuation</a>. And if you need further reason to watch, the cinematic was created in partnership with Fortiche, the talented French animation house behind Arcane. Here it is:

<p>
First off, we can tell this is absolutely set after Arcane's second season due to Mel's new golden tattoos she acquires during its storyline. 
</p>
<p>
Here, we also get a proper look at LeBlanc, leader of the Black Rose group, who popped up within Arcane's second season but stayed largely disguised. She's seen here chatting with Vladimir, another League of Legends champion, about some unscrupulous-sounding plans for the Noxian empire.
</p><p>Following the conclusion of Arcane, showrunner Christian Linke confirmed the series would be followed by three additional shows featuring other locations within the League of Legends world. The first, set in Noxus, began production a year ago - and today's cinematic almost feels like a first trailer for that. Other series will then feature the regions of Demacia and Ionia.
</p>
<p>"We're really going wide, we're looking at every region and we really now have the ability to build a slate to tell many more stories - and continue some of them," Linke said previously.</p>
<p>If you haven't watched Arcane yet, it remains one of the best video game adaptations of all time and requires zero prior knowledge regarding League of Legends itself. Its first season is flawless, while its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">second was marred slightly from pacing issues due it cramming so many story threads in</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-film-gets-positive-update-more-than-10-years-after-its-director-was-first-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>10 years after he was first attached to the project, It and The Flash director Andrés Muschietti says he still has plans for Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> film adaptation.</p>
<p>The Shadow of the Colossus film has been, it is fair to say, a long time coming. We first got wind of an adaptation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-in-works">all the way back in 2009</a>, when it was suggested that creator Fumito Ueda would be involved in some capacity. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-developing-shadow-of-the-colossus-movie">Chronicle director Josh Trank then joined the project in 2012</a>, but this still didn't seem to kick the film into any sort of gear. The following year, Sony then hired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-hires-hanna-writer-for-shadow-of-the-colossus-film">Hanna writer Seth Lochhead to pen the script for the adaptation</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014, it was then revealed Trank had left the project to head to a galaxy far, far away instead (nothing sinister, just Star Wars). At this time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-now-helmed-by-mama-director">Muschietti was announced to be taking over the reins from Trank</a>. But, like I said, that was in 2014. So, it has been over a decade since Muschietti was first brought on to direct the still non-existent Shadow of the Colossus film.</p>

</figure>
<p>And yet there is still hope, despite a very long period of absolutely no news whatsoever. Muschietti has now said he still has plans for the adaptation, and there is a script. In a conversation with programme <a href="https://youtu.be/Tugk5mzMHqM?t=2670">"La Baulera del Coso"</a> on Radio TU, Muschietti assured listeners the film was not "an abandoned project by any means" (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-is-alive-and-has-a-script/">TheGamer</a>).</p><p>"I'm not a big gamer, but Shadow of the Colossus seems to me a masterpiece and I played it several times," Muschietti said. "The film has been in development for 10 years and now the possibility of making it is opening up."</p>
<p>Muschietti stated he likes the project's script "very much", but admitted there were still a number of hurdles that needed to be sorted before the film could really get going. Namely, the financial side of things.</p>
<p>"Shadow of the Colossus is a cult game, but to make a good film, there is a studio that puts the numbers and says how much it is worth to give the director $200m, $150m, or $100m," he said. "There are different versions of the film, and obviously, I want them to give me $200m, but this is another factor to take into account."</p>
<p>So, I guess with this update, it is now a case of once again waiting to see if Muschietti gets the funds he hopes for, and then perhaps the Shadow of the Colossus adaptation will finally begin filming.</p>
<p>Shadow of the Colossus is not the only PlayStation IP currently slated for a film release. Just yesterday, the company announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">adaptations of both Helldivers 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn</a>. Meanwhile, its Until Dawn film is set to release this April, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">new cast of characters taking center stage in a brand new story</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first open beta <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">took place in November</a>&nbsp;and was so popular that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke Steam player count records</a> for the series, despite essentially being a playable demo. No wonder Capcom wants to hold a second beta test.</p>

<p>According to Capcom, this second beta is for players who "were unable to participate the first time or simply wish to play again", so if you did miss the first open beta, now's your chance to check it out once more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-second-open-beta-burning-room.jpg?itok=v8VFE1IO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-second-open-beta-burning-room.jpg?itok=c45ccVbn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A second&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta is coming in February.</figcaption></figure><p>As before, the beta will be held across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and it'll take place across two three-day periods. The first starts on February 7th and ends on the 10th, while the second runs between February 14th and 17th.</p>

<p>This second beta will contain all of the content featured in the first test, as well as the chance to take down the returning Gypceros monster, which made its last mainline appearance in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Generations</em>.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to create your character, remake it "as many times as you like", and even design your Palico companion. Naturally, character creation data will also carry over into the full version of the game, and you can use the character you made in the first beta as well.</p>




<p>If you take part in the beta, you can also net yourself some unique rewards for the full game, including a bonus pendant and some extra items.</p>

<p>The second beta period will be held not long before the main game releases;&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is due to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th.

            <p>Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amds-ryzen-9000x3d-processors-with-their-fancy-pants-cache-are-launching-november-7th">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-bets-on-efficiency-with-the-power-sipping-core-ultra-200s-series">Core Ultra</a> chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2025">CES 2025</a> hardware announcements.</p>
<p>No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t bet against the Ryzen 9 9950X3D nabbing the Ryzen 7 9800X3D’s crown as the king of gaming CPUs, though whether it (and the Ryzen 9 9900X3D) are actually worth buying will surely come down to price. The 9800X3D is already a super-duper-premium part, and won’t stop bossing games just because something with 24MB more cache comes along, so it could feasibly remain the one to upgrade to if you don’t do the kind of multitasking or media work that would benefit from the added threads.</p><p>AMD’s new handheld processors, also unveiled at CES, are a more diverse bunch. In addition to the Ryzen Z2 and Ryzen Z2 Extreme – direct replacements for the Z1 chips powering handhelds like the Asus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">ROG Ally</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review">ROG Ally X</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a> – there’s also a Ryzen Z2 Go designed for cheaper portables. It’s this modest, 4 core/8 thread part that forms the brain of the $599 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-lenovo-legion-go-s-the-steamos-handheld-pc-that-isnt-a-steam-deck">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> that also got a CES reveal yesterday.</p>

<p>Curiously, these are a mishmash of various generations of AMD Zen CPU and RDNA graphics tech: the Ryzen Z2 Extreme combines Zen 3 and Zen 5c cores, as well as RDNA 3.5 integrated graphics, while the standard Z2 is built around RDNA 3. The Z2 Go relies on the even older RDNA 2, much like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>’s custom AMD APU, so it’ll be interesting to see how the three compare when actually running games. Just don’t expect that to happen on a new Deck version, as Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lf36y66ggs2b">Bluesky</a> to shut down rumours of a Z2-powered Steam Deck successor.</p>

<p>Also curious was the lack of detail AMD gave their other 'big' announcement, the first RDNA 4 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">GPUs</a>: the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. No specs, price, release window, nada. They exist. That’s your lot. It took a since-deleted Asus post (well caught, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/amd-might-have-told-us-little-about-its-rdna-4-graphics-cards-but-at-least-we-know-the-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-have-16-gb-of-vram/">PCG</a>) to even let slip that they’d come with 16GB of VRAM.</p><p>And yet, this dearth of info didn’t stop AMD from letting our Ziff cousins at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-9070-benchmark">IGN</a> from testing out the RX 9070 on the show floor. In an Extreme-quality <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> benchmark at native 4K, it averaged 99fps, which IGN reckon puts it roughly on par with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review">GeForce RTX 4080 Super</a>. Not bad going, except the latter is being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-1999-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-makes-the-rest-of-the-rtx-50-series-look-suspiciously-sensible">replaced by the RTX 5080</a> at the end of this month, seemingly without significant price bump. As with pretty much of all of AMD’s CES reveals – interesting on paper yet light on performance specifics – we’ll have to wait and see how they do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Though available already in other regions prior to the film's release in December, in the UK the meals will be available from today until 18th February.</p>
<p>The included toy also differs. In the US the meals include a plastic character figure in a rolling wheel, while in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHenBg5IGyg">UK it's fabric balls with character faces</a>.</p>

<p>Those characters are Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Shadow, as well as (<em>slight </em>spoiler!) Super Sonic and Super Shadow.</p>

</span></p><p>Of course, this is far from the first time McDonalds has featured Sonic-themed toys in its Happy Meals.</p>
<p>In 1995 a promotion was launched to celebrate Mega Drive game Sonic the Hedgehog 3 - I distinctly remember never receiving a Sonic toy and instead repeatedly getting a terrible Tails that wouldn't fly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-lenovo-legion-go-s-is-the-first-officially-licensed-third-party-steamos-handheld-cheaper-than-windows-variant/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At CES 2025, we learned that the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-soc-priced-lower-than-legion-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> PC handheld will be the first officially licensed SteamOS-powered device not manufactured by Valve. There has been much speculation about whether and when SteamOS would officially move beyond the Steam Deck, and it's finally happening.</p>
<p>Valve itself&nbsp;<span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the subject in</span> a blog post, explaining that this will be the exact same version of SteamOS available on their own Steam Deck. A team is working to ensure everything will work just as well when the device ships. Moreover, Valve said that this work to support the Lenovo Legion Go S will also improve compatibility with other handhelds. Before this handheld ships on the market, Valve plans to ship a beta version of SteamOS that will improve the experience on other handhelds for users to download and test for themselves. The work will continue after the device's launch, too, as you would expect from Valve.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it seems like the Lenovo Legion Go S will have two variants, one without SteamOS and one with Valve's operating system. The former will be available later this month with the regular Windows, priced at $729.99 initially, although a configuration priced at $599.99 is expected to be available in May. That's also when the SteamOS version of the handheld is due to launch at an even cheaper of $499.99.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Go S Windows Variant</figcaption></figure>
<p>The $729.99 version is the one equipped with the AMD RDNA 3-based Ryzen Z1 Extreme, which likely explains the higher price. The other two versions, either Windows or SteamOS, will feature the Lenovo-exclusive AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor, based on the old RDNA 2 GPU architecture. The price difference between Windows and SteamOS is likely due to licensing fees.</p>
<p>Other than that, the specifications should be the same: 8” WUXGA 16:10 120Hz PureSight touch display with Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support, up to 32GB of 7500Mhz LPDDR5X RAM, 3-cell 55.5Whr battery, two USB 4 ports, a microSD card reader, and WiFi6e support.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-does-the-blank-voucher-do-in-balatro.1076907/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-the-blank-voucher-do-in-balatro/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Balatro’s Blank Voucher is a classic roguelike example of asking players to enter the unknown. The item appears to do nothing, offers zilch to a run, and wants to sap you of precious Store currency. So we’re here to dig into what the Blank Voucher is, what it does, and the real purpose behind its existence.</p>



<p>The beauty of a roguelike gameplay loop is each run differs—some more so than others. Balatro joins this <em>club</em>, shows <em>heart</em>, and is ultimately a <em>diamond </em>in the rough. Its endless array of Jokers and gameplay modifiers are why the indie title is our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-of-2024-best-new-indie-games-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Indie Game of 2024</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Community’s pick</a>.</p>



<p>Curiosity is a big aspect of your first few hours in Balatro. You add cards you don’t know the purpose of, and choose items that seem innocuous now but could be the difference between a failed run and a victory. The Blank Voucher epitomizes these traits, and I’ve got everything you need to know about the expensive Shop voucher.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-blank-voucher-in-balatro">What is the Blank Voucher in Balatro?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So why should I buy it then? Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Blank Voucher is a $10 consumable added to your redeemed Vouchers once you purchase it from Balatro’s midround Shop.</strong></p>



<p>Complete any Small, Big, or Boss Blind in Balatro, and you’re taken to the Shop. You can spend your accumulated money on Jokers, Booster Packs, standalone cards, and Vouchers here. We’re taking a closer look at Vouchers, in particular, the Blank Voucher.</p>



<p>On its own, the Blank Voucher “Does nothing?” and is a little disconcerting as the eye-watering $10 fee could be better spent elsewhere. Balatro has a trick or two up its sleeve though to make the purchase worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-blank-voucher-do-in-balatro">What Does the Blank Voucher do in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>The Blank Voucher on its own has zero effects and offers nothing to a run</strong>, but if you <strong>buy it 10 times</strong> during different playthroughs, <strong>you unlock the Antimatter Voucher.</strong></p>



<p>You need to suffer for 10 runs buying the Blank Voucher knowing it provides no bonuses. It’s a meaningless, stagnant consumable designed to look pretty. Purchase it on 10 unique occasions, and you unlock the Antimatter Voucher.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-buy-blank-voucher-in-balatro">Should You Buy Blank Voucher in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>You should buy the Blank Voucher whenever you get the opportunity—unless you’re struggling on a run—as the Antimatter Voucher is an incredible item.</strong></p>



<p>I can tell you now the <strong>Antimatter Voucher is one of my favorites in the game</strong>. It gives you an <strong>extra, free Joker slot</strong> to use however you wish—with zero consequences. Whereas a Negative Joker gives you an extra slot in exchange for requiring the Negative Joker to remain in your possession, Antimatter is more liberating.</p>



<p>I don’t need to tell you how beneficial this is, but I will anyway. How many runs have you had where an additional Joker could help you beat the Ante 8 Boss Blind? You’ve got a couple of scaling Jokers, a plus-mult Joker, a times-mult Joker, and a Chip-boosting Joker, but the shop is offering another Rare Joker to push your score potential over the edge.</p>



<p>Antimatter gives you a lot more flexibility and firepower to stack Chips on Mults—or add Blind-beating modifiers. <strong>Always buy a Blank Voucher</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<p>Balatro’s addictiveness continues to consume me as the months go by. Are you still enjoying it? Also, what are your favorite Jokers to use?</p>

                <p>It's official: Valve's SteamOS will be available on more platforms soon, and the first handheld PC gaming device to adopt the operating system will be the new Lenovo Legion Go S. At CES 2025, it was revealed that the slim Lenovo unit will run on the Linux-based OS--, the same one used on Valve's Steam Deck.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4424121" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4424121"></a><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Go S</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg"></figure><p>The big draw here is that SteamOS is more intuitive to use and better suited for smaller screens when compared to its Windows 11 counterparts. While you are losing out on the flexibility of being able to load games from multiple storefronts, SteamOS makes up for it by being quick and easy to use thanks to its design. Essentially, if you're looking for a pick-up-and-play handheld gaming PC that isn't a chore to use and you don't mind sticking to Steam, these new Lenovo devices could be perfect for you.</p><p>As for the new Lenovo model, the Legion Go S looks like it'll be a direct competitor to the Steam Deck thanks to several hardware changes. Most notable is that it won't offer Switch-like removable controllers, but it will keep the small trackpad found underneath the face buttons. These handhelds will be flexing some impressive power thanks to the new AMD Z2 Go chip. These will also be equipped with a 120Hz variable-refresh-rate display and customizable levers on the rear.</p><p>Lenovo will launch a $730 model equipped with a Windows OS, a 1TB SSD, and 32GB of RAM first, and another Windows OS version with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for $600 in May. The SteamOS Legion Go S is also planned to launch in May, and while exact hardware specs haven't been confirmed yet, we do know that it'll be priced at $500. Additionally, Valve will support it with SteamOS updates.</p>

            <p>Classic FM is launching a new video game music radio series presented by Minecraft YouTuber DanTDM.</p>
<p>Next Level with DanTDM launches on Saturday 11th January at 9pm for an hour, and will run each week until Easter.</p>
<p>The first episode will focus on legendary soundtracks from games such as The Legend of Zelda, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, The Elder Scrolls, and of course Minecraft.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.classicfm.com/music-news/dantdm-next-level-video-game-music-series/">Classic FM</a> has championed video game music for quite some time, with entries in its Hall of Fame from 2012. It then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-fms-video-game-music-show-is-back-for-a-second-series-in-november">launched High Score in 2017</a>, a radio series presented by BAFTA-award-winning composer Jessica Curry, who also co-founded Everybody's Gone to the Rapture studio The Chinese Room.</p>
<p>It seems clear, though, the radio service is aiming for a younger audience with the hiring of Daniel Middleton, aka DanTDM.</p>
<p>The YouTuber has 29 million subscribers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS5Oz6CHmeoF7vSad0qqXfw">his channel</a>, with more than 20bn views across his online content.</p>
<p>"Teenage me wouldn't be able to believe I have my own radio show!" he said. "Having studied music production at university and then worked in video games for the past 15 years, being given a show that celebrates the meeting of these two worlds feels totally surreal.</p>
<p>"Classic FM is such an iconic station and I'm really grateful and excited to have been given this opportunity."</p> <div>

"We have always championed new forms of classical music, from film scores to gaming soundtracks, so I'm pleased to announce this next chapter in our support of video game music."</p><p>DanTDM has recently been involved with charity work, <a href="https://x.com/dantdm/status/1859288096098898244">donating gaming carts to Great Ormond Street Hospital</a> for Children.

            <p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-us-just-added-worlds-biggest-games-publisher-tencent-to-their-list-of-chinese-military-companies">reported</a> that the US federal government had placed Chinese video game publisher Tencent - owner of League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear and much more besides - on a list of Chinese military companies. The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.</p>
<p>At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.</p><!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf">statement in full</a> is rather robotic, and mostly just fleshes out the spokesperson's previous argument that Tencent is not, in fact, involved with anything military. It further argues that Tencent is not a "military-civil fusion", in response to the US defence department's <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4023145/dod-releases-list-of-chinese-military-companies-in-accordance-with-section-1260/">standing claim</a> that China's armed forces rely on "technology and expertise" provided by Chinese "companies, universities and research programs" that "appear to be civilian entities".</p>
<p>"As the Company is neither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base, it believes that its inclusion in the [Chinese Military Company] List is a mistake," the statement reads. "Unlike other lists maintained by the U.S. Government for sanctions or export control measures, inclusion in the CMC List relates only to U.S. defense procurement, which does not affect the business of the Group."</p><p>The statement also specifies that the "CMC list" - which was introduced under the first Trump presidency, and is known inside the US government as the Section 1260H list - is distinct from another document, the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex List, maintained by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control. The point being that "inclusion in the CMC List will not prohibit any persons (other than the Department of Defense) from business dealings with the Company, including transacting in the securities of the Company".</p>
<p>Tencent are about "to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake", during which they "will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the Company from the CMC List."</p>
<p>If it comes to a lawsuit, Tencent won't be the first Chinese company to go to court over their inclusion on the US federal government's list of "military-civil fusions". As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-adds-tencent-catl-list-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijings-military-2025-01-06/">Reuters</a>, drone maker DJI and Lidar maker Hesai Technologies sued the Pentagon last year over their designations, though they're still on the list for the moment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony's upcoming Until Dawn film adaptation will feature both a new cast of characters and a new story.</p>
<p>This titbit was shared during a presentation at CES by Sony's president of film division Screen Gems Ashley Brucks, who stated that while the film would - clearly - be different in some ways to the original Until Dawn game, it would still respect the series' source material.</p>
<p>"The key to [successfully] adapting these games comes down to one thing: respecting the source material," Brucks said (transcribed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-features-a-new-story-and-cast-of-characters">IGN</a>). "Our close collaboration with PlayStation Productions gives us and our filmmakers the advantage of working directly with the creators of the game."</p>
<p>The Sony exec said it was a "careful balance of trying to identify and incorporate what the fans love about the game and the experience as well as offering something fresh and exciting to entice newcomers".</p>
<p>"In adapting Until Dawn, filmmaker David F. Sandberg, who is a big fan of the widely acclaimed game, took the essence of what makes the game great and selected elements we think are the most important to the fans and paid homage to it in the right way," Brucks continued. "We then built out Until Dawn's universe, using the core premise of a group of friends who encounter a variety of terrifying threats to tell a new story that is truly visceral and horrifying."</p>

<p>Actor Peter Stromare, who is said to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-sees-peter-stormare-reprise-his-role-as-dr-hill">reprising his role as psychiatrist Dr Hill in Until Dawn's adaptation (so, perhaps there is at least one returning character after all)</a>, added the film will "honour the spirit of the game".</p><p>"I have been lucky to be part of Until Dawn since the original, incredible, super terrifying game, and what's why I'm so excited to be part of this film, because the whole thing is a love letter to horror, and it completely honours the spirit of the game," Stormare said.</p>
<p>"The movie is going to be full of fresh characters and victims in a brand new story loaded with twists, so whether you're a longtime fan or discovering it for the first time, get ready for Until Dawn like you've never seen it before."</p>
<p>The Until Dawn film is set to arrive later this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-horror-until-dawns-live-action-movie-adaptation-arrives-next-april">on 25th April</a>.</p>
<p>As for the game itself, the recently released PS5 remake introduced a new ending for Until Dawn, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel">which hints towards a sequel</a> (please be aware of story spoilers for Until Dawn if you follow the link).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Games available on the Xbox Game Pass can expect to lose around 80% of their expected premium sales on Xbox consoles, although being available as part of the subscription can be beneficial for some of them.</p>
<p>Speaking during a Q&amp;A session hosted on the <a href="https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/news-publisher/industry-q-a-christopher-dring-answers-your-questions.37/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Install Base forums</a>, former head of GamesIndustry.biz Chris Dring revealed some interesting tidbits on sales of games available on Xbox Game Pass, saying that any game can expect to lose around 80% of its expected premium sales on Xbox, less if it is a big mainstream release. How low Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, and even Starfield have charted makes it clear how Game Pass hurt the sales of these games on Xbox consoles. Being available on Xbox Game Pass, however, can also be beneficial for multiplatform games, as a surge of players on Xbox can have a strong impact on sales on PlayStation.</p>
<p>While a game being available as part of the Xbox Game Pass library can lead to lost sales, it can also make it easier for developers to get people to try out their game. Chris Dring highlighted that, from data, it is known that a lot of people only play the Call of Duty series, and if some of them got the game via the Xbox Game Pass this year, they might have tried another game available on the subscription service they may otherwise never have played. Unfortunately, this may be a best-case scenario, as the limited growth of subscription services and the existence of big free games that are hundreds of hours long makes it unlikely.</p>
<p>While Microsoft never made it clear, it's evident from the company's marketing messaging and some of its latest decisions, such as the first major changes introduced to the service <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">last year </a>since its launch, that the Xbox Game Pass is impacting their console business. According to well-known analyst Mat Piscatella, the company's approach to its subscription service needs to be balanced with its other services, and the aforementioned changes introduced last year suggest that this is what Microsoft is attempting to do. Balancing the service and further expanding on other systems, according to the analyst, could make Xbox's future <a href="https://wccftech.com/analyst-reckons-xbox-has-a-bright-future-according-to-sales-data/">bright.</a></p>
