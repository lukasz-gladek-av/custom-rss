            <p>
Right, has everyone got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> out of their system? I'm sure there's plenty of you that have scoured enough of its map to feel satisfied and ready for another hand-drawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>. Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/constance">Constance</a>! A game that fits that bill precisely, albeit with its own, quite literally painterly flair, one which is out today.
</p>
<p>
Constance, as you may have gathered from looking at it, is the game's titular hero, one who wields a big ole paintbrush. To say this game is one that takes some cues from Celeste would probably also be apt, as Constance's main foe is, dun-dun-dun, herself. Or, well, her unconscious inner demons, that have imprisoned her within her own mind. These demons appear to manifest in a myriad of ways, such as evil robots, or sentient candles, or straight up bits of paper.
</p>
<p>
Those mental-health focused Celeste inspirations appear to translate to the game's movement puzzles a touch as well, as you do a lot of dashing around avoiding dangerous obstacles and the like. Of course platforming is a big element of many 2D metroidvanias, there's just an element of precise timing here that looks reminiscent of how Celeste functions.
</p>
<p>
I quite like the sound of the narrative framework around upgrades. This is a game about creativity, so you can find "inspirations" along the way to sketch in your journal, which then can improve Constance's abilities. There's just something quite nice, conceptually anyway, about the idea of going out into the world and taking in what it offers you to better yourself in some shape or form.
</p>
<p>
It's cheap as chips too with a 10% launch discount, so as I said, if you're ready for a new metroidvania in your life, Constance is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2313700/Constance/">ready and waiting for you on Steam</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-kicks-off-black-friday-week-with-an-all-time-low-price-on-the-m5-ipad-pro-2000646585</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-goes-margin-blind-with-the-m5-ipad-pro-as-black-friday-brings-an-unprecedented-drop-for-its-newly-released-tablet.1363039/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Picking up the M5 iPad Pro for the first time should come with a wary bystander asking, “are you sure you can handle this thing,” as if you were sliding into the driver’s seat of an F1 race car. The amount of power under the hood of the newest iPad Pro is&nbsp;<em>that</em> significant, and with Black Friday week kicking off, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/">Amazon is handing you the keys to the 13-inch version with a first-ever $100 price drop to $1,195.</a></p>
<p>Fortunately, learning how to harness all of the crazy amount of power and features of the M5 iPad Pro won’t end with you pancaked into a wall. If anything, you won’t be able to put it down once you see just what the upgrade to the M5 chip — the very same one found in the newest MacBooks — has done for the iPad Pro. Everything from editing 4K video, precision art creation, and heavy-duty gaming is now firmly on the table.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Than Enough</h2>
<p>The best reviews on iPads or any tablets has always been that they’re “good enough” to take on visually challenging or work-intensive tasks normally done by laptops or desktops. The M5 iPad Pro isn’t merely “good enough” to be your primary device for streaming, photo editing, content creation, number-crunching, or anything else — it handles them all as easily as virtually any laptop.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the M5 iPad Pro falls in line with pretty much every iPad ever made by having an industry-best display. The 13-inch screen is a Liquid Retina XDR thing of beauty, and it’s not going to lag or glitch out on you while you stream or edit videos or play an action game, thanks to the GPU built into the M5 chip.</p>
<p>Take a deeper dive into the Apple ecosystem by adding the Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard folio (both sold separately) and you have a truly formidable touchscreen laptop, but one that runs the clean, silky-smooth iPadOS 26, updated with Liquid Glass design, helpful widgets and improved interaction with the Apple Pencil.</p>



<h2>Best iPad Ever?</h2>
<p>Need more power? Take Apple Intelligence out for a spin to help you create and execute pro-level workflows, and the iPad Pro’s Neural Accelerators will have them up and running in no time. Browsing or streaming speed? This iPad Pro can run Wi-Fi 7 with Apple’s brand-new N1 chip to deliver stunning online speed. The landscape 12MP front camera and 12MP rear camera are top notch, and when you combine them with the elite-level built-in mics and speakers, your FaceTime calls and videoconferencing will be the best ever delivered by any iPad. There’s also a USB-C port that lets you connect to an external Thunderbolt or USB 4 monitor.</p>
<p>Call it a race car, a thoroughbred, a rocket, or any other analogy you want, and the M5 iPad Pro lives up to it. Simply put, it’s Apple’s best and by&nbsp;<em>far</em> most powerful tablet yet, and it should be at the very top of the Black Friday list for anyone who wants it all when it comes to portable smart-device power. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/">Hit Amazon now and grab the 13-inch M5 iPad Pro while it’s at an all-time low price of $1,195.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-players-please-capture-control-points-2000646929</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Later this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-free-week-star-wars-fan-film-exodus-leaks-bf6-2000646871#:~:text=Battlefield%206%E2%80%B2,royale%20spin%2Doff."><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s conquest mode and some of its maps</a> will be free to play across all platforms. That means an influx of new players. So now seems like a good time to ask everyone, even the people already playing EA’s blockbuster online FPS, to please capture control points in Conquest. Please. I’m begging you.</p> <p>I’ve been playing a lot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em> since it launched in October</a>. And I’ve had a great time with it. The FPS is easily my favorite <em>Battlefield</em> in a few years and will likely be a game I return to a lot in 2026. But whenever I play Conquest, <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Conquest">the franchise’s iconic mode</a> that’s been around since the OG <em>Battlefield 1942</em>, I get frustrated by how many players seem not to understand the point of the mode. That point being: Capture control points, hold and defend them, and if needed, take them back from the enemy. Hold more points, and your team will win faster. Let them control the battlefield, and you’ll lose just as quickly.</p>

 <p>Sounds simple enough, yet I’ve lost a Conquest match and skimmed the scoreboard afterward countless times, just to spot half or more of my team with zero captures.</p>  <p>Now, I understand that some people are sniping and aren’t capping points. Fine. And some are using tanks and aircraft to support the team and won’t have as many captures as some other players or me. I get that, too. My problem is that so many players who aren’t sniping or using tanks seem to just… not take control points.</p>

 <p>I’ve watched players run into the first control point at the start of a match and capture it, then just run around the next one, never going in to cap it or help their team hold it. These aren’t snipers either, but support or assault players. Other times, I see people run to an enemy base, help fight and clear it, and then leave when it’s neutralized but not fully capped. Or some players will cap a base and then never leave it.</p> <p>I don’t care if you only get three kills. I don’t care if you a dozen times. As long as you are helping our team cap points, push forward when it makes sense, and fall back when needed to defend, I’ll be happy. And you’ll likely get more XP and be higher up on the scoreboard, too, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-review-good-eastwood-big-large-ps5-pc-2000645547"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> greatly rewards teamplay and objective support over kills. So help your team win, get to the top of the leaderboard, and have a fun time by capturing control points in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, okay? Please.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-decided-money-doesnt-matter-q10-s5-robot-vacuum-drops-50-off-with-10000pa-suction-2000646915</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-decided-money-doesn%E2%80%99t-matter-q10-s5-robot-vacuum-drops-50-off-with-10-000pa-suction.1363030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock has become the premium brand in robot vacuums with their latest flagships such as <em>Qrevo CurvX</em>&nbsp;and <em>Saros 10R</em>&nbsp;crossing the $1,000 threshold even with Black Friday discounts. But here’s the thing: t<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/">he Roborock Q5 S10+ is currently sitting at an all-time low of $259 on Amazon, down from its original $549 price tag</a>, and it’s flying off the shelves. This model packs serious technology into a mid-range package – think <strong>10,000Pa suction power, a self-emptying station that holds 70 days worth of debris, and a sonic mopping system that scrubs 3,000 times per minute</strong>. The kind of deal that makes you wonder if someone in Roborock’s pricing department made a mistake.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Vacuum Cleaner</h2>
<p>First of all, the 10,000Pa suction power puts this vacuum in the <strong>same league as models costing twice as much</strong>. That level of suction pulls embedded pet hair out of carpet fibers, grabs crumbs from hardwood floor crevices, and handles the kind of everyday mess that accumulates a lot quicker than you’d like to admit. The HyperForce technology behind this suction isn’t just a marketing term: it’s the difference between a robot that pushes debris around and one that actually removes it.</p>
<p>The self-emptying station completely changes the way you interact with the vacuum. You are looking at a 2.7L dust bag, able to hold up to 70 days of dirt and debris, which essentially means that you can forget about emptying for over two months. This is where pet owners will appreciate it more than anyone because pet hair fills up the standard robot vacuum bins in a matter of days. The <strong>station will automatically empty the robot after each cleaning session</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll never need to deal with those pesky clouds of dust or tangled hair when manually emptying a bin.</p>



<p>The <strong>VibraRise 2.0 mopping system</strong> is where this vacuum starts to feel like a premium product. Dual-zone sonic vibration scrubs floors up to 3,000 times per minute, which is enough force to handle dried spills and stuck-on messes that regular robot mops just smear around. The mopping module automatically lifts 8mm when it detects carpet, so you’re not dealing with wet carpets or having to manually remove mop pads before running a cleaning cycle. You can adjust mopping intensity through the app depending on how dirty your floors are, giving you control without requiring manual intervention.</p>
<p>The smart carpet detection uses ultrasonic technology to identify when the vacuum moves onto carpet from hard floors. Detecting carpet, it lifts the mopping modules and automatically increases suction power for a deeper cleaning. This dual response ensures that the carpets get the aggressive cleaning they require while protecting them from water damage. It’s reliable enough that you can run cleaning cycles while away from home with no fear of returning to soaked rugs.</p>



<p>Navigation on this vacuum relies on PreciSense LiDAR technology which scans 360° to create detailed maps of your home. The system supports multi-level mapping, meaning if you have a two-story house, the vacuum remembers the layout of both floors and can plan efficient cleaning routes for each level. With ReactiveTech obstacle avoidance, structured light technology is used to detect objects in real time and navigate around them, meaning fewer situations where it gets stuck and more complete cleaning coverage without needing to pre-clean before the robot vacuum cleans.</p>
<p>At $259, this vacuum delivers technology that was reserved for $500+ models just a couple of years ago. Roborock’s reputation for build quality means you’re not sacrificing reliability to hit this price point, and the fact that it’s selling in huge volumes on Amazon suggests plenty of people have figured out this is an unusually good value.</p>

<p>The 2025 holiday shopping season is in full swing, and Nintendo is dropping a host of discounts to help players secure some last-minute deals and gifts.</p>



<p>Whether you’re looking to pull the trigger on a Nintendo Switch 2, are looking to add to your library of games, or are on the hunt for accessories, Nintendo has plenty of deals to cover all bases.</p>



<p>To help with your shopping spree, Insider Gaming has collected the best Nintendo Black Friday deals for 2025. Make sure to leave a comment if something catches your eye, and join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a> to share deals you’ve found with other players to take advantage of.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-do-the-nintendo-black-friday-deals-start">When Do The Nintendo Black Friday Deals Start?</h2>



<p>Nintendo’s holiday gift guide went live well in advance of Black Friday, on November 10, with the main Cyber Deals kicking off on November 20 and running through to December 3 at 11:59 PM PT.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-nintendo-deals-for-black-friday-and-the-2025-holidays">Best Nintendo Deals For Black Friday and the 2025 Holidays</h2>



<h3 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-console-deals">Nintendo Switch 2 Console Deals</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch 2 console has not received any fresh price drops directly from Nintendo for the holiday season, though you can still take advantage of the bundle deals with Mario Kart World &amp; Pokémon Legends: Z-A that save $20-30 compared to purchasing separately. However, retailers may offer additional incentives on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, though this is unlikely to be a price slash, and may instead include extra accessories or bundle deals.</p>







<h3 id="h-nintendo-switch-accessories">Nintendo Switch Accessories</h3>



<p>Similar to the Switch 2 consoles, Nintendo hasn’t issued any direct deals for accessories for the original Switch and Switch 2, so the best course of action for savings on these will likely be heading to other retailers. However, even they are unlikely to drop prices significantly for Switch 2 accessories like Joy-Con controllers and the Camera. </p>

<p>If you’re looking to expand your games library on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 this holiday, the good news is that this is where you will find the majority of savings, particularly during the Cyber Deals event running until December 3.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday deals</a> get messy fast, especially in the games world. Retailers love to hurl half-baked offers around in the run-up to what I like to call "Black Friday proper," the day after Thanksgiving. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are some genuinely good deals already available, it can still get a little tricky to work out what is actually worth your time, especially if you're on a limited budget.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's where I'm here to help. Sure, there are plenty of strong 2025 releases on offer, with big <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-best-games-already-on-sale-black-friday-2025">PS5</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Nintendo Switch</a> titles in the mix, but the real gold right now is the slew of games sitting at 20 dollars or less at retailers like Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That slice of the sale is stacked with some genuine heavy hitters from across the current generation's almost five-year life cycle. If you want actual bargains, this is the bin worth digging through.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Elden Ring</h2><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231670"><div id="231670" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Horizon Forbidden West</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, slightly overshadowed by Elden Ring (sorry, Guerilla Games). <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-review">Horizon Forbidden West</a> is another <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/79775" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100-hour plus game</a> that is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-is-down-to-its-lowest-ever-price-at-amazon-ahead-of-black-friday">absolute bargain for $19.99 on PS5</a>. Yes, it's also on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/playstation-plus-premium-tier-games">PlayStation Plus</a> if you're signed up. But do you remember the feeling of owning games? Like actual physical copies? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My advice? Pick this up for 20 bucks, and never have to worry about your PS Plus sub lapsing if you want to replay it, or perhaps spend more than a month getting through it (which is likely, this one is <em>big). </em>If you can stretch to $30, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8dO3?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">complete edition is also on sale</a>, and includes the games entire DLC collection as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Star Wars Outlaws</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231671"><div id="231671" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, here's one that might take a little more convicing. But, trust me, even a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">7/10 game</a> can be worth $20. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's another fairly sizable entry into this list as well, and I truely think there's a lot of fun to be had with Outlaws. Sure, it's got a bad rep, but for 20 big ones, you're actually getting <em>so </em>much genuinely great Star Wars content, it's no joke.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If anything, I really think it's worth a go for anyone who was ever on the fence about buying it. Dropping this down to just $20 for both PS5 and Xbox is a great deal, and it's also <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxx28O?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$39.99 for the complete Gold Edition on Switch 2</a> right now as well (but again I'm breaking the rules by mentioning that, woops).</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 2 + 3 + 7</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231672"><div id="231672" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey, look at me, cheating at my own game again. Yeah it's supposed to just be 10 games in this list, but I'm having some fun with it, sue me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's our first picks that are hitting the "or less" part of the article, and no $19.99 doesn't count, that's just $20, so don't start on me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three brilliant Resident Evil games for just $14.99 each, now that's hard to argue with. In my opinion, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/22/resident-evil-2-review">Resident Evil 2's remake on PS5</a> is the best of the bunch, but there's still <em>a lot </em>of<em> </em>fun to be had with the RE3 remake, and Resi 7 as well. </p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrAeN?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 2<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$14.99</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2Bpx?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 3<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$14.90</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QdpWqv?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 7: Gold Edition<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$14.99</span></li></ul></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Armored Core 6</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231675"><div id="231675" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay here's where I've got to start admitting when I haven't played some games.

It’s let down by a dull story, but lands direct hits where it counts."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade + Final Fantasy 16</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231676"><div id="231676" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh no, I haven't played these either. Again, cheating with the entry double ups, but it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-episode-intermission-dlc-review">Final Fantasy</a>! What, am I just gonna dedicate three slots of Resident Evil, and two more to Final Fantasy, that's half the article? ... and I haven't even played these two either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, look, look, put the pitch forks away. I've never <em>been</em> a Final Fantasy kind of guy, and that's okay, I can still trust in the many, many friends and collegues who tell me these games rock. For $20 each for FF7 and FF16, I definitely think it's worth it, even for how little I know.</p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/akwdeg?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy 16<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$19.93</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8D24?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$19.99</span></li></ul></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Red Dead Redemption 2 for $14.99</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231678"><div id="231678" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Red Dead Redemption 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey, I've played this one! It's great, we all love Red Dead Redemption 2, even if it is still stuck at 30fps. Another banger from Rockstar, and another game you can drop over <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/27100" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100 hours in</a>, no questions asked. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for another brilliant game to sink your teeth into while we wait for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> (which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">just got delayed again</a>, ouch), then this is a pretty solid pick for just $15. It's discounted at GameStop for a physical copy, or both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">PlayStation</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Xbox</a> have it for the same price digitally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I loved my time with it, and was even considering a cheeky replay over the holidays as well. IGN's Luke Reilly also awarded it a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review">10 in his review from 2018</a>... seven years ago!

At $20, that sounds pretty great to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, not every game in this article has to be certified 10/10 banger like RDR2 or Elden Ring, sometimes it's also nice to spend a reasonable low amount of money on games that are just plain, simple, fun. And Mortal Kombat 1 is exactly that: fun!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Shin Megami Tensei V</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231681"><div id="231681" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Shin Megami Tensei V</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I really should've put more games in that I've actually played. What is that, like four now? Yeesh, that's kinda rough. Okay, so at least ign.com's 7/10 review team can back me up again with this one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leana Hafer reviewed this one, and awarded it a very respectable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-v-review">8 in her review back in 2022</a>, stating: "Shin Megami Tensei V's excellent JRPG combat and deeply rewarding customization shine bright, even when it sometimes feels like Persona without the heart."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sounds pretty good to me, maybe I should actually start checking out some more JRPGs. In any case, this is down to just <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXVGmy?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$17.99 at Amazon</a> for PS5, Xbox, and Switch, and that's a certifiably great deal.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tekken 8</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231680"><div id="231680" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tekken 8</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Final game that's worth picking up for $20 or less! It's Tekken 8! No, I haven't played this one, either! Yes, I've heard it's very, very good! Listen, I spend way too much time just playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a> on my Steam Deck, and maybe I should find more time to play fighting games. Okay look, I promise I'll buy it and give it a go over Christmas. Happy?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ronny Barrier reviewed this one for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-review">IGN, awarding it a fantastic 9/10</a>, and stated: "Tekken 8 is an incredible evolution for the series, with tons of single player content, an excellent suite of training tools, a great online experience, and exciting new mechanics that make Tekken more dynamic than ever."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Honorable Mentions</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Some quick honorable mentions for under $20 bangers before I start badgering on about some more spenny games: <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrZGe?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LEGO 2K Drive is just $15</a>, and so is <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6DpO7?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4pMl?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mario + Rabbids Dual Pack for Switch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, anyway, like I said near the start of the article, there's actually <em>loads </em>more great games in the sales, and plenty I couldn't include (even with me already breaking the rules a few times). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're budget is more in the $30-$40 range, then I can recommend plenty of other top titles, like one of my favorites of the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-dropped-to-its-lowest-price-yet-at-amazon-for-black-friday">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 for $30</a>, or 2024's Game of the Year winner, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-is-one-of-the-best-ps5-games-and-its-33-cheaper-at-amazon-for-black-friday">Astro Bot, for $39.99</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my other top picks from 2024 is also just $25 in the sales, for both PS5 and Switch 2, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRMAlO?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a>. This is well worth it simply for the new Shadow levels alone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, some of the best Nintendo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-best-games-already-on-sale-black-friday-2025">Switch games are also down to just $30</a> right now as well, such as the all time great, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-odyssey-black-friday-deal-2025">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's all she wrote! Well, apart from this bit. And then this bit as well... and the rest of everything I'm going to write now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Good job getting to the end of this article and my non-sensicle ramblings about 13 cheap games I may or may not have played (also in an article that's meant to be limited to just 10). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right, that's me actually done now, if you pick up anything good over Black Friday, or just want to tell me how much of a fool I am, let me know in the comments ASAP.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">That's an insane price drop.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo thankfully isn't dropping <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/Amiibo_Unlockables,_Rewards,_and_Functionality">amiibo support for Switch 2</a>, and right now that matters because some of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp48gw?object_uuid=16df76a2-6333-46d8-b01c-17eaeaa1545c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">best Zelda figures have quietly crashed to just $9.99</a> ahead of Black Friday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sidon, Riju, Tulin, and Yunobo are all heavily discounted as the Nintendo Black Friday sale kicks off today, and honestly, deals this aggressive usually disappear fast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-sale-2025-early-deals">Amazon</a> has dropped Riju and Sidon to $9.99, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-2025-black-friday-sale-is-now-live-updated">Best Buy</a> has matched that price on <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5Xeq8?object_uuid=16df76a2-6333-46d8-b01c-17eaeaa1545c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tulin and Yunobo</a>. Street Fighter amiibo are also discounted for Black Friday, sitting at <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5Xeq8?object_uuid=16df76a2-6333-46d8-b01c-17eaeaa1545c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$14.99 at Best Buy</a>, if that's also of interest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of these was supposedly only meant to get a $10 cut for Black Friday, so either the retailers blinked or someone mispriced them. Either way, grab all of these before the correction hits, because this will not last. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each figure launched at $29.99, so seeing them down to $9.99 means you're saving 66% and shaving $20 off every amiibo. That's even stronger than the midyear sale, when they bottomed out between $14.99 and $19.99 at Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you're wondering what they actually do in-game, all four of the Zelda figures unlock content in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. All of which will be compatible with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/ACNH_3.0_Update_and_Switch_2_Edition:_All_Details_and_Everything_New">Animal Crossing 3.0 update</a> in January 2026, as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the Zelda figures, tap any of them via NFC while playing Tears of the Kingdom and you'll get exclusive paraglider fabric options, extra materials, and a weapon or rare item. Being part of the Zelda line also means they can unlock bonuses elsewhere. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening includes amiibo-exclusive Chamber Dungeons, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe gives you a new Mii racing suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on Switch 2 with the upgrade pack, you're getting a much smoother ride. The update bumps up frame rate and resolution, cleaning up the original's only real flaw, its performance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update">Tom Marks put it in his review update</a>, ”This [Switch 2 upgrade] really does feel like the way this game was always meant to be played, and I’m thrilled by the idea of a new generation discovering it for the first time.” Hard to disagree.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Switch 2 Black Friday Deals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

Even still, the GSD numbers indicate that Black Ops 7 was still the top-selling game in Europe during its opening week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>For a very long time, the possibility of the long-anticipated Half-Life 3 was nothing more than an illusion, but in the past few months, evidence piled up regarding a new project codenamed HLX, which could actually be the game that most fans of the series lost hope in.</p>



<p>Although Half-Life 3 has yet to be officially announced, we already have some information on how the game might play. For some time, dataminers have taken a close look at every update made to the Source 2 engine, which powers Valve's currently supported games, such as Counter-Strike 2, and have discovered <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-final-development/">a wealth of information related to the gameplay mechanics that will power the project codenamed HLX.</a></p>



<p>In case you haven't followed all the leaks, some dedicated users have <span><a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJnkh8Q4=/" target="_blank">created a board on Miro</a>&nbsp;that compiles</span> all the known information regarding the yet-to-be-announced Half-Life 3, providing an excellent overview of the game's core mechanics and engine features.</p>



<h2 id="h-core-gameplay-and-player-systems">Core Gameplay and Player Systems</h2>



<p>At its core, Half-Life 3 will provide an immersive experience, featuring core gameplay mechanics centered on unique environmental interactions through fire and heat conductivity mechanics, as well as a granular weapons system with a physics engine that determines how projectiles interact with the environment. Vehicles will also be return from Half-Life 2, with simulation features that focus on realistic low-level wheel and suspension physics and mechanics that will handle passengers, FOV changes depending on speed and more.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Key Elements</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Fire and Heat Conductivity</strong></td><td>Highly detailed simulation for tracking heat transfer, focusing on how different materials and the player react to fire and heat sources.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weapons</strong></td><td>Granular system covering multiple fire modes, attachments, and the specific rules defining how projectiles interact with deformable physics.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Vehicles</strong></td><td>Realistic handling and movement based on simulation of Wheel Dynamics, including tire friction, suspension, and responsive damage tracking.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-physics-fluids-and-other-environmental-interactions">Physics, Fluids and Other Environmental Interactions</h2>



<p>The Gravity Gun will play a significant role in Half-Life 3's environmental interactions, powered by a physics system that handles complex object manipulation with high precision. Another core element of the game's environmental interactions will be represented by the simulation of multiple liquid types, as well as their interactions with the environment and the player. A complex physics system will also handle character ragdoll behavior and the destruction of environmental objects. Additionally, advanced world manipulation via precise physics adjustments and the ability to alter the gravity of specific locations will provide an even more immersive experience, offering numerous gameplay possibilities.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Features</th><th>Key Elements</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Gravity Gun</strong></td><td>Dedicated, complex system for lifting, manipulating, and launching objects with high precision. Essential for core physics-based puzzles and combat.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ragdoll &amp; Destruction</strong></td><td>Advanced, physics-driven death animations and object shattering. Focuses on granular, realistic destruction of large props and entities.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Water / Liquids</strong></td><td>Simulation of diverse fluid types (acid, oil, water) and their unique physical interactions, visual effects, and environmental consequences.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Deformable Physics</strong></td><td>Implementation of objects capable of bending, denting, or deforming under stress and force, adding realism.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Track/Train Changes</strong></td><td>Specific engine modifications to handle the physics, tracking, and switching of large moving platforms, trains, and interactive machinery.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gravity Shifting</strong></td><td>Core system for modifying local or global gravity vectors, used for complex puzzle design and unique gameplay scenarios.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>BasePhys Adjustments</strong></td><td>Low-level customization layer for the base physics engine parameters, allowing precise tuning of collision, friction, and mass for every object type.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-core-engine-features">Core Engine Features</h2>



<p>The Half-Life 3 gameplay mechanics will be further compounded with some of the core engine features. Chief among them will be an enhanced audio experience with positional sound systems that provide accurate 3D audio implementation, augmenting stealth gameplay mechanics. This will enable NPCs to detect player noise and react accordingly.</p>



<p>The supposed complexity of the game's world will be compounded by the SpatialOctree data partitioning structure, which will organize every visual element to deliver highly optimized interactions between a multitude of in-game elements. A G2 Generation system will also be introduced, enabling the rapid creation of levels and areas. Further enhancing the world's immersion will be a save system that manages data persistence across maps and more.</p>

<p>Although the Half-Life 3 gameplay features promise to be the main focus of the experience, the next entry in the series is also set to feature some great visuals featuring a realistic global illumination and shadow mapping systems alongside necessary optimization tweaks that will ensure that models and effects not currently on screen are not drawn, and an LOD and AI system that will manage the level of detail of distant objects depending on the distance from the player.</p>

<p>As all of this information has been datamined, there's the chance some of these features may not make it into the final version of Half-Life 3. Still, they paint a very exciting picture for a game whose release may be a hallmark for reasons other than its now legendary status. Hopefully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization-trailer-prepared/">it really won't take much longer </a>to learn everything about the game directly from Valve itself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TvWNFBBwuY">People Make Games</a>, the investigative journalists and documentarians who have recently been doing boots-on-the-ground coverage of Rockstar's firing of 34 union members and accusations of union busting, seems to have discovered the messages behind Rockstar's claim that the fired employees were discussing confidential information in a public forum.</p>



<p>To quickly catch you up if you've not been following this story, on November 1, Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">was accused of union-busting when it fired 34 employees between Rockstar North and its Rockstar Toronto offices</a>. Five days later, Rockstar followed up by denying it was union-busting, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/">claiming that the employees were fired for "<em>gross misconduct</em>," </a>and cited that misconduct to be "<em>distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum</em>."</p>



<p>As the IWGB held its ground, continuing to claim that Rockstar was union-busting, an anonymous <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/">employee took to GTAForums to fire back at their company's claims</a>. They alleged that this was nothing more than union-busting and said that Rockstar was trying to claim that a Discord server that only included Rockstar employees and IWGB members was a 'public forum' and pin the discussion of company policy changes as confidential information that was publicly shared.</p>



<p>The IWGB followed up <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">with two legal claims against Rockstar</a>, over <a href="https://wccftech.com/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-vicious-union-busting/">200 Rockstar employees signed a letter to management in support of the fired employees</a>, and protests have taken place outside of the Rockstar offices in Edinburgh, London, and Paris, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">calling for the reinstatement of the fired employees</a>.</p>



<p>Now, People Make Games' latest report seems to not only corroborate what the anonymous employee shared on GTAForums, but also provides a more specific account of the messages that are likely the ones Take-Two and Rockstar are using as the reason for the firings.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Messages Rockstar Saw Before Firing 34 Union Members" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8TvWNFBBwuY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to information shared with People Make Games by a Rockstar employee who is not a union member, the messages that the company is likely calling "<em>gross misconduct</em>" and the "<em></em><em>distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum</em>" are employees sharing changes to the company's internal Slack policies in the aforementioned union-focused, employee-only Discord server.</p>



<p>The Slack policy changes reportedly came in October, which included the removal of miscellaneous channels, meaning that employees now had no place within the company's internal communications to discuss any non-work-related topics. Discussing what was dubbed "<em>The Slack Purge</em>" in a Discord server that had been around since 2022, with the intention of it being a place for union members to discuss working conditions, is the exact kind of thing that, in the eyes of the IWGB, is protected under UK law.</p>



<p>These weren't employees sharing the latest information about Grand Theft Auto VI in a public Discord server that anyone can join. It was employees talking about their working conditions in a private Discord server that was set up for employees to talk about their working conditions, and is only accessible to IWGB members and Rockstar employees who had verified their identity.</p>



<p>Now, because Discord is not the company's chosen internal communication platform, and because the policies were discussed and shared in the server, it could potentially hold up in court that the employees were sharing company information in a 'public forum.' That'll be for a judge to decide, depending on how far this case goes. Still, it's clear that this wasn't a case of the company cracking down on leaks as we move closer to GTA VI's launch.</p>

            <p>Arkane Lyon level designer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thief-the-dark-project">Thief: The Dark Project</a> modder Romain Barrilliot is back with another fan creation - a Thief 2 castle heist Barrilliot calls "by far my most ambitious work in the Dark Engine to date", presumably including his previous group project The Black Parade, despite being "purely based on vibes". Called Reflections In Red, it's a sequel to Barrilliot's <a href="https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=152800">Winds Of Misfortune</a>, though it works well as a standalone release. It's also based on a real-life castle so preposterous I have no choice but to immediately steal the deeds from what I assume is a heavily fortified bank vault inside a creepy mountain somewhere.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Reflections In Red has no bank vaults, nor creepy mountains, just majestic amphibious architecture. It sees light-fingered snarkyman Garrett heading to a manor built over a lake on the outskirts of Wychwood. He's here to pinch a recipe for some posh wine, by any means necessary. "Swim, sneak, or climb, the choice is mine," explains the intro, below. "Front gate's a death trap. Guards in plate, a captain and two sergeants keeping watch. The lord hates electricity, sticks to torches and gaslight. Perfect for someone like me. A few water arrows should do the trick."

<p>Long story short, it's a mansion raid with many points of entry and superb production values, inside and outside. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skacky.bsky.social/post/3m5yxqa73ds24">Posting on Bluesky</a>, Barrilliot concedes that it followed "a very unusual development cycle" and "wasn't even supposed to be a real mission at first, just a testbed for my own textures and a doodle based on <a href="https://www.nicolasdelort.com/illustration?pgid=ki3luwp3-ad5b13cd-8b7c-48aa-a53f-7e5277bd326d">this etching by artist Nicolas Delort</a>." (For clarity, I've added the link to speed the chain of reference here. Can't have you running off to Google them like a sap.)
</p><p>Barrilliot says he "had no document for this mission whatsoever. I just built it and it eventually coalesced into the final result." The castle takes inspiration from <a href="https://www.chenonceau.com/en/">Chenonceau Castle in France</a>, "which has some of the stupidest vanity architecture you'll ever find", in Barrilliot's estimation. I feel like quite a lot of videogame level design can be filed under "vanity architecture", though it's not a comparison I've thought about before.
</p>
<p>Up for it? You will first need Thief 2 version 1.28, which may mean you have to upgrade using T2Fix 1.28, as detailed alongside the download link on <a href="https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=153139">TTLG</a>. While Reflections In Red appears to have been Barrilliot's pet project, the mod features contributions from a few other Thief fan community members, including voice actors, writers, scripters and tool developers - find a full list in the Thanks section in the TTLG post.</p>
<p>Ah, Thief. I've kind of forgotten everything about the first two games, bizarrely, though I can quote certain bits of Hammerite scripture in my sleep. The third remains vivid in my mind thanks to the efforts of Kieron Gillen, co-founder of this parish, who once dedicated a whole PCGamer feature to its Shalebridge Cradle level. I remember Eidos Montreal's fourth Thief mostly for that time I choked out a guard and he carried on humming, though I thought it was solid enough as stealth games go.</p>
<p>If you call yourself a Thief enthusiast and you've yet to play Barrilliot's previous The Black Parade, you should get that wiped off your ledger pronto. Here's an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-black-parade-is-a-thief-mod-from-a-team-including-a-dev-at-arkane-and-an-original-thief-designer">interview of our own with Barrilliot about its creation</a>, in which writer Lee Seymour confesses that "the thing is so jammed with fun surprises that anything more than a sketched overview feels like a spoiler."</p>

              <p>When people recall their favorite <em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games, it’s often focused on which was their first. For me, that was <em>Tomb Raider II</em>, and as such, it remains very special. For others, it’s the wonderful opener to Crystal Dynamics’ era of the franchise, <em>Tomb Raider Legends</em>. And for many more, it’ll be one of the more recent entries, like 2018’s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. But for all the reminiscing and celebrating, there’s one entry that seems to get little love, despite being one of my absolute favorites at the time, and to replay today:&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>. It turns 25 years old today.</p> <p>There is a perennial issue for both games and movies, which I call Critic Fatigue. It doesn’t matter how good a series may be, nor how increasingly popular it might be among audiences: at a certain point, critics seem to believe it’s their role to be sick of something. “Uh, <em>another</em> <em>Avengers</em> movie? I hate it just for existing!” “More&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed</em>?! It’s time for it to be taken down a peg or two!” It’s like it’s their collective job to punish a franchise for having too many entries. That happened astoundingly harshly to&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> at the turn of the century.</p>

 <h2>Business is boobing</h2> <p>Obviously, the first three <em>Tomb Raider</em> games were a phenomenon. From 1996 to 1998, the original trilogy received international hype that today is hard to even conceive. It was a messy combination of a worthwhile celebration of three genuinely fantastic video games and the lecherous misogyny of the late-90s era. The reason an entire generation bought 3DFX cards, Lara Croft championed and emboldened the third-person action genre, <em>and</em> had rather large boobies. So yes, there <em>was</em> a lot to be frustrated by, especially in Lara’s home country of the UK, where “lad mags” ruled supreme with their soft-porn photography and lifestyle articles. This aspect was so blatantly exploited by publisher Eidos that there was always an <a href="https://www.laracroftonline.com/pictures/tomb-raider-models-images-gallery-page-one.html">“official” Lara Croft model</a>, despite these people never appearing in movies, TV shows, or any other actually extant tie-in media. Instead, the likes of Rhona Mitra, Ellen Rocche, and Nell McAndrew would show up on the covers of those lad mags with multi-page photo shoots within, and on cardboard cut-outs in every gaming store. (And on the covers of many a gaming magazine.) It’s pretty embarrassing to look back on, not least remembering how Nell McAndrew was hypocritically fired from the role after posing for <em>Playboy</em>.</p>

 <p>But for all the squirm-inducing marketing, the games remained <em>fantastic</em>. They still are. Then, in 1999, came <em>Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</em>, and the tide started to turn. Critic Fatigue was due to kick in, and you could smell the backlash coming. <em>The Last Revelation</em> was more of the same, and for some reason, more of something we previously loved stops being good enough after a while, and scores came in lower. It wasn’t helped by a crappy Dreamcast port, but there was still enough residual love for the franchise that <em>The Last Revelation</em> escaped the brunt of the kickback. That was reserved for—in my opinion—a better game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646923" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646923"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646923">© Eidos</figcaption></figure> <h2>Putting the fun in funeral</h2> <p><em>The Last Revelation’</em>s ending deserved far more criticism.&nbsp;The game, during which you watched Lara Croft die some 40 billion times, ended with a cutscene in which Lara Croft died. A pyramid falls on top of her. “Reload then!” I remember saying to the screen at this ridiculous forced ending, reloading to see if I’d made a mistake. But nope, she was dead. It was extremely silly, but it happened for a reason. Core, the developers of the games, were sick of making <em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games. It was hoped that by killing her, the developers would be free to make something else. It didn’t work, and Eidos demanded more.</p>

 <p>However, it also set up a superb conceit for the fifth game,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>. Rather than beginning with Lara in the middle of some improbable heist, then bringing us back to her manor to start a new series of international adventures, <em>Chronicles</em> began with Croft’s funeral. That’s something, right! And of course, everyone was expecting the immediate reveal, that having the Pyramid of Giza squish her flat turned out not to be so serious, and reports of her death were greatly exaggerated. Except that’s not what happened at all. Instead, post-funeral, Lara’s butler Wilson invites two of her close compatriots back to the manor for a drink. Together, the three begin to reminisce about their friend, recalling adventures that had yet to be seen in the games. And that’s what you play! Four stories, in completely unique settings, at different stages in Lara’s life—including as a teenager.</p>

 <p>The result was almost all great! Each of the four chapters was a distinct game, with enormous variety in setting, from haunted islands to modern, high-tech skyscrapers, via an abandoned submarine, delivering the intricate puzzles and acrobatic antics we’d come to expect from developers Core. That no one involved in the game apparently wanted to make it really didn’t come through, perhaps via some sort of involuntary competence, or as a result of breaking it into small chunks that felt less oppressive to create. I can imagine if someone had just played the first four games through in a row and then instantly started on this fifth, they could be thoroughly sick and tired of Lara and her formula. But giventhat&nbsp; a year went by between each entry, I really want to push back against this “fatigue” argument.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646924"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646924">© Eidos / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <h2>Backlashing out</h2> <p>No matter <em>Chronicles</em>‘ merits, they wouldn’t matter. The backlash was due, many critics were ready to put Lara in her place for having the temerity to keep returning. Scores came in hard and harsh, with even <em>IGN</em> almost hitting its lowest possible score of 6.&nbsp;<em>EDGE</em> dished out a mauling 4, while the usually supplicant&nbsp;<em>Official PlayStation Magazine</em> joined in with a 5. But as you read through those reviews (or the residual summaries remaining on the internet), they all praise the game, celebrate its great level design, recognize it as a good example of a&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> game, but then penalize it for…existing? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010220230712/http://www.zdnet.com/opm/stories/main/0,11891,2667614,00.html">That&nbsp;<em>OPM</em></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010220230712/http://www.zdnet.com/opm/stories/main/0,11891,2667614,00.html"> review</a>, that 2.5 star score, described the game as “the best sequel in the series thus far,” albeit then claiming that all the other games “downright sucked.” The same magazine gave <em>TR II </em>a 9, then the third game 7. The fourth game, that one got a 10.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/22/tomb-raider-chronicles"><em>IGN</em>‘s review</a> couldn’t make my argument any better. The 25-year-old article had the strapline, “Lara Croft’s last adventure on PlayStation is also her very best. Still, it’s just more of the same.” There it is! The whole point, perfectly encapsulated! How dare this game be the best example of a thing?</p> <p>The review goes on to say that the matter of annual releases “turned what could have been one of gaming’s most cherished franchises into one of the most reviled.” Most reviled! For the crime of carrying on being good too often. The article also praises the game for its four distinct chapters, offering “the greatest amount of diversity in play style and atmosphere,” then calls the fourth story “one of the best <em>Tomb Raider</em> levels ever.”</p>

 <p>A huge part of this reaction, as indeed is the case in most other examples, is leveling complaints at the latter entry that should have been raised from the start. So <em>Chronicles</em> was repeatedly berated across reviews for its control issues, and indeed the games’ silly combat, even though these aspects were almost always overlooked in the rush of excitement for, er, the first three games. The best example of the series so far, having the same faults as the poorer examples in the past, makes the most recent game the worst? That seems to be the rule.</p> <p>And yes, of course, I’m not naive. Having the same control issues five games in&nbsp;<em>is</em> crappy and should be dealt with. But given they were given a critical pass the first four times, and the games sold eighty million-billion-squillion copies despite them, there’s not a great deal of incentive being put before the developers to prioritize them. It is, in a large part, a failure of criticism.</p>

 <p>It’s the same reason Bethesda gets to release half-finished games with barely functioning UIs, because why would the developer bother to do otherwise? It knows it’ll get a round of 9s and 10s from every outlet despite it, and given the company releases new games every decade rather than every year, these consistent issues don’t seem to amount to “fatigue.” It took an actively&nbsp;<em>boring</em> game,&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>, for any hint of that backlash to appear.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000646925" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646925"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646925">© Eidos / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <h2>The fallen angel</h2> <p>I’m here to say that I loved&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>, despite the litany of flaws that haunted the entire franchise up until that point. I played&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> games on PC, with one hand on a game controller and the other on my keyboard, because this was the only way the crummy control issues were overcome. That worked for&nbsp;<em>Chronicles</em> as well as it worked for&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider II</em>, and if anything, I was used to it by then. It was a splendid game, despite the malaise behind its creation, because—as so many identified at the time—it featured some of the best levels in the series!</p> <p>The irony that it was&nbsp;<em>Chronicles</em> that received the backlash when the borderline unplayable <em>Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</em> was just three years away isn’t lost on me either. Both games were developed simultaneously, the former a reluctant sop to the publisher, the latter a whole fresh start for Core. But after years of delays and brutal development issues, <em>Angel of Darkness</em> was atrocious. Lara was close to uncontrollable, the enemy AI was abysmal, and the game quickly became a laughing stock. And it reviewed the same as <em>Chronicles</em>, because it was new! It was fresh! So it&nbsp;<em>had</em> to be interesting. This time, reviews went, “While the game is so broken as to be functionally useless, it has new graphics!” (To be abundantly fair to <em>IGN</em>, after just picking on them, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/06/24/tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness">the site gave it a good kicking</a> with a score lower than some thought it could reach: 5.3.)</p>

 <p><em>Chronicles</em> is included in Aspyr’s recent remake, <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-angel-darkness-release-date-1851670508"><em>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</em></a>, although <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-remastered-review-pc-lara-croft-1851250080">given my experience with the gruesome mess of the first three</a>, I’m not convinced it’d be the best way to play—definitely stick to the original graphics and controls. You can also <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_the_last_revelation_chronicles">pick it up paired with&nbsp;<em>The Last Revelation</em> from GOG</a> for under $9, and then <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Tomb_Raider_Chronicles">go crazy on&nbsp;<em>PCGamingWiki</em></a>, getting it all patched up for modern machines.</p> <p>I say it’s worth it! Ignore those fatigue-ridden naysayers. It’s OK for something to be good five times in a row.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is practically giving away its smart plug at a price that barely exceeds what you’d pay for a basic outlet adapter: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/">At $12, down from $24, this connected device costs roughly the same as a dumb power strip from the hardware store</a>.</p>
<p>This Black Friday, Amazon slashed prices across all its <strong>own-brand products by approximately 50%</strong>, selling at zero margin to drive ecosystem adoption. The smart plug exemplifies this aggressive strategy and offers voice control and automation at a price that removes every excuse for not starting your smart home journey.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Voice Control That Changes Your Daily Routine</h2>
<p>The <strong>Alexa integration adds voice commands to any device</strong> that has a physical on/off switch. Tell Alexa to turn on your coffee maker from bed, and hot coffee waits when you reach the kitchen. Command the lamp in your living room to turn off from the couch. Turn on a fan in another room without walking there. These minor conveniences compound throughout your day into proper quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Setup takes literally minutes</strong> and requires no technical knowledge whatsoever. Plug the Smart Plug into any outlet, open the Alexa app on your phone, and follow the simple, on-screen prompts. The plug connects automatically to your 2.4GHz WiFi network. You then name the device based on what you’re controlling, such as “bedroom lamp” or “coffee maker.” It takes less than five minutes from box to working smart device.</p>



<p><strong>No smart home hub requirement</strong> removes the additional hardware cost that plagued earlier smart home adoptions. It directly connects your Smart Plug to your WiFi and communicates with Alexa over the cloud. You avoid buying expensive hubs like SmartThings or dedicated Zigbee coordinators. The Alexa app manages all your Smart Plugs from one interface.</p>
<p>Routine automation turns disparate smart devices into cohesive systems that react intelligently. Create a morning routine that starts the coffee maker at 7 AM, turns on bathroom lights, and starts playing the news on your Echo. A bedtime routine might turn off all the lights, smart lock the doors, and drop the thermostat. Leaving home triggers an away routine to power down everything non-essential. These are scheduled automations that happen independently of you and creates the smart home experience most people envision when they first hear about connected devices.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa+ capabilities give you much more natural interactions</strong> with your smart home. You can set routines without having to open the app, using voice commands for actions that power multiple devices at once, such as saying, “Alexa, it’s movie night,” to activate all the smart lighting in the room and turn on TV-connected devices. You can be a lot more casual about what you are asking for without needing to follow strict command structures. It all feels less robotic compared to earlier smart home controls, which required you to say things in a very specific way.</p>
<p>At $12, the smart plug provides fundamental smart home functionality at just about the price of basic electrical accessories this Black Friday. Want to start controlling devices by voice without spending hundreds on smart home infrastructure? This record-low price eliminates that barrier.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With Marathon’s most recent Closed Technical Test behind it, a new Community Playtest has been announced. Details are already available on how to sign up, but it brings more focus on the fact that there’s no sign of a Marathon release date.</p>



<p>October’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-marathon-closed-technical-test-dates-platforms-nda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Closed Technical Test</a> is done. Bungie has inevitably learned valuable data about the extraction shooter, and Insider Gaming has reported before that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has confirmed that Marathon will launch by March 2026</a>.</p>







<p>We’re one step closer to another test, but no closer to knowing when before March 2026 the full release will happen.</p>







<figure><figcaption>This feels like a marathon in itself. Credit to Bungie</figcaption></figure>



<p>The official <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Marathon/Playtests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marathon</a> website is now advertising and recruiting for the ‘Marathon December Community Playtest’ taking place in December 2025.</p>







<p>You can try out the latest extraction shooter build for yourself. It’s playable across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam, and Bungie has said this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Marathon December Community Playtest will run from December 12th to the 15th from 2PM PT to 8PM PT each day.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like before, the playtest is under a strict NDA, so you can’t share your footage or experience. It’s only for North America, so if you’re based outside of here, you’ll have to wait for the next one!</p>



<p>It’s true that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-leaks-closed-test-reveal-positivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks from the recent Closed Test were positive</a>. However, Bungie needs to commit to a release date soon and has to make sure it can compete with the dominance of ARC Raiders and Escape From Tarkov.</p>



<p>How is Marathon shaping up? Are you interested in it? Share your thoughts on the shotoer through the Official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> staff were fired last month due to internal company messages being discussed on a Discord server shared privately between staff and union workers, a new report has suggested.</p>
<p>Rockstar Games fired 34 staff members for "gross misconduct", though further details have not been officially revealed. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">company has since been accused of union-busting</a>, with UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">launching a legal claim alleging unfair dismissal of staff</a>.</p>
<p>Now, a new video report from People Make Games has revealed messages shared in a Discord server, sourced from a Rockstar insider who believes these may be the cause of dismissal.</p>
<p>Use of the Discord server began in 2022 and was invite-only for employees, with a "general" channel available to all and other channels accessible only for paying union members. Membership to the Discord was limited to either Rockstar employees, or representatives of the IWGB (which the Rockstar union was part of).</p>
<p>Most conversations in the Discord were around salaries, bonuses, and other HR issues - topics protected by the Equality Act of 2010 and relevant to the union members.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-acknowledges-gargantuan-grand-theft-auto-6-leak">major leaks in the past</a>, it's understandable Rockstar would be protective of its work. But it would appear this Discord server contained no confidential information about its games.</p>
<p>The catalyst towards these dismissals, however, appears to be the sharing and discussion in the server of changes to internal Slack policies.</p>
<p>Rockstar employees are unable to access their work emails outside of the office and, as at least one email concerning these internal policy changes was shared after work hours, it was instead discussed in this Discord server, with details and quotes shared.</p><p>People Make Games' source believes at least one server member brought this to Rockstar management, which reportedly led to an internal investigation into the Discord server. The Slack policy changes were initiated in the second week of October and by the end of the month, 34 employees had been fired - as such, the timing of these dismissals is in line with these messages, as the source suspects.</p>

<p>The Slack policy changes themselves include the removal of various miscellaneous chat channels concerning non-work topics, which Rockstar considered a distraction. The "Slack purge", as it became known by employees, proved unpopular and, as such, was discussed separately on the Discord server.</p>
<p>One Slack channel focused on gaming became a place for employees to share industry news on mass layoffs. Union members often reacted with the seedling emoji to show support. Elsewhere on Slack, employees would use emojis such as this (or the Palestine flag) in their status to show support for important causes. All of this was disallowed under Rockstar's new Slack policy.</p><p>"What we've seen time and time again is that Rockstar are desperately trying to prevent people from being able to communicate," IWGB president Alex Marshall told People Make Games. "And all these workers have ever been trying to do is to discuss their pay and conditions in order to try and improve them so they can deliver a game that's loved by millions."</p>
<p>Marshall also explained IWGB's presence in the Discord server is legally sound as it's completely normal for workers, when they join a union, to be supported by union staff.</p>
<p>Rockstar refused to comment on People Make Games' investigation.</p>
<p>In addition to the IWGB's legal case against Rockstar, over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">200 employees at Rockstar have signed a letter to management condemning the firing</a> of their fellow staff members.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">dismissal was also discussed in UK Parliament last week</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="4bfd593560611"><a title="Shujinkou Soundtrack" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4bfd593560611/shujinkou-soundtrack.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Rice Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shujinkou">Shujinkou</a> surprised us all when it arrived on Switch in October, bringing its unique blend of dungeon-crawling RPG mechanics and the chance to learn Japanese through combat to the hybrid system after launching elsewhere in February. Now developer Rice Games is keeping the educational odyssey going with a release for the game's lengthy soundtrack, which recently went on sale as a digital download.</p>
<p>Popping up on <a href="https://ricegames.bandcamp.com/album/shujinkou-original-soundtrack">Bandcamp</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2098430/Shujinkou_Original_Soundtrack/">Steam</a>, and the <a href="https://ricegames.net/product/shujinkou-original-soundtrack-digital/">Rice Games store</a> for <strong>£19.99 / $25</strong>, the soundtrack comprises a whopping 158 tracks for almost seven hours of dungeon-crawling tunes. Lead composer Brian LaGuardia packs a bit of everything in there, too, with battle themes, character motifs, and minigame tunes spanning genres from classical to metal, rock to jazz.</p>
<p>All this comes from an orchestra of more than a dozen live performers, with the collection mastered by <a href="https://vgmdb.net/artist/13760">Ryuichi Tanaka</a> of Warner Music Japan — the same mastering engineer that you'll find on numerous Pokémon music collections.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, you can also stream the full collection on the likes of Spotify, Amazon, and YouTube, and there's a physical release on the horizon, too, with a seven-CD Collector's Edition planned to launch at some point in 2026. No word on price yet, but keep an eye out for that one.</p>

<p>If you missed it, Shujinkou is a dungeon-crawler that gives you the chance to learn Japanese as you play. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/shujinkou-has-been-updated-on-switch-here-are-the-patch-notes">A patch at the end of October</a> added a Visual Fidelity mode, which improved the presentation on Switch 2, as well as fixing some other issues. We've recently added expanded impressions to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/shujinkou">our review</a> of the game, so if you like the sound of this unusual language-learning RPG, check it out.</p>

<p>The announcement comes at the same time as the game has officially surpassed 500,000 wishlists. No details have been revealed yet on pricing, but we do know that there will be a Standard Edition and a Deluxe Edition.

<p>The game, initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-is-an-impressive-survival-mmofps-inspired-by-stalker-and-metro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in 2021, was featured here on Wccftech multiple times thanks to two <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interviews with GFA Games</a>. We've often referred to it as clearly inspired by STALKER; it takes place on a vast post-apocalyptic island (spanning over 50 square kilometers filled with hidden dungeons, story quests and faction missions that influence alliances and rewards) where the remnants of the Soviet era have created an incredible alternate reality. As a social MMO, PIONER combines story-driven exploration with intense PvE and PvP gameplay. Here's an overview of what players can expect in this title:</p>



<ul>
<li>Story-driven campaign</li>



<li>Intense PvP modes</li>



<li>Unique Progression System that lets players grow their influence by completing quests, defeating monsters and exploring. The greater their influence, the more inclined merchants will be to sell you better items and the higher the quality of materials that will drop. Even non-combat abilities can be improved.</li>



<li>Diverse game activities include events, story-driven locations, and engaging mini-games such as fishing and Carnage, a unique tactical card mini-game featuring collectible decks, rewards, and ranked matches.</li>



<li>An extensive weapon customization system lets players tweak militarized weapons with a wide array of unique modules and designs.</li>



<li>Realistic survival mechanics require the maintenance of your character's strength by managing hunger, rest and resources.</li>



<li>In-depth crafting system: use artefacts, anomaly energy, and scavenged materials to craft powerful weapons and equipment at workbenches.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Earlier this year, it looked like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/629678/zombies-run-marvel-move-six-to-start-layoffs-fitness-tech">time was up for ZRX: Zombies, Run!</a>, a popular fitness app that mixed couch-to-5K plans with postapocalyptic audio storytelling. Now, cocreator and author Naomi Alderman has announced that she’s bought back the franchise from the brink.</p><p>Zombies, Run! was first founded in 2012 with about 10 million users worldwide. The app, made by Six to Start, immerses runners and walkers in an episode-based storyline where the undead “chase” users. Despite the expensive and time-intensive process, the company was successful enough to make other immersive fitness games, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23686893/marvel-move-six-to-start-running-fitness">Marvel Move</a>. Six to Start was bought by OliveX in 2021.</p><p>In March 2025, OliveX <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/629678/zombies-run-marvel-move-six-to-start-layoffs-fitness-tech">laid off all but two Six to Start staff members</a>, noting that the game would be shut down if a buyer could not be found. At the time, sources told <em>The Verge</em> that the Six to Start staff clashed with OliveX and its owner, Animoca Brands, over the games’ anticapitalist themes and the latter’s attempts to create crypto and NFT projects. Later, Six to Start alerted users that the Zombies, Run! app, archive, and message boards <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633758/zombies-run-six-to-start-layoffs-statement">would remain available</a>, but that future episodes were paused, leaving the app’s future in limbo.</p><p>“I am incredibly delighted to be taking ownership of the game. This isn’t a big corporate takeover, it’s me buying back the game I made and love so I can look after it,” Alderman wrote in <a href="https://zombiesrungame.com/">a post on the Zombies, Run! website</a>. Alderman also confirmed the news in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/naomialderman.bsky.social/post/3m6e5zqg3uc26">a Bluesky post</a>.</p><p>“We’re working on a new story for Zombies, Run!, which I’m intending to be a great ‘on-ramp’ for new players or people who want to come back to the game after a break,” Alderman tells <em>The Verge</em>. “We’ll also resume production on Season 11, which was paused halfway through — a very long cliffhanger to wait through!”</p><p>Alderman clarified that she hasn’t bought Six to Start. Rather, she’s bought the Zombies, Run! franchise, along with <a href="https://thewalkgame.com/">The Walk</a> — another immersive fitness game Alderman created with Six to Start. She also confirmed that Marvel Move had already been in the process of sunsetting, but that the app will be supported until the last annual subscription ends in July next year.</p><p>Alderman says that her main focus going forward will be preserving the app and experience, noting that she’ll be reaching out to the community soon with more news. “Zombies, Run! has been a community effort since the first Kickstarter, and we’ll keep it shambling on together.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjI1"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Victoria Song</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/827575/zombies-run-six-to-start-fitness-gaming]]></content:encoded>

<p>This new report from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrisbratt.bsky.social/post/3m6eynx2ycc2f">People Make Games</a> cites an anonymous Rockstar insider as having passed on messages from the private Discord server Rockstar developers and IWGB staff were using to organise, with the insider claiming they believe these messages contributed to the firings. The alleged messages in question discuss and include snippets of text from internal Rockstar emails concerning a change in internal Slack policy, which the company reportedly announced to staff in the second week of October this year.</p>
<p>According to People Make Games, the policy changes included the removal of miscellaneous Slack channels which staff used for non-work related discussions, with Rockstar allegedly claiming these had become distracting and occasionally sources of poor conduct. The report claims that at least one of the two emails from Rockstar about the changes was sent out after 5PM UK time, with Rockstar staff reportedly only able to access their work emails while at the company office during work hours. Some members of the Discord who were still in office then allegedly shared information or quotes from the emails in the server, so staff who'd gone home could see and discuss them.</p>
<p>People Make Games claim Rockstar management then became aware of these messages when at least one non-union member of the Discord server reached out to them to express concern.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Rockstar for comment.</p>
<p>Asked about the Discord discussion of the Slack policy changes by People Make Games, IWGB union president Alex Marshall said the following:</p>
<blockquote>I think it is absolutely normal for people to be discussing their material conditions, whether that's bonuses, whether that's policies, whether that's anything like that. That's completely normal for staff to be doing that and for an employer to respond in a way that comes down so hard on that shows not only that they are governing by this lack of transparency, but they're also trying to govern by fear. They feel completely threatened by the idea of workers talking to each other and that's why they've taken this act to try and destroy the union, decimate any form of kind of solidarity being built between workers.</blockquote>
<p>Earlier this month, Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">raised the issue of the firings in UK Parliament</a>, revealing that she'd written to Rockstar asking for information about the issue and requesting a meeting with a relevant minister in the hopes of discussing what support may be offered to affected staff.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/djis-4-7-star-wireless-microphone-is-a-massive-pre-black-friday-steal-2000645986</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-goes-into-black-friday-clear-out-mode-with-the-mic-mini-bundle-and-each-mic-feels-practically-free.1362910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Look up any portable video device — smartphone, tablet, or camera — and you’ll get a full, vivid description of just how good its video quality is. That does leave out one very important and all-too-often ignored part of a truly pro-quality recording — the sound. Even the best smartphones and pocket-sized action cams can leave you with truly spectacular video paired with tinny, shallow sound filled with background noise.</p>
<p>There’s no need for a boom mic — the DJI Mic Mini wireless lavalier microphone transmitter is the tiny, ultra-lightweight (10 grams) solution that delivers exceptional sound from as far away as 400 meters. Content creators, vloggers, and travel buffs can give their content a massive upgrade for a lowest-ever price during this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/">Amazon Black Friday blowout that drops the price of the DJI Mic Mini by 45%, down to just $66.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Sound for Pro-Level Content</h2>
<p>As 4K or even higher-resolution video has moved from being the exclusive property of professional videographers to being a smartphone feature that you carry in your pocket, the world of content creation has exploded. But with ultra-hi-res videos and vlogs being created by virtually anyone and everyone, the best way to set yourself apart from the masses is with content that pairs that video with sound that’s just as good. DJI has mastered ultra-high-quality cameras, both in their tiny action cameras and their famous fleet of consumer drones. Once they turned their attention to sound, it was no surprise that the result was exceptionally small and lightweight, highly versatile, and of the best quality.</p>
<p>In barely a year’s time the Mic Mini has become the gold standard of rechargeable wireless microphones, with a stellar 4.7-star average rating at Amazon. It can be worn as a clip-on, on a lanyard, or magnetically attached to your clothes — regardless of how you decide to go, it’s unobtrusive on camera and able to deliver a highly stable, impeccable sound transmission from as far away as 400 meters, even in busy or noisy environments. Two built-in levels of noise cancellation — Basic for quiet indoor settings and Strong for noisy environments or outdoor shoots — cut out the background noise, often the biggest shortfall of video shot on a smartphone.</p>



<h2>The Total Package</h2>
<p>The sound quality of the DJI Mini Mic sets it apart from the built-in mics of any consumer-level video device — 48Hz sampling and 120 decibels of full, clear, rich sound. This Amazon deal includes everything you need to give your videos a huge sound boost – two transmitters and one receiver, a USB-C charging cable, four mini windscreens, a type-C smartphone adapter, two DJI Mic Mini Clip magnets, and a carrying pouch.</p>
<p>If you’re already shooting video with a DJI Osmo camera — the Pocket 3, Action 4, or Action 5 Pro, the Mini Mic can be used in a direct wireless connection to the camera, delivering premium audio without the need for a receiver. And a single charge gives you 48 hours of shoot time, so you never have to worry about going silent in the middle of a shoot.</p>
<p>For anyone who wants their videos to sound as good or even better than they look, this is the best $66 upgrade you can make. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/">It’s an amazing pre-Black Friday deal that’s live right now at Amazon — 45% off the price of the DJI Mic Mini.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-millennium-falcon-stays-full-price-on-official-site-but-selling-for-pennies-on-amazon-2000646840</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO’s official website lists flagship sets at full retail price year-round with very little pricing variations. Amazon manages its own inventory and slashed the prices of thousands of products aggressively on Black Friday. Indeed, while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">LEGO still sells the Star Wars Millennium Falcon (25th anniversary) set for $84 on its website, Amazon slashes it to $67</a>. This <strong>921-piece collectible build</strong> of one of the most iconic starships in cinematic history is now at its lowest price ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Star Wars Set</h2>
<p>The 921-piece construction is satisfying to build and requires several sessions of focused building time. Each bag of parts opens up a new section of the Falcon, from the detailed cockpit to the iconic sensor dish. The process of building naturally encourages mindful relaxation as you work your way through the instructions, never hurrying the pace.</p>
<p>The <strong>mid-scale size</strong> hits the sweet spot between desktop models and massive display pieces: At 9.5 inches long, 7.5 inches wide, and 5 inches high, the finished Falcon commands attention without dominating an entire shelf. The proportions of this LEGO version hold true to the ship from A New Hope and do so in a structurally safe way. You can place this next to other mid-scale starships from the LEGO Star Wars collection with no mismatched sizes. The dimensions are perfect for home office desks, bedroom shelves, or living room displays.</p>



<p>Authentic details recreate the Falcon’s most recognizable features in LEGO brick form: The cockpit sits offset on the starboard side, just as it should. The quad laser cannons rotate and articulate for different display poses. The sensor dish mounts on top in its classic pre-Return of the Jedi configuration. The hull greebling makes use of clever part combinations to suggest the weathered, lived-in aesthetic of the original prop.</p>
<p>Thoughtful presentation features on the display stand take this set from toy to décor piece. Instead of placing flat on the table, the angled mounting provides dynamic visual interest. The nameplate clearly identifies the ship for guests who might not be too familiar with Star Wars. There is <strong>also a brick that commemorates 25 years of LEGO’s partnership with Star Wars</strong>. This stand design shows LEGO understands their adult audience, wanting display-worthy builds rather than play sets.</p>



<p><strong>4.9 out of 5 stars, with almost 2,000 reviews,</strong> confirms this set lives up to expectations. More than 10,000 sold in the last month prove sustained popularity well beyond a niche following among Star Wars fans. The wide appeal crosses multiple demographics: long-time fans of the franchise, LEGO collectors, décor-conscious adults, and gift-givers seeking a well-appreciated gift. The universal recognition of the Millennium Falcon transcends typical hobby boundaries.</p>
<p>At $67, the Star Wars Millennium Falcon set offers collectible quality 20% off retail this Black Friday. LEGO’s official site is still charging full price, while Amazon moves inventory aggressively.</p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios recently spoke about their next title, revealing that it shouldn’t be too far from Helldivers.</p>



<p>We have been hearing a lot about Helldivers 2 recently, with the developers also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-ceo-comments-on-switch-2-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commenting on a Switch 2 port</a>. However, we have yet to hear new details about the next game that Arrowhead Game Studios has been working on. The latest comments from the devs don’t provide too much information, but should be enough to make Helldivers fans happy. </p>



<h2 id="h-arrowhead-studios-next-game-will-not-be-too-far-from-helldivers">Arrowhead Studios’ Next Game Will Not Be ‘Too Far’ from Helldivers</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowheads-next-game-wont-be-something-thats-too-far-off-from-helldivers-2-creative-lead-says-were-looking-to-continue-the-legacy-of-what-weve-created/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Arrowhead Game Studios CCO, Johan Pilestedt, spoke a bit about their next title. Pilestedt first revealed that the game is currently in his favorite phase, the part he loves the most. The CCO revealed that he loves getting a new team together, breaking down boundaries among themselves, and getting to the heart of “who we are as people, and what games do we want to make together.”</p>



<p>Talking about what Arrowhead devs want to make, Pilestedt states that the team is “looking to continue the legacy of what we’ve created already.” The CCO added that the next title is “something that’s too far off from Helldivers”, which means that people who are massive Helldivers fans will be able to jump into their next game and “recognise the DNA” they have become familiar with over the years. The devs didn’t provide any more details about the game or explain how Helldivers will inspire it. </p>
