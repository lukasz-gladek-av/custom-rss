<div>
<div><p>Recently, Golden Lasso Games launched a Kickstarter campaign for their latest tabletop project. The project was <em>Starscape</em>, a sci-fi TTRPG heavily inspired by themes of found family. It was fully funded the same day it went live.</p>
<h2>The Starscape Kickstarter Campaign</h2>
<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goldenlassogames/starscape"><em>Starscape</em></a> is a TTRPG that uses the Powered By The Apocalypse RPG system. The game is inspired by episodic sci-fi television shows, citing <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Firefly</em>, <em>Farscape</em>, <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, and <em>Babylon 5</em>.</p>

The players are crewmates on a starship, which they slowly make into their home as they travel the galaxy. Whether exploring planets, infiltrating space stations, or fighting with outlaws, their ship is their foundation and their shipmates are their second family.</p>
<p>The <em>Starscape</em> core rulebook contains over 200+ pages of original rules and playbooks. These include playbooks for different kinds of ships, ten different character archetype playbooks, a step-by-step Session Zero world creation process, and an economy where players trade, earn, and wager Trust.</p>
<p><em>Starscape</em> was a four-year-long passion project by writer and designer Kimi Hughes. She got the idea for the game during the COVID-19 lockdown after recently becoming a mother. Isolated from the rest of the world full of uncertainty and fear, she found hope through binge-watching <em>Star Trek</em>. This game is the result of that nostalgia trip.</p>

This includes character artist Carlos "Kaek" Eulefi (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/backroads-bringing-southern-gothic-horror-to-table" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Backroads</em></a>), cover artist&nbsp; Bryan Vectorartist, layout designer Bora Haxhirai (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everyday-heroes-rpg-book-rambo-total-recall" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Everyday Heroes</em></a>), and editor Jaye Elsinger (<em>Horror Beneath The Frost</em>).</p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign's stretch goals are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Planet for $20:</strong> A PDF of the core rulebook</li>
<li><strong>Moon for $30:</strong> A PDF and physical softcover copy of the core rulebook</li>
<li><strong>Comet for $45:</strong> PDF, physical copy, and adventure supplement written by Kimi Hughes</li>
<li><strong>Star for $60:</strong> A hardcover deluxe edition of the core rulebook and PDF</li>
<li><strong>Supernova for $75:</strong> Hardcover deluxe edition, PDF, and adventure supplement</li>

<li><strong>Galaxy for $500:</strong> Everything from the Nebula tier, and having Kimi Hughes GM a one-shot of Starscape for your table</li>
</ul><p>At time of writing, <em>Starscape</em> has raised&nbsp;$14,757, fulfilling its initial funding goal of $12,000. The campaign concludes August 8.</p>

The sequel, <a href="https://www.frontier.co.uk/news/press-releases/ride-wave-much-anticipated-planet-coaster-2">coming this fall</a>, will finally let you construct everything from wave pools and lazy rivers to custom-built waterslides.</p><p>You’ll also get to outfit your aquatic experience with changing rooms, sunbeds, lifeguards, and more. <em>Planet Coaster 2</em> builds upon its predecessor with the addition of new building and pathing tools, as well as an advanced event sequencer system that can give your guests new experiences.

            <p>
If you just can't get enough of those Epic Games Store freebies, here're some more for your list; Epic has revealed an upcoming twosome of arcade management action and Welsh folklore horror when its latest batch of free titles arrives next week. And, before that, grid-based, turn-based deckbuilder Floppy Knights is currently available to download and keep for zero pee.
</p>
<p>
Starting in the present, Rose City Games' <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/floppy-knights-6a735a">Floppy Knights</a> casts players as Phoebe, a brilliant young inventor with a robotic arm for a best friend, who's trying to save up enough money to leave home. To meet her goal, Phoebe must smash through armies of monsters using her titular tangible projections, all summoned from floppy disks. The result is a mix of tactical turn-based battling and deckbuilding that Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/floppy-knights-is-an-irresistible-mix-of-advance-wars-and-deckbuilding-1">said</a> "oozes fun, plain and simple",  back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
Floppy Knights is free to download and keep on the Epic Games Store right now, and will remain so until next Thursday, 18th July. After that, two more freebies take its place:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcade Paradise</li>
<li>The Maid of Sker</li>
</ul>

<p>
Nosebleed Interactive's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arcade-paradise">Arcade Paradise</a> is a sort of hands-on, first-person management game challenging players to turn their family's run-down laundrette into a thriving arcade. Your time is split between keeping the laundrette running - manually collecting trash, washing and folding clothes, unclogging the toilet, and so on - in order to scrape together the cash needed to buy new arcade cabinets and expand your empire. Which is where you'll spend the rest of your time: messing around with Arcade Paradise's 35 fully playable arcade games (with more available as DLC). Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcade-paradise-review-wash-clothes-and-play-games-in-this-feat-of-grime-caked-memory">liked Arcade Paradise a lot</a>!

<p>
As for <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/maid-of-sker-2ae24e">The Maid of Sker</a>, it's a Welsh-folklore-inspired slice of stealth horror that tells the supposedly true tale of Elizabeth Williams, who's said to have have died of a broken heart after being locked inside her home by her controlling father. The action picks up in 1898 when players must explore the shadowy halls of Sker Hotel, sneaking about the place to avoid a cult of enemies that react to sound. Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maid-of-sker-review-an-effective-if-unadventurous-slice-of-rural-horror">lukewarm on this</a> when it released in 2020, calling it an "effective if unadventurous slice of rural horror". So there you go.</p>
<p>
To recap, The Maid of Sker and Arcade Paradise are next week's freebies (yes, I totally got muddled up first time around), and Floppy Knights is free now - just remember to claim it before Thursday, 18th July, when it's all change.

                <p>Mining is an important part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a>, as it offers a great way to make a ton of money and is necessary for upgrading your tools and crafting important machines. Because mining is so important, it makes the decision between the two skill paths, Miner and Geologist, that much more difficult. Unlike the choice between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/should-you-choose-rancher-or-tiller-in-stardew-valley/1100-6524885/" data-ref-id="1100-6524885">Tiller and Rancher</a>, the answer is a little less obvious.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Miner or Geologist</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>The Miner path is better for making money, but the Geologist path can help you complete the Museum collection faster.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Miner increases the number of ore (copper, silver, gold, and iridium) by one piece per vein. This is a relatively substantial boost, since it's guaranteed to give the extra ore. This makes it easier to upgrade tools in the early game and lets you stockpile materials early on. The level 10 skill options are Blacksmith, which makes Metal Bars worth 50% more. That means Iridium bars sell for 1,500G and the late-game Radioactive Bars sell for 4,500G. The other skill is Prospector, which doubles the amount of Coal found. Obviously, the Blacksmith skill is significantly better than the Prospector skill.</p><p dir="ltr">Geologist adds a 50% chance for gems to spawn in pairs and it applies to Geodes found from breaking rocks. The level 10 skill Excavator doubles the chance to find Geodes, in addition to the chance for them to appear in pairs. With this skill you can easily get a triple digit amount of Omni Geodes from a single Skull Cavern run, which can be exchanged at the Desert Trade for Artifact Troves, which have a chance to contain some of the rarer Museum artifacts.</p><p>Ultimately, the <strong>Miner path is more profitable in the long run</strong>, but there are benefits to following the Geologist path. You can change skills at the <strong>Statue of Uncertainty</strong> in the Sewers for 10,000G per skill.</p>

                <p>At level 5 of each skill in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> you will be offered two skill options, specializing you in a certain aspect of that skill. One of the most important is the <strong>Rancher or Tiller</strong> choice at level 5 farming, since farming is such a large part of making money is Stardew Valley. One option focuses on animals, while the other focuses on crops. Here's what you should pick depending on how you play Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Rancher or Tiller</h2><p><strong>In most cases Tiller will provide a larger boost to your profits and offers better level 10 skill options</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">Rancher provides a 20% boost to the sell price of animal products, both raw, like eggs and milk, and processed, like cheese and mayonnaise. Tiller increases the sell price of all crops by 10%, which only applies to crops and not foraged plants.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331790-rancherortiller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331790" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331790-rancherortiller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331790"></a><figcaption>At level 5 you will have to choose a profession, but you can change it later for fee.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331790-rancherortiller.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are two major reasons why Tiller ends up being better. First, most players won't have many animals, if any, by the time they reach level 5, assuming they are growing crops every season. While the 20% boost is larger, the amount of animal products you are selling is likely much lower than the amount of crops you are shipping every season. The second reason is that the level 10 skills are better for the Tiller than the Rancher.</p><p dir="ltr">The first Rancher level 10 option is <strong>Coopsmaster</strong>, which decreases egg incubation time, makes it easier to befriend coop animals, and increases the likelihood of the coop products being high quality. The second option is Shepard, which causes sheep to produce wool faster, makes befriending barn animals easier, and increases the likelihood of barn animal products being high quality. Both of these options reward you for focusing on either of the two animal types, but one of the level 10 Tiller options offers a much bigger boost.</p><p dir="ltr">The first option for Tiller level 10 is Agriculturalist, which increases the growth rate of all crops by 10%, which is the worse option of the two. The better option is Artisan, which increases the selling price of all artisan goods by 40% (except oil). This applies to not only pickled crops, but crops that have been turned into wine. But the <strong>biggest benefit here</strong> is that processed animal goods, like cheese, mayonnaise, and cloth, are all considered artisan goods and benefit from the 40% boost.</p><p dir="ltr">Because of the Artisan skill, Tiller is the superior choice. If you want to try the other option, the <strong>Statue of Uncertainty</strong> in the sewers allows you to change skills for 10,000G per skill change.</p>

Many expected characters from the base game to return in some way, react to the events of the expansion, or simply play a bigger role in it, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">especially ones who have close ties to Miquella</a></span>, the DLC’s central character<em>. </em>The lack of consequence, and the absence of new dialogue that’d further the player’s understanding of the story, have been a sore point for folks who are starved for morsels of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s massive, sometimes inscrutable narrative.</p><p>There’s a contingent of folks who are especially disappointed in the final cutscene of the DLC, feeling that it does very little to pay off the experience that preceded it. That sentiment is likely bred from the fact that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>ends in a <em>massive</em> fight. I’m talking, like, a <em>huge </em>pain in the ass that is even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346">rigged against the player thanks to insane hitboxes</a></span>, seemingly unavoidable attacks, and the kinds of long combos that <em>Elden Ring </em>has become infamous for doubling down on. Once you have beaten that absolute unit of a final boss, there’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaaugb0au4&amp;pp=ygUkc2hhZG93IG9mIHRoZSBlcmR0cmVlIGZpbmFsIGN1dHNjZW5l&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaaugb0au4&amp;pp=ygUkc2hhZG93IG9mIHRoZSBlcmR0cmVlIGZpbmFsIGN1dHNjZW5l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cutscene</a></span> that can be triggered, and many fans of the game are none too pleased with its brevity and lack of <em>oomph</em>, for lack of a better word.</p><p><strong>Spoilers for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree’s </em>ending follow.</strong></p><p>For many, this ending to <em>Elden Ring</em>’s saga seems like a whimper rather than a triumphant bang. The scene is straightforward enough (or as clean-cut as FromSoftware’s esoterica can be) and that appears to be the source of the tension. Miquella, the quintessential character of the entire expansion, appears for the first time and effectively doubles down on his goal, or at least restates it. There is no pomp to the affair. Miquella is kneeling throughout the scene, which takes place in a void save for the nearby throne of the Elden Lord, and it is over before you know it. It betrays no significant new insight.</p><p>I won’t lie: this <em>does </em>kind of suck ass. I actually get the contingent who were maybe expecting more from the end of this DLC. <em>Elden Ring </em>is an epic, and if this is the end of it, yeah, it’s not exactly what I would’ve expected. But while some are fixated on the short nature of the ending, others are pissed because of how little it appears to add to the story, or at the least their understanding of it all.</p><p><em>Elden Ring</em>, like most of FromSoftware’s oeuvre, is fascinating to digest and think about. I love people who sniff out bits of lore and propose theories about the motivations of characters and the larger schemings of the world. I too have fallen asleep to many Vaatividya videos piercing together scraps of item descriptions into a cogent and deeply tragic narrative. However, these practices have also borne a kind of fan that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/openwindow6am/status/1810779817018872255&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/openwindow6am/status/1810779817018872255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demands “<em>truth” </em>from these games</a></span>. People who <em>expect </em>answers for their sleuthing and investment. In my humble opinion, those folks are playing these games—and engaging with art—in a reductive manner, and only getting in the way of their own enjoyment.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-s-story-explained-1851566799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-s-story-explained-1851566799"><strong>Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree’s Story, Explained</strong></a></span></p><p>The absolute truth of these games is <em>supposed</em> to elide you, you dingbats. Whatever absolute meaning you are trying to wring from them flies in the face of the entire point of FromSoft’s preferred method of storytelling. If Miyazaki wanted players to know everything about the game, he and his team could’ve simply written it out for you in a game rich with endless dialogue, exposition, and scenes pontificating on every minute detail. The fact that these games have never fit that mold should have clued you all into an obvious fact: there is no truth waiting for you at the center of <em>Elden Ring</em> or its expansion.</p><p>Disgruntled players who can’t believe that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>would end in such an abrupt and curt manner are outright hoping that there’s a secret ending to be uncovered. Though <em>Elden Ring </em>didn’t have a secret one, it did feature multiple endings depending on what quests you completed and what force/faction you ultimately aligned with. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>lacks a similar framework, and Miyazaki has outright stated that the DLC wouldn’t impact the endings already baked into the game, but that hasn’t stopped a select few from praying that those claims were little more than a red herring.</p><p>I find how little I understand <em>Elden Ring </em>to be a fucking joy, y’all. When I do come back to it, I love trying to click the puzzle pieces together. Some of them fit, and others don’t. Some of them may <em>never </em>click and that’s okay. I can master the game’s mechanics and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-gideon-boss-1851576225&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-gideon-boss-1851576225">dog-walk half of these bosses in my sleep</a></span>, but there’s <em>something </em>about the fact that I may never really understand all of its mysteries, including Miquella’s motivations for abandoning the Lands Between and seeking godhood, or whatever people are bent out of shape about. I’ll never really stop exploring the larger-than-life cast of <em>Elden Ring </em>and that keeps the thrill of it alive. I don’t need to know everything about <em>Elden Ring </em>to know that I love it and love being engaged by it. Believe it or not, that’s enough.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
GreedFall 2: The Dying World, the sequel to 2019's scrappy but enjoyable historical fantasy RPG GreedFall, will launch into Steam early access on 24th September this year.
</p>
<p>
Despite its rough edges, the original GreedFall was a bit of a surprise hit, its blend of RPG action and BioWare-style player choice striking enough of a chord that it went on to sell 2m copies. So it wasn't a huge surprise when developer Spiders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/historical-fantasy-rpg-greedfall-is-getting-a-sequel-in-2024">announced plans for a follow-up in 2022</a>.
</p>
<p>
As we learned at the time, GreedFall 2 begins three years prior to the events of the first game, casting players as a Teer Fradee native, uprooted from their island home and taken to the continent of Gacane. Here, they must use "diplomacy, cunning, or combat", as well as help from their allies, to regain their freedom and "end one man's ambitions of conquest, which could spell the end for the continent and your island."

<p>
"Travel across new landscapes, from Olima... to the shores of Uxantis, and uncover the secrets of these ancient lands," GreedFall 2's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/Greedfall_II_The_Dying_World/">Steam page</a> continues. "Meet all the factions that share control over these nations and navigate the treacherous waters of their schemes and conspiracies."
</p>
<p>
Spiders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-will-launch-in-early-access">confirmed its plans to launch GreedFall 2: The Dying World into Steam early access</a> back in March, explaining it would be "relying heavily on early access to collect player feedback and see if we're heading in the right direction." In particular, it said it was keen to get the game's combat in front of players because it was "something new".
</p>
<p>
And now the studio has confirmed early access begins on 24th September, when - as it explained previously - players will have access to the "entire beginning of the game". Spiders plans to release updates at "regular intervals" after that (saves won't be compatible between updates, it's warned), all leading to GreedFall 2's 1.0 launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, that final release will maintain some of its predecessor's charm. As Eurogamer contributor Malindy Hetfield wrote in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/greedfall-review-technical-shortcomings-are-overcome-by-an-abundance-of-heart">review of the first game</a>, "GreedFall has more than its fair share of faults, and its curious mix of the sweet and the sour is far from a roleplaying revelation. But the elements that matter have been imbued with such love and care - so much so that I quickly forgave this ambitious RPG its shortcomings."

However, they’ve discovered that the update has also created entirely new ways in which you can make your character look quite silly.

The trend has quickly spiraled into players just making all sorts of silly faces, many of which recreate memes from all over the internet. Some great examples include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/eclipseorzea/status/1811182418520392108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/eclipseorzea/status/1811182418520392108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one poster</a></span> making their Viera look like the meme of Jamie Lee Curtis yelling at someone and then drinking a glass of water, as well as so many female Hrothgar players just making their Warriors of Light do cat memes. Take a look at what the <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> community has come up with thanks to all these new bones.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>If you've had your eyes on GreedFall II: The Dying World for a while now, you won't have to wait too long. NACON and Spiders officially announced that the roleplaying game will enter Early Access on September 24. This title expands on the universe of GreedFall, which has a strong community of over 2 million players. If you are interested in Early Access to GreedFall II: The Dying World, it enters Early Access on Steam specifically as of September 24.</p>
<p>When this releases, players will get to explore the beginnings of the game, including the first few chapters, which introduce players to the realms of Teer Fradee, Thynia, and Uxantis. While players get to explore these brand new areas, there will also be important characters that you get to meet along the way. You will then get to form bonds with some of these characters, and they can accompany you on your adventures as you explore these brand-new realms.</p>
<p>GreedFall II: The Dying World will continue to be updated throughout the early access period, where you will see more content consistently added to the game. This includes brand-new quests, new features and improvements, and exciting zones to explore to give you the most impactful experience as you play the game. If you have yet to hear about the game, check out their<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sol7cwP8mI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;new release date trailer </a>to see what you can expect by getting stuck into GreedFall II: The Dying World.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall 2 | Release Date Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6sol7cwP8mI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this game, you are a native of Teer Fradee and were uprooted by force from your island. You were then made to travel to the continent of Gacane, home to the colonists. Compared to home, this continent has an old-world feel, and you have to survive through the constant state of conflict, Malichor Plague, and outrageous political scheming as you try your best to carve out your destiny and break away from Gacane. Through it all, you must try to stop one man from taking over the world. If he succeeds, it could cause the entire world to fall to pieces.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, console owners will have a bit of a longer wait. GreedFall II: The Dying World will be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2025 once the game gets out of early access.</p>
<p>Why not jump back into GreedFall during the wait and check out their DLC to prepare for your upcoming journey from Teer Fradee? Additionally, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-hands-on-preview-swapping-places-with-dragon-age/">our preview of GreedFall 2: The Dying World</a> to see if it's a game you are prepared to dive into.</p>

This time, his latest creation is NSFW. The content creator was able to get the original Doom running on a Tifforun sex toy—specifically one marketed as an Automatic Telescopic Masturbator.</p><p>According to Christophel, this was one of the only electronic fleshlights he could find that had a built-in screen. Once he got his hands on the sex toy, the creator cracked it open and stuck some extra hardware inside to help the device run Doom. </p><p>To play <em>Doom </em>on Tifforun’s sex toy you simply use the device’s pre-existing buttons to move the Doomguy forward, backward, and left to right. Another button fires your gun. Simple as that. And when you kill a demon or zombie in this version of <em>Doom </em>the device pumps once, providing anyone with a penis some pleasure. But you only get one stroke per kill. So if you want to finish the fight, so to speak, you’ll need to do a lot of killing. </p><p>Anyway, I’m nervous about the future of <em>Doom </em>ports. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-weirdest-ports-keyboard-atm-calculator-tractor-pc-1850726374&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-weirdest-ports-keyboard-atm-calculator-tractor-pc-1850726374">Now that most devices have been added to the list</a></span>, I worry about what comes next. There are probably a lot of sex toys out there that can’t run <em>Doom </em>yet. Well, for now...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The video shows off a pool area for attendees to float around in as well as a steep, stomach-churning waterslide, but the team also promises other features, including lazy rivers, wave pools, water coasters, changing rooms, sunbeds, lifeguards, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“Building upon its highly successful predecessor, <em>Planet Coaster 2</em> gives players the ability to push the boundaries of creativity like never before,” Frontier explains. “Be inspired by spectacular real-world parks and create vibrant guest plazas with enhanced building and pathing tools. Intuitive piece-by-piece building tools and mesmerising new themes make it simple for players to elevate their park building to the next level.”</p><p>Planet Coaster 2 aims to enhance the experience players remember from the series’ last outing, so while new watery tools will freshen up the theme-park management gameplay, some fan-favorite rides will return, too. Other new tools include animatronics, smoke, water jets, and unique sounds to ensure guests stay happy. </p><p>Frontier also promises three game modes to enjoy: Career mode, Franchise mode, and Sandbox mode. Career sees players completing specific scenarios, while franchise challenges players to build out a worldwide park network. Sandbox, meanwhile, lets thrill-seekers design parks to their heart’s content.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Planet Coaster 2 Gallery</h3></div></output><p>Finally, Frontier says playing with friends will be “easier than ever” in Planet Coaster 2. That’s thanks to the ability to visit friends’ parks and compete in Franchise mode leaderboards. Even Sandbox mode includes the option to jump into shared levels, allowing for cooperative building across platforms.</p><p>Frontier plans to reveal further details in Frontier Unlocked livestreams, which are set to premiere on the last Wednesday of every month. We enjoyed Planet Coaster upon its launch in 2016, giving it an 8.5/10 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/planet-coaster-review"><u>our review</u></a>.

According to Lintern, it was clear from the moment he walked in that he had underestimated the scale of what was going to be asked of him. He said, "Now, I'm not entirely stupid, but I had not heard of Mr. Miyazaki before. I didn't know the game... and I didn't know his status. But when I walked into the room, his status was very clear, very clear immediately." Luckily, the voice director Adam Chapman took him under his wing immediately, clarifying what the role would expect from him.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-considering-ceasing-marketing-of-xbox-consoles-in-emea-shifting-focus-to-game-pass/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has reportedly decided not to continue to market Xbox Consoles in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa), focusing solely on marketing Game Pass, controllers, and its Cloud feature instead. This consideration comes after they announced that they are hiking up <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">Game Pass prices</a>, which has caused a huge stir in the gaming community.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been peddling that you <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-dont-need-an-xbox-to-play-xbox-says-new-fire-tv-app-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no longer need an Xbox to play</a> or utilize Xbox services, with many day-one Xbox releases also being released on PC. Alongside this, they promote their Game Pass subscription, offering plenty of offers to new subscribers, especially through the Discord Nitro gifts.</p>
<p>All of the recent changes within the Xbox team have come as Microsoft is beginning to navigate its new financial year, which means plenty of changes are to be expected. We have already seen many Xbox employees being <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-xbox-layoffs-at-microsoft-inbound-this-week-tom-warren-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off</a>.</p>
<p>A while ago, Tom Warren of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196361/microsoft-xbox-no-console-required-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> received a tip suggesting that Microsoft was shifting its focus on promoting its consoles for the new financial year. As it stands, the tip has not been fully verified, so this information may yet turn out to be incorrect. However, considering the significant changes we've seen Microsoft make so far, especially this week, it doesn't sound so outlandish.</p>
<p>This change wouldn't be a shock, as we have seen declining sales of their Xbox Series X|S consoles across EMEA markets for a while, with plenty of gamers choosing a PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, or PC instead. If this change goes ahead, we will see Microsoft focus less on consoles in Europe, meaning we could see a price hike as people would scalp them and then sell them through third parties. While the tip said it would affect the EMEA markets, it specified that it would only be in certain EMEA markets. At the moment, it is uncertain which markets across Europe will be affected.</p>
<p>Additionally, Xbox has released a dedicated app is available on Amazon Fire TV stick, where you can utilize Xbox services without the console. Should Microsoft undergo these changes, it will be interesting to see where the stock allocation goes instead. Especially as they have recently announced their brand-new disc-less Xbox Series X console. What does this mean for Xbox gamers in Europe, and will prices increase as a result?</p>
<p>If Microsoft confirms that it is ceasing EMEA console marketing, hopefully, it will expand and specify which markets will be affected so consumers can make a financial choice before the change.</p>

<p>Intel’s next lineup of CPUs has been confirmed thanks to an update from <a href="https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html#version-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CPU-Z</a>. Launching later this year — current rumors range from October to December — Intel will be releasing its Arrow Lake-S lineup of processors. </p>



<p>Based on the CPU-Z update, there will be at least six new SKUs coming. All of them will also feature the new naming convention from Intel for its CPUs.</p>



<p>There will be two SKUs in each CPU tier with the new lineup: Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and 275, Core Ultra 7 265K and 255, and Core Ultra 5 245K and 240. There will be no Core 3 processors with the new lineup.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While we know the CPUs are officially Arrow Lake, what we don’t know are the exact specifics of the new chips. According to rumors, the Core Ultra 9 285K and 275 are expected to have 24 cores and 24 threads. The Ultra 7 CPUs will feature 20/20 while the Ultra 5 245K will have 14c/10t and the 240 will have 10c/10t.</p>



<p>Intel is expected to fully reveal its next lineup of CPUs in the coming months. That will give everyone their first look and the new generation from the blue team.</p>

<p>As the 2024 season has unravelled, viewers have become less interested in the Call of Duty League. Last year, record-high numbers were recorded, but the 2024 season hasn’t delivered against expectations, which wasn’t helped by Activision pivoting to an exclusivity deal with YouTube late last year.</p>



<p>Since Major I took place in January, viewership has declined with each successive tournament, with Major IV – which took place behind closed doors – landing a peak viewer count of just 109,764 users, a woeful low for Call of Duty esports.</p>



<p>If this trend continues, the 2024 Call of Duty League Championship could suffer immeasurably from a lower viewer count.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-are-cod-esports-dying">Are COD Esports Dying?</h2>



<p>Call it a disappointing game or foul decisions made by the tournament organisers, something somewhere has gone wrong with the Call of Duty League. This monopolised, franchised tournament has rubbed fans wrong since day one, with Activision Blizzard opting to scrap the more open-ended COD World League in favour of something stricter and more regimented back in 2020.</p>



<p>This season has been particularly miserable for fans. Here’s the downward trend we’ve noticed in terms of peak Major viewership over the year (data courtesy of <a href="https://escharts.com/tournaments/cod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">escharts.com</a>):</p>



<ul>
<li>Major I: 245,437</li>



<li>Major II: 244,478</li>



<li>Major III: 238,499</li>



<li>Major IV: 109,764</li>
</ul>



<p>Traditionally, things are kicked up a notch when COD Champs rolls around, and this is where all the viewers come out of the woodwork to tune in, watching the best Call of Duty teams in the world fight for the lion’s share of a $2.3 million prize. However, viewership still isn’t back to where it was during the first season of the COD League where Champs is concerned:</p>



<ul>
<li>Champs 2020: 331,000</li>



<li>Champs 2021: 238,794</li>



<li>Champs 2022: 275,244</li>



<li>Champs 2023: 294,178</li>
</ul>



<p>Last season, Major III pulled in record-high viewership figures, with a peak count of 335,170 users tuning in to catch the action unfold in Texas. It was an intense tournament that saw Toronto Ultra win a chip, with controversial rookie, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scrap-cdl-adderall-call-of-duty/">Scrap</a>, securing the MVP award. Modern Warfare 2 proved to be a solid title for the CDL, and the COD Champs Grand Final last year saw records broken and dreams shattered – and achieved – in a monumental fashion.</p>



<p>But there’s just no real appetite for it this year, it seems. Modern Warfare 3 was a disappointment, the map pool isn’t inspired, and a lot of beef behind the scenes and on the stage has led to many feeling a bit bummed out overall. We’ve had concerns about abuse in the League this year, and some sketchy updates have flipped the meta around too inconsistently for most players to track.</p>



<p>Will this year’s Call of Duty League Championship, which is being hosted by OpTic Texas, be a success, or will the viewer count drop yet again? We’ll know soon enough – the tournament takes place between July 18 – 21. There’s also an immense conflict at play there – on July 18, the final stages of the Modern Warfare 3 tournament at the Esports World Cup will unfold, adding more strain to the CDL’s viewer count.</p>



<p>Let’s see what happens.</p>

I like to participate in such events, as making a game from scratch in 48 hours is a great way to relax.</p><p>Based on the theme, I came up with the idea of “people running out of energy” and built a simple character who was slumped on a couch. I posted a screenshot of it and got a lot of likes—not because of my modeling skills, but due to the resonance of exhaustion the character exuded.</p><p>I decided to make a game with this exhausted character—so he couldn’t just stay slumped on the couch, he needed to move. We’re all familiar with how our bodies feel when we’re extremely tired, standing up was not an option, so I made him crawl on the floor.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This crawling animation got even more likes. I tested the crawling maneuver on the ground in real life and it hurt all over. But since people liked it, I kept it.</p><p><strong>Crawling Like a Bug</strong></p><p>To crawl, especially on walls, humans need to learn from bugs. First, we made a ladybug that can crawl on any surface in a 3D environment.</p><p>The character’s head could copy the way the ladybug moves, but there was still a long body behind the head to account for. What bug is like that? Caterpillars. So, we implemented a feature named caterpillar bones, responsible for anchoring the body to the environment based on the head’s position. So, when you see a person crawling in the game, it’s actually based on the inner workings of a crawling caterpillar.</p><p><strong>Soft as Noodles</strong></p><p>For a long time, the character’s body was like a normal person’s, with bendy arms and legs split in two. Although he could only crawl, he was at least somewhat human.

With yearly releases and rotating sub-franchises, the games have been a big revenue generator for Activision Blizzard on a near-yearly basis, and have been cemented as the shooter to beat or replicate in the eyes of other publishers. But in the eyes of Microsoft, Call of Duty isn’t just a series to have—it’s worth sacrificing everything else for, including the service that has defined its console for nearly a decade.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Price bumps and tier shifts on Xbox Game Pass beg questions">Price bumps and tier shifts on Xbox Game Pass beg questions</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Earlier this week, Microsoft announced its plans to bump up the prices on multiple tiers of its&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-increasing-price-of-xbox-game-pass-introducing-new-standard-plan-that-ditches-day-one-access">Xbox Game Pass</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> subscription service.

The Treyarch-developed title marks the first game in the series to launch on the service the same day as it releases for $70 on other systems. It’s unclear how that specific game will be handled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/call-of-duty-s-game-pass-debut-eschews-new-sub-tiers">tier-wise</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but it also doesn’t matter: after fighting tooth and nail with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-accepts-microsoft-s-offer-to-keep-call-of-duty-on-playstation-for-a-decade">Sony</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and regulators like the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-wins-ftc-trial-can-proceed-with-activision-blizzard-merger">FTC</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Microsoft finally has the biggest mainstream shooter in the palm of its hands, and it’s going to become a centerpiece of its service.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-blizzard-joins-xbox-game-studios-following-microsoft-acquisition">fully acquired</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Activision Blizzard last year, it was clear that Microsoft really just wanted to add this one particular franchise to its stable. Call of Duty’s always been fairly popular on Xbox, and to Microsoft, this is a golden goose in multiple respects. In the short term, putting the series on Game Pass may finally give the service a significant </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-says-starfield-is-driving-xbox-game-pass-subs">subscriber boost</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that Microsoft has been openly wanting for years. Even if it doesn’t, it gives Microsoft something it hasn’t had in a long time, if ever: a bulletproof franchise. Call of Duty isn’t held hostage by its player base (or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-343-developers-call-out-microsoft-for-mismanaging-i-halo-infinite-i-">itself</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) the same way Xbox's first-party children Halo and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-game-showcase-2024-promises-a-first-party-deluge-at-some-point-">Gears of War</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are. Those two franchises are beholden to their fanbases in a way Call of Duty just isn’t, and Infinity War or Treyarch (and sometimes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sledgehammer-says-modern-warfare-iii-was-labor-of-love-after-crunch-reports">Sledgehammer Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) don’t have to make games that effectively apologize for the previous installment. Quality may fluctuate between Call of Duty titles, but the series nailed general consistency pretty early on and kept that streak going, something you can’t fully say for any Xbox series except </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>maybe </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Forza.</span></p><p>Image via Treyarch/Activision Blizzard.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The quality of Xbox franchises has been erratic compared to those from Sony and Nintendo. It’s something Microsoft is actively aware of; during its legal tussles with the FTC about the merger, Phil Spencer and other executives like Matt Booty practically weaponized internal incompetence as an argument for buying Activision Blizzard. That’s why Xbox’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-owes-everyone-more-context-for-mass-xbox-layoffs">layoffs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> this year across subsidiaries at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-closes-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-alpha-dog-studios">Bethesda</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and other studios angered so many: the “I’m just a little guy” tactic doesn’t work when you’ve spent five or six years buying mid-size studios, then follow those up with grabbing one of the biggest third-party publishers in the world and killing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-killed-ps5-version-of-bethesda-s-indiana-jones-game">multiplatform versions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of their work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for Game Pass? The seven-year-old service now seems like it’s become Microsoft’s one and only lifeline into games, albeit with tears showing in the fabric. Recent years have shown </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/massive-xbox-leak-offers-picture-of-game-pass-deals">how much</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the company is willing to spend on locking down </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-spending-over-1-billion-annually-on-third-party-xbox-game-pass-titles">third-party games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for the service, and the ways it hopes to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-is-heading-to-amazon-tv">draw in</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> more users.

More importantly, the series is so big in part because there are players out there who make it their One release for the holiday season—if not the entire year—and are fine with just handing over $60 or $70 every fall. Game Pass has become so unwieldy that its various tiers and price changes may actively stop someone from signing up for a membership and direct them toward the Xbox Store.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">success was basically written the moment Treyarch entered full development on the game, which begs the question: is all of this worth it? Is complicating Game Pass and axing unrelated studios worth a brief subscriber boost and putting this single game as the 2024 centerpiece of its whole service? In the eyes of the general public, the answer appears to be an emphatic “not really.” But Microsoft is nothing if not determined to steer things in its favor, even if it means bringing the entire house of Xbox down on itself.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/the-yard-days-of-summer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>It’s July, which means for many parts of the world, it’s hot as hell right now. 75 degrees ain’t always 75 degrees, if humidity has anything to say about it. Your solution to the heat might be huddling in the AC with a video game, or heading to the beach. We all deal with summer—with seasons, really—in different ways. But summer and winter, the most extreme of the seasons, are different beasts.</em></p><p><em>Which got Rob and Patrick thinking about summer itself, and how their relationship has changed with it not only over the years, but the decades. Summer as a kid is not summer as an adult. Hell, it’s not the same as summer as a teenager. It’s only three months, but a long three months.</em></p><p><em>For some, it stirs memories of endless hours on summer break, doing whatever you please. For others, it’s toiling in the yard, whether under the lax supervision of parents vainly attempting a new project or playing soldier in the background. You might be able to guess who did the last one.</em></p><p><em>In any case, summer. It's just a season, Michael. How hot could it get?</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Hey Rob, it’s early July. One of the first exchanges you and I had since coming back from the holiday break was about the heat. (It’s okay here right now, sounds like it’s worse by you?) Growing up in the Midwest, I’m used to rapidfire weather changes, and broadly, the heat does not bother me. Humidity sucks, don’t get me wrong, but I think a lot of my indifference—or learned acceptance—has to do with growing up around a pool or lake during huge parts of my life. I associate the warm weather, ironically, with cooling off. I could spend all day in the water, and as we talked about on the HOA podcast this week, chasing that feeling was a huge part of why I poured so much time and effort into getting an above ground pool into our yard this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, when I think back about some of my fondest memories with video games, it’s the summer, especially those years before I was gently—and then more forcibly—encouraged to get a job during those months between school years. It was an opportunity to fully and completely indulge, which is what led me to seeing how far the in-game clock for Final Fantasy VII will keep ticking up and up. For the record, it’s 99 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds, and then you’re on your own. I’m pretty sure I hit that moment while grinding a goofy chocobo mini-game that helped you uncover an ultra-powerful spell in the game, a summon called Knights of the Round.&nbsp;</p><p>Knights of the Round was, in fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv9aI5RkoeQ&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>sick as hell.</u></a> Worth it? Who can say. I was a kid, long before I stumbled into the person I am today, who spends too much time trying to be <em>efficient </em>with time. But I miss those days where I’d just give myself over to a game, usually an RPG, and stay up until the wee hours of the morning, because I didn’t have to get out of bed until closer to noon.</p><p>There was a rhythm to those days, as lackadaisical as they were. When I couldn’t escape from the heat in a giant vat of water, I would escape from the heat inside with a stack of video games.</p><p>Now, I associate summer with being out of sync. With two kids and thus, an increasing pool of social obligations, my summer weekends are booked before May ends. This summer has been <em>particularly </em>out of sync, because I was out of town three weekends in a row—Summer Game Fest, then a funeral, and finally our big in-person stream—and now I’m pairing a Remap company break around July 4th with a family vacation soon after. One third of the summer has already passed by, but it barely feels like I’ve found my footing in one of my favorite seasons.</p><p>The one constant, though, has been my Steam Deck. I know this device is only a few years old, but it’s genuinely hard to imagine my life without it at this point. At least, it’s hard to untangle my relationship with video games without the Steam Deck, because it’s become my summer out of sync device. If I’m on an airplane, I can pull out the Steam Deck. If I’m in a hotel, I can pull out the Steam Deck. If I’m at a gymnastics practice for one of my kids, I can—well, you get the idea.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like it helps me have one foot in one world, while I’m existing in another.</p><p>It may seem like a goofy frustration to express, but part of my adoration of the Midwest—and I’m sure this is true for you on the East Coast—is shifting behaviors in the direction of the seasonal changes. There are only certain things you do, or eat, or <em>play</em>, during parts of the year, and especially when fall and spring are so fleeting, time to make good on those can be precious.</p><p>What’s your relationship with the summer months, and how’s that changed over the years?</p><figure><figcaption><i><em>Infinite Wealth</em></i><span>. Now there's a game that understands how to enjoy the heat.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I used to really hate the heat, so summer was always my least favorite season. I think part of my hatred, though, was the fact my parents loved to press me into helping with yardwork and home maintenance projects that were always murderously boring and actively miserable in the heat. “Go weed underneath the bushes,” they’d tell me, handing me a bucket and a trowel and gesturing at a forty-yard line of vine-invested shrubs that wrapped around part of our lawn. They’d be stunned how long it was taking me, then they’d show me how they would have done it, and I realized that usually it was because they were doing a bad job, missing most of the new shoots of weeds erupting in the topsoil, which is probably why the weeds were thriving more than the bushes.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, the demands for me to do yardwork were replaced by demands I go get a summer job, which I must admit did give me a lot of valuable experiences and exposure to jobs and types of people I might not otherwise have encountered, but is also what led me to taking up smoking. It was also when I began to suspect that my parents no longer really knew how the world worked, perplexed as they were by the fact that simply walking to various shops or cold-calling businesses in the Yellow Pages and politely asking if they needed help did not immediately yield gainful employment.</p>

It’s good, even. It’s the image that accompanied this heartfelt message that has fans making a ruckus.</p><p>The attached graphic includes Chuck, the yellow bird featured in a lot of <em>Angry Birds</em> movies and TV shows.

In the episode, Chuck and <em>Angry Birds </em>protagonist Red are locked in a cage by the evil pigs to make them fuck. This is not an exaggeration, this is literally what happens. They’re trying to get them to make an egg for them to eat. It’s a whole thing. But Chuck blushes at the notion rather than reacting with immediate anger, which some fans read as further evidence of him liking boy birds.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Y’all choose the gayest character to make the ‘straight ally,’” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://@thelameshiver&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://thelameshiver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TheLameShiver wrote</a></span>.</p><p>“THAT BOY IS *NAWT* AN ALLY THAT IS A WHOLE ASS FRUIT BASKET RIGHT THERE,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/FIeshbook/status/1810372940267221165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/FIeshbook/status/1810372940267221165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@FIeshbook said</a></span>.</p><p>“So he’s like the straight friend that swears he’s straight but does the gayest things ever,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AShortGuy_/status/1810669118342983724&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AShortGuy_/status/1810669118342983724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@AShortGuy_ replied</a></span>.</p></blockquote><p>Some fans elected to just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Mista_Blizzard/status/1810692386026111201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Mista_Blizzard/status/1810692386026111201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“fix” the graphic</a></span> by putting the standard Pride flag in the background instead. Doing so would have both likely felt true to fans’ perception of the character over the years while also giving the <em>Angry Birds</em> brand some plausible deniability if they weren’t ready to commit that hard. Some of the responses claiming Chuck isn’t straight have been hidden by the official account, but they were mostly ones that either had profanity or direct references to bangin’. There are also some predictably bigoted responses in the hidden replies, so look through them at your own risk.</p><p>The <em>Angry Birds </em>brand has been incredibly online over the years, using platforms like TikTok to create its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/angry-birds-red-tiktok-smash-pass-sega-sonic-sex-1850368291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/angry-birds-red-tiktok-smash-pass-sega-sonic-sex-1850368291">own versions of popular memes and trends</a></span>.

<p>Jude Bellingham will be the cover star for EA Sports FC 25, but the Ultimate Edition is set to feature several stars, both past and present.</p>



<p>The news first broke of Jude Bellingham being the cover star by Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/LeanDesign_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@LeanDesign_</a>, which has been independently verified by Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>In addition to Jude Bellingham though, Insider Gaming has been sent the Ultimate Edition cover of the game, which features five different stars both past and present. These are (from left to right), Gianluigi Buffon, Aitana Bonmati, Jude Bellingham, Zidane, and David Beckham. The stars are surrounded by various different championship trophies.</p>



<p>Credit is to be given to <a href="https://x.com/AsyFutTrader" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@AsyFutTrader</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Fut_scoreboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@WetDesignFUT</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Fut_scoreboard">@Fut_scoreboard</a> for the find.</p>



<p>It’s unclear when the covers will be officially shared, but as leaks continue to spill, it’s likely to be soon.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the price, editions, and an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access period for EA Sports FC 25</a> were also leaked online.</p>
