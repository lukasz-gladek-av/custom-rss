            <p>Todd Howard recently said that he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-expect-fallout-1-and-2-remakes-from-bethesda-any-time-soon-todd-wouldnt-want-to-paste-over-their-charm">wanted people to experience Fallout 1 and 2 as they were</a>, rather than remake them. Well, this'll make things easier: both games are currently free to keep as part of the Fallout Classic Collection over on the Epic Games Store.
</p>
<p>Fallout Tactics is free, too, but I don't know whether Todd's cruel enough to want people to experience that one as it was.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can head to the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/bundles/fallout-classic-collection">Fallout Classic Collection store page</a> anytime between now and September 5th at 4pm to add the set to your account. Which means that you'll need an Epic account, of course.
</p>
<p>I'm a Fallout 3-and-after heathen, so I can only turn to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-25-favourite-rpgs-of-all-time">your own picks for the best RPGs</a> to tell me that Fallout places at 13 and Fallout 2 at 21. Those are respectable positions for two games that are, frankly, ancient. (Fallout Tactics didn't place.)
</p>
<p>Or perhaps I should look to Edwin, who revisited <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-fallout-is-the-perfect-antidote-to-fallout-fever">the original Fallout and found it the perfect antidote</a> to the fever around the Fallout TV series. He also found it "the hardest to get into", all these years later.
</p>
<p>My parents have been staying with me for the past week and we didn't Fallout even once. On the other hand, I discovered recently that my dog has fleas, so if someone wants to nuke my entire flat, that's fine with me.
</p>
<p>There's a second game currently free over on Epic, and it's Wild Card Football, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/wild-card-football">which you can grab here</a>. It's a knockabout 7-aside arcade American football game, where 150 'Wild Cards' remix the rules with invisibility, stat boosts, flying saucers, and the like. Shades of Brutal Sports Football, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutal_Sports_Football">maybe</a>? Or perhaps that's just me longing for hyperviolence.</p>
<p>For regular updates on what's free, and what's coming next, check out our guide to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-games-free-games-list">all the free games on the Epic Games Store</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To talk more about these changes, <a title="Companies > Gematsu" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gematsu">Gematsu</a> spoke to Marvelous USA and XSEED Games executive vice president Kenji Hosoi at PAX West 2024, where both brands are showcasing a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/marvelous-usa-and-xseed-games-announce-pax-west-2024-lineup">diverse lineup</a>. <span id="more-911433"></span></p><p>Get the full interview below.</p><p><strong>First thing’s first—what was the reasoning behind separating XSEED Games and Marvelous USA into distinct publishing labels?</strong></p><p><strong>Kenji Hosoi, Executive Vice President, Marvelous USA / XSEED Games:</strong> “I think it’s always been slightly confusing for our fans since we were both XSEED Games, as well as Marvelous USA. Even in online comments, sometimes people would refer to us by both names in one sentence, so the brand separation was to mainly clarify which titles fall in the Marvelous category and which ones are XSEED’s. The Marvelous side will consist of titles that are internally developed by our Marvelous dev team—like the <em><a title="Series > Story of Seasons [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/story-of-seasons">Story of Seasons</a></em> and <em><a title="Series > Rune Factory [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/rune-factory">Rune Factory</a></em> series, as well as <em><a title="Games > Daemon X Machina [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/daemon-x-machina">Daemon X Machina</a></em> and others. The titles that we license from external developers and publishers, such as the indie titles <em><a title="Games > Potionomics [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/potionomics">Potionomics</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/sakuna-of-rice-and-ruin">Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin</a></em>, and <em>Freedom Planet</em>, would fall into the XSEED category.”</p><p><strong>I understand differentiating Marvelous content from third-party content, but then you have <a title="Companies > Marvelous Europe [141 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/marvelous/marvelous-europe">Marvelous Europe</a> who is still publishing that third-party content in Europe, and Marvelous the parent company still publishing in Japan. So why is there only that separate in North America, as opposed to just publishing everything as Marvelous USA going forward?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “Unlike Marvelous Europe and Marvelous Japan, our company originated as XSEED Games, and many of our fans have been with us throughout our decades long journey of bringing games from Japan to a western audience from before we teamed up with Marvelous. Many people still think of us as XSEED, so we figured the easiest way to represent both sides of our business was to separate the brand name based on the two types of titles (external or internal dev) we handle.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/XSEED-Games-Interview_08-31-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>So what opportunities do these changes present for XSEED Games in terms of expanding your games lineup? Will we see more third-<a title="Genres > Party [72 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">party game</a> announcements from XSEED Games than usual as a result?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “The brand separation is specifically to clarify which titles will fall under which brand name, so aside from that, our operation itself will not change. As each game we consider for a publishing deal is different, we’ll continue to pick up third-party titles that fit our target audience, expected game quality, and how it performs in our internal title evaluation process. If we get lucky and receive a wave of titles that fits with the XSEED brand, then we’ll have more to publish, but the same logic applies if we are not as lucky in any given year.”</p><p><strong>XSEED Games already has quite the number of upcoming third-party projects. Will these changes affect the way the company approaches partnerships going forward?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “No, not at all. As mentioned previously, there really are no operational changes and we’ll continue doing everything we’ve been doing for the last decade.”</p><p><strong>XSEED Games has published third-party projects from developers big and small. What’s the brand’s process when it comes to actually discovering these games?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “There are multiple avenues by which we discover titles. Sometimes we get direct emails or introductions from industry friends, which is the usual process for many third-party titles developed by bigger companies. Sometimes we’ll receive pitches through our website, though we haven’t had one that’s come through that we’ve actually ended up publishing. Other times, we’d find potential titles at game shows like PAX, Gamescom, Tokyo Game Show, and BitSummit. <em><a title="Games > Cuisineer [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/cuisineer">Cuisineer</a></em>, one of our indie darlings, was actually discovered by our president Ken Berry when he visited PAX East, and then later introduced to our Marvelous Europe office for publishing. Ken meeting the developers <a title="Companies > Edelweiss [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/edelweiss">Edelweiss</a> at BitSummit was also the start of our partnership on <em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin</em>.”</p><p><strong>Does fan demand or feedback play any part in determining which projects XSEED Games decides to sign?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “100 times yes! Like many things in our lives, feedback is some of the most valuable info we get. The more fan love there is for a title, the easier it becomes to make a decision. If there’s a big demand that’s easily measurable like Steam Wishlists, social media follows, Kickstarter pledges, the first step of quantifying market demand is that much easier to do. And if proving market demand is easy, then it becomes easier to prove to decision makers why a game is ‘good.’ The process of convincing someone that a game is good enough to merit the risks inherent in publishing is actually quite hard, and fan feedback brings a very important piece to the table that’s easy to digest for everyone involved.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/XSEED-Games-Interview_08-31-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Can you talk about how your PAX West 2024 lineup is different from previous events with this new distinction between Marvelous USA and XSEED Games?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “On a fan / attendee level, the booth experience will be the same except that we have a massive lineup this time around! From the publishing side it’s helping us to bring more titles than we’ve historically taken, including creating booth experiences for upcoming Marvelous USA titles <em><a title="Games > Farmagia [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/farmagia">Farmagia</a></em> and <em><a title="Games > Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a></em>, as well as a playable demo for <em><a title="Games > Death the Guitar" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/death-the-guitar">Death the Guitar</a></em>. These combined with our big lineup of playable XSEED Games-published titles including <em><a title="Games > Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/corpse-party-ii-darkness-distortion">Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion</a></em>, <em>Cuisineer</em>, <em><a title="Games > Moonlight Peaks [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moonlight-peaks">Moonlight Peaks</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Potionomics: Masterwork Edition [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/potionomics-masterwork-edition">Potionomics: Masterwork Edition</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Slitterhead [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/slitterhead">Slitterhead</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > The Big Catch [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-big-catch">The Big Catch</a></em>, and <em><a title="Games > Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</a></em> has made it a bit of a challenge to fit all in one booth, but it’s one we were eager to take on to make sure fans have the best possible experience when they stop by.”</p><p><strong>XSEED Games once dipped its toes into the <a title="Genres > Visual Novel [450 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a> genre with <em>London Detective Mysteria</em>, but we haven’t seen any visual novel releases since. Would XSEED Games ever consider localizing more visual novels in the future?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “As someone who was really pushing to pick up the <a title="Platforms > PS3 [15,621 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps3">PlayStation 3</a> version of <em>428: Shibuya Scramble</em> back in the day, personally, I wish we could do more visual novels. Unfortunately, that genre of games is very text heavy obviously, and they take a long time to localize. We work on a lot of text heavy games like the <em>Story of Seasons</em> and <em>Rune Factory</em> series, and we just don’t have enough resources at the moment to pick up visual novel titles on a regular basis. If we exponentially grow our localization team in the near future, then it’s definitely possible, but I don’t see how we can handle frequent visual novel releases at this time.”</p><p><strong>With the popularity of <a title="Companies > Vanillaware [192 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/vanillaware">Vanillaware</a> titles, would XSEED Games ever consider remastering <em>Muramasa: The Demon Blade</em> or <em>Grand Knights History</em> for current-generation platforms?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “This is a question we get asked quite frequently at game shows. All I can really say is I wish we could! We’re all fans of Vanillaware, as everyone should be, and both titles mentioned would be a great addition. If we’re ever given the opportunity, it’d be a fun party for us!”</p><p><strong>Are there any plans to localize future projects in more languages such as Brazilian Portuguese and LATAM Spanish?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “Brazilian Portuguese is definitely a language we get asked about once in a while. Given the massive amount of text in some of our games, I’m not sure if it’s cost effective enough for us to keep BP as a default language for all of our games just yet, but we’ve had a few titles we’ve included BP as a localized language, so we’ll definitely be looking more into the LATAM languages as our next expansion in our localization process.”</p><p><strong>It looks like we’re out of time. Thanks so much for talking to us, and enjoy the rest of PAX West!</strong></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you game the schedule the right way, and get your challenges done quickly, you can gain some serious ground as the runner. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The ins and outs of the game don’t really matter, as they explain the rules as they play, so you should go watch it over on YouTube (or Nebula) right now. “Jet Lag” has quickly become one of my favorite shows on the internet over the last year or so, and this season is shaping up to be a pretty intense chase.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-concord-failure-sony-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony, a pillar of the video game industry, recently released a big new multiplayer tentpole game, but you wouldn’t know it based on buzz. <em>Concord</em>, which iterates on the team shooter styles of games like <em>Overwatch </em>and the attitude of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, is struggling to <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2443720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attract even just a couple hundred players</a> at any given moment on Steam, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales estimates</a> on PC and PS5 aren’t great. What happened? And why can a by most measures solid game with a big marketing budget<em> </em>flop during a year that has produced <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-palworld-helldivers-manor-lords-aaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several surprise hits from much smaller studios</a>? On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we discuss that.</p><p>We begin by talking about the first big game of the “fall” video game season:<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>. Despite an enormous budget and a four-year development cycle, reviewers were given just a week to play the gargantuan game <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1828072104350146837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before embargo</a>. Not ideal! We discuss how that impacts the way reviewers play and perceive games.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to <em>Concord</em>, Sony’s new team-based hero shooter that generated more buzz by flopping than by existing in the first place. Why are people so gleeful about tallying up its commercial failings, though? What about the modern internet has broken our brains in this specific way?</p><p>Lastly, on a happier note, we discuss <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em>, the <a href="https://aftermath.site/tactical-breach-wizards-pc-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brilliant not-quite-<em>XCOM</em>-alike</a> that recently rocketed to the top of our game of the year lists. We also pitch several compelling get-rich-quick schemes, including my personal favorite: Replace all executives with babies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can create our own middle-of-the-road triple-A game that chases trends from several years ago. Ours will succeed, though, because we’re built different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>These [kinds of games] are usually somebody’s game. People who play <em>Overwatch </em>play a lot of – if not exclusively – <em>Overwatch</em>. It’s the same with <em>League</em>. It’s the same with <em>Valorant</em>. People play that game. People aren’t gonna leave those other, better games for <em>Concord</em>. It’s not a 20-hour single player game that people can stack up at sale time or put on their pile of shame and come back to later. If you’re not playing this game, this game’s fucked.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> This is also why, if you look at Sony’s stable, its other live service multiplayer game this year was <em>Helldivers</em>. There wasn’t really an analogous experience for that, so people were more willing to hop in and give it a try. Whereas with <em>Concord</em>, you can point to several other, pretty similar games, so people are like “Well yeah, I’m just gonna keep playing those” or move onto playing another of those because they already have player bases, they already have a lot of content, they’re better known, or their friends might already be playing them. In other words, the reasons people check out games.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah, my favorite team shooter to play is <em>Apex Legends</em>, because I cannot get enough of that Respawn gunplay. But I play <em>Overwatch </em>because my friends play <em>Overwatch</em>. We have a group call every Thursday night where we play games together, and we usually end with <em>Overwatch</em>. That’s why I’m an <em>Overwatch </em>player. In the darkest time of my life, I played so much <em>Overwatch </em>that it’s now deeply embedded in my brain. I don’t think I could play another team shooter – at least, not seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>I tried <em>Helldivers</em>, and I had fun, but as the bloom came off the rose and people stopped playing it, I eventually uninstalled it from my PC. That’s just what happens: These games are seasonal. If you want the money faucet to turn on and stay on forever, you have to be something that’s a little different from what’s out there. <em>Overwatch </em>couldn’t sustain itself being Blizzard’s flagship moneymaker product because it couldn’t keep up with the novelty of new games that were coming out. I also have really intense opinions about how they do character balance; I don’t think they do a very good job. But that’s a story for a different time.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> You were talking about having a game night with friends, and I think recent multiplayer hits – like last year’s big example, <em>Lethal Company</em> – show that the meta for how multiplayer games blow up now is word of mouth. And I think it’s sort of been that way since covid [lockdowns in 2020]. <em>Among Us</em> was the canary in the coal mine. It came out before 2020 but had this big surge because of word of mouth and became one of the most popular games out there at that time. <em>Lethal Company</em> was the beneficiary of a similar phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now it’s just sort of how multiplayer games get big. Friend groups move from one game to another, and they’ll say “Hey, everybody else, come join me on this!” Then that game gets really big for a minute. That happened to <em>Helldivers </em>earlier this year. The problem for companies is, it’s really hard to manufacture that, especially when a game is just not demonstrating anything super new or interesting. <em>Concord</em>, again, isn’t. So it didn’t generate that groundswell of interest. It didn’t have people being like “Me and my friends have to check this out. We’ve gotta switch over to this one for a little bit.”</p><p>Without that, I think the floor for how a big-budget multiplayer game can perform – as opposed to the ceiling – is really low now. Even for a game with the marketing power of Sony behind it. You can still wind up with less than a thousand concurrent players on Steam during your launch week, which I think in another era of games would be unheard of. But the way people find out about games and move between them now is so rooted in their friend groups and Steam and Discord that a tiny game can become huge, and a huge game can be tiny, depending on the circumstance.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>That’s such an interesting way to put it, but it’s really true. What I’ve heard from people who work in game development – from all levels of game development, but especially the indies, where you’re responsible for so much more – is that measuring the success of a game or predicting the success of a game is just… nobody knows! Nobody knows what makes a game a hit or not a hit or makes people grab onto an idea or not. Marketing budget certainly has something to do with it. I don’t think <em>Cyberpunk </em>would have gotten to the place where even my husband was like “I think I might check out <em>Cyberpunk</em>” [without it]. And then I had to be like “Homie, I heard some bad stuff about <em>Cyberpunk</em>. I’m so sorry.” I had to sit him down.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> With his fist on his knees, he’s so excited. “I’m sorry, baby. It sucks.”</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>“No, it can’t suck!” But there were billboards everywhere, on the side of every bus and every subway station we went to. We were flying back and forth from LA a lot at the time, and we were seeing <em>Cyberpunk </em>everywhere. Advertising works! But it’s not everything. Word of mouth counts for so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>STALKER 2 has a final release date of November 20, after many delays. The development team at GSC Game World is currently polishing the game as much as possible ahead of that date, but they also have a plan for post-launch support that includes free updates and the announced story DLCs.</p>
<p>Moreover, three major features will be introduced to STALKER 2 after launch. The first is a technical one, hardware ray tracing, which Lead Producer Slava Lukyanenka <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told me</a> is unlikely to be ready for November 20.</p>
<p><em><strong>Slava Lukyanenka:&nbsp;</strong>We are going to have software ray tracing. As for hardware ray tracing, it's too early for us, but we are experimenting with that. We are trying to have it on the release date, but it is highly unlikely you will have it at launch. But NVIDIA DLSS will be there.</em></p>
<p>Lukyanenka is likely referring to Unreal Engine 5's Lumen here, which uses a software ray tracing technique that can optionally be augmented by hardware.</p>
<p>Two more features coming to STALKER 2 with post-launch updates are cross-platform mods and multiplayer. Lukyanenka and PR Specialist Zakhar Bocharov spoke at length about mods, hinting it won't be long until players get this functionality.</p>
<p><em><strong>Slava Lukyanenka:&nbsp;</strong>STALKER is a known franchise not only because of the games but also because of the support from the mod community, which has thrived for the last 15 years, and we don't really want to abandon these people. So, after the release, I can't say when exactly, but we want to do it as close as possible to the release date, we will have the official mod support. We are cooking up some new, interesting initiatives for next year. We are striving to support both PC and console.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, we're actually already supporting them with&nbsp;<span>Mod.io</span>&nbsp;in the original trilogy. I can't confirm whether it's going to be&nbsp;<span>Mod.io</span>&nbsp;or something else for STALKER 2. But the thing is, the modding scene is a little bit of a Wild West right now where you need to download files, replace files, et cetera, so we want to make it structured. There are certain ways on the market to make it structured: Steamworks,&nbsp;<span>Mod.io</span>, and others. We're exploring, we're playing for that, and we want to do it as close to release as possible, but we cannot just guarantee it's going to be on the release, but we are doing our best efforts to be there on time.</em></p>
<p>I got a lot less about multiplayer. GSC Game World always said it would add multiplayer post-launch, and that's still where they're at, it seems.</p>
<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is supposed to be an update after the release. But for now, we're making the single player as polished as possible. Everything connected to multiplayer probably belongs to our post-launch phase, so we just don't have an update on that right now.</em></p>
<p>Further details will have to wait. From the sound of it, though, it's not coming soon after the launch of STALKER 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-beta-zombies/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As someone who spent countless hours playing through the round-based Zombies game mode in past Call of Duty titles, learning about its return in Black Ops 6 had me more excited than the campaign and multiplayer combined. Like many of you, I was ecstatic to hop in and play Zombies, first and foremost, but is it available? Does the Black Ops 6 beta have Zombies?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-zombies-mode-in-the-black-ops-6-beta">Is Zombies Mode in the Black Ops 6 Beta?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately,<strong> the Black Ops 6 beta does not include Zombies</strong>. The beta period—Early Access and Open Beta—will only feature the competitive multiplayer mode. That means anyone most excited about playing the co-op Zombies mode or the single-player campaign must wait until the game’s official launch in October.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s always a chance that Activision runs a Zombies beta, but that seems unlikely. Its primary focus is most definitely on the multiplayer side of things.</p>



<p>That said, there were rumors not too long ago—nothing we can corroborate—that Zombies would launch a week early. If that happens, you’ll know where to find me in mid-October!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-modes-does-the-black-ops-6-beta-offer">What Modes Does the Black Ops 6 Beta Offer?</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 beta proves somewhat limited. It features only a handful of maps, with many fan favorites, such as Skyline, taking center stage. But regarding the beta’s multiplayer modes, you can play:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong></li>



<li><strong>Domination</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hardpoint</strong></li>



<li><strong>Faceoff</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kill Order</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>From firsthand experience with the beta, I can say that all the sweatiest players wind up in Domination or Hardpoint. I had the most fun playing Team Deathmatch.</p>

<p>After spending some time in the game’s competitive multiplayer modes, I can safely say the XM4 is one of my all-time favorite weapons in modern Call of Duty. Here’s a look at all of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xm4-unlocks-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4 unlocks</a>!</p>

<p>There are numerous questions surrounding access to the Black Ops 6 beta, as Activision and Microsoft somehow made the entire event somewhat confusing and convoluted. You can pre-order the game to gain access, but there are other ways to play in the multiplayer beta. So, can you play the Black Ops 6 beta with Xbox Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-xbox-game-pass-give-you-access-to-the-black-ops-6-beta">Does Xbox Game Pass Give You Access to the Black Ops 6 Beta?</h2>



<p><strong>If you subscribe to Xbox Game Pass, you’re in luck because you can access the Black Ops 6 beta</strong>. Three specific monthly plans offer access: Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, and Game Pass Console. If you subscribe to any of these monthly plans, you’ll immediately receive access to the multiplayer beta, which you can download from the Game Pass App.</p>



<p>Oh, and yes, this includes early beta access, not just the Black Ops 6 open beta. With Game Pass, you’ll get the opportunity to play alongside everyone who received a code through giveaways and those who pre-ordered the game, starting on August 30!</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-black-ops-6-open-beta">When is the Black Ops 6 Open Beta?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, the Early Access beta period runs from Friday, August 30, to Wednesday, September 4. After that, the multiplayer servers will close down briefly, allowing for maintenance and whatever else Activision must complete before the open beta begins. The open beta runs from <strong>Friday, September 6, to Monday, September 9</strong>. It’s a short beta period, running the span of a single weekend, but that should offer everyone a chance to test out the game’s competitive multiplayer modes in earnest.</p>

<p>We’re having a fantastic time with the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta so far, though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/use-your-knife-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wielding a knife</a> is proving troublesome to many players who want to race about the arena with a melee weapon!</p>

<p>I don’t know why, but I always prefer the early firearms in Call of Duty—the weapons you receive a few levels into the game or those unlocked for you by default. They’re often the most versatile, especially when unlocking additional attachments. In Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, there’s one rifle that stands the test of time, and we’re going to explore all of the XM4 unlocks here and now!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/31/24232314/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-open-world-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There was a moment in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24230628/star-wars-outlaws-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft’s <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a> when I was scouring the depths of a creepy cave, just after finishing a dogfight in space and winning a card game in a boozy cantina, that the game clicked for me. The usual Ubisoft drudgery, where icons on maps become weights on the brain, was gone. Instead, there was an organic, self-determined flow as to why I chose to leave the frozen wastes of one planet to dig beneath the surface of another.</p><p>Here was a game reacting to my actions: it was an open-world experience I’d never encountered before.&nbsp;</p><p>I felt elated at this realization, with things happening as a result of the consequences of my own gameplay decisions. The game was organically adjusting to my moment-to-moment play. It works because of two clever systems: <em>Outlaws’</em> faction system where you either grow or destroy your reputation with various criminal syndicates, and <em>Outlaws</em>’ unique approach to ability upgrades.</p><p>Kay Vess, the protagonist, forms relationships with all sorts of shady syndicates, all with their own constantly conflicting agendas. As a freelancer, Kay can do missions for any and all of them, but sometimes stealing documents for one faction means undermining an ongoing scheme for another. This raises Kay’s reputation for one and lowers it for the other.</p><p>Higher reputation nets you discounts, access to syndicate-controlled areas, special gifts, and so on. Lower results in the opposite, primarily restricted access to areas and antagonistic reactions from members of the syndicate.</p><p>As an example, the result of a recent mission for the Hutt syndicate meant that if I wanted access to the Pyke syndicate area, I’d have to sneak in. Or, I could find ways to raise my reputation with the Pykes. A new mission centered around stealing or buying an item in the currently restricted Pyke area on the jungle planet of Akiva. Before embarking on the Akiva mission, I decided to improve my reputation with the Pykes. This took me to the underground caves on a distant moon of Toshara because the Pykes wanted an item there.</p><p>The reason I wanted access to the Pykes in the first place was related to Kay’s abilities. <em>Outlaws</em> ties ability upgrades to collecting specific rare gear and performing certain actions; there is no XP to speak of. I was trying to upgrade Kay’s silent takedown, allowing her to stealthily take out harder enemies instantly. Upgrading that skill required stealing or purchasing that item in Pyke territory. And since my reputation was so bad, I was now on a moon doing a mission for the Pykes to improve things.</p><p>This push-and-pull meant that I was traveling to distant planets and choosing missions based on what would improve my moment-to-moment play. I wasn’t following a preordained path, or filling out a checklist, but approaching the world on my own terms.</p><p>The game is structured like this: open-ended but with clear trajectories depending on your goals, cleanly doing away with the usual Ubisoft open-world bloat. Whereas so many of the developer’s other big games, like <em>Far Cry</em> or <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, often felt like ticking boxes, <em>Outlaws</em> provides a slicker but meatier canvas of play due to this depth and variety while allowing player choice to dictate action.</p><p>The game seems to speak directly to so many players’ frustration at the size and drudgery in Ubisoft games, as seen in, most recently, <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em>. <em>Outlaws</em> really does feel as if my experience and choices not only matter but are part of the system. The world reacts, alignments shift, my choice of task changes. While there are legitimate complaints about its stealth system feeling underbaked and missions effectively repeating themselves, my own experience was one of constant joy, due precisely to the ebb and flow of the systems I could play with.</p><p>I didn’t realize how badly I wanted an open world that was actually this reactive until I played <em>Outlaws</em>. Yes, there’s some jank and instability, but by Picard’s beard, it is a blast to play with these systems, with the freedom ripe for manipulation of a gunslinging outlaw like Kay.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
