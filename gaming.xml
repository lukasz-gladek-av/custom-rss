The years pass and the animals perish and the oceans rise and the wealth gap widens and I repeatedly think to myself through a fug of nitrogen oxide, Steam discounts and microplastic sediment, “man, those Oddworld games were excellent, weren’t they”. If you've yet to have the pleasure, you can scoop up the entirety of the squalid anti-capitalist satire universe on <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/oddworld-complete-collection">Fanatical</a> right now for a pound or dollar. It's been a while since I read Theses on Feuerbach, but I'm pretty sure that counts as praxis?

<p>
Released in 1997 for the PlayableStation, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddworld-abes-oddysee">Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee</a> is the story of a Mudokon meat factory worker with his mouth sewn shut who overhears plans to convert the entire workforce into popsicles. It’s a single-screen 2D platformer in which your skills consist of jumping, pulling levers, communicating by means of a once-touted GameSpeak system, farting, and praying.</p>

<p>Oh, how you’ll pray, for you have all the offensive capacity and resilience of a McDonalds salad. Threats include gun-toting Sligs and their miniature T-Rex guard dogs, handsy herds of Paramites, and the viciously territorial Scrabs. The nearest you get to fighting back is possessing the bodies of other creatures and making use of their capabilities.
</p>
<p>
Survival rests on manipulating the puzzle-game workings of each screen so as to bypass or isolate dangers, often by the skin of your teeth.  Death is frequent, and gruesomely funny. Abe might be gaming’s ultimate fallguy. Also funny: watching a crowd of Mudokons squeakily tip-toe past a sleeping sentry. Aside from getting the hell out of Rupture Farms, the game calls on you to play a mixture of local messiah and union organiser – commanding and guiding your fellow labourers to mystic portals formed by flocks of birds, while trying not to get them mulched, eaten, blown up, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddworld-abes-exoddus">Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus</a> is in some ways a remake, fleshing out the Mudokon communication aspect and turning in a grander plot involving a ghastly new mind-altering soft drink. Mudokons now have emotional states - they'll get angry, wired, depressed or sick, which means you now have to worry about your allies running around giggling or getting into possibly-fatal slapfights. I think Exoddus is the better game than Oddysee, the one they really wanted to make, but they’re both excellent, with tumid, desolate industrial environments made up of pipes and chasms and LED displays.</p>
<p>The later Oddworld games are more of a mixture. Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is the standout, a cult Wild Western shooter in which your bullets are squirming critters. Oddworld: Munch's Oddyssey is an imperfect departure into full 3D platforming. I never got round to playing the 2.5D series reboot <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddworld-soulstorm">Oddworld: Soulstorm</a>, but I hear it's a bit ropey.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure I need a new Oddworld game right now, but I’d like to play more games that recall this particular blend of gallows humour, apocalyptic gloom and ingenuity. If you’d like to recommend an Oddworld spiritual successor, I’m all ears.

<p>Square Enix celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Kingdom Hearts series in 2022. Kingdom Hearts 4 was unveiled during the special presentation, showing us how glorious a next-gen KH could look, but the project has gone quiet since.</p>



<p>I have played Kingdom Hearts 1 to death, and it’s one of my favourite games ever. Sequels have grabbed my attention, but a warmth resides in me when I think of KH1. Recent Kingdom Hearts titles have so many narrative strands weaving about all over the place that it’s hard to keep up sometimes, but there’s no mistaking the brilliance of the franchise. </p>



<p>Director Nomura Tetsuya has said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-is-heading-towards-the-conclusion-of-the-series-says-game-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 4 is heading toward the end of the series</a>. But many players want to know what they’re getting with Kingdom Hearts 4 before they contemplate the future.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-news-on-kingdom-hearts-4-release-date">No News on Kingdom Hearts 4 Release Date</h2>

<p>The April 10, 2022, Kingdom Hearts 20th Anniversary Celebration featured trailers for new KH games. The final announcement was for <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-iv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, and featured a set-piece battle between Sora and a skyscraper-sized Heartless boss.</p>



<p>It ends with a comical cameo featuring Donald and Goofy. Those closing moments were the last we’d see for three years. We reported in 2024 that a leaker had outed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 release date for Kingdom Hearts 4</a>. We’re a third of the way through 2025, and still have heard nothing—making this report feel thinner by the day.</p>



<p>The only thing Square Enix has said about KH recently is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-series-is-coming-to-steam-in-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts is finally coming to Steam</a>. It’s at the point now where I’d forgotten KH4 exists until I saw social media today. In today’s ever-evolving and fast-paced game industry, it’s hard to believe it’s been three years since Kingdom Hearts 4 was announced.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has confirmed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> editions of original first-party Switch games will have the full game on the card rather than requiring a download - though that may not be the case for third-party titles.</p>
<p>Since the Switch 2's reveal last week, there's been some confusion about what exactly will be included on physical game cards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">Nintendo previously stated the console will support both regular game cards and game-key cards</a>, with the latter being a "key" to downloading the full game. It's unclear at present which games will use which card type.</p>

<p>However, further confusion specifically arose around Switch 2 Edition games and whether the card would include both the original game and the upgrade package.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/">Vooks</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson said: "Physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (ie. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code)."</p>
<p>They added: "Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card."</p>
<p>This confirms the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> will be complete on the game card. Third-party publishers may still opt for download codes, though.</p>
<p>These Switch 2 Edition games upgrade the originals with new features to make use of the new console's capabilities, be it improved frame rates or camera usage. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">They will cost £65 here in the UK</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-closer-look-at-kirby-and-the-forgotten-lands-remixed-switch-2-worlds">Kirby and the Forgotten Land will include expanded worlds</a>, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will have mouse control support.</p>
<p>No matter what's on the game card, though, don't lick them - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-games-will-still-taste-so-bad-you-will-want-to-spit-them-out">Nintendo has confirmed the cards still purposefully taste awful</a> to stop players eating them.</p>

<p>Upgraded Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games have been confusing because of their contents, but Nintendo has clarified that they don’t include download codes, and everything is on the game cartridge.</p>



<p>The physical and digital media conversation is louder than ever. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost-physical-digital-game-prices-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2’s increased game costs</a> have made physical media the costliest it’s ever been. But when players are paying for physical media and receiving digital media instead, it sends mixed signals.</p>



<p>There’s been unrest and understandable headscratching over the Switch 2’s games and what you get. There’s been talk of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/not-all-nintendo-switch-2-games-include-game-on-cartridge-despite-prices-of-up-to-90/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$90 physical Nintendo Switch 2 games</a> giving you a code instead of a game cartridge. One thing we know for sure is that if you buy a Switch 2 Edition release, you don’t get a code.</p>



<h2 id="h-switch-2-edition-games-have-everything-on-the-game-cartridge">Switch 2 Edition Games Have Everything on The Game Cartridge</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All-in-one convenience. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vooks</a>, Nintendo addressed Switch 2 game cartridge concerns: “That physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will <strong>include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card</strong> (i.e. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code).”</p>



<p>So, if you’re buying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild</a> Switch 2 Edition, you get the game’s box and a cartridge inside with the full upgraded version of the RPG—<strong>no code required or included</strong>.</p>



<p>However, Nintendo did clarify that this applies to first-party exclusives: “Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card.” We’ve seen this before with Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Black Flag and Rogue bundle featuring a physical case and a download-only code inside it.</p>

            <p>It's hard to imagine, but Mario Kart: Double Dash's two-player driving mechanic <em>almost </em>didn't happen!</p>
<p>As I am sure you know, in Mario Kart: Double Dash, rather than only choosing one character to plop into a kart of your choosing, players instead select two characters to ride in a kart together, with one at the back and one at the front.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo was anxious about introducing this mechanic into the Mario Kart series, so also worked on a "single-driver version" in tandem with the doubled-up driver version we all know today.</p>

<p>That's according to a 2003 interview with Mario Kart: Double Dash's developers, which first featured in Nintendo Dream magazine but has been freshly translated by <a href="https://shmuplations.com/doubledash/">Shmuplations</a>. Within this interview, producer Shinya Takahashi explained that "since Mario Kart has always been more of a party game", the team's "point-of-departure for the development was thinking about what new multiplayer gameplay mechanics we could add, and specifically what new mechanics we could add if the karts had two drivers".</p>
<p>However, the Double Dash team wanted to ensure it was innovating the series, "while not destroying what makes Mario Kart unique". The producer added this was "a monumental challenge" for those working on the game. Fellow producer Tadashi Sugiyama added Mario Kart had already turned into a "flagship title for Nintendo", and "each console has to have its own Mario Kart" title.</p>
<p>"Well, of course it's going to sell big, it's Mario Kart! - that pressure is huge," Sugiyama said, noting creating a game like this comes with "all these expectations" and the team had to "add something new" to the formula.</p>
<p>"The 'two drivers' concept, therefore, was something we came to at the end of a veryyy long process of brainstorming. We were a little worried about it though, so at first we were developing a single-driver version too, in parallel with the two-driver development," Sugiyama revealed, with Takahashi joking this was the Double Dash team's "emergency escape hatch" should all else fail.</p>
<p>"But in the end, owing I think to the majority of our staff who really wanted to do something new, we consolidated the development into just the two-driver concept," Sugiyama said</p>
<p>That isn't to say it wasn't still challenging to implement, and according to chief director Kiyoshi Mizuki, the best part of a year was spent working out that two-driver mechanic.  "We tried all sorts of stuff," Mizuki said.</p>
<p>One idea floated around for a while was to include sidecars, which immediately made me picture a Wallace and Gromit/Two Fat Ladies racer, which is perhaps making me show my age. Anyway, back to the interview in hand!</p>
<p>"Normally when one thinks of two people in a car, you think of a driver and passenger seat side-by-side. But for Mario Kart, that would end up making the karts too wide. Can you imagine eight massive karts lined up like that," Sugiyama quipped.</p>
<p>Takahashi added the developers "messed around with the positioning a lot", and eventually settled on "having them ride behind you" but this led to another issue - not being able to see both drivers. The solution? "To let you swap the drivers at any time," Sugiyama closed, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>

<p>The Mario Kart reign remains strong, and the arrival of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will also hail in the latest series entry: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. Unlike Mario Kart games of old, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">World will include the ability to drive basically anywhere and a whopping 24 drivers can compete in a race</a>.</p>
<p>Our Tom has already taken the upcoming game for a whirl, calling Mario Kart World "undoubtedly Switch 2's killer app" and one he can't wait to play more of.</p>
<p>"Mario Kart World's reinvention of the series may be a gamble, but it's absolutely one I think will pay off. With a web of possible routes and hours of time likely to be spent exploring every corner of its highways, deserts and mountains - or racing to stay ahead of the competition in Knockout Tour - it's just as well the game's a Switch 2 launch title," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Eurogamer's Mario Kart World preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/10/do-the-game-is-a-new-docu-series-charting-10-chambers-path-through-den-of-wolves-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the clearest benefits of the modern world is the ability to dig into your interests and hobbies in a way that would never have been possible before. That said, game development remains something of a secret society, hushed tones and controlled PR encounters sometimes making it seem as though games blossom into being, ready to play. Common sense says that’s not the case, and 10 Chambers are providing us with the opportunity to see what game development is truly like, with ‘Do The Game’ charting the Stockholm-based studio’s path through their latest game’s development.</p>
<p><iframe title="DO THE GAME | Game Dev Docu-Reality TV Series | Official Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7tVu_YEEGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That game is Den of Wolves, the spiritual successor to their earlier work on GTFO, Payday 1 and Payday 2. We were lucky enough to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/den-of-wolves-throws-an-inception-sized-wrench-into-the-multiplayer-heist-genre/">hands-on with it a couple of weeks ago</a>, and it already looks like it could be a big multiplayer hit for the team when it launches sometime in the near future.</p>
<p>10 Chambers, founded by Ulf Anderson, Oscar J-T Holm, Simon Viklund and Anders Bodbacka, are a team built on pragmatism, and a family feud that saw Ulf and his brother go their separate ways. That reality, that emotional grounding, sets the groundwork for Do The Game, and the team wanted the documentary to show the gritty reality of game development, through turmoil, struggles and successes rather than sugarcoat that process as many pre-release showcases would.</p>


<p>“With our previous success of GTFO and now working on a major title like Den of Wolves, it might seem glamorous,” says Oscar J-T Holm, Co-Founder at 10 Chambers. “However, growing a company while building a game can be incredibly stressful and create tension even between long-time friends. Through this Docu-Reality series, we aim to provide a brutally honest look behind the scenes of all this.”</p>
<p>With Do The Game, 10 Chambers is inviting the world to witness the untold reality of game development—the chaos, passion, and pressure of trying to make history. Ulf Anderson’s contribution? “I hate making this documentary”, he says.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more on Do The Game, and Den of Wolves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/days-gone-remastered-gets-horde-assault-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-is-reportedly-getting-a-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> has received a new trailer for the Horde Assault mode ahead of the game's launch set for April 25. Kevin McAllister, Creative &amp; Product Lead at developer Bend Studio, also shared new information on Horde Assault in a dedicated <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/days-gone-remastered-a-closer-look-at-the-horde-assault-modes-survival-arcade-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The 'survival arcade' mode was designed to challenge the players' skills as they attempt to beat their high score while surviving as long as possible against increasing horde sizes and various enemies such as Breakers, Reachers, and Raging Bears. In Horde Assault, players start with only a sidearm and must fight their way through the initial Freaker onslaught to reach Deacon St. John's Drifter Bike, an invaluable tool for traversing the open region.</p>
<p>Raiding the supply crates scattered across the map is crucial to increasing your chances of survival. There are more than 20 weapons available, including a new flamethrower not available in Story mode. The weapons that drop from each crate are random and reset each time you start a new game.</p>
<p>You may also replenish your supplies and earn extra XP by completing side quests. Also, if you manage to survive 30 minutes on any map, you will be treated to the Ultimate Horde, a never-ending horde battle that will relentlessly hunt you down.</p>
<p><iframe title="Days Gone Remastered - Horde Assault Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9BJ5L-TIK1E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As players level up Deacon St. John, they can earn in-mode rewards with never-before-playable characters, new patch cosmetics, and unique Injectors. Speaking of those, Days Gone players will already be familiar with the benefits of Injectors from the main story. This idea carries over to Horde Assault, but now with a big boost to drastically change gameplay in the form of modifiers. Throughout your journey to Legendary Survivor, you can earn a total of 24 unique Injectors - 12 positive and 12 negative. Positive Injectors provide a positive boost to your score but increase the challenge. Negative Injectors will penalize your score but increase your chance of survival with gameplay benefits.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploding Freakers – Upon death, Freakers will explode. You need any advantage you can get when facing increased horde sizes, and this Injector is a unique way to trim its numbers.</li>
<li>Wanted – Start at maximum heat level. In Horde Assault, the longer you survive, the more difficult your chances of survival become. With this Injector, that escalation difficulty system begins immediately, proving to be a real challenge that only the strongest will survive.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Days Gone Remastered, as players go through Horde Assault mode, they'll progress through a Reward path of 35 levels. Each level earns them a reward, such as Injectors, character skins, and patch cosmetics, and six never-before-playable additional characters from Days Gone: O’Brian, Lisa, fan-favorite Skizzo, and more.</p>
<p>On PlayStation 5, this new edition of the game also comes with graphical enhancements, full DualSense support, new accessibility features and enhanced Photo Mode. PlayStation 4 and PC owners of the base game can purchase the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3238470/Days_Gone__Broken_Road_DLC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broken Road DLC</a> for $10, accessing Horde Assault as well as Permadeath mode and Speedrun mode.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/days-gone-drifting-through-the-apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loved</a> Days Gone at launch. Unfortunately, a pitch for a sequel was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected</a>. In theory, a movie should be in production, although there haven't been any official updates on that front <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-film-adaptation-on-the-way-game-creators-arent-happy-with-cast-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since August 2022</a>. Meanwhile, Bend Studio had its next project, an open world multiplayer game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> a couple of months ago.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has responded to a lawsuit over the shutdown of its racing game The Crew, stating players purchased a "limited license to access the game" as opposed to "unfettered ownership".</p>
<p>The game was taken offline in March last year, becoming unplayable due to its online requirements. Despite being 10 years old and essentially replaced by a successor, the decision sparked concern over both consumer rights and game preservation.</p>
<p>In November last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sued-over-controversial-the-crew-shutdown">fans filed a lawsuit in California against Ubisoft</a>, stating players were unaware they owned only a licence to the game. Ubisoft responded in February, in a filing seen by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games">Polygon</a>, to dismiss the case.</p>

<p>The filing, from Ubisoft's lawyers, states the company "allegedly misled purchasers of its video game The Crew into believing they were purchasing unfettered ownership rights in the game, rather than a limited license to access the game".</p>
<p>"But the reality is that consumers received the benefit of their bargain and were explicitly notified, at the time of purchase, that they were purchasing a license," it reads.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's lawyers claim plaintiffs have applied a "kitchen sink approach on behalf of a putative class of nationwide customers" and alleged eight causes of action including false advertising and unfair competition. In response, they believe there has been no real "cognisable injury".</p>
<p>Plaintiffs then responded in March with an amended complaint and an additional accusation around gift certificates. Sales of the game's currency, they argued, could be considered a gift certificate and in California, gift certificates can't expire - yet with the game shut down, the in-game currency has expired.</p>
<p>Further, photos of the packaging from the plaintiffs reveal the activation code for the game doesn't expire until 2099, which they claim is how Ubisoft "implied that [The Crew] would remain playable during this time and long thereafter". As such, they believe the statute of limitations has not expired.</p>
<p>Ubisoft now has until 29th April to respond once again.</p>
<p>After shutting down the game's servers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-killing-the-crew-ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes">Ubisoft retroactively added offline modes to other games in the series</a>.</p>
<p>One group of modders, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back">recreated the server-side software needed to play The Crew online once again</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-selling-switch-2-consoles-us-at-a-loss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed by a securities analyst that Nintendo could be shaping up to sell every Switch 2 console ‘at a loss’ based on the estimated costs of the bill of materials. This is because of the recent tariffs imposed by the United States government, and it’s assuming that they stay at 10%.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-uneven-ground">Uneven Ground</h2>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-10/nintendo-s-pivotal-switch-2-launch-boosted-by-trump-tariff-pause?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Bloomberg</a>, the scope of the financial situation surrounding Nintendo and Trump’s tariffs came into question.</p>



<p>Hideki Yasuda of Toyo Securities in Japan explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We believe the Switch 2’s bill of materials is around $400, meaning Nintendo would still be selling consoles at a loss in the US with the 10% tariff — but the loss would be something Nintendo would be able to absorb.</p>



<p>Sony is in a tougher situation as most of its PlayStation production is in China, and it may be forced to hike PS5 prices in the US in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2’s price point is much higher than that of the first console, released in 2017, but Nintendo recently went on record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-why-switch-2-so-expensive/">explaining why that is</a>. It’s all to do with the quality of the offering and the upgrades over the first console – and inflation also weighs into the debate.</p>



<p>In the Bloomberg report, Bernstein’s Robin Zhu explained how Nintendo could raise prices if the tariffs escalate:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If the tariffs stay at 10%, Nintendo probably keeps pricing at $450 and just takes the hit on margin.</p>



<p>At 46% Vietnam tariffs, I expected them to raise by $50 to $100.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These tariffs are wreaking havoc on the pre-order situation in the United States and Canada. Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been put on hold as manufacturers and retailers across the region contend with what might happen next.</p>

			<p>South of Midnight is a special game, for any number of reasons. Arresting art direction, a strong black female lead, a South American folklore-inspired tale, it also stands amongst the quite suddenly reinvigorated first-party line-up from Microsoft and Xbox. Here it’s the turn of Compulsion Games to weave a fantastical and mesmerizing adventure, joining Avowed and Indiana Jones and The Great Circle at the newfound pinnacle of Xbox gaming.</p>
<p><iframe title="South of Midnight | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nEZg6TYJTl4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Our central character is Hazel, a track star who lives with her mama in Prospero, a fictional town in the American South. They’re surrounded by nature, their house sitting on concrete stilts next to a river, but when a downpour causes the river to swell, the house is swept away with Hazel’s mama inside, forcing Hazel to set off on a magical journey of self-discovery.</p>


<p>It turns out that track star Hazel is a Weaver. These mystical female icons have previously served as leaders and protectors, drawing on the powers of weaving to restore the natural order and release spirits back to where they belong. Through South of Midnight’s 12-hour runtime, you’ll unravel various mysteries centred around Hazel’s family, as well as the personal tales of the people living in the area.</p>
<p>Hazel is led through the discovery of her powers via visions of the past, watching Mahalia, the last Weaver of Prospero, lead former slaves out of bondage. Their ghostly forms, a husband, wife and small boy, are being hunted, and their fear is palpable.</p>

<p>It’s one of the best narrative framings for a tutorial I’ve come across, adding tension and emotion, despite it being a reenactment of the past. When other games make these sections frictionless and rote, Compulsion make it clear that storytelling is at the heart of South of Midnight, and that they’ll make use of every possible moment they have with a player.</p>

<p>As Hazel’s skills grow, you learn and understand more about the people of this fictional bayou, and their pain. South of Midnight wants you to empathise, to understand, and to inhabit the culturally and emotionally disparate group of characters, and it does a fantastic job of making every moment feel personal.</p>
<p>South of Midnight is a modern fairytale. There are magical trappings, a journey of self-discovery, and the knowing sting of multiple tails waiting to surprise you. Hazel is strong, opinionated and believable, and you want to take this journey through folklore and history with her.</p>
<p>That’s helped by South of Midnight’s striking visual style, mixing stop-motion techniques with traditional digital animation. It looks phenomenal, and my only wish is that they leaned even harder into the off-kilter hand-made look. At times, it feels too smooth during the moment-to-moment gameplay, but I imagine they settled on this for easier locomotion, and probably not giving players too much to deal with visually.</p>
<p>The creature design, in particular, is stunning, giving life and character to some truly incredible monsters. Early on, you’ll love meeting the Creole Catfish, his low frame rate animation and Southern drawl setting the tone for the rest of your journey. It’s not all about the scene-stealing giant creations though, and the little stop-motion turtles, foxes and possums that populate the world also help to make it feel as though you’re playing through an animated movie.</p>

<p>South of Midnight isn’t shy about flinging powers and abilities at you, and your toolkit of ways to deal with knotted strands, giant briars and malevolent creatures soon fills up. Mechanically, South of Midnight isn’t quite as ground-breaking as its visuals and storytelling might have you expect, but this is a solid and enjoyable third-person adventure, with Hazel leaping, gliding and fighting her way through a series of visually arresting areas.</p>
<p>If anything, the combat here reminds me of Hellblade, in that there’s a limited number of enemies, and they often just serve as gates to the next area you’re going to explore. Still, I found it enjoyable perfectly timing dodges and flinging enemies around the small combat arenas, but it’s solid, rather than spectacular. There’s more than enough challenge to it to keep you on the edge of your seat, and it limits the unfair moments where you might feel that you were beaten by the camera rather than your skill set.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Hazel borrows from Lara Croft’s toolkit, ably climbing across painted sections of wood, or a handily aligned row of fungi growing from a tree. She can glide like Link, or wall run like the Prince of Persia, but there are few moments where your interaction with Hazel feels wholly new.</p>
<p>You’re here for the lore, the visuals and the storytelling. The audio is also fantastic, with energetic, emotional voice acting – all delivered with some wonderfully authentic-sounding Southern accents – and music that lilts between dark, unsettling tones before turning to hopeful acoustic moments and surprising vocal interludes. I loved it, and you should absolutely check out Olivier Deriviere’s full soundtrack as soon as you can, though it might give a few things away narratively.</p>

			<p>When buying Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games at retail, customers won't need any further downloads, at least if the games have been published by Nintendo. The same may not necessarily be true for third-party publishers, though. The lingering question was finally answered by a company spokesperson in a statement <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Vooks.net</a>:</p>
<p><em>The physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (i.e., they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code). Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card.</em></p>
<p>So far, the following games will allow customers to upgrade:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild ($69.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom ($79.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (currently unknown price)</li>
<li>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Switch 2 + Star-Crossed World ($79.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV ($79.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma (third-party; $69.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A (currently unknown price)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as many had assumed, Nintendo also confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will not include that game's Expansion Pass. Following the launch, Nintendo released two DLCs: The Master Trials and The Champions' Ballad. It is presently unclear, although likely, if players will be able to purchase them separately on the new console.</p>

			<p>There are a lot of fantastic sights and sounds to take in on Hazel's journey to the small town of Prospero. But there's also plenty to read as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> shines brightest with its storytelling, and that includes all the little notes you can find along your journey. Each of them adds a bit of context to the events you're experiencing and learning about.</p>
<p>They can also add a welcomed dose of historical context at times, digging into some of the tragedies that people in this fictional town faced that pull from real-life horrors. That's why it's well worth your time to seek out all 103 notes you can read in South of Midnight.</p>
<p>Starting with Chapter 1, we'll take you through where to find every single note.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 1</h2>
<p>There are only 3 notes to find in the first chapter of the game, and they're all in Bunny's house. So don't worry about looking around for anything until Hazel wakes up in Bunny's house after the night of the storm.</p>
<p><strong>Bunny's note to Lily on tea</strong> - You can find this note in the room where Hazel wakes up. Look to your right, where you'll see a desk and a mirror. On that desk is the first note and the first layer of Bunny's character beginning to unravel.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Notes-Guides-Chapter-1-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Bunny's journal entry, 1982&nbsp;</strong>- This note and the next are both in the same room, Bunny's office. You'll climb into this room by climbing the ledges around the house, and you'll find this note on the desk to your left when you enter the room.</p>
<p><strong>Bunny's journal entry, 1989 &amp; 2003</strong> - You'll find these two journal entries as one note on the red chair, immediately in front of you when you enter Bunny's office.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>And that's all the notes for Chapter 1 in South of Midnight. Only 100 more to go!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-almost-1-billion-dollars-raised/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Star Citizen, from Cloud Imperium, is one of the most bizarre projects you’ll ever lay your eyes on. In 2012, Cloud Imperium kickstarted a crowdfunded project to bring Star Citizen to life, and within a couple of months, millions of dollars had been raised to support the development of this space-faring epic.</p>



<p>Today, the game still hasn’t been ‘released,’ and it still sits in alpha. Recently, the team at Cloud Imperium passed the <strong>$800 million mark </strong>on the crowdfunding (and sales) scale, moving ever closer to the almighty and ludicrous $1 billion mark.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-burning-money">Burning Money</h2>



<p>In October 2024, our Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secured a monumental exclusive report</a> from within Cloud Imperium, diving deep into the company’s culture and the decade-long development cycle of Star Citizen.</p>



<p>It came off the back of a new working mandate that forced employees to grind their asses off to hit deadlines for a time. The report delved into financial updates that suggested the hundreds of millions of dollars the company had raised had been poured into developing the title and that the financial outlook for the firm was ‘bleak’ at best.</p>



<p>Then came the layoffs.</p>



<p>We heard from those inside CIG that the creative processes internal to the company weren’t working and that even the minutest of details were taking <strong>days </strong>to be decided on because of poor creative control and micromanagement.</p>



<p>In January, CIG’s founder, Chris Roberts, stated that the team is ‘closer than ever’ to hitting that 1.0 release mark, but there are still no timelines or indicators to suggest when that will happen. Until then, players will keep pouring in their pledges, donations, subscriptions, and purchases, some of which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-legatus-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can sell for as much as $48,000</a>.</p>



<p>It’s possible to track the trajectory of <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/funding-goals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Star Citizen’s financials</a> through the official site, where it’s revealed that, at the time of writing, $802,335,704 has been raised or earned by the project.</p>



<p>Have you ever invested any cash in Star Citizen, and are you jonesing for the 1.0 release to hit? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov%E2%80%99s-first-battle-pass-is-here-and-it-has-more-than-100-rewards-to-claim.1160115/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games has unveiled the first battle pass in the Tarkov universe – Season 0. It’s available exclusively in Escape from Tarkov: Arena, the multiplayer, session-based spin-off that was released in December 2023. It’s a solid staging ground to gauge the responses of players before something similar could be introduced for the core extraction shooter, though.</p>



<p>The Season 0 Battle Pass has more than 100 unique rewards, ranging from custom tactical clothing to masks and from GP coins to supply crates for Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-the-tarkov-arena-battle-pass-free">Is the Tarkov Arena Battle Pass Free?</h2>



<p>That’s the question on the minds of Tarkov players worldwide, and <strong>yes</strong>, the Season 0 Battle Pass is completely free to access and grind.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that the 100+ tier battle pass will be progressable entirely through Escape from Tarkov: Arena, but there will be rewards that apply to both that game and the foundational extraction shooter title.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov: Arena - 0.3.0 BattlePass Season 0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQAYSNYVAvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>As soon as you start your path with the Season 0 Battle Pass, you’ll unlock exclusive tactical outfits available in <strong>both </strong>Escape from Tarkov: Arena <strong>and </strong>Escape from Tarkov, and even PvE players can take advantage of the new loot.</p>



<p>BSG <a href="https://arena.tarkov.com/news/patch-0300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has advised</a> that not <strong>everything </strong>will be available in PvE, as the synchronisation mechanics between EFT: Arena and PvE mode aren’t yet complete – Ref doesn’t exist in that vertical, for instance.</p>



<p>Players will have two months to grind through the Season 0 Battle Pass, but it has been suggested that the timeline might be extended, depending on feedback.</p>



<p>Also, everything you unlock in the battle pass, including ‘Battle Pass Currency’, will be persistent through Tarkov and Tarkov Arena’s regular wipes.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to grinding the Season 0 Battle Pass? Let me know in the comments.</p>

It’s a game set to launch alongside the Switch 2 in June that offers a guided tour of the console itself in video game form.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is described as a "virtual exhibition" of the new hardware. Per Nintendo: "through tech demos, minigames and other interactions, players will get to know the new system inside and out in ways they may never have known about otherwise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Direct showed footage of a small player avatar exploring a super-sized Switch 2, reading about the different features and facts about the console. It also includes mini-games such as Speed Golf, Dodge the Spiked Balls, and a Maracas Physics Demo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-will-be-a-paid-tour-of-your-new-nintendo-switch-2"><u>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</u></a> costs $9.99 and is a digital-only product. That’s significantly cheaper than other Switch 2 games, but IGN has already reported to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-would-you-make-people-pay-for-that-nintendos-decision-to-charge-for-switch-2-tutorial-game-welcome-tour-sparks-backlash"><u>the complaints from some Nintendo fans that Welcome Tour costs money at all</u></a>, with many saying it should be a Switch 2 pack-in, as DualSense tech demo game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astros-playroom-ps5-review"><u>Astro's Playroom</u></a> was for PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Fils-Aimé has tweeted three clips from IGN’s two-year-old interview with the former Nintendo executive in which he discussed the internal battle he had with legendary developer Shigeru Miyamoto to get Wii Sports as a free pack-in for the hugely successful Wii console.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the first clip, Fils-Aimé says "it is an understatement to say that Mr. Miyamoto pushed back” on the call to make Wii Sports a Wii console pack-in. As we know, this is a battle Fils-Aimé won to a degree, with Wii Sports bundled with the Wii everywhere except Japan.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The story of Wii Sports pack in ...<a href="https://t.co/LhflSFWaL3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/LhflSFWaL3</a></p>— Reggie Fils-Aimé (@Reggie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reggie/status/1910052940242620563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The second interview clip Fils-Aimé tweeted pointed to a similar battle to bundle Wii Play with the Wii Remote. In the clip from our interview, Fils-Aimé revealed he “pissed off” Miyamoto once again with the suggestion. “He was not happy about that either.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, tweeting “and the results,” Fils-Aimé clipped out the section from our interview in which he reveals that all this was, ultimately, the right call.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the Americas and in Europe Wii Sports was packed in with the Wii proposition. It was not in Japan, which created a bit of a test market. It was obvious that in the markets where Wii Sports was packed in that we became much more of a phenomenon. Wii Sports itself became much more of a phenomenon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We did pack the Remote with Wii Play. And it became the fifth best-selling piece of software in the history of the Wii.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">And the results.<a href="https://t.co/xrFTDeJMQf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/xrFTDeJMQf</a></p>— Reggie Fils-Aimé (@Reggie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reggie/status/1910052943690150239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s clear to see what Fils-Aimé is doing here. Although he’s not directly commenting on Nintendo’s Switch 2 strategy, he is making the point that free pack-ins have worked in the past for Nintendo consoles,so it stands to reason that it would do so again for Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans know what’s up, too. “Hahaha, guys I think Reggie is watching our comments about the Switch 2,” said one X / Twitter user. “We know you would have packed in Welcome Tour,” said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, IGN published its interview with Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience, Bill Trinen, conducted at a recent Switch 2 preview event in New York, but before Nintendo announced the delay to pre-orders due to Trump’s tariffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trinen said there’s more to Welcome Tour than it appears based on the showing during the Nintendo Direct and even during recent hands-on opportunities the media had access to. Based on what’s actually in the game, Nintendo decided $9.99 “is not an exorbitant price,” he continued.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/10/reggie-1744265519979.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Reggie fought for Wii Sports as a Wii pack in.

That's one of them. And I think people will be able to see through Treehouse Live probably a little bit more maybe than you were able to see on the show floor. It's a pretty robust piece of software. There's a lot of great detail in there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For some people, I think there are people who are particularly interested in the tech and the specs of the system and things like that, for them I think it's going to be a great product. It's really for people that want more information about the system rather than necessarily a quick intro to everything it does.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And for that reason and just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, 'Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Welcome Tour is of course just one part of Nintendo’s next-gen push to become embroiled in controversy, and we’ve also got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy"><u>Trinen’s response to questions surrounding the company’s decision to go for $80 Switch 2 games</u></a>, as well as going for $450 for the Switch 2 itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Susan Goldman/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Doubles Down on Players Not Owning Digital Games in The Crew Lawsuit]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-players-not-owning-digital-games-double/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-players-not-owning-digital-games-in-the-crew-lawsuit.1160100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-players-not-owning-digital-games-double/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In November 2024, Ubisoft’s lawyers started contending with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-class-action-lawsuit-shutting-down-the-crew/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a class-action lawsuit</a> raised following the shutting down of The Crew, an MMO-based, live-service racing game, taking it offline for one and all. </p>



<p>The lawsuit alleged that Ubisoft had ‘duped’ players into believing they were buying a game with permanent ownership. Ubisoft retorted that they were only ever buying a ‘license to play’ the game. In the latest update in the case, Ubisoft’s legal team has doubled down on that concept, and the plaintiffs have fired back with amendments.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-not-unfettered-ownership">It’s Not ‘Unfettered Ownership’</h2>



<p>In a document dug up by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR6qVUri3YEl-Rm1i2hUkopLGiFMB0vcfSJN_2XvFyiSWDUJc6EDhA_0kDCXkw_aem_vnLG_QctHg-dUb7i1mTNHA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> (and <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/848030901/The-Crew-lawsuit-Ubisoft-response-via-Polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">helpfully transcribed</a>), it was revealed that Ubisoft’s tenacious legal team filed to have the case thrown out of the California court. The team claimed – or rather, reiterated – that <em>‘customers received the benefit of their bargain and were explicitly notified, at the time of purchase, that they were purchasing a license.’</em></p>



<p>Per the original claim from the plaintiffs:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Ubisoft Inc. allegedly misled&nbsp;purchasers of its video&nbsp;game <em>The Crew</em> into believing they were purchasing unfettered ownershiprights in the game, rather than a&nbsp;limited license to access the game.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The recent amendments to the class-action suit saw the claimants leaning on the law surrounding gift certification sales in California. The hope is that they can stress that they were ‘robbed’ of digital currency, as in California, gift cards aren’t allowed to expire – but any in-game credits players had when The Crew was shut down did just that: they disappeared.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Ubisoft’s Director of Subscriptions, Philippe Tremblay, went on record speaking about the transformation of gaming from a physical to a digital world. He suggested that players should <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-not-owning-games-comfortable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘get comfortable’ with not owning their games</a> and instead acquiring limited licenses to play them.</p>



<p>Gamers have never forgotten these comments, and even today, folks on social media platforms worldwide will jibe Ubisoft fans with comments about them ‘renting their games.’</p>



<p>With the latest amendments having been made to the class-action lawsuit, Ubisoft has been given a new window in which to respond. We’ll have the latest on this case by April 29, which is the deadline.</p>



<p>Do you think Ubisoft is right, or are you on the side of the plaintiffs in complaining that digital ownership should also be <strong>permanent </strong>ownership? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

As in previous years, it will be a double feature with a presentation dedicated to The Outer Worlds 2 airing immediately afterward.</p>

<p>The Xbox Showcase occurs during the week of Summer Game Fest and begins at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. Like previous years, the event is a digital-only showcase, meaning it's pre-taped instead of being a live event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with the Starfield and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Directs the last two years, The Outer Worlds 2 Direct promises to reveal new gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG with an inside look at Obsidian Games and insights from its developers. The game was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2021/2021/06/13/the-outer-worlds-2-announcement-trailer-left-us-smiling">announced</a> in 2021, but got its first gameplay reveal during The Game Awards last December.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/video-games-journalism-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve (sadly) covered a lot of games media stories that<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-media-journalism-layoffs-gamurs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> involve writers being laid off</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sites being shuffled around</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-closed-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometimes even whole companies shutting down</a>. For Inside Baseball week, I figured it might be a good time to check in with some of the few people left still making a living in video games journalism.</p><p>I spoke with a number of writers and voices who are a) drawing a full-time salary writing or talking about video games, and b) are working at what I’d call a “major” site, the big ones with historical brands that are still in a position to be paying people decent wages. These folks are the lucky few survivors, those in jobs that a decade ago were relatively common but which today–thanks to the aforementioned layoffs and closures, <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-an-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not to mention other contractions like a growing reliance on freelance and guides</a>– are increasingly scarce.</p><p>I asked a number of questions about their past, present and, perhaps most pressing, their immediate future, with their answers to each below. To protect their identities and jobs their names have been changed, and outlets omitted where requested. By way of introduction, I spoke with:</p><p><strong>Kate</strong>, who moved from various esports sites to a bigger site before landing a full-time job with one of the <em>biggest </em>sites, first on an esports vertical then on the main site itself, where they’ve worked as a culture and games writer.</p><p><strong>Frank</strong>, who has been in the games journalism and online/social media business in one way or another for around nine years now, sometimes as a freelancer, other times–like now–as a full-time member of staff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bruce </strong>has been writing about games for over a decade now, originally as a volunteer on a fansite, then as a paid-per-post freelancer before making the jump to one of the biggest games sites, initially as a freelancer then a full-time member of staff.</p><p><strong>Robert </strong>started their career with a personal blog and some freelance work, before moving to a major games site around a decade ago to cover weekends. They later became a full-time writer at the same site.</p><p><strong>Beatrice </strong>has been working full-time for a few years now at a prominent, generalist site that has a video game beat.</p><p><strong>Hank </strong>has worked in video game journalism for around ten years now, originally as a volunteer writer for a tiny site before moving onto paid freelance stuff and, finally, a position as a full-time staffer at a major video games website. I know that’s almost an identical career path to someone else above, but that used to be how people got jobs in this business!&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>The parts of the craft I spent my early years at the site trying to hone...all became liabilities under an increasingly broken regime run by dickheads.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Luke</strong>: <strong><em>In the time you’ve been working permanently at a site, has your job changed at all?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Kate</strong>: Overall, my career at my current site has been pretty stable and changes to my job have been communicated and make sense.</p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yes, due to restructuring and layoffs. My job has always been way more nebulous regardless, but even then, yes, that nebulousness has itself changed. That being said, I have made a career of being a jack-of-all-trades kind of employee, trying to diversify my skillset as broadly as possible. That aside, there is a lot of instability with my role in terms of expectations and responsibilities that I have raised concerns regarding to powers that be on numerous occasions.</p><p><strong>Bruce</strong>: I do more, but mainly because I got more confident and better at writing. I also have ended up doing more because there are fewer people around. And because the people above us in charge demand more content with a smaller staff. I probably work harder these days than ever before.</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: My job has gone from trying to think up cool shit and writing stuff that people would read, to navigating increasingly boneheaded and idiotic mandates from the business side made by people with no idea how to make or run a good website. The parts of the craft I spent my early years at the site trying to hone--voice-y headlines, creative packaging, funny images, speed, rigor, and quality--all became liabilities under an increasingly broken regime run by dickheads.&nbsp;</p><p>It did not help that during this time the way digital media functions online fundamentally shifted, and at the exact same moment the industry was facing a sea change the people steering our ship were aiming at icebergs. There was no investment, leadership, or freedom to explore alternate ways of engaging with and monetizing a passionate and loyal readership outside of assaulting their eyeballs and mobile battery life with ever more programmatic spam.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Beatrice</strong>: My responsibilities have not changed thankfully. I’m still required to write a blog every day, although now with the tariff situation, my EIC has mandated that we chase down any and all leads about how this situation is impacting my beat.</p><p><strong>Hank</strong>: My job has changed, but it’s more in the ways of adding new responsibilities as I’ve gotten more experience and learned new skills.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...over the past few years, I've lost any real sense of pride in my work...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Luke</strong>: <strong><em>Do you think the site's objectives or output have changed? And if so, why?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Kate</strong>: It feels like the site has become more focused on producing a consistent stream of content over fostering the time to produce more thoughtful and in-depth pieces at a slower pace. Recently, our post quota was raised again. I get that there's an economic aspect to it, and news posts and guides keep the lights on. But over the past few years, I've lost any real sense of pride in my work. I think we're all familiar with the YouTube content creators who turn on a camera and simply talk off the top of their heads and publish it before moving onto the next piece of slop, and it really feels like we're being pushed towards that. Obviously my colleagues are still doing phenomenal work and I have a lot of respect for what they do, and I can only speak from my POV, but I feel like my work is increasingly becoming slop because I gotta meet quota.</p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: Totally, yes. I don’t even need to talk about behind the scenes stuff for that. You can see our current video programming, and look at what we were doing this time not even six months ago to see that this is an EMPHATIC yes. What we are doing now is a combo of plans that were in motion before some recent layoffs, and then those new plans having to adapt to a reduced workforce.</p><p>That being said, I don’t think the actual site–our written, editorial content–has changed at all, thankfully. That department has been (relatively) unharmed in the years I’ve been here, and honestly, has only become more robust seemingly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bruce</strong>: Yes. For sure. Where I work, we used to be laser focused on writing cool shit and speaking truth to power while covering the news and publishing reviews. Today, we still do some of that, but not nearly as much. The people in charge want more guides. More deals posts. More evergreen content. And they don't want to scare away advertisers. It's frustrating to be told a headline is too spicy or that a story is too "business-y" simply because it dares to say a corporation sucks or unions are good.</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: There is no site objective at this point, and probably hasn't been for years. There are a few people who log on to write each day, a person who edits them, and some rich assholes who try their best to kick sand in the gears. The output that's left is shaped by a combination of incentives, trying to write about what's happening that day, what we think people will want to know about, and increasingly cynical plays to try and grab whoever happens to be scrolling by when a hyperlink pops up on Facebook, Reddit, or Google. All the while trying to avoid getting yelled at by management.&nbsp;</p><p>No matter how bad it gets there's a sense that if we can stabilize the numbers--uniques, page views, sessions per visit--then we might be able survive long enough to make it to the other side. Of what? I have no idea. But it's hard to see a world where there aren't at least some number of people keeping a written record of gaming culture.</p><p><strong>Beatrice</strong>: Thankfully no. My site has never been one to prioritize traffic or clicks with its writers. There’s never been an editorial imperative to chase trends. That doesn’t mean we get to ignore trending topics, but it’s more like, how can we make what we’re currently working on fit the moment. It has always been “do the best, informative work to service our readers” in line with our mandate as a more generalist website, and I’m incredibly grateful for that.</p><p><strong>Hank</strong>: I don’t think that from an editorial standpoint our objectives have changed since I started. We’ve definitely expanded into what we call “commerce,” which includes deals and merch, but that team operates on their own for the most part. We’ve seen a big push into social media as well, but again, it’s more of an expansion rather than a change. DLC rather than a patch!&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Where I work feels like one of the most stable places you could work at in the games industry, and still I think people are worried.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Luke</strong>: <strong><em>Games media has been hit with layoffs, site closures and buyouts over the last few years. As one of the few remaining sites to employ people full-time, what's the mood like at your publication right now in terms of its future and headcount?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Kate</strong>: We’ve been lucky enough that we haven't been hit with any major layoffs - not 0, but no major sweeps. But the industry is clearly burning down around us, along with the rest of the world, so the mood is definitely grim. Many of us feel like there's a guillotine over us that will, at some point, fall. We don't know when or who will get hit, but it feels inevitable.</p><p>I will say I do feel like my boss, and my boss' boss, fundamentally give a shit and are decent people. I'm disabled, and I know I can take time off as I need and I won't have to hustle to meet quota regardless. But I feel like there's someone above my boss' boss who will not hesitate to cut the team if it'll make a line go up. It's happened to other parts of our network and I don't feel particularly immune.</p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: I would say that it’s certainly worse having suffered some layoffs, but even if we hadn’t in the last few years, I think we’d still be on pretty tenterhooks being surrounded by it. It’s like something that keeps circling around you and then tightens around your neck when you go through it. Even if it never eventually tightened, that pressure is still there.</p><p>So then to actually be strangled by it a couple times; yeah, everyone I’ve spoken to about it at work says that, like me, they think about it and are concerned by it all the time. More layoffs, site closure, you name it. Vibes are just never really good, which makes it really hard to do the work.</p><p><strong>Bruce</strong>: It's very bizarre. A small group of people huddled around a fire in a barren, icy wasteland filled with corpses and monsters. The fire is smaller. The thin wooden walls around us are crumbling. But we still have fun and do cool shit. Yet, and I think the others would agree, we know that eventually something is going to happen. Perhaps we will be saved. Perhaps a big monster will break the walls down and end everything. Or maybe the fire will go out and we all will take one last look at each other and drift away into the wasteland around us, spotting old campsites and bodies as we exit. Honestly, I'm just ready for something to happen. Because lingering around in a perpetual state of "Maybe we all die, maybe this keeps going for five more years" as everyone else suffers is getting old. Really fucking old.</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: I'm too burnt out to imagine a future outside of our website maybe getting sold, and new management deciding to smartly invest in a few easy growth areas. Or maybe while it crashes the economy the Trump admin will decide to also break up Google and Facebook's duopoly on online advertising, single-handedly reviving the value of having a free website with millions of readers. Or maybe the economy continues to tank and the last vestiges of institutional online games media that had been slowly declining for a decade gets hit by a meteor instead. Like, all of this might feel quaint once we're in the throes of another major recession, and not one where everyone's hanging home playing <em>Animal Crossing</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p><p><strong>Beatrice</strong>: As strange and guilt inducing as it is to say: we’re good! My website truly does feel like it’s “one of the good ones” where we prioritize good journalism and empower our journalists to do good work they’re passionate about, and that’s been enough for whatever corporate overlords.</p><p><strong>Hank</strong>: Where I work feels like one of the most stable places you could work at in the games industry, and still I think people are worried. 2025 was supposed to be huge for us with things like <em>GTA 6</em>, <em>Superman</em>, and the Nintendo Switch 2, but now thanks to tariffs and everything else, the video game landscape for 2025 feels a lot less bright. Luckily more and more games workers are unionizing, both on the media side and the development side, which is heartening, because that’s really the only way to protect yourself and your coworkers when you work at a corporate-owned site (or corporate-owned anything, really). Unions are only going to become more important as the games industry shifts towards this relatively bleak future we find ourselves in.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Despite working at a decent company that takes good care of me, every day I live in fear that my bosses will decide what I do does not provide enough value for them to keep me.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Luke</strong>: <strong><em>On a more personal basis, what's your current mood in terms of your job and career? Do you think there's scope to make a career out of games media in the years and decades to come?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Kate</strong>: My mood is pretty bleak. Like I said earlier, I've lost a lot of pride in my work. I feel like I personally peaked in about 2021 and I've been phoning it in throughout COVID and its aftermath. It's hard to get excited about video games when the world is on fire and looking through social media is an endless firehouse of human suffering.</p><p>I intend to stay here for as long as they will have me. I'm the breadwinner -- my partner works, but doesn't make enough to cover our bills alone. I do feel very lucky and blessed to have this job, and I know a lot of people would kill for the opportunity. That almost makes it worse; it feels ungrateful and shitty to be so pessimistic and doomer-ish about a dream job.&nbsp;</p><p>But at the same time, the industry seems to be moving towards mass-produced slop, quickly made YouTube videos, and streamers making guesses on the industry as they play through a game. I have no interest in competing with that.</p><p>I've found my work in the crosshairs because I cover subjects that have become a front in the culture wars. I can't look up reception to my work anymore, as it's a mental health trigger. Sometimes, I have the opportunity to sink time and effort and passion into something like an explainer, only to find a Nazi made a three hour video critiquing it and by extension, me. I'm very lucky in that this vitriol is directed towards my outlet and not me for whatever reason, but it feels like I'm rolling dice and praying I never end up being a person of interest to these people.&nbsp;</p><p>There was a point I considered moving more into the "public" side of the job, but I've strongly pulled back on all of that because I don't want to add to my risk factor of being targeted, harassed, and/or doxxed.</p><p>If and when I lose my job, I intend to leave the industry and look into something more practical like medical transcription. I love games, I love writing about games, but I feel like I don't get much paid time to just... decompress and think about games. I always have to be writing, pitching, producing. It's a tolerable bargain, considering the perks, but I don't know if I'll still be here in a year, five years, etc.</p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: Setting aside myself wrestling with the thought of maybe exiting games media, like everyone contemplates at some point eventually, that feeling ebbing and flowing, if we’re talking about my own personal ability, I am relatively confident that I could, <em>eventually</em>, find my footing. But that comes back to the jack-of-all-trades path I have taken. I can be slot in a lot of different places.</p><p>I also know my opportunities come from an immense space of privilege, too. My skin color, gender, and even name rocks no boats, the waters becoming more turbulent by the day. In addition, I have several support systems that would buy me time to work on carving a path in the industry. That is a <em>rare</em> privilege very few others in games media have, I know. I do not think I would have gotten where I am today without it, to be honest.</p><p>So tl;dr, yes I do, but only really because I have the resources to invest time into that project.</p><p>The whole world is gonna explode too, so I’m not necessarily sure if the industry will even be a thing in “decades to come” lol.</p><p><strong>Bruce</strong>: I hope so. I really do. We need a strong games media. But I'm not dumb. I got eyes. I see what's happening. There are so few of us left, people with full-time jobs in games media, that I know most of those people. That's not good. And things are getting worse. So I'm hopeful that reader-supported sites can keep some of us employed. But as for the rest of us... I have no idea. Scary shit.</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: There was a point around 2022 where it felt like I was going to hit escape velocity and either land a more mainstream gig covering games for a more stable media business, or would have built enough of a reputation that I would be in pole position for whatever few deckchairs remained on the digital games media Titanic. There are lots of people more talented than I, but many of them have already washed out or don't have the same bandwidth for dumb shit I do.&nbsp;</p><p>I was quickly disabused of that notion after repeated rejections from what had felt like increasingly slam dunks. At this point the only alternative is running a subscription operation that caters to a niche audience, and even those hills feel mostly mined at this point. At the end of the day you have to be really, really good at delivering things people feel like they can't miss and that is way harder, in many ways, than running a high quality publication at scale. I give myself 1-3 years before I'm working in PR or Home Depot. The post office was going to be a fallback but it doesn't seem like that will exist by then either.</p><p><strong>Beatrice</strong>: Despite working at a decent company that takes good care of me, every day I live in fear that my bosses will decide what I do does not provide enough value for them to keep me. I increasingly feel like the polar bear stranded on the thin piece of ice – when my one place eventually leaves me behind, I will have no other place to go. There is no demand for gaming journalists at places that will pay them a living wage, they just do not exist anymore. So if I do lose my job where I am, I’ll have to leave the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think I can become one of those journalists who pivots to having their own paid subscription newsletter. I think the journalists who have done that and can be sustained by that are incredibly lucky, but that avenue is really only available to a very specific kind of journalist, and that success is exceedingly hard to replicate. To that end, I just continue to do the work I do in hopes of looking up in another five years to see that the field has weathered this particularly nasty storm and is in a better place. Until that happens (and there’s a willfully optimistic part of me that hopes it does) I continue to do the work only I can do in hopes that’ll be enough to justify letting me keep my job.</p><p><strong>Hank</strong>: I’m pretty confident in my own career, but I’m lucky. I already work at a major website, and I’m also a straight white man, which is a privilege that I’m very aware of, especially in the games industry, where it’s very hard to be anything other than that. I think I have enough of a foothold now that I should be able to keep this thing going, but it’s hard to recommend that someone graduating college enter this space. The number of jobs are dwindling, and it doesn’t look like there will be more soon. I wish that weren’t the case, and I hope it changes soon, but with the current administration, things are going to get worse before they get better.&nbsp;</p><p>—</p><p>For what it’s worth, much of what’s been said above <a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/youre-solid-gold-ill-see-you-in-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mirrors my own personal experience</a>. During my time at Kotaku (I started in 2006) it was, once upon a time, a reasonably secure and well-paying job that yeah, while encouraging some degree of traffic-baiting bullshit, was also a website that gave me the peace and space to do the kind of work I wanted to do and felt was important to readers. By the time I left in 2023, it may as well have been a different website; intrusive ownership had stripped the site of much of its voice, and dwindling resources meant more and more work was being pushed on an increasingly smaller and inexperienced team.</p><p>The responses here give voice to a vibe that’s been around for a while now: that even for those individuals lucky enough to still be in a stable job, this is an <em>industry </em>in crisis, one where things aren’t just bad for the scores of writers being laid off and cast into the uncertainty of freelance work, or smaller websites being shuffled around owners or shut down altogether. Things are bad for almost <em>everyone</em>, because even those lucky enough to work at the biggest sites, with audiences in the millions and the security of a full-time salary, can see what’s happening around them, and what could soon be happening <em>to </em>them.</p><p>Because the same forces that have closed all the other sites are a rising tide that, as many have said above, could well be coming for them next. The free internet as we’ve known it for the last 20 years is collapsing as the ad market evaporates and corporate media ownership becomes increasingly unhinged in response. As belts tighten and profits dwindle across all media–not just video games–that rising tide could begin claiming more and more sites that even ten years ago would have seemed immortal.</p><p>Is there a way out of this? I dunno, man. I want to end this piece with some kind of optimism, a plan for the future, but as has been said above, even the stuff we’re trying here at Aftermath isn’t a proper solution. Paid media as it exists today is a limited market, and it can’t support everybody out there who is currently writing about video games for a living.&nbsp;</p><p>The problems facing the industry, and the source of everyone’s fears and discomfort here, are wider than any of us can hope to tackle directly. These are systemic issues, born of late stage capitalism, the callousness of an executive class, the destructive greed of Google and Meta. It doesn’t matter how many millions, or even <em>tens </em>of millions of people are reading a website if the means of financially supporting that writing are evaporating.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is a huge bummer to end this on, but then, as you’re reading this it’s still today, not tomorrow. These sites still exist, these writers and voices are still doing great work, and if there’s anything you as an individual person on the internet can do to support them, it’s to enjoy their stuff, give their site your click and share anything you’re into while you’re at it.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025" target="_blank">Inside Baseball Week</a>&nbsp;is our annual week of stories about the lesser-known parts of game development, the ins and outs of games journalism, and a peek behind the curtain at Aftermath.

            <p>
Behold, your irregular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> funding update is here, with the news Cloud Imperium Games' controversial space sim has now raised over $800m - despite there still being no hint of a version 1.0 release date some 12 years after its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cig/star-citizen">original Kickstarter campaign</a>.
</p>
<p>
Star Citizen's previous major milestone arrived last May, when <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/funding-goals">Cloud Imperium's funding tracker</a> - which aggregates money raised from likes of paid alpha access and those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizens-latest-dlc-pack-costs-over-45000">eye-wateringly expensive ship packs</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-but-has-raised-over-700m">ticked over the $700m mark</a>. That does, of course, mean the game - as far as it can currently be described as such - has raised a further $100m in just 11 months.
</p>
<p>
All this and there's still no sign of a 1.0 release date for Star Citizen, although its paid public alpha continues to evolve with regular updates. The space sim, you might recall, was originally targeting a 2014 launch, but sailed right past that (and just kept going) as Cloud Imperium Games' plans grew ever-more ambitious and the project fell into a vortex of feature creep.

<p>
The closest Cloud Imperium has come to suggesting an end is in sight in recent times came last March when CEO Chris Roberts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-is-finally-pushing-towards-the-finish-line">wrote that the "team [was] hard at work, heads down, driving towards the finish line."</a> But while the massively multiplayer, persistent universe portion of Star Citizen is potentially still some significant way off, its story driven, single-player spin-off - known as Squadron 42 - is supposedly much closer on the horizon.
</p>
<p>
Cloud Imperium last year said it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-spin-off-squadron-42-will-release-in-2026-heres-an-hour-long-gameplay-teaser">targeting a 2026 launch for Squadron 42</a>, whose <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-hires-hefty-hollywood-cast-for-squadron-42">star-studded cast</a> includes the likes of Gary Oldan, Mark Hamill, Gillian Anderson, and Andy Serkis. But given the number of times the project has already slipped back (it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/11-years-later-star-citizen-dev-says-squadron-42-is-feature-complete">described as "feature complete" in 2023</a>), it remains to be seen whether that 2026 release window holds true.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/almost-half-of-players-who-quit-overwatch-jumped-to-marvel-rivals/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Many expected Marvel Rivals to siphon off a number of players away from Overwatch. Thanks to the latest report from NewZoo on the state of the gaming industry, we now know many jumped ship, and what percentage of the overall market Marvel Rivals its hands on.</p>



<h2 id="h-even-overwatch-classic-did-almost-nothing-to-stop-marvel-rivals">Even Overwatch Classic Did Almost Nothing to Stop Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>According to the latest<a href="https://resources.newzoo.com/hubfs/Free%20Reports/PC%20and%20Console%20Report/2025_Newzoo_The%20PC%20and%20Console%20Gaming%20Report.pdf?utm_campaign=3440460-2025%20PC%20%26%20console&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9kVtouoRdXai43NTW21yCjxlIAy1Rm3YMFWNGEsQ6J0AgoSoYZEdaa2ExtnJN1BX5v7OZB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> gaming industry report from NewZoo</a>, 45% of the Overwatch 2 players who stopped playing in December 2024 played Marvel Rivals instead. After hitting a very high peak in daily active users when it launched in early access in October 2022, Overwatch 2’s numbers dipped over the next year and a half. After stagnating throughout 2024, the game’s numbers got even lower in December when Marvel Rivals launched. The Overwatch: Classic Event temporarily increased player engagement by 12%, but this was followed by a 26% decline that coincided with the Marvel Rivals launch.</p>



<p>Despite releasing in the last month of 2024 though, Marvel Rivals was one of the most played games of the year. It had the eighth highest share of total playtime on Steam in 2024, and was the third highest among 2024 releases, behind Helldivers 2 and Palworld. Amongst all the most played free-to-play 2024 releases on Steam, PS5, and Xbox, Marvel Rivals is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-hits-40-million-players-within-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the only game</a> that has not shut down or is more than 90% below its peak monthly average users (MAU).</p>



<p>Free-to-play game playtime reportedly grew in 2024, and Marvel Rivals was also a major part of that. Marvel Rivals was the second highest source of growth in free-to-play game playtime (amongst new releases) in 2024, just behind The First Descendant. It’s worth noting though that The First Descendant released several months before Marvel Rivals did, and according to current Steam player numbers, Marvel Rivals currently is drastically outpacing it.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals’ numbers on Steam have been slowly declining since launch, but a surge could occur <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-all-changes-and-updates-coming-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in just a matter of days when Season 2 starts</a>. Will it finish 2025 as one of the most played games of the year?

<p>If you want to play Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle immediately after it finally launches on PlayStation 5, our preload and file size guide has you covered. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> launched in December 2024 as an Xbox Series X/S and Windows exclusive. The game received glowing reviews, leading to reports that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-indiana-jones-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more Indiana Jones games</a> are in development. </p>



<p>In addition, Microsoft boldly decided to remove console exclusivity and release the game on PlayStation 5. This follows a trend of other titles making the leap, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to PlayStation this spring, and rumors suggest that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War and Halo</a> could also be coming. For all the PlayStation users who initially missed out on Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle, this guide is for you. </p>

<p><strong>According to <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1909573383991275871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>, the PlayStation File Size for Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle is 125.290 gigabytes</strong>. </p>



<p>125 gigabytes is a massive file size, meaning some players might need to remove some of their downloaded games to make room. </p>
