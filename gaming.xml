					<p>Over the past few months, we have seen the release of plenty of controllers from Chinese companies that attempt and succeed for the most part, at offering advanced features for very competitive prices. Some of these features, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/qrd-spark-n5-controller-an-affordable-solid-choice/">back paddles</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/manba-one-controller-advanced-features-for-an-affordable-price/">built-in LCD screens</a>, however, may not be enough to justify the higher price for someone who is just looking for a functional controller that can be used on multiple platforms. For this reason alone, the <a href="https://www.easysmx.com/products/easysmx%C2%AE-x05-multiplatform-gaming-controller-with-hall-effect-joysticks?variant=43849282158780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasySMX X05 controller</a> is a controller worthy of more than a look for those gaming primarily on PC or Nintendo Switch who are looking for more reliable Hall Effect sticks and have no use for the fancy features offered by other controllers.</p>
<p>At a glance, the EasySMX X05 doesn't look much different from any other controller using the Xbox controller asymmetrical sticks layout. Coming in three colors - Oyster White, Lime, and Black - and with controllable RGB lights placed around the sticks, the controller looks pleasing enough to the eye. With a net weight of 218g and a size of 13.70 × 6.70 × 17.40 cm, the EasySMX X05 feels light and comfortable enough even for those with big hands. The Hall Effect sticks and triggers prevent drifting issues and grant maximum accuracy, as do the regular face and shoulder buttons. The face buttons are also quite silent, as they have a minimal amount of clicking, which is great for late-night players who require their controllers to be as silent as possible. The controller also features 5-level adjustable vibration, providing the user with more customization options that are always welcome. The anti-slip texture on the back of the controller feels pleasant to the touch and does its job rather well. The stick caps and Teflon, which prevent wear on the stick surfaces included in the package, are rather welcome and could potentially extend the controller's life considerably, even with hard use.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EasySMX-X05-02.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Setting up the EasySMX X05 controller on PC is easy and straightforward. The controller was instantly recognized by Windows 11 while plugging it in using the included USB-C cable, and I had to do no other operation to use it with Steam games. The wireless setup is just as simple as plugging the included dongle in my PC was all I had to do to use the controller wirelessly. The ceramic chip antenna featured in the controller enhances its stability and minimizes its latency, so using it wirelessly is definitely a viable option, even for intense games that require quick reactions with minimal latency, such as fighting games. The Ternary Lithium 750 mah battery granted around 8 hours of gameplay, so in this sense, the EasySMX X05 delivers a similar experience to other wireless controllers.</p>
<p>Speaking about fighting games, I have found the EasySMX X05 controller to be a surprisingly decent one to play them, thanks to its d-pad, which is rather accurate and doesn't take too long to get used to. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a>, I tested the controller out using charge characters, my main Blanka and M.Bison, since I've found this type of character to be the most problematic for the average d-pad, and I'm happy to say I had no issue whatsoever. I had no trouble with motion characters as well, so if you're looking for a controller with a decent d-pad for fighting games to use on PC without breaking the bank with more expensive fight pads, the EasySMX X05 could be a decent choice for you. For every other genre that may not require the same level of accuracy as a fighting game, the controller is just as good, feeling incredibly comfortable even if you are more used to the PlayStation or Nintendo Switch controller layout. Besides Street Fighter 6, I have tested the controller with other games I am currently playing, such as Final Fantasy VIII Remastered and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-berseria-review-tale/">Tales of Berseria</a>, and had no issues whatsoever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, much like most controllers produced by Chinese manufacturers, the EasySMX X05 is not compatible with PlayStation and Xbox consoles, which limits its appeal quite a bit. It is a real shame, as $29.99 is an excellent price for such a solid controller. If you play mostly on PC or Nintendo Switch, however, and don't need advanced features like back paddles, the EasySMX X05 is an excellent choice that is well worth its low price.</p>

<p>The EasySMX X05 is an excellent controller for those who primarily play on PC and Nintendo Switch and are looking for hall effect sticks without breaking the bank. While the controller lacks advanced features such as back paddles, it makes up for this with a solid d-pad, accurate face and shoulder buttons, hall effect triggers, and seamless pairing with all compatible devices.  All this makes the EasySMX X05 a very compelling choice, especially considering its low price.</p>

            <p>
Current and former employees of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie have responded to the news of devastating layoffs at the studio - which has seen 220 employees lose their jobs - aiming harsh criticism at the handling of the cuts amid calls for Bungie CEO Pete Parsons to resign.
</p>
<p>
Parsons announced the studio would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">laying off approximately 17 percent of its workforce</a> earlier today, blaming "rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions." The news marks the second round of job cuts at the studio in less than a year, with approximately 100 employees having been laid off last October.
</p>
<p>
Following this latest round of job cuts, former and current Bungie employees took to social media to lambast the decision. Destiny 2's global community lead Dylan Gafner (AKA dmg04) called the move "inexcusable" in a <a href="https://x.com/A_dmg04/status/1818668997443023183">post on X</a>. "Industry leading talent being lost, yet again," he wrote. "Accountability falling upon the workers who have pushed the needle to deliver for our community time and time again."

<p>
"I'm safe but I'm fucking enraged," Bungie technical UX designer Ash Duong <a href="https://x.com/_Ashdown/status/1818679800426643820">wrote</a> in response to today's news. "This is hitting people who were told they were valued. That they were important. That they were critical to business success. But none of that mattered."
</p>
<p>
Others more directly aimed their ire at Parsons. Bungie's former global social media lead Griffin Bennett, who was laid off as part of last year's job cuts, <a href="https://x.com/GriffinWB/status/1818670768152363478">posted</a>, "Pete is a joke", while former Destiny 2 community manager Liana Ruppert <a href="https://x.com/DirtyEffinHippy/status/1818677930622685516">wrote</a>, "Step down, Pete."
</p>
<p>
Anger at Parsons was also felt in the community, with noted Destiny content creator MyNameIsByf (AKA Lore Daddy) <a href="https://x.com/MyNameIsByf/status/1818671790538809555">posting on X</a>, "Leadership needs to be changed. Their decisions have consistently led to disaster for everyone who has actually been making the games we play. They've been reckless with the studio, its employees, and its franchises. The problem is clear. Bad leadership. It needs to change."
</p>
<p>
Criticism of Parsons' leadership, and the devastating impact Bungie management's decisions have had on its employees, follows a series of troubling reports that have surfaced since last October. In December, Bungie employees told IGN the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-staff-reportedly-worried-about-bungies-future">mood at the studio</a> was "soul-crushing" as leadership implemented harsh cost-cutting measures, seemingly in a bid to cling onto independence following Sony's acquisition of Bungie in 2020. It was also claimed senior management met employees' sadness at last year's layoffs with "indifference or even outright flippancy or hostility", and that leadership rebuffed suggestions they took a salary cut to prevent future cuts, telling workers, Bungie is "not that type of company".
</p>
<p>
In November, it was reported last year's layoffs followed internal warnings that studio revenue was 45 percent below projections due to a "sharp drop" in the popularity of Destiny 2 - news that was followed by an open letter to players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-tells-destiny-2-players-we-know-we-have-lost-a-lot-of-your-trust">admitting</a> the studio had "lost a lot of your trust" and promising a "bigger, bolder, and brighter" future for the game.

We’re already surviving a global pandemic, so why would anyone consider playing a game with that name literally in the title? Because, my friends, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-op board game</a> version of fighting this big thing is all about coming together for the sake of the greater good. I mean, who doesn’t love a superhero tale, right?</p><p>While the game and its many iterations do not involve superheroes with capes, they involve superheroes of different kinds: scientists. Each player has their own special skills that help with the greater objective. </p><p>Pandemic is a popular <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a>, one often chosen on regular game nights – even during our modern time. The necessary teamwork involved helps strengthen friendships and see where communication and coordination might be improved. You see, it’s an all-or-nothing game. You either save the world and win, or you don’t, and everyone loses. I guess you’d better buck up on those soft communication skills or else, eh?</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><p id="pandemic"><h3 data-toc-title="Pandemic">Pandemic</h3></p><div catalogid="f23e15fd-d80d-41f8-9e8f-8b48c2091783" id="198687"><div id="198687" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Pandemic</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $44.99 USD</li><li>2-4 Players </li><li>45 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p>There are several versions of the base game available to play. The original is a great place to get versed in the game mechanics and learn how each role works together. While you can play it with two players, I’ve found that this game is best experienced with more players than that (it supports up to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a>), as you’ll have more options to get you through the waves of the pandemic. Playing it as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player board game</a>, however, might make for one revealing date night adventure!</p><h2>Pandemic Board Game Expansions</h2><p>There are a few different expansions for Pandemic, but even more options exist beyond the expansions themselves.

There are new roles to play that come with alternative ways to approach the now even stronger version of the virus. </p><p>Another added element when playing with a fifth player is that the fifth player will play as a Bio-terrorist. This is a secret role that adds chaos and helps spread the virus, so other players will have to beat the virus and the bio-terrorist to win.</p></div><p id="pandemic-in-the-lab-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Pandemic: In the Lab Expansion">Pandemic: In the Lab Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="3d074cc0-92ee-4f3a-b164-a614c95b5818" id="205432"><div id="205432" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Pandemic: In the Lab Expansion</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $44.99 USD</li><li>1-6 Players </li><li>45 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Lab board, 4 new role cards, 3 new event cards, lab abilities, CDC card</p><p><strong>Note: To play the In the Lab expansion, you must have both the base game and the expansion On the Brink.</strong></p><p>This expansion adds to both the base game and the previous expansions. It allows folks to play Pandemic in teams or as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a>.</p><p>The lab portion of the game extends to the capacity to study the virus outside of the field. You’ll have to sequence and categorize the disease to effectively create a cure. </p><p>In a solo game (available with this expansion), you’ll have the help of the CDC. In a multiplayer game, you can either team up or split into rival teams competing to see who can find the cure and move fast enough to resolve it before the virus does its worst.</p></div><p id="pandemic-state-of-emergency-expansi"><h3 data-toc-title="Pandemic: State of Emergency Expansi">Pandemic: State of Emergency Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="91a07e5e-aca2-41ad-b8a7-71ac47062089" id="205433"><div id="205433" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Pandemic: State of Emergency Expansion</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $43.95 USD</li><li>2-4 Players </li><li>45 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Five new roles, 2 new game boards, 4 new locations, 2 new challenges, one untreatable virus</p><p><strong>Note: You need the base game to play State of the Emergency.</strong></p><p>In the State of Emergency expansion (playable with the base game), you face even more obstacles to battle viruses… and not all of them can be cured. Two different <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign challenges</a> are in this expansion: Hinterlands and Superbug. </p><p>You'll race worldwide on two boards to move the emergencies out of orbit. Be careful, however – the virus in this version not only affects humans but also goes after animals, which can pass the virus on to humans. You’ll have to invoke quarantine and other methods to counter the state of emergency. (Note: If this description gives you deja vu vibes, it’s purely coincidental. Believe it or not, this expansion came out in 2015!)</p><h2>Alternative Universes &amp; Timeline Stand-Alone Counterparts</h2><p>Some board games have spin-offs in universes that are different from the original base game. Other times, board game iterations remain relatively the same but with different characters pursuing similar objectives. <strong>The following titles are standalone board games with varying takes on the Pandemic universe game mechanics.</strong></p></div><p id="pandemic-reign-of-cthulhu-board-gam"><h3 data-toc-title="Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu Board Gam">Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu Board Game</h3></p><div catalogid="19ea6b97-c944-444c-ab6f-7683f7b1f1e9" id="205434"><div id="205434" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $49.99 USD</li><li>2-4 Players </li><li>45 minutes</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Game board, investigator meeples, Shoggoth meeples, cultist meeples, sanity die, and associated cards</p><p>Fans of the mythos of Cthulhu will likely love this game edition.

Instead of a virus, you’re fighting against cultists and supernatural powers called Shoggoths to avoid awakening the ancient ones. The art is fantastic. The meeple characters are shaped like monsters, investigators, and cultists. It’s a great stand-alone game that gives you a bit of the enjoyment of Pandemic but without the doctor part… unless you want to play as the doctor character, because it wouldn’t be Pandemic if that weren’t still an option, right?</p></div><p id="star-wars-the-clone-wars-board-game"><h3 data-toc-title="Star Wars: The Clone Wars Board Game">Star Wars: The Clone Wars Board Game</h3></p><div catalogid="66057520-6e77-41d1-b66d-c953d586bcd4" id="179755"><div id="179755" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars: The Clone Wars Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $59.99 USD</li><li>1-5 Players </li><li>60 minutes</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Intergalactic game board, Star Wars character meeples, connected game cards</p><p>This is a stand-alone board game with Pandemic-style mechanics, and its version of intergalactic dramas to defeat and reign victoriously cooperatively.

Contagion, while also a shorter-to-play game, is completely different from any of the others out there. You see, in this version, players play as the disease. Yep, you read that right. You and other players are working as the virus to wipe out the human race.</p><h2>Pandemic Legacy Games</h2></div><p id="pandemic-legacy-season-1"><h3 data-toc-title="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1">Pandemic Legacy: Season 1</h3></p><div catalogid="8958ad46-461f-4918-88ca-84eb6ca4aba9" id="161120"><div id="161120" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 (Blue Version)</h3></p></div><p>On the opposite side of the time-to-play spectrum, if you are seeking a very repeatable, lengthy, and committed gaming experience, consider one of the legacy versions of the game. Legacy games feature campaigns done across multiple play sessions. They require a lot of time commitment and are something to jump into with mindfulness. Legacy games pack in a lot more content than standard games, and are generally more expensive.</p><p>Pandemic has multiple legacy versions available to play. The legacy titles are <a href="https://zdcs.link/knAPY?object_uuid=f7c215f0-03e7-4176-816b-eed6ef0799f2&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Season 1</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/V0gAN?object_uuid=f7c215f0-03e7-4176-816b-eed6ef0799f2&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Season 2</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ey53G?object_uuid=f7c215f0-03e7-4176-816b-eed6ef0799f2&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Season 0</a>. Legacy games take place over the course of one year. Your actions each month of the campaigns will continue to affect you throughout the course of the very lengthy gameplay. If your gaming crowd holds grudges, well, this one will be a rough year to maneuver! </p><h2>How to Play the Pandemic Board Game Online</h2><h3>Board Game Arena</h3><p>A number of iterations of Pandemic are available in digital form. The site <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board Game Arena</a> is a browser-based platform where folks can play the game. It's how several of my friends in my digital board game group and I have enjoyed this version.</p><p>To play the base game over there (available for 1-4 players who can play in real-time or turn-based games where players can take turns over several days), someone in your board game group will have to have a premium subscription. A premium subscription to Board Game Arena costs $3 a month, billed at $36.00 once a year. Playing multiple games, even outside of Pandemic, can be well worth the investment. My board game community currently has several ongoing turn-based premium version games going on with regularity.</p><h3>Tabletopia</h3><p>Another place you can play Pandemic digitally is via the website Tabletopia. Tabletopia offers three digital versions of the game: <a href="https://tabletopia.com/games/pandemic-north-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pandemic Hot Zone North America</a>, <a href="https://tabletopia.com/games/pandemic-hot-zone-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pandemic Hot Zone Europe</a>, and <a href="https://tabletopia.com/games/pandemic-legacy-season-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pandemic Legacy Season 0</a>. All of the versions on Tabletopia are available to play free online. The gameplay is a bit different than on Board Game Arena, as their version is a physics-simulated version that is essentially one step in between playing the game physically and playing it on BGA.</p><h3>Video Game Iterations</h3><p>Steam used to have a PC version of Pandemic <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/622440/Pandemic_The_Board_Game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on its store</a> but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pandemic-digital-game-removed">removed it in January 2022</a>. Other versions of the game on Xbox and the Nintendo Switch were <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=5462088137147638&amp;id=941343545888809&amp;paipv=0&amp;eav=AfbMHmsHPKPpQbPrTw_oHL9KHelFcyS59T1mj8hqg_mIOirMG3sLB7mux359M2znEKE&amp;_rdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">removed at the end of July 2022</a>. It was reported that the development team (Asmodee Digital) might work on a newer game version at some point, they haven't announced any solid plans yet. Asmodee did not respond to my request for an updated comment. </p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>I know that in our post-pandemic era, it probably sounds strange to play a game about fighting a pandemic – or, goodness, even being a virus on the opposite end – but my experiences with the Pandemic board game have all been enjoyable. It’s a fun game that shows where your tabletop group's communication skills work together… and where they could improve. My personal crew has both won and lost plenty of battles playing the game, but our sessions have always been full of laughs, regardless of the outcome. In any case, rally your gaming group and pick the Pandemic base game, spinoff, and/or expansion, and have fun.</p><p><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

They shared their various problems and concerns about Apple Arcade, the tech giant’s lack of vision, and how it poorly treats game studios.<br></p><h2 id="h16717"><a id=""></a>Apple makes devs wait for money and rarely replies</h2><p>One big problem is that some devs have to spend months chasing Apple down for their money. The way Apple Arcade works is devs get a large amount of money upfront to make the game, and then collect royalties from Apple as more players download and play their titles. In the early days of the service, devs say these payments arrived promptly, but now these royalty payments can take months to arrive. One dev claimed they had to wait for six months to get paid and it nearly killed their studio.</p><p>“We can go weeks without hearing from Apple at all and their general response time to emails is three weeks, if they reply at all,” said a developer speaking to MobileGamer.biz. “We’re supposed to be able to ask product, technical, and commercial questions, but often half the Apple team won’t turn up, and when they do they have no idea what’s going on and can’t answer our questions, either because they don’t have any knowledge on how to answer it, or are not able to share that info for confidentiality reasons.”<br></p><p><em>MobileGamer.biz </em>contacted Apple for comment but didn’t hear back.<br></p><p>Another problem is discoverability and promotion on Apple Arcade, with a developer telling the outlet that it feels like their game has been in a “morgue for the last two years.”<br></p><p>“It doesn’t matter what we put in the game, Apple won’t feature us, it’s like we don’t exist,” claimed the dev. “So as a developer you think, well, they’ve given us this money for exclusivity…I don’t want to give them the money back, but I do want people to play my game. It’s like we’re invisible.”<br></p><h2 id="h16718"><a id=""></a>Apple Arcade is a pain to work with and lacks vision</h2><p>This same dev described a horrible QA and update process, saying that a single update can take multiple back-and-forth meetings with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/apple-ipad-pro-hydraulic-press-crush-commercial-ad-1851463729&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/apple-ipad-pro-hydraulic-press-crush-commercial-ad-1851463729">Apple</a></span>.</p><p>“Submitting updates is so painful our developers started trying to avoid it,” they said.<br></p><p>One person who spoke with <em>MobileGamer.biz </em>claimed that one QA and localization process involved submitting 1,000 screenshots all at once to show the game was correctly working on all devices and in all languages. “My team were like: ‘There’s no fucking way we’re going to do that,’” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-again-late-payments-stonewalled-studios-terrible-tech-support-and-vision-pro-woes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-again-late-payments-stonewalled-studios-terrible-tech-support-and-vision-pro-woes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told the outlet</a></span>.</p><p>Another common complaint from devs was a lack of vision or planning on Apple’s part, with some suggesting the company was just working devs because it was a “necessary evil” as games are so popular on Apple’s devices.</p><p>“Given their status as a huge tech company it feels as if they treat developers as a necessary evil,” explained one developer. “And that we will do everything we can to please them for little in return, in the hope that they grace us with another project – and a chance for them to screw us over again.”<br></p><p>“It’s like an abusive relationship where the abused stays in the relationship hoping the other partner will change and become the person you know they could be.”<br></p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It got its first big break designing the GPU for Microsoft’s original Xbox, and helped Sony design the graphics processor for the PlayStation 3. For years it was the company that held up big hunks metal with plastic fans on stage to woo gamers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-budget-4k-ray-tracing-dlss-3-1850327485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-budget-4k-ray-tracing-dlss-3-1850327485">with upgrades they couldn’t afford</a></span>. Now it’s quickly become something else entirely. </p><p>Nvidia was trading below $15 a share at the start of 2023. Less than two years later it’s over $100. What changed? Microsoft and others are gobbling up GPUs to power their AI ambitions. It seemed like the fever might have broken amid a renewed wave of skepticism around what generative AI and machine learning will actually be useful for, but then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/technology/microsoft-earnings-profit.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/technology/microsoft-earnings-profit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft announced it’s going to continue pouring billions</a></span> into server farms for AI computing and Nvidia’s stock shot up more than most companies are worth in less than eight hours. Let’s remember some previous high scores:</p><p> $329 billion is more than Netflix, Coca-Cola, and Bank of America. It’s the value of eight Electronic Arts and 12 Take-Twos, whose subsidiary Rockstar Games publishes <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> next year. Nvidia isn’t worth more than ever—it peaked last month at over $3 trillion—but this single-day swing points to how completely untethered the company has become from its recent history or the current marketplace reality in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsofts-ai-dreams-make-for-an-expensive-reality-90a8c8e4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsofts-ai-dreams-make-for-an-expensive-reality-90a8c8e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which OpenAI is reportedly losing billions</a></span>. With Meta pivoting from VR to the AI chip arms race and others chasing desperately to catch up, Nvidia has quickly become the center of the tech and financial universe. </p><p>‘These violent delights have violent ends.” We might just be witnessing the first of many transformations before Nvidia’s final form. Maybe it will be the first true megacorp in a future cyberpunk dystopia, or maybe some of the plates stop spinning and start breaking and the company goes back to releasing hard-to-find <em>Gundam</em>-branded graphics cards for $4,000 gaming rigs that let you play <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> in 4K at 120fps. It’s never a good sign when the numbers get so insane that they stop meaning anything. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Once it's in your loot pool, you can visit Failsafe in the HELM to focus Echoes engrams into new Perfect Paradox rolls.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Perfect_Paradox_God_Rolls">Perfect Paradox God Rolls</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4343871-20240731142313_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343871" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4343871-20240731142313_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343871"></a><figcaption>Perfect Paradox</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4343871-20240731142313_1.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perfect_Paradox_PvE_God_Roll">Perfect Paradox PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Barrel Shroud  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Handling, +10 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload Speed, +5 Stability, +1 Magazine</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Dual Loader / Pugilist  <ul><li dir="ltr">Dual Loader: Reloads an additional shot at a time</li><li dir="ltr">Pugilist: Final blows with this weapon grant melee energy</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: One-Two Punch / Trench Barrel / Swashbuckler  <ul><li dir="ltr">One-Two Punch: Hitting a target with every shotgun pellet in a shot increases melee damage for a short duration.</li><li dir="ltr">Trench Barrel: After a successful melee hit, this weapon gains increased damage, range, and handling for a short duration, or until three shots are fired.</li><li dir="ltr">Swashbuckler: This weapon gains increased damage from melee kills and kills with this weapon.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Handling / Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Perfect Paradox is a gun you combine with melee strikes, and it is <em>great</em> in that role. It has a bunch of perks that play into the punch/shoot rotation, such that you kind of can't go wrong with whatever you pick--it really comes down to your specific build and how you want the gun to function.</p><p dir="ltr">In the first perk column, Dual Loader is a good all-around pick that helps you reload the gun faster, which works well paired with a Reload Speed Masterwork. Pugilist, however, might find better synergy, depending on how you use the gun, as it charges your melee when you get kills with Perfect Paradox.</p><p dir="ltr">In the second column, you'll be making use of that melee. One-Two Punch powers up your melee by a pretty huge margin if you hit the enemy with every pellet in the shotgun blast, making it great to use against bosses and major enemies in a melee-focused damage build. Trench Barrel, on the other hand, increases Perfect Paradox's damage when you punch an enemy, so go for this perk if you want the bulk of the damage to come from the shotgun rather than your punch. Finally, Swashbuckler enhances the shotgun's damage when you get melee kills <em>or</em> kills with Perfect Paradox; you might want this option if you're running a melee build that's better for clearing minor enemies.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perfect_Paradox_PvP_God_Roll">Perfect Paradox PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Smallbore / Corkscrew Rifling  <ul><li dir="ltr">Smallbore: +7 Range, +7 Stability</li><li dir="ltr">Corkscrew Rifling: +5 Range, +5 Stability, +5 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Accurized Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Slideshot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Sliding partially reloads this weapon's magazine and temporarily boosts range and stability.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Opening Shot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improved accuracy and range on the opening shot of an attack.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Perfect Paradox isn't nearly as great in PvP as it is as a PvE weapon, but it's still a strong shotgun that can be very useful. It carries a classic shotgun perk combo in Slideshot and Opening Shot, which can allow you to boost its range and accuracy pretty significantly. As a gun you use for close-range encounters as you're rounding a corner, Perfect Paradox is a strong contender, allowing for those one-shot kills on unsuspecting enemies or for you to follow up with a quick punch to finish someone off.</p><p dir="ltr">There are better PvP shotguns out there, but Perfect Paradox isn't necessarily a bad option. Just make sure to prioritize its Range stat if you want to take it into the Crucible, as that'll help you land more kills in tight situations.</p>

Discovered by the player Joo, the glitch can be initiated in a variety of ways, including the use of the DLC’s perfume weapons or hitting a Site of Grace where players can rest.</p><p>If the player manages to interrupt the mounting animation at the exact right frame, they can achieve a “limited no-gravity” effect that simply allows the player to walk on air. The initial animation isn’t so much canceled as it is “paused” while the player commits to another action. That last bit is especially important because in order to maintain the Legasus effect, you can never idle.<br></p><p>There are actually a million caveats to making Legasus work, which you can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hackmd.io/@ViRazY/er-legasus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hackmd.io/@ViRazY/er-legasus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read up on here</a></span>, but the gist of it is that movement isn’t exactly free once you manage to activate the glitch. You can only move forward or step backward and you must always be doing something like holding guard with a shield out. If you idle, you’ll be restored back to the point at which you activated the glitch, and if you accidentally break the effect somewhere else, you naturally risk plummeting to your death. Additionally, in order to turn, you have to use a bow, aim in the direction you’d like to go, and then dodge roll that way.<br></p><p>Once you get it working though, you can get pretty far, and players have been using it to get into areas like <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s Abyssal Woods (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-abyssal-woods-torrent-1851560149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-abyssal-woods-torrent-1851560149">which apparently sucks ass</a></span>) while skipping segments of it that might be a pain in the ass. That’s because you can also “unload” Torrent, which commits to the rest of the summoning animation and breaks the glitch exactly where you are, allowing players to tactically position themselves to die near checkpoints and respawn there. </p><p>The tournament that prompted this find is being held by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-speedrun-world-record-distortion2-youtube-30-1848655345&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-speedrun-world-record-distortion2-youtube-30-1848655345">Distortion2</a></span>, one of the most prominent speedrunners of FromSoftware’s catalog, and a guy who’s beaten <em>Elden Ring </em>with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-speedrunner-bosses-ground-slam-malenia-margi-1848783561&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-speedrunner-bosses-ground-slam-malenia-margi-1848783561">nothing more than his character’s ass</a></span>.

                <p>The Tesla Cybertruck has been the subject of jokes and memes since the very moment it was announced, and they didn't slow down at all once the thing came out earlier this year--its launch was greeted with <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91109879/a-timeline-of-tesla-cybertruck-problems-from-rust-to-hail-damage-to-pedal-recalls" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">all sorts of severe issues, which have sparked multiple recalls</a>. Now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/teslas-cybertruck-is-your-fortnite-summer-road-trip-reward/1100-6525207/" data-ref-id="1100-6525207">the Fortnite version of the Cybertruck</a> is finally here, too, and it's introduced at least one game-breaking bug to battle royale.</p><p>Right now, the Cybertruck SUV car body is available for free through a series of quests in Fortnite, and July 31 was the first day the vehicle skin could be earned. But it took roughly five minutes of use before folks discovered a fatal flaw with their Cybertrucks: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1egqhzh/cybertruck_breaks_nitro_fists_ships_in_bottles/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">It rendered their Nitro Fists unusable for the remainder of the match</a>. The bug also affects the Ship in a Bottle item, though at least that isn't super important for this season's meta. A lack of Nitro Fists, on the other hand, could get you killed, since they're the season's primary traversal item and are also very effective in a close-range fight.</p><p>What happens is that transforming the standard SUV into a Cybertruck during a round of battle royale will cause your character to twitch oddly every time you try to fire off either your Nitro Fists or the Ship in a Bottle, and the effect persists for the rest of the match. If you see a Cybertruck that somebody else made, it's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1egvuel/transforming_suv_into_cybertruck_disables_the_use/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">apparently safe to use</a>. But if you're using the Cybertruck as your SUV skin, this is simply going to be a thing you have to deal with.</p><p>It's possible this bug is related to the Cybertruck's main unique property: Its backseats are actually in the bed of the truck, allowing for full aim and body rotation from those positions, as well as exposure from fire from enemies. Epic would have needed to block players from using the Nitro Fists and Ship in a Bottle while sitting in those seats--perhaps those blocks are persisting even after the player leaves the vehicle.</p><p>Whatever the true reason, Fortnite isn't slated for a new patch until next week, but this may be an issue that Epic can solve on the server side of things.</p><p>The Tesla Cybertruck is available to earn for free in both Fortnite and Rocket League through Monday, August 5, after which point the vehicles will be sold in the item shops of both games. The Cybertruck comes with several decals and color options, including the exclusive Baja Off Road decal that you can only get by completing the quests. Once the Cybertruck is working properly, you can use that decal to make sure everyone knows you didn't pay for it and maybe <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/battle-royale/fortnite-players-declare-the-cybertruck-public-enemy-number-one-you-are-now-in-a-truce-with-everyone-else-in-the-lobby-until-theyre-taken-down/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">avoid the wrath of the Cybertruck hunters</a>.</p>

                <p>Nearly 27 years after the original game's release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/">Final Fantasy 7</a> superfan Jamie Colliver has finished his magnum opus: A shot-for-shot remake of the original PlayStation 1 game, created entirely via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/littlebigplanet-2/">LittleBigPlanet 2</a>. Colliver's remake reimagines the original game as a platformer, with every scene, every location, every line of dialogue, and every song from the game's OST painstakingly implemented into a LittleBigPlanet 2 level.</p><p dir="ltr">After three-and-a-half years of work (which he diligently documented via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheJamster1992">his YouTube channel</a>), Colliver's creation is finally complete, and can be seen via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oz6oZPZsWw&amp;list=PLF9D7EDF22859E9D2&amp;index=2">141-video YouTube playlist</a> showcasing an entire playthrough of the game. Colliver--who says the original Final Fantasy 7 is his all-time favorite video game--is proud of the work he's done, and gave GameSpot a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to build a 27-year-old game via a 13-year-old puzzle-platformer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49CJLp2uyyE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/49CJLp2uyyE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"It all started with experimenting with the creation tools in LittleBigPlanet 2," Colliver told Gamespot. "To me, Final Fantasy VII represents the pinnacle of any form of media. I believe it features the strongest set of main characters in any video game. For me, Final Fantasy VII is not just an excellent game but a timeless narrative that continues to resonate on a personal level as I grow older."</p><p dir="ltr">Given the plethora of build-whatever-you-want games that are currently available (like Minecraft, Roblox, and even The Sims 4), we wanted to know what motivated Colliver to use 2011's LittleBigPlanet 2 as the framework for his incredibly detailed reimagining of Final Fantasy 7.</p><p dir="ltr">"LittleBigPlanet 2's platforming mechanics allowed me to introduce new gameplay elements not present in the original Final Fantasy 7," Colliver explained. "For instance, you might need a grappling hook to reach certain areas or scuba gear for underwater battles. The three-layer design gives the world an intimate, stage performance vibe, and the shift in visual style adds a unique charm to the characters and environments. The polygonal visual style of Final Fantasy complements LBP's craft-based aesthetic nicely. Additionally, the original game's focus on written dialogue mirrors LittleBigPlanet's storytelling method, using expressions and environmental cues to advance the narrative."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4343837-ff7dialogue.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343837" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4343837-ff7dialogue.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343837"></a><figcaption>Colliver's remake includes all 140,000 dialogue lines featured in the original 1997 game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4343837-ff7dialogue.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking of written dialogue, Colliver's little big project also includes all 140,000 lines of dialogue from the original Final Fantasy 7. He says it takes about 30 hours to complete his version of Final Fantasy 7, which is close to the 35 hours it takes to complete the original game. Colliver says he spent a similar amount of time each week working on the project during its three-and-a-half-year development. The game's soundtrack was recreated via LittleBigPlanet's Music Sequencer, which allows users to create music using a variety of instruments and adjust pitch and tempo as they see fit.</p><p dir="ltr">But obviously, a project this size was no small task, and Colliver faced several roadblocks while the game was in development.</p><p dir="ltr">"Wutai was particularly challenging due to its vast size, numerous cutscenes, and hidden paths, making it a nightmare to plan," Colliver said. "Building bigger areas like the Great Glacier and the Northern Crater also proved difficult, as they have multiple branching paths and are massive, so [they] had to be adapted further than smaller locations like Kalm or Under Junon. Additionally, the project's scope, especially the extensive text conversations and NPCs populating the game world was a headache, taking forever to include. Lots of coffee helped keep me focused."</p><p dir="ltr">But it all came together in the end, and Colliver says he's "especially proud" of the Sector 7 pillar section of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"It was one of my favourite parts of the original game, and I wanted to capture the brutality, struggle, and despair in my version by showing the full collapse of the pillar onto the citizens of Sector 7," he told GameSpot. "Another highlight is the burning of Nibelheim, where I aimed to convey the intensity of Sephiroth's breakdown. I spent hours perfecting the infamous scene in the flames. Additionally, recreating Aerith's iconic death scene, putting my own spin on Cosmo Canyon, and finalizing my character designs were also proud moments for me."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4343838-biglevel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343838" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4343838-biglevel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343838"></a><figcaption>The project required Colliver to recreate some truly massive levels, despite LittleBigPlanet 2's technical limitations.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4343838-biglevel.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now that the project's complete, Colliver says he's considering adding some content (mainly new bosses) from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> to the game as an extra treat. But his main goal at the moment is getting the word out about the completion of his project. There's even a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/feature-fan-made-ffvii-platformer-as-a-minigame-in-ffvii-remake-trilogy-s-part-3" rel="nofollow ">Change.org petition making the rounds</a>, urging Final Fantasy and LittleBigPlanet fans to sign their names in the hopes that Square Enix might include a part of Colliver's remake in the upcoming third chapter of the Final Fantasy 7 remake.</p><p dir="ltr">"Since the LBP servers are down permanently, the only way to view my project is on my YouTube channel," Colliver explained. "In order to make it playable to the public, I had the idea of creating my petition to ask Square Enix to include my creation as a playable mini-game in Part 3 of the FF7 remake trilogy."</p><p dir="ltr">But regardless of whether Square Enix acknowledges Colliver's project, one of the more rewarding parts of finishing his creation has been the feedback he's gotten from voice actors involved in the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">"I've been lucky to receive brilliant praise and feedback on my project from the voice actors of Barret, Cait Sith, Tseng, Elena and Rude of the Turks, Palmer, Professor Hojo, Elmyra, and Roche and Kotch from the remake trilogy so far. This has been really special to me, so having my project featured in the game alongside them and the other characters would be the cherry on the cake."</p><p>Colliver's project can be seen in its entirety via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oz6oZPZsWw&amp;list=PLF9D7EDF22859E9D2&amp;index=2">his YouTube channel</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-trek-lower-decks-buffer-time-card-game-about-doing-starfleet-menial-tasks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modiphius Entertainment has announced a new Star Trek board game. It isn't a new RPG like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-trek-adventures-second-edition-sets-course-for-strange-new-worlds" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Star Trek Adventures</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-trek-captains-log-solo-roleplaying-game-charts-new-course" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Captain's Log</em></a>, but a card game based on the animated spin-off show, <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em>. The game, <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks - Buffer Time </em>aims to bring the show's comedy into a game about balancing work with relaxation.</p>
<h2>The <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks - Buffer Time</em> Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks - Buffer Time</em> is an accessible card game designed for both die-hard <em>Star Trek</em> fans and casual party game fans. It will also aim to capture the humor of the <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> show.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-trek-lower-decks-buffer-time-chaotic-hallway-artwork.jpg?itok=7PIacG2e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-trek-lower-decks-buffer-time-chaotic-hallway-artwork.jpg?itok=VGua1lvp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks - Buffer Time</em> is a low-stakes, push-your-luck card game designed for 2-6 players. All players must work together to complete menial assignments while stationed on a Starfleet ship, all while making time for relaxation. Can your crew squeeze enough "buffer time" into duty rotation before the bridge crew figures out what's going on?</p>
<p>The game's project manager, Jim Johnson had this to say about the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s a fast-playing card game that’ll have you laughing and crying. I’m super excited to be able to expand our <em>Star Trek</em> license into card games, and I hope you check it out and have fun with your group playing this one! Just watch out for those senior officers–they’re allergic to buffer time and will find new menial tasks for you and your fellow lower deckers to complete.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> debuted on CBS All Access in August of 2020. As the name implies, the show doesn't focus on a Starfleet ship's captains or senior officers, but on low-ranking officers with menial jobs getting into absurd situations. Its fifth and final season is set to release in October 2024 on Paramount+.</p>
<p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks - Buffer Time </em>will be sold at an MSRP of $19.99. At the time of writing, there is no release date.</p>

            <p>
With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frontier-officially-announces-planet-coaster-2-now-with-water-parks">Planet Coaster 2's big reveal</a> out the way, Frontier Developments is ready to start talking specifics - and it's now done just that in the first in a series of developer deep dives, showcasing some of the sequel's new features in 15 minutes of first gameplay.
</p>
<p>
The big new thing in Planet Coaster 2 is , of course, water - or rather water parks, with the likes of pools, lazy rivers, and flumes. Frontier's deep dive offered a quick walk through the basics here, noting its sparkly new pools can be carved into the earth using geometric or custom shapes, while body flumes - just like rollercoasters - can be constructed piece-by-piece. Expect to see the likes of plughole, sphere, vertical, and boomerang flume pieces, even a six-person raft flume ride, adding variety to the basic flume styles.
</p>
<p>
Flumes, like any other ride, can be ridden in first-person, and also have their own excitement, nausea, and fear levels that'll determine whether guests want to ride them. Also like other rides, they'll work with Planet Coaster 2's suite of new customisation options, with players able to assign them colours, pre-defined patterns, and more.
</p>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, given the focus on creativity over management in the first game, customisation opportunities have been expanded significantly in Planet Coaster 2, with one of the most notable additions being the ability to attach scenery parts directly to coasters and flat rides - which will then appropriately animate in tandem with whatever they're attached to. Expanded tools also help reduce the number of steps required when decorating rides, with players able to quickly mirror customisations or instantly copy them across ride cars.
</p>
<p>
To accommodate these improved customisation opportunities, rides in Planet Coaster 2 will be much plainer compared to the elaborate versions in the first game - although ride blueprints (which now include flat ride blueprints) will once again enable players to share their creations via the game's workshop, so less creative sorts still have something nice to plop in their parks.
</p>
<p>
There's also a new asynchronous cross-platform co-op mode so players can share a park with a friend - who can then hop in, make some changes or additions, then send it back. It's not the sort of fully fledged co-op mode seen in developer Texel Raptor's stellar 2018 theme park sim Parkitect, but it's something at least. And it'll work across all three core modes - Career, Sandbox, and Franchise - even enabling friends to co-operate on leaderboard challenges. Oh, and, yes, there'll be rollback tools to stop your friends from cocking up your creations.
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere, Planet Coaster 2 massively overhauls the first game's notoriously finicky pathing tools - its now possible to create large plaza-like pathed areas simply by drawing out their shape - and there are new additions on the management side too. Power, for instance, is now a resource players will need to supply in sufficient quantities in order to keep their parks running, and the new weather system also introduces a few wrinkles, with players needing to provide sunscreen and shade for their water park sunbathers. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, today's deep dive suggests the majority of new management features will be tied to water parks. Players will also need to hire lifeguards, purchase and maintain water filtration systems for flumes and pools, as well as provide changing facilities, park services to supply pool passes, and set up stores selling inflatable to wring more money out of guests.
</p>
<p>
Other nuggets of information shared in Frontier's Planet Coaster 2 deep dive (and subsequent Q&amp;A) included confirmation that hotels will be absent from the sequel, despite the introduction of a new Resort scenery theme, and that the complexity meter will return for console players, limiting the amount of items they can put in their parks. Additionally, saves and workshop creations won't carry over from the first game, given Planet Coaster 2 is a "full rebuild".
</p>
<p>
As a suite of creative tools, then, Planet Coaster 2 is looking extremely impressive - even if this first proper gameplay breakdown does suggest the original's rather lacklustre management side won't be notably more robust. Still, that might change as Frontier reveals more Planet Coaster 2 details in the run-up to its Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC release this "autumn".

They'll also need to make promises to players, and whether they're kept or not will determine how they play throughout the season.</p><p dir="ltr">Another feature being introduced in Madden NFL 25 is Team Builder.

            <p>I'm hooked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-imperium">Dune Imperium</a>, a deckbuilder and worker placement digital board game I'm only just beginning to get my head around. Here comes some news to send my head spinning again: the Rise Of Ix expansion is out now, which adds three new factions, six new leaders, a new mode and much more.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Rise Of Ix expansion is currently only available for the Steam version of the game, where <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3051590/Dune_Imperium__Rise_of_Ix/">it costs £8.50</a>. 
</p>
<p>Ix adds additional strategic layers to the existing game, including a technology track for players to advance along, and new dreadnought units that can be used during combat. All of these are represented as new spaces on the board to which players can send their agents.
</p>
<p>There are also 35 new cards which can be added to your deck, and a new Epic Game Mode where where players fight for 12 victory points rather than the 10 of the base game. I've wished almost every match of Dune Imperium I've played could have gone longer, and I wonder if this might fulfil that wish.
</p>
<p>The update also comes with a set of bugfixes for the base game, including improvements to the AI that takes over when players resign, improved AI behaviour when playing Staged Incident, and other miscellaneous improvements to skirmish games.
</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-spice-wars-imperium-and-the-trouble-with-a-dune-strategy-game">Sin played both recent Dune strategy games, Imperium and real-time cousin Spice Wars</a>. She found both to be successful adaptations, in spite of or because of all they jettison from the source material.</p>
<p>I haven't played Spice Wars, which means I can confidently state that Imperium is definitely better. I'm not sure if I'm going to dive immediately into Rise Of Ix - I really don't feel as if I'm bored of the base game yet - but I'll definitely get to it in due course.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Simple enough. But for a long time during the Xbox 360’s run, the console used Microsoft Points, a virtual currency created by Xbox. This was already annoying enough, but what made matters worse was that the conversion for dollars to Microsoft Points was needlessly complicated. 80 points cost $1 USD. So doing the math for purchases was a pain. Luckily, this all went away in 2013.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="65b375ec1561fa2212731e414cee346c" data-recommend-id="image://65b375ec1561fa2212731e414cee346c" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows the Summer of Arcade logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image shows the Summer of Arcade logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65b375ec1561fa2212731e414cee346c" data-recommend-id="image://65b375ec1561fa2212731e414cee346c" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows the Summer of Arcade logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Xbox 360 wasn’t the first console to offer digital games to players, but it was the first to really embrace the concept and support it long-term.

These Summer of Arcade events produced a ton of great titles and got my buddies and me excited to check out smaller games we might have skipped over otherwise. Of all the things we lost from this era, this level of curation might be the biggest and most frustrating loss.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="130cf660ff342ea03c5ebf26c9c4be0a" data-recommend-id="image://130cf660ff342ea03c5ebf26c9c4be0a" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows some of the Xbox 360's launch games.

So instead, Xbox 360 used DVDs, like the PS2 and OG Xbox. (It was also cheaper to produce a DVD-powered console compared to Blu-ray.) </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hey-remember-the-xbox-360s-hd-dvd-drive-it-was-a-thi-1450452649&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hey-remember-the-xbox-360s-hd-dvd-drive-it-was-a-thi-1450452649">Later Microsoft offered an HD DVD player attachment</a></span>. That format never took off and Sony’s decision to include Blu-ray support in the PS3 was the right call. As the generation went on, it became wild how many big Xbox 360 games shipped on two, three, or even four DVDs while PS3 games rarely exceeded one Blu-ray. When the Xbox One arrived, Microsoft learned its lesson and supported Blu-ray.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fd1edb324d1d92d20e47a9a3dcfeb4a6" data-recommend-id="image://fd1edb324d1d92d20e47a9a3dcfeb4a6" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd1edb324d1d92d20e47a9a3dcfeb4a6" data-recommend-id="image://fd1edb324d1d92d20e47a9a3dcfeb4a6" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Before the Xbox 360, consoles didn’t track what games you played beyond whatever saves you created while playing stuff. But with the Xbox 360, Microsoft invented a whole new concept: Video game achievements. The idea was that every game on Xbox 360 would offer a series of challenges that could be completed for points and that the console would track all of this. I was one of the many people who spent a lot of time grinding for those achievements. </p><p>There was something so cool about a game rewarding you for doing something really hard, weird, or surprising while you played it. And being able to look back at your video game accomplishments and history years later was also rad. 360’s achievements were such a popular and smart concept that basically everybody else—including Sony and Valve—copied the system and it’s still around today.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b4bdd171c78499fdd737f2c373ca3032" data-recommend-id="image://b4bdd171c78499fdd737f2c373ca3032" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b4bdd171c78499fdd737f2c373ca3032" data-recommend-id="image://b4bdd171c78499fdd737f2c373ca3032" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The OG Xbox locked multiplayer behind a paywall, something that people criticized at the time.

The post linked an account page that appears to belong to Parsons called “bngpparsons.”<br></p><p>The page lists over a dozen classic cars and motorcycles that the Bungie executive seemingly won in auctions between September 2022 and June 2024. A 1967 Jaguar XKE Series I 4.2 Roadster has a winning bid of $205,000 in December 23, 2022. A 1971 Porsche 911S Coupe has a winning bid of $201,000 in November 22, 2023, the month after Bungie’s first round of mass layoffs. The winning bids for all auctions listed totals around $2.4 million. Many of the vehicles show up in a photo album on Flickr called “Avants Parsons garage tour 2024" which shows the CEO and others examining vintage cars in a commercial-sized garage. </p><p>“How exciting!” the bngpparsons account wrote after winning the Chevy in June. “I have wanted a c1 since I was a little kid. My second hot wheel ever (in gold). Going to its forever home.”</p><p>It’s unclear if the millions spent on the collection came from the Sony buyout or Parsons’ lifelong work at Bungie, and the amount would have likely been a drop in the bucket compared to the massive cuts being asked of the studio as a whole. But so far there doesn’t seem to be any evidence that senior Bungie leadership has taken salary cuts or pursued other cost-saving measures in solidarity with laid-off staff or those still employed who may struggle to make ends meet. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em> reported last fall</a></span> that when a Bungie department head was asked if Parsons or others were taking pay cuts amid the studio’s current crisis, they said it’s “not that type of company.”</p><p>When Sony originally purchased Bungie, some employees were optimistic.

Suda51 and Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami are interested in returning to the Killer7 series.</p><p>The two renowned game makers discussed their potential futures during an installment in one of Grasshopper Manufacture’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAQE3GIjdu4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grasshopper Direct</a> presentations. Toward the end of the 40-minute video, which primarily offers a behind-the-scenes look at Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered, Mikami and Suda were asked to comment on what they’re working on next. It was the Resident Evil veteran who brought up his desire to see more from Killer7.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/killer7-1722446227509.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Shinji Mikami and Suda51 are interested in revisiting the Killer7 series.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“I’ve realized that I want to stay as hands-on as possible when it comes to game creation, and I’d love to see Suda make a sequel to Killer7,” Mikami said.</p><p>Suda, surprised, replies, “Seriously?!”</p><p>Killer7 launched in 2005 and follows Harman Smith and his seven killer personalities. Fans have grown to appreciate the game in the last 19 years, with many falling in love with its unique gameplay, visuals, and style. We gave it an 8.1/10 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/07/01/killer-7"><u>our original review</u></a>, and at the time, we said, “Players who can look beyond the control mechanics will find a truly bold and intriguing adventure game lurking within Killer7's beautiful cel-shaded visuals.” Suda directed Killer7 with oversight from Mikami and isn’t opposed to revisiting its world.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“I’d rather make a complete edition first.</p></div><p>“Someday we just may see a Killer7 sequel or a ‘complete edition,’ " Suda adds. However, it sounds like he’d prefer to start with the latter.</p><p>“I’d rather make a complete edition first. First a complete edition and then Killer11,” he says with a smile. Suda continues: “I don’t know – ‘Killer7-something,’ probably. Maybe ‘Killer7: Beyond.’”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Mikami feels a Killer7 complete edition might be “doable,” but Grasshopper would need to first decide whether to pursue it or some sort of sequel first. For now, no sequel has been announced.

<p dir="ltr">It all looks fairly similar to the support hero Lucio from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a>, who wields an almost identical-looking gun and features similar music-based AOE abilities that heal or speed up teammates. If there's one major difference, it's that Luna doesn't have rollerblades (though in the gameplay trailer she does skate around on a hovering disc at one point), something that does make up a large part of how it feels to play Lucio in Blizzard's 6v6 shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from Luna, the first content update for the free-to-play shooter also adds an Ultimate version of the water-bending Valby Descendant, who comes equipped with a fancy new nano suit that allows access to new modification modules that change up gameplay. The update additionally adds a new Void Intercept Boss, Gluttony, a massive machine that if defeated will earn players blueprints for new ultimate weapons and components.</p><p dir="ltr">The First Descendant seems to have done well for itself since its July 2 launch, staying among the top-played and top-earning games on Steam and reaching more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-descendant-already-has-10-million-players/1100-6524898/" data-ref-id="1100-6524898">10 million players within its first week</a>. Developer Nexon recently received criticism over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-descendant-icons-that-look-eerily-similar-to-destiny-2s-will-be-changed/1100-6524951/" data-ref-id="1100-6524951">The First Descendant's use of in-game icons that looked almost identical to those in Destiny 2</a>. Nexon stated it would change the icons and "make adjustments to ensure that the imagery that may appear similar clearly reflects the unique identity of our game."</p>

There are some complexities to the game, especially in its differences to <em>Magic</em>. Instead of different colors of magic there are eight different elements that determine similar attributes. Players still must construct a deck of their own, in <em>FFTCG</em> it must have 50 cards exactly. You win by dealing seven points of damage to your opponent directly. </p><p>There are also some specific mechanics that the <em>FFTCG </em>has that try to fix common issues with <em>MTG</em>. As laid out in a helpful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/comments/178joq8/sell_me_on_this_game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/comments/178joq8/sell_me_on_this_game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a></span> post , <em>FFTCG </em>has a smart resource system in place to combat<em> MTG</em>’s common bottlenecking problem that forces you into a card draw loop. It also has a mechanic called EX Burst that gives losing players a better chance at changing the tides, giving you more control over how the game plays out rather than you being so beholden to card draws. </p><figure id="" data-id="c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-recommend-id="image://c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Ysayle Final Fantasy Trading Card Game card" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Ysayle Final Fantasy Trading Card Game card" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-recommend-id="image://c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Ysayle Final Fantasy Trading Card Game card" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All those specific mechanics make <em>FFTCG </em>sound great, and as someone who has only ever dipped her toes in card games but never fully taken the dive, it makes me feel like this could be a more welcoming experience. The card designs are also a major part of that. I have a strong affinity for the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series and its long-history of impeccable character designs. Seeing some of my favorite protagonists, villains, and weird little guys rendered in a beautiful art style on the cards makes me want to buy a bunch of them, even if just to look at them. I haven’t actually played a match yet, and it’s not just because I only have one card.<br></p><p>There are fans of the <em>FFTCG </em>out there. Just look at the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subreddit</a></span> or dedicated sites like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://ffdecks.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://ffdecks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ffdecks.com</a></span>, but the community is definitely smaller than <em>MTG</em>’s. Living in New York City, I’m sure I could find a local game shop that does run the occasional game, but by and large, opportunities for playing seem few and far between. As a newcomer it’s hard to find a casual place to learn the basics. I could buy as many cards as I want and read over the rules (which I have done) but I wouldn’t have people to play with, and I don’t think my fiancée would appreciate me trying to force her to play. This makes it all the more confusing to me that there isn’t an online version. </p><p>With the likes of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-arena-the-kotaku-review-1834790330&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-arena-the-kotaku-review-1834790330"><em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em></a></span> making that card game more accessible to players across the world, and a great point of entry for curious newcomers, it feels like a no-brainer for the <em>FFTCG</em>. Yet, until a good online version of the game is released, I think my growing interest in the <em>Final Fantasy Trading Card Game</em> will be limited to purchasing cards so I can look at them. Though it turns out my friend’s gift was strategically timed, as on August 2, <em>FFTCG </em>will release <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fftcg.square-enix-games.com/en/news/new-product-information-hidden-trials-booster-pack-set&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fftcg.square-enix-games.com/en/news/new-product-information-hidden-trials-booster-pack-set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hidden Trials</em></a></span>, its latest set . Maybe I need to consider setting up Discord matches, at least that way I can excuse the ill-advised spending I’m thinking about doing right now.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
