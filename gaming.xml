<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158869/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>I've become so used to Nintendo taking its sweet time with DLC rollouts I assumed there was no way we'd get first-party add-ons within the first year of Switch 2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/animal_crossing_new_horizons_-_happy_home_paradise_dlc">Happy Home Paradise</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mario_kart_8_deluxe_booster_course_pass">Booster Course Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/splatoon_3_side_order">Side Order</a> were all pleasantly surprising, not because of their packed bonus content (though that was a welcome factor), but because I had given up hope of ever hearing from these games again. So, you can only imagine my surprise when Nintendo flung an image of DK and Pauline at me last week, accompanied by the words 'DLC' and 'Available Today'.</p>
<p>It has been a little over two months since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> launched on Switch 2, and the DLC is already here. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> expansion packs in a new area to explore <em>and</em> a ridiculously fun new game mode, but its proximity to the base game's arrival and a £16.99 / $19.99 price tag make it difficult to shake the feeling that this add-on content should have been included from the jump. In short, this banana is split.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158864/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's kick things off with the positives — because come on, could <em>you</em> be mean to DK's goofy little grin? I'll get to DK Island in just a moment, but the new Emerald Rush mode is undoubtedly the star of the show. What's more, it slaps.</p>
<p>This takes the basic movement and combat of Bananza and shapes it into a roguelike. Yes, a roguelike. It sounds like a bit of a square-peg-round-hole situation, no? Don't worry, I was of the same mind for a second too, but once I started barrelling around with a timer ticking away in the background, I quickly saw the two were a match made in heaven.</p>
<p>After the events of the main story (don't worry, I won't be spoiling too much here), big bad Void Kong finds himself chilling on the surface at DK Island — the one from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">64</a> et al. Putting his Banandium passions behind him, he ropes DK and Pauline into a new mining operation: Emerald Ore. Void has quotas to fill, and he wants to fill them fast, so our beloved platforming pair set out collecting as much of the damn stuff as possible.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158867/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not your typical roguelike set-up, but stay with me here. Void's initial quotas are simple enough to fill within the 99-second time limit, but as the pressure ramps up, you'll need to rely on 'Perks' found in Fossils scattered across the stage to keep the ore supplies rolling in. These boosts can increase the amount of ore you get from defeating an enemy, influence the frequency of treasure chests, or grant bonuses to certain Bananza transformations. There's a boatload of them. What's important, however, is that every Fossil will let you add one to your 'build' — a 'build' that resets with every run. <em>There's</em> the roguelike repetition we know and love!</p>
<p>Whether you fulfil all of Void's quotas or crash out under the pressure, DK's Perks are reset for the next run, so you'll have to start from scratch to craft the ultimate ore-collecting machine. Of course, the genre's randomisation is all present and correct too, so no two builds will be identical — you can only make the most of the Perks presented to you, after all.</p>
<p>It's fast, it's frantic, and it gels beautifully with Bananza's destructive gameplay. I adored how DK handled in the base game, and I got to really put my skills to the test here. The ever-ticking timer means rolls, jumps and Turf Surfs are more important than ever, and there's even a meaty list of rewards that progressively unlock after successful runs that promise new outfits, Perks, and the chance to go rogue(like) on other layers.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158863/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the layer you'll start on (and, let's admit it, the one you'll want to spend the most time with) is DK Island. This is a brand new setting for Bananza, and it looks every bit as enticing as you'd expect. DK's house is here, the DK-shaped mountain is here, even Grant Kirkhope's lovely little island theme from DK 64 is here.</p>
<p>In Emerald Rush, it's a joy to dash past these familiar surroundings en route to your next quota. But without Emerald Rush... it's lifeless. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a>, Bananza feels built for bonus DLC worlds — a new layer with a tiny storyline and a handful of fresh collectibles feels like a no-brainer, right? But, also like Odyssey, Nintendo doesn't seem to see that.</p>
<p>While pretty to look at and fun to run around, DK Island has no unique Banandium Gems or Fossils. There are no missions to complete or bosses to battle. Heck, apart from Squark's Statue hut, there's not even a shop with some new merch. Sure, Emerald Rush brings some of these to the table (one of them crops up <em>right</em> at the end), but without the pressure of the timer ticking away in the background, the new island struck me as a massive wasted opportunity.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158861/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As fun as Emerald Rush is (and, as I've said, it's <em>really</em> fun), its addition alone doesn't quite feel worth the price of admission. If this roguelike island had cropped up in the base game, it'd be happy days all around. Rambi Rumble brought a welcome change of pace to the Racing Layer, so why not do it again? But as it stands, Emerald Rush feels lost in an otherwise quite bland package.</p>
<p>If you've 100%-ed the base game and are looking for an excuse to dive back in for more action, this is a good excuse to do it — you'll get more than a good few hours of roguelike smiles. If you're looking for something more substantial, you won't find it here. I can't believe I'm saying this after tracking down all 777 Banandium Gems, 696 Fossils and 110 Discs in the base game, but this DLC could have done with some more collectibles.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush feels like a split banana. The new roguelike mode is a lot of fun, gelling surprisingly well with the game's core mechanics and giving me a welcome excuse to swing back into my beloved Bananza, but the other half of the deal, DK Island, left me feeling a little short-changed with its lack of appeal outside of the new game mode.</p>
<p>Bananza constantly reminded me of Odyssey as I played through the base game, and now it seems, much like its platforming predecessor, I'm going to be forever thinking about the DLC potential that never was.</p></section>

            <p>
There is nothing inherently awful in a game being obscenely long, in fact it can be quite pleasurable to get to know a digital world so intimately. The issue is that I am an "adult" who has to "work" to pay my "bills" and "taxes," so I don't always have time for such things. How some of you manage to fit in multiple playthroughs of Persona games will always be an enigma to me. But, as I sit here in my despair, along comes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/34everlast">34EVERLAST</a>, a game designed to be beaten in "as little as 10 minutes," expressly designed for "busy working adults."
</p>
<p>
34EVERLAST, according to its Steam page description, is an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> puzzle game about the world ending, which I'm going to be incredibly real with you all for the moment, sounds like a very heavy topic for a game where you can beat it in 10 minutes. However! The way you apparently survive this is by ending the "'worlds that refuse to die' that are parallel to this world." Not any lighter or smaller a concept, potentially compelling though.

<p>
Gameplay works twofold. In the first instance, it's a 3D action game, looking a little bit PlatinumGamesy in nature. You run, fall, and fight through various worlds on the brink of collapse, with what looks like some visual novel stroke manga elements mixed in for the story. There are also some puzzle elements, though how these manifest isn't quite as clear.
</p><p>
As condensed as it is, conceptually I quite like some of the design choices it claims to make. The Steam page says that if you make it rain in one world, a desert in another might turn into a forest. You can die in boss fights on purpose too, to potentially "gain an advantage against another." A smally, flashy package, yet one that, if successful, may have a good bit of substance to it.
</p>
<p>
While I am intrigued by the concept, it does also raise a bigger, perhaps more personally existential question about life. What are the reasons that we have so little time for hobbies we so greatly enjoy? I could probably name a few, but that'd be going into feature territory. I somewhat hope 34EVERLAST takes such a question into consideration in its story, rather than the 10 minute thing just being a bit of a gimmick.
</p>
<p>
There's no exact release date for 34EVERLAST just yet, but it was confirmed by publisher Playism that it's due out sometime in 2026. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2134470/34EVERLAST/">wishlist it on Steam now</a>.

              <p>Have you ever dreamed of playing <em>Halo</em> on an <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-an-original-xbox-easter-egg-thats-remained-hidden-1846926839">original Xbox</a>, but you didn’t want to use a big TV? And you also wanted to risk damaging your game disc and/or fingers in the process while holding a large technological monstrosity in your hands? Well, that’s a strange dream you have, buddy, but I got just the video for you.</p> <p>On September 16, as spotted by <em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/handhelds/now-i-can-take-steel-battalion-with-me-everywhere-hey-gamers-ive-found-your-xbox-handheld/">GamesRadar</a></em>, YouTuber, retro console enthusiast, and modder James Channel <a href="https://youtu.be/W3OK9A_RbSI">posted a new video</a> to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Games_for_James">wonderful channel</a> all about his wild and wacky experience turning an OG Xbox into a portable handheld console in the most janky way possible. It’s a fantastic video that involves Channel getting shocked, ripping apart multiple electronic devices, and covering the entire beast in a bunch of duct tape. Here’s the video, which is admittedly 33 minutes long, but totally worth watching.</p>  <p>Something I really appreciate about this video is how committed the modder is to making sure this handheld Xbox looks and feels hacked together. It’s like a Frankenstein’s monster of a console, with pieces and parts from an old iPod dock crammed on top of an Xbox’s motherboard. And while it takes him a few attempts and a lot of tinkering, he does eventually pull it off and is able to play <em>Halo</em> in one of the wildest ways possible. It also seems very dangerous, as there is a DVD spinning incredibly fast just a few inches away from his fingers and face at all times.</p> <p>This monster of a thing even sports a relatively impressive 9 minutes and 40 seconds of battery life. That might not sound like a lot, but keep in mind this slapdash device relies on nearly 20-year-old batteries from an iPod dock. The fact that it can even run at all on just those ancient chemical husks is incredible. And if you were then wondering, “<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/steel-battalion">Can this thing play <em>Steel Battalion</em></a>?” well, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/W3OK9A_RbSI?t=1964">Yes, it can.</a></p>

<p>A spokesperson for EA confirmed the finer details about how cross-play works on console, and that is that when it's toggled on, the game will <em>prioritize</em> console-only cross-play, but not guarantee it<em>.</em> Players can select Cross-play Off to only play against people on their platform.</p><p>On PC, cross-play is on by default and cannot be turned off. Here are the two settings and their descriptions, as written by EA: </p><p><strong>Cross-play ON</strong></p><ul><li>On console, when cross-play is on, we will prioritize allocating you on servers with other console-only players, but players can expect to be in a larger matchmaking pool with players on all platforms. Cross-play On is the only option available on PC.</li></ul><p><strong>Cross-play OFF</strong></p><ul><li>You will only play against players on your platform (Xbox only if on Xbox, PlayStation only if on PlayStation). Joining with friends/parties containing players from other platforms will not be available.</li></ul><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. A <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1968006588784058548" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">battle royale mode</a> is in development as well, and it <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1968006588784058548" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">could launch on October 28. </a></p>

                <p>Florida has set its lasers to "sue" as the Sunshine State moves to attack porn games and their distributors in court.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/09/15/florida-targets-porn-video-game-websites-under-child-safety-law/86167331007/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Tallahassee Democrat</a>, Florida's attorney general James Uthmeier filed two separate lawsuits against Lustyheroes.com and the parent company of Nutaku.net and SpiceVids.com. The dual suits allege that these websites have violated <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HB 3</a>, the state law that went into effect in January and forced explicit websites to verify the ages of Florida users.</p><p>According to Uthmeier, all three websites have skirted the responsibility of ensuring that people visiting them are at least 18 years old. As such, he's serving them fresh lawsuits to ostensibly make examples out of them.</p><p>"Florida is committed to being the best place to raise children," Uthmeier said in <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-files-complaints-against-pornography-websites-violating" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a press release</a>. "We passed strong legislation to keep kids from being exposed to harmful and toxic material, and instead of following it, these platforms ignored it. We are taking them to court to make sure they cannot continue bypassing Florida’s common sense safeguards."</p><p>Gethins Limited is the distributor of Lustyheroes, while Aylo is the parent company behind Nutaku and SpiceVids (as well as Pornhub). Although Gethins Limited has yet to publicly comment on the lawsuit, Aylo said both Nutaku and SpiceVids have complied with the legislation since it went into effect earlier this year.</p><p>"We intend to vigorously defend against these allegations in court," Aylo told the Tallahassee Democrat. "These platforms are committed to ongoing compliance with applicable state laws. We look forward to presenting the facts through the appropriate legal process."</p><p>This is the latest development in the ongoing battle against pornographic material by Republican lawmakers. If you're an explicit-material enjoyer--whether casual or otherwise--you may have seen age verification pop-ups when visiting these websites (depending on where you live in the US). GOP members are adamant that, to protect the kids, "graphic" and "harmful" material must be abated. But there are always ways to consume porn.</p>

                <p>Amazon's long-anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-shows-latest-update-reveals-a-key-detail/1100-6534272/" data-ref-id="1100-6534272">Mass Effect TV series</a> is reportedly moving forward with casting, and it appears early character details have surfaced online. These leaks have sparked widespread speculation among fans about which iconic characters from BioWare's beloved video game trilogy may be featured, and what kind of storyline the show might explore. The casting call includes roles that closely resemble Commander Shepard and Liara T'Soni, leading some to believe the series may follow the original game's narrative or, at least, a variation of it.</p><p>According to insider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/mass-effect-138895669" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Daniel Richtman</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/casting-calls-for-amazons-mass-effect-series-have-leaked-and-fans-are-now-trying-to-guess-which-characters-are-included" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), who has previously provided reliable casting details for projects like the Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot, the show is searching for a male lead in the 30–39 age range described as a "young Colin Farrell" type, as well as a 34–39-year-old female alien character requiring prosthetics. This has led fans to theorize that these roles are for a male Shepard and Liara, respectively. Other notable roles include a female character offering a parallel Earth-based narrative (maybe a gender-swapped Captain Anderson from Mass Effect 3), a villain described as a Doug Jones type aged 40–60, and a soldier-like male character aged 30–49, who evokes comparisons to James Vega.</p><p>The character descriptions have fueled intense speculation, particularly around the apparent decision to cast a male lead. Many fans see this as a possible confirmation that the series will make the male version of Shepard canon--a controversial move given how central player choice is to the Mass Effect experience. However, it's worth noting that Amazon has not confirmed whether the show will directly adapt the original trilogy. Given the branching narrative paths and customizable protagonists of the games, a faithful adaptation could be a significant challenge.</p><p>Interestingly, this may lead the series to chart new territory instead. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">BioWare itself is working on a new Mass Effect installment</a> that uses familiar elements like the return of Liara, yet is reportedly set far enough in the future to account for all possible endings of the trilogy.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix%E2%80%99s-animated-splinter-cell-tv-show-is-the-only-return-sam-fisher-has-on-the-calendar-amid-no-news-of-a-new-game.1300704/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-netflix-anime-series/">2020</a>, we learned that Ubisoft was teaming up with Netflix to produce an animated Splinter Cell TV series adaptation. Now, five years later, that adaptation, titled Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, will finally premiere this coming October 14, 2025. But as far as a new game in the series is concerned, or even when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-continuing-to-progress-according-to-rumors/">previously announced remake is coming</a>? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>



<p>Netflix debuted the first official trailer for Splinter Cell: Deathwatch yesterday, alongside its release date, featuring an older Sam Fisher getting back into his three-eyed night vision goggles alongside a new Splinter Cell agent for a new generation, Zinnia McKenna. Fisher is being voiced by Liev Schreiber instead of his original voice actor, Michael Ironside, while McKenna is played by Kirby Howell-Baptiste.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Deathwatch | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4A9iFjaKeMk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The story of Deathwatch follows Fisher getting back into the fight thanks to a personal connection, after McKenna seeks his help. A larger plot unfolds, and a much older Fisher than the one we knew in the core games finds himself back in the thick of it.</p>



<p>It seems like a fairly solid foundation for an interesting story, but that's not all fans of the Splinter Cell franchise are looking for. A new animated show is great, but everyone is waiting on a new game.</p>



<p>Stealth games like the original Splinter Cell series are few and far between nowadays, and a new game in the series is well overdue. Hopefully, we'll actually hear something about a new game in the series within the next year, or at the very least the coming remake, if we're not going to get a brand new entry in the series.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Splinter Cell fans who are taking whatever morsels of information they can, can try to tide themselves over with the coming animated series.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-toreador-lasombra-paywall-removed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloodlines-2s-toreador-and-lasombra-paywall-has-been-removed.1300701/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Paradox and&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade&nbsp;</em>IP owner White Wolf&nbsp;have announced that&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>'s Lasombra and Toreador clans will no longer be optional extra DLC for the game.</p>

<p>In the description of a new overview trailer, the two studios say that both clans "are confirmed for the base game at launch", and that this means all six playable clans will now be available for everyone rather than just those who pony up a little extra cash.</p>

<p><em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>executive producer and White Wolf executive VP Marco Behrmann says players' "frank feedback" has been heard, and that since that feedback made it clear Lasombra and Toreador should be included in the base game, "that is what we are doing".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-clans-paywall-shooting.jpg?itok=imC_aknQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-clans-paywall-shooting.jpg?itok=TFp_tuwS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bloodlines 2</em>'s Toreador and Lasombra clans will no longer be behind a paywall.</figcaption></figure><p>It was first revealed that two clans would be hidden behind a paywall <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-sucks-youll-have-to-pay-for-two-clans-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in August</a>, quickly prompting an outcry, especially given that the add-on required to unlock both clans would have set you back an extra $22.</p>

<p>Honestly, this feels like a great time to ask why it was so easy for Paradox and White Wolf to remove the paywall on both clans. It's almost as though it was arbitrarily added to make the studios a bit of extra money in the first place, but hey, what do I know?</p>

<p>Of course, if you are desperate to pay some extra money on top of the fee you're already coughing up for <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, there will still be some DLC you can grab at launch, namely two story packs that are included as part of the expansion pass every game must now have.</p>

<p>The Loose Cannon and The Flower &amp; The Flame story packs won't be released until next year, but you will get the Santa Monica Memories Cosmetic Pack on day one, so, well, there's that, I suppose.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>, it's the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">long-awaited</a> (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again" rel="nofollow">oft-delayed</a>) followup to the cult 2004 action RPG. The game was originally being worked on by Hardsuit Labs before a developer switch to&nbsp;<em>Dear Esther&nbsp;</em>studio The Chinese Room was announced&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">in 2023</a>.</p>

<p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on October 21st for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10007767/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/9pf9rkwb9b50" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The upcoming retro-inspired brawler <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> is one of the coolest-looking Marvel games in years. And now we know the identities of two more Marvel characters who will be joining the pixelated action when <em>Cosmic Invasion</em> launches later this year. One of them is a very popular character you are likely familiar with, and the other is Cosmic Ghost Rider.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-brawler-dotemu-tmnt-co-op-switch-1851772740">Announced in March</a> during a Nintendo Direct, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is a side-scrolling 2D pixel-art beat ’em up being developed by Tribute Games. That’s the team behind <em>Mercenary Kings</em> and the totally rad <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, which was also a 2D co-op brawler. <em>Cosmic Invasion,</em> like Tribute’s past work, looks to be another snappy and action-packed retro throwback that I’ll be playing over and over with friends. We’ll all have a huge roster of characters to pick from, as Tribute and Marvel have confirmed that <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/17/black-panther-cosmic-ghost-rider-join-marvel-cosmic-invasion/#:~:text=In%20Marvel%20Cosmic%20Invasion%2C%20one%20of%20our%20biggest%20features%20is%20our%20playable%20character%20roster%20boasting%2015%20Super%20Heroes!">15 heroes</a> will be available at launch. And now we know two more names that have made the cut: Black Panther and Cosmic Ghost Rider.</p> <p>On September 17, Tribute put out a trailer showing off the newly announced<em> Cosmic Invasion</em> characters, which you can watch below:</p>

  <p>I likely don’t need to explain who Black Panther is to most people reading a video game website in 2025. The character has appeared in multiple games, movies, and award-winning comics and has become extremely popular, thanks in large part to the fantastic performance delivered by the late Chadwick Boseman in the MCU. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Ghost_Rider">Cosmic Ghost Rider</a> is a bit more obscure and quite an odd duck. The short version is that he’s an alt-universe version of The Punisher that died and became the Ghost Rider and then met up with Galactus, who made him his Herald aka his new Silver Surfer basically. Yeah, it’s weird. But hey, he’s literally got Cosmic in his name, so he seems like a fine choice for <em>Cosmic Invasion.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Every character confirmed for <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></h2> <p>Here are all the <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> characters that have been officially revealed so far. As mentioned, the full roster will include 15 people, so after today’s reveal, that leaves just three more heroes left to unveil.</p>

 <ul> <li>Captain America</li> <li>Spider-Man</li> <li>Venom</li> <li>Wolverine</li> <li>Storm</li> <li>Phyla-Vell</li> <li>Nova</li> <li>Rocket Raccoon</li> <li>She-Hulk</li> <li>Beta Ray Bill</li> <li>Silver Surfer</li> <li>Black Panther</li> <li>Cosmic Ghost Rider</li> </ul> <p>It makes sense that the game will feature a huge roster, as the big gimmick in<em> Cosmic Invasion</em> is that <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">everyone picks two characters</a> that you can then swap between while playing. This means that if four players join the game, you’ll be rolling into fights with eight Marvel characters. Good luck to all the random, nameless goons trying to fight Venom, Storm, Wolverine, Spider-Man, and Black Panther.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> looks great and sounds like a blast based on previews</a> of the upcoming brawler. We still don’t have a specific release date for the game yet beyond 2025. Hopefully it lands soon, though maybe not in October. That month is already a mess.</p>

About a month ago, it was announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> would only feature four different clans in its base game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sticks-two-bloodsucker-clans-including-the-sexy-one-behind-paid-day-one-dlc">with two extra clans coming as day one DLC</a>. This, unsurprisingly, was received like a wet fart on a hot Sunday at church, with publisher Paradox later saying that they would make "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-are-making-adjustments-to-bloodlines-2s-day-one-vampire-clan-dlc-plans-following-backlash">adjustments</a>" based on the response. And as confirmed in a press release and new trailer, said adjustments are the fact that these two clans, Lasombra and Toreador, will be included in the base game at launch.
</p>
<p>
"Thanks to our community for the frank feedback on Bloodlines 2 and the Premium Edition. That feedback made it clear: Lasombra and Toreador belong in the base game, so that is what we are doing," said Bloodlines 2 executive producer Marco Behrmann in a statement. Behrmann also thanked developer The Chinese Room for their "quick turnaround on the concepts for the post-launch story packs."

<p>
This new trailer also showed off a couple of said story packs, Loose Cannon and The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flower">Flower</a> &amp; The Flame. These will apparently let you play as Camarilla Sheriff Benny Muldoon and Primogen Ysabella Moore, respectively, and will both be released in 2026. You can get them either through the game's premium edition, or as individual pieces of DLC. I'd also like to point out that the trailer makes it very clear what is and isn't base game content, as it says as much in a little label on the top right of the video. Certainly feels like Paradox wanted to be as clear as possible this time around.
</p>
<p>
Despite several delays, it's not long until Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 actually launches now, as it's due out next month, October 21st.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/former-telltale-devs-the-wolf-among-us-2-adhoc-dispatch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-telltale-devs-think-%E2%80%9Cpeople-would-love%E2%80%9D-the-version-of-the-wolf-among-us-2-they-had-written-wishes-telltale-%E2%80%9Cgood-luck%E2%80%9D.1300617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's not unfair to say that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been through the videogame development wringer. There was a time when we thought the game would never be released, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/telltale-games/">Telltale</a> famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-closing-walking-dead/">went bankrupt and shut down</a>. Then the studio was brought back to life, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-revived/">hope was restored</a> for new Telltale titles, and development on The Wolf Among Us 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-development-reboot-unreal/">was restarted</a>. </p>



<p>But that was five years ago, and it's been three years since we heard that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-gets-first-official-trailer-will-launch-in-2023/">game was supposed to arrive in 2023</a>. Then it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-delayed-beyond-2023-unreal-engine-5/">delayed out of 2023</a>, and in the time since, we've only gotten some <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-gets-first-ue5-screenshots/">nice-looking screenshots</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-isnt-canceled-confirms-telltale-games/">Telltale's word</a> to make us believe that the game is still in development.</p>



<p>It's all taken far longer than anyone might've initially thought it would, and one former writer at Telltale, Nick Herman, who has long since moved on from the studio to be a co-founder of AdHoc, a team formed by Herman and other former Telltale developers who are due to release their newest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/">Dispatch, in October</a>, has shed a bit of light on what happened with this game's prolonged development.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-the-studio-that-wrote-the-wolf-among-us-2-doesnt-know-whats-going-on-with-it">Eurogamer</a> about Dispatch, Herman tried to answer why the AdHoc team, which was working alongside Telltale to make The Wolf Among Us 2 at the time, stopped working on the game and moved on to Dispatch. Herman also offered a potentially reassuring note, saying that in his mind, what they had written was better than the first game, and if it ever made it into players' hands, "<em>people would love it</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Look, the truth is</em>," Herman began before another former Telltale developer and AdHoc co-founder, Pierre Shorette, interjected in what seems to have been a coy way, since Eurogamer states he did it with a smile, saying, "<em>Yeah why did we stop working on that, Nick?</em>" </p>



<p>Herman continued, saying, "<em>We wrote a season, Season Two. We think it's better than Season One - and we were on Season One. And yeah, we're really proud of it. We were doing tests. We were in cinematics and animation and stuff. And then basically they needed more time.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>They weren't… We weren't running the project. It was Telltale we were doing it in partnership with. And we couldn't wait around and do nothing, so we had to move on to Dispatch to keep the studio moving, and they needed to go their own way.</em> <em>We're looking forward to seeing what they do with it</em>. <em>I don't know how much of our version of the script is going to make it into what they end up making. But if one day we were able to make the thing that we wrote and were in the middle of directing, we think people would love it. So, you know, good luck</em>."</p>



<p>At this point, only those inside Telltale can really tell the tale of what's going on with the studio now and The Wolf Among Us 2's development. Hopefully, it's a story that has a good ending, one where the game does cross the finish line, and lives up to players' expectations.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Paizo's recent crowdfunding project, <em>Pathfinder Quest</em>, is a runaway hit on Backerkit. The board game, which promises an authentic GM-less version of the fantasy TTRPG experience, was fully funded in just 90 minutes and has been steadily reaching stretch goals since going live.</p>



<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/paizo-inc/pathfinder-quest" rel="nofollow"><em>Pathfinder Quest</em></a> is a cooperative board game designed for 1-4 players. Like the beloved <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a> TTRPG, players can create their own characters, choosing their ancestry, class, and abilities. Alternatively, they can play as pregenerated characters based on Iconics like Valeros, Harsk, and Ezren.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-quest-game-contents.jpg?itok=slA2NMee 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-quest-game-contents.jpg?itok=bBQOc4k4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Those characters will embark on a campaign spanning 12 possible adventures. These adventures will be packed with exploration, combat, and choices that will ripple throughout the multisession campaign. Each of these adventures is designed to last roughly two hours and strikes a balance between random dungeon crawls and a more curated, in-depth experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Pathfinder Quest</em> isn't a direct translation of the TTRPG. Dungeon navigation, combat, and leveling up are still present, but mechanics are more streamlined. Whenever an action is taken, you roll Quest Dice, which are D6s, and you refer to the game's Challenge Book to determine the results of your action. In addition, it appears damage is not represented as hit points, but as wound tokens.</p>

<p>The game is available in two editions. The standard edition contains everything you need to play. Dice, ability cards, various books, character and enemy standees, etc.. The second is the Backerkit-exclusive Deluxe Edition, which includes special variants of those game pieces and sculpted miniatures. These miniatures are perfectly scaled to work with existing Pathfinder miniatures for your home game.</p>

<p>The pledge levels for <em>Pathfinder Quest</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Apprentice Adventurer for $100:</strong> A standard edition copy of the game, as well as any physical and digital stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Veteran Dungeoneer for $120:</strong> A deluxe edition copy of the game, as well as any physical and digital stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Dragon's Hoard for $240:</strong> A deluxe edition copy of the game, a unique set of magma dice by FanRoll, four player mats made by GameHead, A Hero Miniatures set by Titan Forge, and a Narrative Companion App by Forteller</li>
	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Miniature Menagerie for $450:</strong> A deluxe edition copy of the game, a Hero Miniatures Set, Early Encounter Creature Miniatures set, Late Encounter Creature Miniatures set, and Time Dragon miniature</li>
	<li><strong>Animal Companion for $1000:</strong> Collaborate with Paizo to create an Animal Companion Card based on your pet or an animal of your choosing. This includes a high-quality art print illustration and 20 copies of the Animal Companion Card to use in the game</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Pathfinder Quest</em> campaign has raised&nbsp;<span data-controller="funding-counter" data-funding-counter-amount-value="256592" data-funding-counter-currency-value="$" data-funding-counter-target="amount" id="funding-counter-project-2656">$256,592, more than three times its initial funding goal of $75,000. This has unlocked several stretch goals for the campaign, including additional dice, new undead enemy miniatures, the Oracle class, and a treasure chest-shaped custom organizer for all game components as an optional add-on. The campaign ends on October 17.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Seagate’s 2TB Xbox Expansion Card Is Cheaper per TB Than the 1TB One, All-Time Low Ahead of Prime Day in October]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-2tb-xbox-expansion-card-is-cheaper-per-tb-than-the-1tb-one-all-time-low-ahead-of-prime-day-in-october-2000626069</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate%E2%80%99s-2tb-xbox-expansion-card-is-cheaper-per-tb-than-the-1tb-one-all-time-low-ahead-of-prime-day-in-october.1300605/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Video game files sizes have gotten ridiculous. As time goes on, they continue to balloon to astronomical levels that are frankly unreasonable. This is especially common among western AAA developers. Just this year, we saw&nbsp;<em>Oblivion: Remastered</em> reach a size of over 120GB. I don’t even want to think about just how much space&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI </em>is going to take up. While these game files extending into the triple digits of gigabytes, our Xbox consoles still sit at their base internal storage of 1TB. If you intend to play more than just the same four games back and fourth, you’re going to have to do some regular maintenance of deleting and reinstalling games — but not one want to that. The better solution is to get yourself a dedicated expansion drive. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/">Seagate has one made specifically for the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. For a limited time, you can grab it for a hefty discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Right now, Amazon has three models of the Seagate expansion card for Xbox on sale. The 1TB model is down from $160 to just $130, saving you $30. The 2TB version comes down from $360 to just $218, a savings of $142. Then we have the massive 4TB model, normally priced at $500 but down to $430. That’s a savings of $70 with the deal. The best deal among the three at this time is for the 2TB version. That $142 savings accounts for a whopping 39% discount.</p>

<p>Since the Xbox Series X only starts with a single terabyte of storage, adding on one of these Seagate drives means you’ll be either doubling, tripling, or quintupling your storage capacity.</p>
<p>The Seagate expansion card is super easy to install. While the PS5 expansion SSDs require opening up the casing of your console, these ones for Xbox simply just plug into a dedicated slot in the back. No tools necessary. Once installed, you can choose to have the games you download save to either your internal storage or the new Seagate drive.</p>



<h2>Play Games Seamlessly</h2>
<p>Games saved to the Seagate drive receive the same benefits as those on your internal drive. One of the features of this generation Xbox that Microsoft likes to show off is Quick Resume. That allows you to suspend your game state of one game while you play another. You can hop from a race in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> into a quick&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em> match with your buds, then pop back over to Forza to cross the finish line.</p>
<p>Well, Seagate officially-licensed the Xbox Velocity Architecture which is what makes Quick Resume possible.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/"> That means its supported on any game you have downloaded, whether its to your internals or to your new Seagate drive.</a></p>
