And if you're looking to celebrate the occasion, why not do it with this Jaws movie poster puzzle from Spin Master Games? It features the iconic image of "Bruce" the shark sneaking up on a swimmer with the film's title across the top. Similar to the Ghostbusters puzzle, it's 500 pieces and even comes packaged in a VHS-style case, only this time straight from the shelves of Blockbuster. A truly excellent package for movie fans.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Aquarius Harry Potter Movie Posters Collage Puzzle (1,000 Pieces)</h2></div><div catalogid="8ab5eeae-e9ed-49f9-b7d4-2ac2a5be2279" id="225795"><div id="225795" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>AQUARIUS Harry Potter Puzzle Movie Posters Collage (1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like with the Lord of the Rings triptych, it's sometimes too hard to pick just one poster from a series of films. So why settle for just one when you can have everything all together? This Harry Potter puzzle from Aquarius, which comes to 1,000 pieces, is perfect for fans who want to make sure every movie poster from the franchise is accounted for. It features <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-movies-in-order">all eight Harry Potter movies</a> as posters across the top and bottom, with Ron, Harry, and Hermione in the middle. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Aquarius The Goonies Puzzle (500 Pieces)</h2></div><div catalogid="8ab5eeae-e9ed-49f9-b7d4-2ac2a5be2279" id="225796"><div id="225796" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>AQUARIUS The Goonies 500pc Puzzle (500 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is another movie poster puzzle from Aquarius, but this time only covering one movie poster rather than multiple from a franchise. For fans of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-goonies">'80s classic The Goonies</a>, this puzzle comes to 500 pieces and captures the film's one sheet in a truly frame-worthy final product. By the time you're finished, you'll be itching to watch it and experience the adventure all over again.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ceaco Disney/Pixar Movie Posters Puzzle (2,000 Pieces)</h2></div><div catalogid="8ab5eeae-e9ed-49f9-b7d4-2ac2a5be2279" id="225797"><div id="225797" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ceaco - Disney / Pixar - Movie Posters - 2000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, there are simply too many good Pixar movie posters to focus on just one. Thankfully, this 2,000 piece puzzle from Ceaco features a big collage of several different posters from the company, from Finding Nemo to The Incredibles to Toy Story to Coco. If you're a Pixar fan, this massive puzzle is an excellent project to take on. By the time you finally finish this puzzle, you'll likely want to watch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pixar-movies-in-order">all of the Pixar movies in order</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Buy a Puzzle or a Poster for Your Wall?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This depends on what you're looking for. Paper movie posters can really capture that traditional feeling of walking into a movie theater when they're in a frame, but puzzle movie posters like the ones above add a fun pop of personality to a room. Since they come in different sizes and styles - especially if you choose to go with one of the collage-style puzzles listed above - and you pieced them together yourself, they can add a nice personal touch to your wall. But again, it all depends on your personal preference of what sort of poster design you'd rather have up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're leaning towards framing the movie poster puzzles listed above, we can help with that, too. You can check out some of our favorite frames for puzzles in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">puzzle gift guide</a> and this <a href="https://zdcs.link/av48p8?object_uuid=f9d1f4ba-9fce-40f0-95e6-df22dc343bc6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RoseArt Jigsaw Puzzle Glue</a> will help you keep your favorite pieces together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 1, 2025 11:52 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-movie-poster-puzzles]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> is just around the corner, promising more looter shooter shenanigans than ever before with its seamless open world design and exciting new traversal methods. There's a ton to look forward to when the game lands on September 12, and it's certain to keep you busy for many months beyond. But what if your friends are picking the game up on a platform you don't have? And what if you want to carry your saves between different ecosystems? We've got the answers about Borderlands 4's cross-play and cross-progression below.</p><h2>Does Borderlands 4 have cross-play?</h2><p>If you have friends playing on different platforms, we've got some good news for you. Borderlands 4 supports cross-play functionality across every platform, letting you team up with any of your pals for some lootin' and shootin'.</p><p>Before you can begin playing with anyone on another platform, however, you'll need to <a href="https://shift.gearboxsoftware.com/home" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for a SHiFT account</a>. This is a "Gearbox account," for all intents and purposes. Without one, you'll be limited to playing with players who own the game on your platform.</p><p>A SHiFT account has other benefits beyond just cross-play functionality, though. It also allows you to redeem SHiFT codes for special in-game items in the Borderlands series. These codes are often shared during various promotions on social media and beyond, so keep an eye out for them.</p><h2>Does Borderlands 4 have cross-progression?</h2><p>As for cross-progression, nothing has been shared about Borderlands 4's cross-save features quite yet. The franchise's two most recent games, Borderlands 3 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, did not feature cross-save functionality. So, it would certainly be nice to finally be able to carry save data between different platforms--but we'll have to wait and see if Gearbox goes all-in on this feature. Even if they do, though, it's important to remember that you'd need to purchase the game on every platform you want to move saves between.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches September 12 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC, with a Nintendo Switch 2 version following a few weeks later on October 3.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">GOG launched a new website Friday where users can claim 13 games that have been delisted from other online sales portals for free. In a press release, GOG wrote that with the giveaway, it and the game publishers taking part are "taking a stand against the quiet erasure of creative works from digital shelves."</p><p dir="ltr">GOG's giveaway--found at the URL <a href="https://freedomtobuy.games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FreedomToBuy.games</a>, makes the games available for free to users for the next 48 hours. The titles are mostly sexually explicit and were recently delisted from other digital purchasing sites. GOG's site also includes an email link for developers or publishers interested in offering their games for free "as part of the protest."</p><p dir="ltr">"As an archival platform dedicated to protecting gaming history, we believe that if a game is legal and responsibly made, players should be able to enjoy it today--and decades from now," GOG wrote in a press release about the giveaway.</p><p dir="ltr">"We launched FreedomToBuy.games to make a statement: when games are delisted today because of discomfort, reviving them tomorrow becomes exponentially harder," it continued.</p><p dir="ltr">Sexually explicit games became the focus of controversy in July when thousands were abruptly removed from online game storefronts Steam and <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a>. Those removals were the result of pressure on the storefronts from payment processors like Mastercard and Visa to remove games featuring sexual content.</p><p dir="ltr">Payment processors were in turn pressured by a campaign by conservative anti-porn organization Collective Shout, which released an <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow ">open letter to payment processors on July 11</a>. The organization said it targeted the removal of games about "rape, incest, and child sexual abuse, and asked its members to <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/win-new-steam-policy-games-removed" rel="nofollow ">call and send emails to payment processors</a>. As <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamers-are-furious-about-the-censorship-of-nsfw-games-and-theyre-fighting-back/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired reported</a>, experts call this tactic "financial censorship," using financial institutions to sidestep platform rules by risking a seller's ability to do business at all. As a result of the campaign, hundreds of games were removed from Steam and, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/itchio-steam-collective-shout-sex-games-consume-me" rel="nofollow ">GameFile</a>, more than 20,000 games marked "not safe for work" were removed from Itch. (Itch released a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" rel="nofollow ">statement</a> regarding the situation and has begun <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">re-listing some NSFW games</a> if developers choose to make them available for free.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542253" data-ratio="0.43043295502312" data-width="2379" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542253"></a><figcaption>freedomtoplay.games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Backlash to the delisting began immediately, as many developers and players saw the situation as payment processors dictating to adults what content they were allowed to buy and play. Many developers also said that their games were caught up in the delisting sweep not because they contained pornographic content, but because they focused on LGBTQ elements and themes, or dealt with tough topics like sexual abuse.</p><p dir="ltr">Players and developers have taken to social media to put pressure of their own on payment processors to push against what they see as censorship. The International Game Developers Association released a <a href="https://igda.org/news-archive/press-release-statement-on-game-delistings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> where it called for "clear rules, fair warnings, and the right to appeal" in this and similar situations, and directed developers to contact Visa and Mastercard directly, and to petitions from the <a href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/mastercard-sex-work-work-end-your-unjust-policy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">American Civil Liberties Union</a> and <a href="https://www.change.org/p/tell-mastercard-visa-activist-groups-stop-controlling-what-we-can-watch-read-or-play" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Change.org</a> pushing back on censorship from payment processors.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mastercard-responds-to-censorship-allegations-after-forcing-storefronts-to-remove-adult-games/1100-6533641/">Both Mastercard and Visa have issued statements</a> saying the companies do not make moral judgments about merchandise sold by partners, and both suggested there was an issue of potential illegality at the heart of the situation.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations," <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" rel="nofollow ">the company said</a>. "Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."</p><p dir="ltr">Visa made a similar statement to Polygon, saying it requires "enhanced safeguards" for merchants facing "an elevated risk of illegal activity."</p><p dir="ltr">"We do not make moral judgments on legal purchases made by consumers," the statement said. "Visa does not moderate content sold by merchants, nor do we have visibility into the specific goods or services sold when we process a transaction. When a legally operating merchant faces an elevated risk of illegal activity, we require enhanced safeguards for the banks supporting those merchants."</p><p dir="ltr">No claims of potential illegality have been made about any games removed from platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">GOG's FreedomToBuy.games website leads with a statement that could be seen as addressing the legality argument.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some games vanish. Not because they broke the law but because someone decided they shouldn’t exist," the site reads. "For 48 hours, these games are free, because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/darksiders-4">Darksiders 4</a> has been announced, with Gunfire Games continuing the apocalyptic adventure in yet another new direction. In development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, your horseman won’t be going it alone this time…</p>
<p><iframe title="Darksiders 4 | Announcement Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As described on the Steam page entry, Darksiders 4 is a third person action adventure game with combat, traversal and puzzle solving. You’ll get to play as one of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, each with their own weapons and combat styles, but all equally capable of cleaving through enemies, traversing the environments and drawing upon supernatural abilities.</p>
<p>Oh, and the story is going to continue on from where the first game left off, pushing the world narrative forward in a major way.</p>
<p>While it’s not stated within the blurb, the Steam page does have the tag for online co-op on it, while the PlayStation Store page also notes 4 player multiplayer</p>

<p>Sadly there’s no mention of a release date or even year, and given how regularly games reappear in THQ Nordic’s summer showcases – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/darksiders-is-back-watch-the-teaser-now/">this was first teased last summer</a> – we’d guess that means that 2026 is out of the window. Pray for 2027?</p>
<p>What will be fascinating is to see how Gunfire blends that with different action adventure subgenres. We’ve seen a Zelda-like, more of a looter RPG, Soulslike, and even top-down isometric. While it’s the most different game, Darksiders Genesis was the most recent title in the franchise. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/03/darksiders-genesis-review/">our review</a>, all the way back in 2019, Dom said, “Despite the fundamental changes to the series’ viewpoint, Darksiders Genesis feels like a true Darksiders game, and banishes any memory of the lacklustre third entry.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Studio head Kelley Gilmore was recently replaced, per report.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">BioShock 4 is currently undergoing a bit of a development overhaul after it recently failed a review by 2K Games executives, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new report from Bloomberg</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per the report, the new BioShock game, which has been in development for the last decade, was criticized by executives especially for issues with its narrative. The studio will allegedly work to overhaul the story in the coming months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioShock 4's struggles have also apparently resulted in the removal of Cloud Chamber Games studio head Kelley Gilmore, and the shifting of creative director Hogarth de la Plante into a publishing role. Employees were told in a recent all-hands that the company needs to become, per Bloomberg, "more agile and efficient," which has some workers afraid layoffs may be on the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2K Games confirmed Gilmore and de la Plante's role changes to Bloomberg, and shared the following statement:</p><blockquote>We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloomberg's report also revealed that a BioShock 1 remake was in development at 2K, but was canceled earlier this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We first heard reports that BioShock 4 was in development <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/13/2k-studio-reportedly-developing-new-bioshock">way back in 2018</a>, when it was still apparently pretty early in the process. The following year it was officially <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/09/new-bioshock-game-confirmed-being-developed-by-new-developer-cloud-chamber">confirmed to be in development at new studio Cloud Chamber</a>, but IGN was told at the time that the team was at "the earlier end of our process." It was also confirmed that original BioShock creative director Ken Levine was not working on the game, but was instead focusing on his own project, Judas, at Ghost Story Games (it's due. However, a number of other BioShock veterans were said to be working on it, including de la Plante, art director Scott Sinclair, and design director Jonathan Pelling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the years since, we've gleaned very little in the way of details on BioShock 4. From job listings, we've put together that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-setting-rapture-columbia-job-listings">won't take place in any of the settings from previous games</a>, and that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-bioshock-game-hiring-writer-for-open-world-setting">may be open-world</a>. In 2022, it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-writer-joins-bioshock-4-as-narrative-lead">picked up former Ghost of Tsushima writer</a> Liz Albl as a narrative lead. And last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leaked-bioshock-4-image-tells-us-next-to-nothing-about-the-game">an image that may have come from the in-progress new BioShock leaked online</a>, though it was allegedly from an early 2021 demo of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that we have yet to see gameplay or hear even a whisper of a release window, it may still be a while yet before BioShock 4 fully emerges. In the meantime, while Levine's Judas was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-story-games-judas-is-currently-planned-for-release-by-march-2025">at one point expected to be out by March 2025</a>, that deadline has come and gone. But we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/judas-gameplay-overview-of-bioshock-creators-next-game">got a preview of the game last March</a>, so it may have to serve to tide over fans until BioShock 4 is ready to emerge once more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-have-to-hear-chris-plante%E2%80%99s-sandwich-story.1260312/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a> is primarily a show about the news – and there’s plenty of talk about The Issues on this week’s episode – but sometimes a moment stops you dead in your tracks, and you’ve got to share it with the world. That could aptly describe both Chris Plante’s sandwich story and my experience of hearing him tell it. Anyway, without further ado…</p><p>Well, with a bit more ado: This week Chris (Person) and I are joined by an additional <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris (Plante)</a> – and also, to complete the bit, I’ve legally changed my name to Chris. We begin by discussing Plante’s life following his tenure as editor-in-chief at Polygon, which came to <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-staff-goodbye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an abrupt halt earlier this year</a> for reasons with which Aftermath readers and listeners are depressingly familiar. On the upside, he’s launched a new show, <a href="https://shows.acast.com/post-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Post Games</a>, and it’s very good!&nbsp;</p><p>We discuss the whys and hows of his interview-focused podcast before delving into the big news of the week: Incensed by the removal of NSFW games on Itch and Steam following pressure from payment processors – which, in turn, were pressured by an activist group called Collective Shout – artists and fans have <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kicked off a mass call campaign</a> of their own, targeting Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and Stripe specifically. Will it work? And in what universe is it appropriate for bank companies and payment processors to even be making decisions about what we’re allowed to watch and play in the first place?&nbsp;</p><p>Then Chris (Person) enthuses about <em>Death Stranding 2</em> – which he recently finished – and Chris (Plante) tells the wildest story about a sandwich any of us have ever heard.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can afford a really long sandwich.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for clarity, but certainly not length (of sandwich)):</p><p><strong>Person: </strong>Battery Park is an unnatural place, physically. It shouldn’t exist. It has one of the best weird movie theaters: the Regal down there. Because nobody knows that it’s there.</p><p><strong>Plante: </strong>When we lived there, we went there all the time, and I… can I share a really quick Regal story? Because it’s one of the most bonkers things.&nbsp;</p><p>So my wife and I, we were dating at the time, and we both got off work. She was working in production; I was freelance. Anyway, we were like “Oh, we want to go see <em>Edge Of Tomorrow: Live, Die, Repeat</em>, and we can go do it in the middle of the day. It’s gonna be, like, Tuesday at 10:40 AM.” And we go down to this theater, and as you’re describing, nobody knows it exists despite it being humongous – built into a skyscraper on the southwest side of Manhattan. It just does not make sense.&nbsp;</p><p>So we go in, and we go up this giant cavern, and we go into the movie. It’s 10:40 on a Tuesday. Nobody’s there at 7 PM on a Friday, so it’s empty. We sit, and this one dude comes in right as the trailers are starting, and he’s wearing the biggest trench coat I’ve ever seen, and he’s holstering something in it that looks like it’s about, like, two or three feet tall and thin. And he really does not want us to see it. We are at this point like “Well, this isn’t great.”</p><p>The trailers start, and every time a sexy thing happens in a trailer, this dude just goes “Mmmm.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh no.</p><p><strong>Person:</strong> Don’t like that.</p><p><strong>Plante</strong>: The whole time! So we’re like “Oh noooooo.” And then we’re like “Do we move?” We were doing that thing where you look at each other but you don’t want to say anything, and you’re kinda mumbling. He was literally just a seat or two down.&nbsp;</p><p>And then as the movie starts, he reaches in, and we’re like “Well, here it is. This is the end for us.”</p><p>And he pulls out the biggest sub sandwich I have ever seen. HUUUUGE. And then he proceeds to, for the first half hour of this movie, duck-style eat this sandwich. It never leaves the front of his face. He never lowers it. It just begins outstretched and slowly disappears into his body. Tomato and lettuce and vinegar and olive oil are spilling everywhere. It’s somehow getting on us. But we’re so happy that we’re not gonna die.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s like being in the front row at Sea World.</p><p><strong>Plante:</strong> That scene in the movie where Emily Blunt – it’s in every trailer – where she bends down in a weird way, like yoga positions… the noise that came from this man. The mix of sexuality, joy, and hunger, I will never forget it.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-covid-lockdown-hideo-kojima"><h3>Death Stranding 2 Is A Joyful, Absurd Response To COVID</h3></a><p>Goofy, lighthearted, constantly mugging: Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an exercise in spectacle, a rumination on lockdown, and one of the most human games Kojima has made in years</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/harry-potter-jk-rowling-cge-codenames-board-game"><h3>Board Game Company Fucks Around (Announcing A New Harry Potter Game), Finds Out (When Fans Revolt And Media Announce Boycotts)</h3></a><p>'It’s a product to sell to people who prioritise their nostalgia for children’s fantasy over the culture their trans friends and family live in'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-user-experience-ux-research"><h3>‘Dopamine Simply Doesn’t Work Like That’: An Interview With A User Experience Researcher</h3></a><p>'Part of the reason I have worked in games UXR and not, say, microwave UX, is that games can be designed to be hard'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal"><h3>Inside The Mass Call Campaign To Stop Video Game Censorship [Update]</h3></a><p>"This is a marathon, not a race," say organizers who plan to keep calling payment processors for months, if need be</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clues-by-sam-wordle-daily-puzzle-game"><h3>Clues By Sam Is My Favorite Daily Puzzle Game</h3></a><p>It’s a nice little thing to do as my last thing before falling asleep.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next game in the BioShock series, which is currently referred to as BioShock 4, is reportedly having some major problems in development, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NDA3NDMxNCwiZXhwIjoxNzU0Njc5MTE0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMEJXRTJHUTFZV1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Zt4Beo52NA1y9AxmXB4Bd38T64ITJqEG1fTMqnDAfZU">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> reports that it recently failed a check-in review with Take-Two and 2K leadership, which resulted in major changes being ordered to the game's narrative, and two of developer Cloud Chamber's creative leadership being removed from their roles into other areas of the company.</p>



<p>The report also reveals that a remake of the first BioShock game was in the works before it was "<em>shelved</em>" earlier this year, according to Bloomberg's sources.</p>







<p>Kelley Gilmore, studio head at Cloud Chamber, was removed from her role as studio head and moved into a position on the publishing side of things, as a result of BioShock 4 failing its recent review, and Hogarth de la Plante, creative director at Cloud Chamber, suffered the same fate, and is now in a publishing role. </p>



<p>2K reportedly told Cloud Chamber's staff that they need to be "<em>more agile and efficient,"</em> which Schreier adds now has staff concerned that layoffs are around the corner.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to Bloomberg in response to questions sent in regarding this report, 2K Games said, "<em>We are working hard to set </em><em>BioShock</em> up for the best possible future. <em>Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path</em>." The same spokesperson also confirmed the role changes for Gilmore and de la Plante.</p>



<p>BioShock 4 has reportedly been in development <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-in-development-since-2015/">in some form or another since 2015</a>, or should we say at least since then, as Schreier adds that the game has been in development for "<em>more than a decade</em>," referring to his prior reporting that Certain Affinity had been working on the next BioShock game since at least 2015.</p>



<p>We only (<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-new-game-top-secret-2k-studio/">officially</a>) learned that BioShock 4 was coming in 2019, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/">Cloud Chamber announced as the studio helming the project</a>. In 2023, there were <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/">claims that the game had been internally rebooted for a second time</a>, after suffering a reboot in 2018. Last year, we saw Cloud Chamber looking to ramp up development with <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-team-ramps-up-recruitment-with-30-job-offers/">multiple job listings posted</a>, and that was essentially the most recent sign of life we've seen from the studio on BioShock 4.</p>



<p>The lack of any concrete information on the game for more than a decade is as good a sign as any that it's struggling in development, because surely if it were anywhere near release, 2K and Take-Two would have already been shouting about it from rooftops. But today's report shows that Take-Two aren't convinced that BioShock 4 is where it needs to be yet.</p>



<p>Of course, there's a stark difference between what a great game looks like for bean-counting executives versus the developers actually working on it. There's more than a slight chance that this failure could be the result of Take-Two just not believing that the current path for BioShock 4 won't be the one that sells the most copies. That doesn't mean it isn't a great game in its current state.</p>



<p>Regardless, it's clear we'll have to continue waiting to see what happens with the next BioShock game. Hopefully, it'll be worth the wait.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/meet-the-guy-keeping-x-men-vs-street-fighter-alive-at-evo-2025-2000614410</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meet-the-guy-keeping-x-men-vs-street-fighter-alive-at-evo-2025.1260300/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Danny Shnorhokian has been going to Evo since before it was called that. <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-best-moments-in-pro-gaming-history-5820907">The biggest fighting game event of the year</a> started as a small tournament back in the late ’90s called Battle by the Bay that focused solely on <em>Street Fighter</em>. Decades later, the annual event’s mainstage features everything from household names like <em>Mortal Kombat</em> to newer franchises like the anime fighter <em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em>. <em>Street Fighter</em> remains the top-billed event at every Evo though, and its legacy is inseparable from the passion and fandom that brings thousands of fighting game players to the Nevada desert each summer. That legacy includes the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> series, which is returning to the main event at Evo 2025 for the first time in 15 years, and which all began with the 1996 arcade classic <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter.</em></p> <p>Most people first came to the flashy pixel art superhero crossover through <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2.</em> That’s what Shnorhokian started out playing in Southern California in the early aughts (he placed in the top 8 at Evo 2008). But he later doubled back to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGWwgYSQUG0">equally gorgeous, even more broken original</a>, and was inspired to start holding annual side tournaments for it during Evo. “In 2005, EVO moved to Vegas, and allowed players (like myself) to run a side tournament if you had the resources,” he told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email. Back then it required having the original arcade cabinets on site, even as modern fighting games migrated primarily to console. “Me and a player named Dogface organized a tournament, which had about 30 entrants! Players from all over the country and even Japan participated. So from 2005 to 2010, I helped organize tournaments for the game.”</p> <p>Things petered out after that, even as Evo itself became larger than ever. Fans of smaller arcade fighting game classics like <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> relied on online matchmaking services like Fightcade to stay connected. Last year, however, Shnorhokian was able to bring the game back to Evo ahead of Capcom releasing it on modern platforms as part of <em>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classic</em>s. “This year, thankfully we can run it on Steam, and that makes it easier for everyone,” he said. “It has all three versions of <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em>, and people can use their own controller. Plus everyone can play this game at home and online to practice. A $50 game is a lot easier to get your hands on instead of a $300 arcade board.”</p> <p>Evo has changed a lot over the years, including being <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-buys-evo-1846507520">sold to Sony</a> during the pandemic and amid a <a href="https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-street-fighter-pulled-from-evo-online-by-1844253712">sexual misconduct scandal</a>. Fan favorites like <em>Smash Bros.</em> are no longer at the event, but a greater emphasis on retro games has brought back many of the games that first ignited players’ imaginations in arcades years ago. 2024 saw the return of <em>Street Fighter 3: Third Strike</em> and this year it’s <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> 2’s turn. But it’s the dozens of side tournaments and casual after-hours meetups where the old arcade culture lives on most.</p> <p>“Sponsored teams with players competing on national television for millions of dollars is something I would never have imagined,” Shnorhokian said. “When I got $50 for Top 8 at EVO, that felt HUGE. It’s a whole different world now. But even with the ups and downs, I do love Evo. It’s a great chance to see old friends, make new ones, meet players from around the world, and share the love of fighting games. Even if it was just 2 people, I’d want to organize an <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> tournament. I love the game, and whoever wins cans say they’re the ‘World Champion.'”</p>  <p>He hopes it’s him, but this year’s event has 20 people registered so far, including the Japanese Evo 2025 Champion Momoten, last year’s runner-up ken240sx, and fellow tournament organizer Majin Obama. “Infinite combos are definitely going to be done throughout the tournament,” Shnorhokian said. “It’s the person who has the patience to land the hit that’s going to make them the winner.”</p>  <p>The<em> X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> side tournament kicks off at 7:00 p.m. ET, but the rest of Evo will go throughout the weekend and late into Sunday night. Games begin each day around 1:00 p.m. ET across half a dozen livestreams culminating in the final top 8 for <em>Street Fighter 6</em> on August 3 around 11:00 p.m. ET. A full schedule of the event can found <a href="https://evo.gg/events/usa2025">here</a>.</p>

		<p>THQ Nordic and Paraglacial have announced Fatekeeper, a new first-person fantasy RPG that is set to head into PC Early Access this winter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fatekeeper | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x9xHZodgC2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fatekeeper promises reactive combat, rich progression and a handcrafted world, inviting players to visit ancient battleground, ruins and forests to uncover relics and lore to what occurred in each area, shaping your adventure and facing enemies as you go.</p>
<p>While it has a narrative path to follow, the intention is to make exploration feel rewarding. Of course, you’ll have your own character progression to shape, mastering weapons and armour, and with every encounter and choice feeding into the overarching tale.</p>
<p>Fatekeeper is in development at new studio Paraglacial, which is formed by former Grimlore Games developers who worked on SpellForce 3. Grimlore Games, of course, is currently working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titan-quest-2">Titan Quest 2</a>, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/01/titan-quest-2-early-access-release-date-is-today/">just went into Early Access today</a>!</p>

		<p>Who doesn’t like surprises? Having been teasing that a release date would be revealed during the THQ Nordic showcase, it was announced during the show that, actually, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titan-quest-2">Titan Quest 2</a> Early Access launch is today! The game is out right now!</p>
<p><iframe title="Titan Quest II | Early Access Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikmiyR8rutw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Grimlore are aiming to have the full launch of Titan Quest 2 in your hands by the end of 2026, and look to flesh the Early Access release out with a character creator, crafting and transmogrification, arcane abilities, new masteries and more. &nbsp;that let you wield your chosen armaments while appearing as heroic as a demigod. New masteries await, shrouded in mystery, offering paths of power not yet walked. Realms unseen and foes unknown gather beyond the mists, waiting for champions worthy of their wrath.</p>
<p>Those who are lured to the combat and action of ancient mythology will be greeted with a reduced price. The full 1.0 release will have a $49.99 / €49.99, but that is cut down to $29.99 / €29.99 during Early Access, and the first week comes with a 20% discount down to $23.99 / €23.99.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/titan-quest-2-announcement-tugs-on-the-threads-of-fate/">Announced during the 2023 showcase,</a> Titan Quest 2 will be a true action RPG in the same vein as the original Titan Quest and the genre’s dominant series, Diablo. Still set within ancient Greek mythology, the game will feature its adventuring within picturesque open world environments, while battling everything from the Stymphalian birds to giant crabs.</p>

<p>Grimlore Games has been crafting the game with hand-composed enemies encounters, designing enemy types to have complimentary attacks and abilities, and then placing them together in ways that they can use actual tactics to come and have a go at you. Boss fights will then be unique encounters that challenge you with individual abilities and tactics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The most influential Japanese TTRPG is getting an official English translation. Mugen Gaming has announced they will be localizing <em>Sword World RPG</em>, a TTRPG so popular that it culturally eclipses <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>



<p>According to a report <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/sword-world-rpg/crushed-dnd-english-translation" rel="nofollow">by Wargamer</a>, Mugen Gaming has announced a partnership with <em>Sword World RPG's</em> original publisher, Group SNE, to localize the TTRPG to English-speaking territories around the world.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sword-world-rpg-english-release-promo-banner.jpg?itok=6B2uGhBv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sword-world-rpg-english-release-promo-banner.jpg?itok=z3IYH5VO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To this end, Mugen Gaming will be launching a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter sometime in 2026. The campaign will be to localize the <em>Sword World 2.5 Core Rulebook</em>. In addition, Mugen plans to support the game long-term, providing localizations of expansions, supplements, and prewritten adventures.</p>

<p>The cultural space <em>Sword World RPG</em> has in Japan cannot be understated. It started when Ryo Mizuno and his friends played a translated version of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons red box. This resulted in the "replay" write-ups, essentially the earliest form of Actual Play, that would become the blockbuster fantasy novel and anime series, <em>Record of Lodoss War</em>.</p>

<p>With a passion for the hobby ignited, Mizuno and his friends founded Group SNE to pursue official TTRPG publishing projects. This led to <em>Sword World RPG</em>, an enduring franchise still going strong after 35 years and over 10 million in sales. It is notable for using a simplified 2d6 system, cinematic battles, an open multiclass system, and adventures designed to make each session feel like an episodic anime arc.</p>

<p>The English localization of <em>Sword World RPG</em> is a natural extension of the growing popularity of TTRPGs as a hobby. While we've seen more niche experiences arrive overseas like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/japanese-rpg-picaresque-roman-comes-to-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Picaresque Roman,</em></a><em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-games-announces-household-ttrpg-coming-to-west" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Household</a>,</em><em>&nbsp;</em>and select entries from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-partners-with-bouken-to-bring-japanese-ttrpgs-to-west" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bouken's catalog</a>, Sword World finding a new audience may handily coincide with rising competition for D&amp;D's market share such as Darrington Press' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-darrington-press-has-announced-for-daggerheart-at-gencon-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> and MCDM's <em>Draw Steel</em>.</p>

              <p><span>It’s been 12 years since the last </span><i><span>Bioshock </span></i><span>game and five years since 2K founded a brand new studio called Cloud Chamber to develop a new entry in the beloved shooter franchise. However, it sounds like we’re going to be waiting a bit longer for whatever the fourth </span><i><span>Bioshock </span></i><span>game ends up being, as a new report from </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil"><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i></a> <span>indicates that Cloud Chamber has hit a snag in development, resulting in a leadership shake-up.</span></p> <p><span>The story says that the next </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span> “failed a review by executives” at publisher 2K Games. According to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>‘s sources, the game’s narrative was a sore spot in the internal evaluation and is now being revamped. Cloud Chamber studio head Kelley Gilmore has reportedly been removed from her position, and </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span> creative director Hogarth de la Plante has been moved to a publishing role. Developers at the studio are worried that broader layoffs may follow after they were told in an all-hands meeting that Cloud Chamber needs to be “more agile and efficient.” A 2K representative told </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span> that the publisher believes the next </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span> is already “a good game” but it is “committed to delivering a great one.”</span></p> <p><span>Buried at the very end of the </span><i><span>Bloomberg </span></i><span>story is confirmation that 2K was also working on a </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span> remake, but that has since been shelved.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Bioshock </span></i><span>series has been MIA for over a decade, with the last game in the series being </span><i><span>Bioshock Infinite</span></i><span> in 2013. It was followed by a two-part DLC called </span><i><span>Burial at Sea</span></i><span>, which bridges the gap between </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>’s airborne world of Columbia and the underwater city of Rapture from the first two games. Ken Levine, the original game’s lead, went on to found Ghost Story Games and is working on </span><i><span>Judas</span></i><span>, which </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/judas-previews-bioshock-ken-levine-1851367642"><span>sure looks like a spiritual successor to </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i></a><span>.</span></p>

		<p>THQ Nordic has announced a Sacred 2 Remaster, a modernised version of the 2008 action RPG, coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sacred 2 Remaster | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YzPPceRfyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The remaster is in development by Jumpgate and SparklingBit, revitalising the game with high resolution textures and improved lighting effects, improved combat, a modernised UI, and bugfixes for the game. This will also include all of the expansions and updates previously released for the game, and I think you can see from the trailer that this will still look and feels like a game from 2008.</p>
<p>A prequel to the original Sacred, this game takes players to the world of Ancaria as it’s on the precipice of disaster. T-Energy, the power source that helped to bring prosperity to the world, has been twisted and corrupted to bring conflict and chaos. Six heroes step forward, each with their own path and story to explore in this world.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fatekeeper Is a New First-Person Action RPG Inspired by Dark Messiah of Might and Magic]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/fatekeeper-new-first-person-action-rpg-inspired-dark-messiah/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fatekeeper-is-a-new-first-person-action-rpg-inspired-by-dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic.1260213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2025, the publisher announced a new dark fantasy game called Fatekeeper. This project is in development at a small studio in the German Alps, which is home to around ten former Spellforce III developers from Grimlore Games.</p>



<p>The idea behind the project came from a discussion about Hellraid, Techland's game, which seemed like it would finally follow in the footsteps of Arkane's classic Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. The developers felt (rightfully so, I might add) that Dark Messiah of Might and Magic was the first game to make first-person melee action combat feel really cool.</p>



<p>They were also disheartened when Hellraid turned out into a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-hellraid-review-hellish-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small DLC pack for Dying Light</a> instead of the full-fledged standalone game that had originally been promised. Following that news, they decided to take matters into their own hands and create their own take on this oft-neglected genre. Thus, Fatekeeper was born, a title with modern graphics (it is powered by Unreal Engine 5), classic RPG elements, and first-person melee action combat.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fatekeeper Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbCAMqhNfzo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Every item in the game can be inspected in the menu, and a lot of the items have hidden mechanics that are unlocked only after inspecting them properly. Following the inspiration of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Fatekeeper also allows for deep interactions with the environment, especially when using telekinesis on various objects and characters.</p>



<p>The developers are still working on the progression systems, such as the skill trees, so they haven't been shown yet. However, they promised progression would have considerable depth, like any other system in the game.</p>



<p>Fatekeeeper will be semi-linear. It's not an open world title, but the maps have been designed so that players can devise a lot of paths. While not as hard as a Souls game, this title should also provide plenty of challenge to players who seek that in games.</p>



<p>Frankly, it's about time that someone had such an idea and implemented it. Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is long overdue for a spiritual successor, that's for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alkimia Interactive and THQ Nordic have confirmed a new release window for the Gothic 1 Remake, which was <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1297900/announcements/detail/519700531080333166">previously</a> set to arrive before the end of 2025, will now launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S in early 2026. The delay is confirmed alongside the debut of a new gameplay trailer, and the release of a demo for the game finally coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>



<p>There's been a demo available for PC players to try out for months now, while console players have been left out of the loop. Now, PS5 and Xbox Series owners can try out the remake for themselves, ahead of its launch sometime in early next year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gothic 1 Remake | Xardas Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TZ7Tk1XoAdQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Gothic 1 Remake was first announced all the way back in 2019, with a surprise teaser demo to gauge players' interest. However, it wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/">2020</a> that players knew the remake would be happening for sure. </p>



<p>By the time it arrives in early 2026, it'll be nearly seven years from its announcement to its release, and it'll be nearly 20 years since the last time a new Gothic game was released. There's no indication yet that Alkimia Interactive and THQ Nordic are looking to make a brand new Gothic adventure, but if the coming remake is wildly successful, the chances of a new game in the series would greatly increase. </p>



<p>We'll find out sometime early next year if this remake has been worth the wait, and if there's any chance at more Gothic games in the future.</p>



<p>Alongside the new gameplay shown in today's showcase and the news of the demo hitting consoles, THQ Nordic and Alkimia Interactive also announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-classic-1-3-are-coming-to-playstation-and-xbox-in-2026/">original three Gothic games will be making their console debuts</a>, arriving on PlayStation and Xbox sometime in 2026.</p>
