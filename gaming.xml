            <p>Since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> rolled onto the, er, battlefield late last week, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-launch-day-patch-notes-are-here-and-nearly-2800-words-so-whip-out-your-reading-specs-private">huge patch having been smashed against its hull</a> to see it off, EA and their Battlefield Studios have understandably only put out a few more tweaks. Their latest little round of changes are server-side rather than being a proper patch, and enact a bit of balancing clearly deemed too important to wait for the next big patch's deployment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is the point at which I'm going to ask you to hold the hands of any mates of yours who use sniper rifles, specifically the M2010 ESR and PSR. The muzzle velocity of both long-range skull-deleters has been toned down. For the ESSER, it's gone from 900 to 800 meters a second. For the PISSR, a smaller tweak from 750 to 720 meters a second has been made.</p>
<p>Thus, esserers and pisserers will have to compensate for the slower speed of bullets leaving their barrels by leading shots on moving targets a bit more. If it's any solace, they've opted to use some of the longest guns out there, so odds are they're used to compensating for things.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Today we've rolled out a few backend changes across our servers, which should now be live across all platforms. The changes are as follows:</p><p>◼️Increased ticket count for some maps on the Rush game mode to the intended amount of 100 (up from 75).<br>◼️Reduced the muzzle velocity of…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977809244906037359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Also among the tweaks is one which'll force <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-m87a1-loadout-guide">shotgun</a> projectiles to take drag into account. Odds are that abiding by the laws of physics will amount to a nerf of some level. Maybe a support group which excludes the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-m433-loadout-guide">assault rifle</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-l110-loadout-guide">machine gun</a> lot should be formed.</p><p>Finally, in non-weapon tweak news, Battlefield Studios have increased the ticket count for some rush maps from 75 to 100. So, there'll be more reinforcements on offer if you suddenly find your gun of choice isn't packing enough oomph to save you from regular murder at the hands of faceless strangers who may or may not tastelessly pause to crouch atop your corpse.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, another post-release tweak Battlefield Studios made over the weekend was a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977388909471338958">fix for jumping momentum being mucked up</a> when certain weapons were equipped. I assume that being rectified elicited an uninterrupted bounce of joy.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series of action games are notoriously challenging, but ahead of the release of Ninja Gaiden 4 its directors have emphasised the importance of fairness.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/ninja-gaiden-4-creators-say-fairness-in-dying-is-what-sets-apart-a-challenging-action-game-from-an-unreasonable-one/">Automaton</a>, directors Yuji Nakao (PlatinumGames) and Masakazu Hirayama (Team Ninja) discussed their approach to balancing the game's difficulty.</p>
<p>"What really stands out throughout the Ninja Gaiden series," said Nakao, "is how enemies are on equal footing with the player. They guard, and they even use throws."</p>

<p>Hirayama added that fairness between the player and enemies is "crucial", maintained by whether death feels like the player's fault.</p>
<p>"If the player gets killed unreasonably," he said, "it's hard for them to reflect and think about what they could’ve done differently. But if they die because they made the wrong choice among several options, they'll think, 'Okay, let's try this instead'. That kind of trial-and-error cycle requires a fair dynamic between offense and defense to work. That's something we talk about a lot at Team Ninja, and it's something we've always valued throughout the series."</p>
<p>Ultimately, said Nakao, Ninja Gaiden 4 is "not a game you'll be able to breeze through" and has "hardship…scattered throughout". "That sense of catharsis you feel when you overcome those challenges is something I truly value," he said.</p>
<p>Debate around difficulty in games has raged for years, particularly with regards to Soulslike action-RPGs. While action games like the Ninja Gaiden series are known for their difficulty, the Dark Souls games certainly popularised high levels of challenge, especially after the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.</p><p>Most recently, the debate has resurfaced in the wake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel. For many players, it's proven an incredibly steep challenge, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-admit-it-has-moments-of-steep-difficulty-but-also-a-higher-level-of-freedom-to-avoid-getting-stonewalled">the studio's Ari Gibson noted</a> players "have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled."</p>
<p>After Ninja Gaiden 4's initial reveal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">Nakao spoke to Eurogamer about honouring the series' legacy</a> with its dual protagonists, as well as its difficulty.</p>
<p>"Ninja Gaiden is known for its intensity, especially that back and forth between offence and defence, and that dynamic ebb and flow of the combat," said Nakao. "With Ninja Gaiden 4, we are making sure it inherits those qualities and that the high speed action and the gameplay feel that longtime players have come to expect from Ninja Gaiden games - including the challenge and the difficulty - are present in this new entry."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the Tokyo Games Show last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-xbox-tokyo-game-show-broadcast">Xbox detailed the difficulty options in Ninja Gaiden 4</a> for newcomers and experts alike ahead of its release later this month across Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sucker-punch-suggests-it-will-stick-with-making-one-game-at-a-time-after-ghost-of-yotei.1324225/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a post-mortem Ghost of Yotei interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, Sucker Punch Studio Head and Co-Founder Brian Fleming suggested that the Bellevue-based developer will keep focusing on one game project at a time instead of attempting to juggle more than one.</p>



<p><em>The truth is that whatever we do next, whether it’s continuing Ghost or going back to Sly, the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time. If we were good at juggling four projects, yeah, we’d have a remaster, and let’s go do one of those, and one of those, and do some fan request, that would be really popular… But we only get to do one thing.</em></p>



<p><em>So it kind of has to be your best idea, right? And that’s really clarifying. It’s not like there aren’t 15 good ideas. But you only get to do one. And by the way, you only get to do one about every five years. So that choice is really important. </em></p>



<p>Interestingly, Fleming also hinted that Sucker Punch has to deal with internal pressures from employees as well as external pressure from fans when it comes to potentially diversifying its output.</p>



<p><em>At 30 years, we now have employees who are kids of former employees. We have employees who weren’t born when the studio was founded. And you also have had enough changes from Sly, to InFamous, to Ghost that part of those changes, when they happen, is that it means not just you’re walking away from Tsushima, and not just that you’re walking away from the actors in Tsushima, but you’re walking away from employees who’ve been a part of the studio for the last decade, because they don’t want to do a game set in a historical setting.</em></p>



<p>As much as I'd love a new Infamous game, though, the Ghost of franchise has simply gotten too big. Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the excellent Ghost of Yotei</a>, which seems to be selling almost as quickly as its predecessor <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-sold-over-1-6-million-units-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on initial estimates</a>, Sucker Punch owner Sony has also invested on a live action film that is being directed by Chad Stahelski and an anime based on the multiplayer mode, Legends. Chances are the developers will be put on Ghost-making duty for at least one more installment.</p>



<p>In related news, we've <a href="https://wccftech.com/discussing-ghost-of-yoteis-lord-saito-with-actor-feodor-chin-he-and-atsu-are-really-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently published an interview with actor Feodor Chin</a> about his role as the main villain of Ghost of Yotei, Lord Saito.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Go's new level cap requirements have leaked, and some fans say the fresh XP total required, as well as the some of the extra tasks involved, are too easy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> will raise its current level 50 cap for the first time in five years, and allow players to reach level 80 for the first time. But this change will come alongside an overall rebalancing of XP — meaning many players will find themselves transported to a much higher level, and potentially far beyond the XP needed to instantly hit level 80.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, players won't simply log on and find themselves at the finish line. As is the case currently, a fresh set of additional tasks will need to be completed to progress through the game's final tier of levels (from 70 to 80, replacing similar tasks required to move from 40 to 50). But even these — which have been datamined by fans — have been dubbed as rather straightforward.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night, a <a href="https://pokemongo.com/post/pgo-leveling-update-details-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on the official Pokémon Go blog listed out the new XP requirements needed after the game's level cap increases tomorrow, October 15.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Go rebalanced XP requirements:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Level 10: 48,000 total XP</li><li>Level 20: 258,000 total XP</li><li>Level 30: 1,083,000 total XP</li><li>Level 40: 3,953,000 total XP</li><li>Level 50: 12,753,000 total XP</li><li>Level 60: 34,353,000 total XP</li><li>Level 70: 85,853,000 total XP</li><li>Level 80: 203,353,000 total XP</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It's interesting to compare these fresh totals with the amounts of XP needed to hit the game's level 50 cap now. Currently, hitting level 50 requires a lifetime total of 176 million XP. (This week, following the game's rebalance, level 50 will require just 12.75 million XP.) This means the new level 80 cap requires just 27 million more XP than the current level 50. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's been clear for a while that Pokémon Go's new level cap will come alongside an overall smoothing of the game's overall XP requirements, hardcore fans have still been surprised to discover that many of them will once again be in Pokémon Go's new endgame, with little to no actual XP grinding required.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to those level up tasks, fans examining a <a href="https://x.com/thepokemodgroup/status/1977819506060759314" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">datamined list</a> of what will be needed have judged the requirements as rather straightforward. Each level requires players hold an increasing number of platinum in-game medals, though these can be earned in a way that reflects your playstyle. Some will take time — Purifying 100 Shadow Pokémon — but with planning there's nothing here which should hold up hardcore players for too long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, there is also palpable relief among fans at the lack of any artificial timegating here — such as requiring a Pokémon be caught on 30 days, holding progress back a month — something which has been found in other challenges previously. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Go Level 71-80 level up tasks</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Level 71</strong><br>Earn 15 platinum medals<br>Power up Legendary or Mythical Pokémon 20 times<br>Make 999 Nice Throws<br>Catch 100 Pokémon in a single day

As the game approaches its 10-year anniversary next year, its developers will likely want to ensure Pokémon Go continues to welcome fresh blood to its userbase, without giving them too steep an XP mountain to climb.

                <p>It's understandable if Xbox users feel a little skittish about the future of the console, given the recent price increases for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">Xbox consoles in the US</a>, as well as formerly exclusive titles heading to PlayStation 5. Over the holiday weekend, there were so many anecdotal rumors about Target, Walmart, and other US retailers pulling Xbox consoles and games that Microsoft decided it was necessary to debunk these reports.</p><p>"Target and Walmart, among other retailers, remain committed partners for Xbox consoles, accessories, and games," a Microsoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-target-and-walmart-are-not-removing-xbox-products-from-their-stores-as-xbox-misinformation-reaches-new-levels" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>. The outlet went on to suggest that the rumors may have been born out of Costco's apparent decision to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/costco-drops-xbox-us-and-uk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remove everything Xbox-related</a> from its digital storefront ahead of the price hikes.</p><p>Microsoft has previously fielded rumors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-has-no-desire-to-make-hardware-anymore-founding-team-member-says/1100-6532825/" data-ref-id="1100-6532825">Xbox is abandoning hardware</a>, as exemplified by Asus handling the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices</a>. However, Xbox VP Jason Ronald told the press that the company remains committed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">to its next generation hardware</a>.</p><p>The increasing cost of the Xbox consoles comes just as Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raised prices on Game Pass</a>. Former Microsoft employee and a founding member of the original Xbox team, Laura Fryer, went on to call those increases <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-co-founder-calls-game-pass-price-hike-a-betrayal/1100-6535337/" data-ref-id="1100-6535337">a "betrayal" of the trust</a> that gamers placed in the company. Microsoft subsequently announced that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-prices-not-going-up-for-everyone-just-yet/1100-6535288/" data-ref-id="1100-6535288">price hikes won't immediately go into effect</a> for all players. But the more expensive version of Game Pass is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimates-price-hike-was-quietly-paired-with-another-downside/1100-6535197/" data-ref-id="1100-6535197">losing a fan-favorite Call of Duty perk</a>.</p><p>Some analysts also believe that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ad-tier-could-come-next-expert-says/1100-6535154/" data-ref-id="1100-6535154">an ad-supported Game Pass service</a> will be added in the future.

            <p>New content updates for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> have been pushed back so developer Arrowhead can prioritise improving performance first.</p>
<p>In a new video, game director Mikael Eriksson acknowledged the current state of the game and the "many things" not working at the moment, which the studio's "top brains" are working to fix.</p>
<p>Issues include the need for smoother framerates across each platform, as well as crash rates and bugs leading to overall jankiness, and balance problems.</p>

<p>"After the last big update, Into the Unjust, we experienced more issues than what we were comfortable with," said Eriksson. "Players felt it, we felt it, and I would say the feedback that we've got has been very justified.</p>
<p>"We're taking this very seriously and we are focusing way more now on addressing these issues to make sure this sort of thing doesn't happen again. We have made the decision to push some of our content and feature updates a little bit into the future while we're addressing these things to make sure that we can get to a much more stable state that we can believe in."</p>
<p>Further, those future updates will be implemented in such a way to make the game more stable.</p>
<p>Some issues are quick to address, such as bug fixes, while others can be "tricky", such as fixing framerates.</p>
<p>"We are already making really big improvements and I'm confident that we will get there and we will be able to talk in more detail about this hopefully quite soon," Eriksson added.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 has been a phenomenal success that recently made its way to Xbox Series X/S, in addition to PS5 and PC. But as the game has ballooned in size and scope, performance issues have reared their head.</p>
<p>At the least, it's great to see Arrowhead acknowledge these flaws and commit to rectifying them, even if that means delaying future content.</p>
<p>Indeed, it seems to be part of a strategy for improved communication from Arrowhead, following a blog post earlier this month explaining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-explains-why-its-so-big-to-install-on-pc-and-why-that-wont-be-changing-anytime-soon">why the install size for Helldivers 2 is so big on PC</a>.</p>
<p>In short, it's due to some players using older storage devices instead of SSDs, as the studio aims to accommodate a wide range of setups.</p>

		<p>With nDreams looking to revolutionise VR action games once more with the release of Reach on Thursday this week, and following <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/hands-on-reach/">my hands on session with the game</a>, I had a chance to sit down with Glenn Brace, Head of the studio to chat about Reach and find out exactly why those death defying leaps don’t make you want to reach – aha! – for the sick bag.</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Please introduce yourself and explain how you came to be working on Reach.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> My name’s Glenn Brace, and I’m the head of studio for Elevation, and a living, breathing VR evangelist. Long story short, I’ve been in games devs for like 20 years but there’s only so many generations of platforms you can go through with the same IPs, so when VR arrived, that was for me the true next-gen. This is a new frontier, there’s new things. It doesn’t matter if you’re a mega studio or a little studio. The innovation is just there for the sake of it.</p>


<p>More recently, I wanted to get back closer to development, back to what is the best for VR. So nDream Elevation was born. The studio was created to look at the future, work on the sort of tech leading to VR innovation and where VR is going. We are the driving core tech, leading that core tech in the rest of the business. The rest of the business can use that and elevate themselves from that, but we are pushing that. We’re making the new stuff.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reach - Gameplay Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOuzzp4V9HQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When we started the studio for this game, we started with the goal of reinterpreting action adventure for VR. That was the goal. We had a hypothesis, which was that we believe through one-to-one physical action simulation, you will have more immersion and therefore more presence. And more immersion presence means it’s more emotional. The more emotional games, the more memorable, the more fun. So, that was the hypothesis.</p>

<p>We set off and set ourselves a task, “Right, let’s discover one-to-one control and prove to ourselves if it truly is agency granting”. So, we tried different jumps, we tried running, how you fail and fall, what is the believability of you as a character. There’s so many metrics to discover.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Give me the Elevator pitch for Reach.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Essentially, it’s action-adventure reimagined for VR. And the root of that is absolute agency-granting, second-to-second role play. What does that mean? That is a translation from the famous genres that we love, such as Tomb Raider. All those games out there that we’ve loved before in the past, but brought into VR, how does that work? We know there will be challenges doing it, but we’re going to fix those challenges and bring the essence of role play to that genre for VR. It’s run, jump, swing, fling. It’s action adventure in the true sense and giving that power to the player.</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Where did the original idea come from? You mentioned Tomb Raider.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> So it’s definitely an influence of what we’re trying to capture, but I think what’s really important about our game is aas a translation of the action adventure genre. So I wouldn’t go into it thinking we’ve made a Tomb Raider – we haven’t – it’s very much what needs to be, different. For starters going first person is in itself a big change. Historically, cinematics have played a large part in that genre, but we don’t want to break the immersion, so even the nature of that format needs to change.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> I played a good hour and a half and it felt like half the time, and not once did I feel any sort of motion sickness or dizziness despite all the running and jumping, how on earth have you managed that?</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> So, comfort was a big thing, and we set out to tackle that. One of the key factors of that was ‘FBA’, full body awareness, one of the key components. It’s not just to render the body and see it in game, although that’s cool, it’s that we have more than the tracking points. We simulate the wrist, the arm angle, we simulate the elbows, we simulate the body, the hips, the shoulders, the neck. When we have all that information, it makes things like mantling so much smoother and more reliable. That allows flow, it allows proper parkour, player-driven you’re-in-control flow.</p>
<p>That extends into jumping as well. If you get a motion that you’re not in control of it can send you over the edge. So for jumping, you actually move your arms as if you are about to take leap in real life to start the jump in-game, and this fools your body in to thinking your are actually doing it.</p>
<p>Another natural thing is when you jump over an edge, you look where you land, you look down, and you can tune the arc of the land specifically on that tight pillar. It feels natural; you do it in a very natural way. So, again, it’s more comfortable. Suddenly, we’ve got a level of parkour and jumping platforming that is super cool.</p>
<p>We also simulate body mass and weight, and that comes back to how you play traditional platforming. Once you familiarize yourself with your body mass and weight, how you use it, you can become skilful in platforming, and therefore in control. When you put those things together, the realization of it, the sense of weight, the sense of mass, the physics of it, the aftertouch, you’ve got a new experience in VR.</p>
<p>One of the goals I always wanted, and I always say this, was to make someone role-playing act in the interest of self-preservation. Faced with a giant leap, will you stop and think, “I’m not going to jump on that. No way. I’m going to do this”? In a standard game you’d do it anyway, you will die, start again, do it, die, start again. We wanted the players to be in the moment and think, making them prioritise their sense of survival in that world.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> So, given that every action adventure game these days gets a TV show or film, who would direct the Reach movie?</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Well, I can tell you, not Michael Bay! We started Reach with the idea that it’s going to be action-packed, but the reality is the emotions and the moments, they’re a lot smaller, a lot more contained. So, I think it’s a more intimate experience now than when we first set out. So, I need to find a director that’s kind of in touch with the emotional side. Who did the Star Wars film everyone really liked?</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Rogue One? Gareth Edwards.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Yeah, I’ll go with Gareth Edwards. He did also Monsters which could have been a big loud film but it was actually quiet and poignant. So, yeah, I would go with Gareth Edwards.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Glenn for speaking to us about this fascinating project.

<p>There's even a new ? silicone case</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Remember Nintendo's collaboration with Fujifilm? The one that let you add all kinds of Switch-relevant frames and stickers to your screenshotted polaroids* via the instax mini Link 3? Don't worry, we had forgotten about it too, but the company has just released a new update to help add an extra bit of Mushroom Kingdom flare to your physical snaps.</p>
<p>The main addition in this update is the instax AiR Studio. As the capitalisation on the former suggests, this new 'studio' lets you take photos with some Mario AR effects to boot — so, if you need a pic of your friend hitting a ? Block, holding a Red Shell, or popping out of a Warp Pipe, you're in luck!</p>
<p>Similarly self-explanatory is the new Click to Collage feature, which takes snaps at three-second intervals and lets you throw in some familiar Mario faces for good measure. With the collection snapped up, you can then print out the full series, photobooth style.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a Mario update without some fresh merch to boot, and Fujifilm revealed that a new limited edition instax mini Link 3 bundle featuring a sweet ? Block silicone case will be launching later this month for <strong>$149.95</strong>.</p>

<p>Fujifilm launched a similar bundle for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> update back in 2023, where the arrival of new in-app stickers and frames was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/01/ink-your-polaroids-with-splatoon-3-frames-and-stickers-in-new-instax-mini-link-app-update">accompanied by a squid-shaped case</a>.</p>
<p>The advantage this time around is that we have the Switch 2 to make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-how-to-transfer-screenshots-from-switch-2-to-smartphone-pc-or-mac">transferring images from your console to mobile</a> <em>much</em> easier. The instax mini Link 3 works with both Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2, we should add, but if you want to get snaps of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> like the cool kids in the above trailer, you'll obviously need the latest hardware.</p>
<p>*Okay yes, they're <em>technically</em> 'mini prints' since Polaroid isn't directly involved here. Sorry, everyone!</p>

			<p>The additional content of the War of the Lions release may at very least have been considered for Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles at some point, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>Using a Cheat Engine table to alter in-game values, YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GusPagan">Gus Pagan</a> discovered that the remaster of the classic tactical role-playing game released last month on PC and consoles features hidden in its files evidence that the War of the Lions content, or at least part of it, may have been considered. This includes the Dark Knight and Onion Knight Jobs and the extra characters Balthier and Luso.</p>



<p>As the implementation of these extra Jobs and characters is clearly incomplete, however, they could simply be leftover data that was carried over from the War of the Lions version code. Still, this could definitely bode well even if the extra content isn't officially released for the remaster, as modders could use this data to port the content themselves, <a href="https://ffhacktics.com/smf/index.php?topic=12951.0">something that has already happened for the original PSX version of the game.</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>While having the exclusive War of the Lions content would make Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles the true definitive edition of the tactical role-playing game, in no way does the remaster need it to be an excellent game. Check out my review to learn <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">how choice improvements like voice acting and a tweaked user interface enhance an already excellent game.</a> </p>

            <p>Sometimes the simple life is the one I crave when I fire up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>. Go away, warring rulers, meddling mages, and otherworldly elven harbingers of the apocalypse, let me concentrate on being medieval pest control. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-mods-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">modder</a>'s seemingly heard my protestations, having just released a standalone monster hunting mode for the game, which comes with an optional extraction shootery twist if you fancy an extra challenge.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This modded mode's dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9426?tab=description">Wild Monster Hunt</a>, and is the work of REDkit-armed developer Aeltoth. Drawing inspiration from the hunting grounds of Capcom's monster hunting series, the mode whisks you off to a new region that's "roughly the size" of Toussaint from the base game's Blood and Wine DLC. Here, you find a witcher camp that'll serve as an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkMG_igY3QY">upgradeable base</a> to rest at between the procedurally-generated monster hunts which populate the area.</p>
<p>As Aeltoth outlines in this <a href="https://modspot.dev/library/8qreyt51iq5d3hnubq5s/u8dtqlnmizrkg2suldq6">intro doc</a>, starting from the camp, you can take on up to five regular contracts on monsters ranging from Wraiths to Wights at once. After gearing up and exiting the camp, you're off into the hostile wilds, with the goal of taking down as many beasts as you can or fancy via sword or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0oPCJ1BL2c">trap</a> before returning home to collect rewards and prepare to head out again. Every departure sees the landscape refreshed, down to any loot or herbs you've picked up.</p>

<p>Finding your targets won't always be a walk in the park, with factors like the time, weather, and different biome requirements for monsters influencing when and how you can encounter them. Aeltoth's worked in a levelling system for the hunts dubbed reputatation, which'll see you dished out more important milestone contracts every so often. These are tougher, but are the only way of progressing up the mod's totem pole and earning gear diagrams.</p><p>If that's not enough challenge for you, the modder's created a "Merciless Path" option, which "turns the mod into a sort of extraction game where gear is lost upon dying. The mod adjusts the rewards when this mod is enabled for somewhat faster progression."</p>
<p>Regardless of which you pick, these monster hunts are an alternative way of earning crowns and experience you'll then be able to take back into the base game, though it does look like some of the witcher camp's various vendors and special forge are designed to act as a semi-closed economy. I assume this is to ensure you do earn the mod's bounties by taking on its hunts. It might get old fast if the story-free hunts aren't varied enough, but as a pocket dimension for those who just want to test their fighting skills, it sounds ideal. The modder also has plans to expand it with the likes of new dungeons, regions, and mechanics like a spot of on-the-go distilling in the future.</p>
<p>Wild Monster Hunt requires you to start a new playthrough upon installing, and you can either hop directly into it from the main menu or warp into the region anytime via a signpost in White Orchard. That said, the former option does look to be causing crashes early doors, so the sign might be the better option. Installing looks as simple as dropping the files into your game directory.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bid-storage-problems-goodbye-with-this-massive-seagate-expansion-14tb-hard-drive-now-going-for-230-2000634647</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate%E2%80%99s-14tb-external-hard-drive-drops-below-0-02-per-gb-storage-at-penny-level-pricing.1324198/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>No one likes to deal with low storage, and sometimes even a terabyte or two just isn’t enough to keep up with everything you need to save. If you’re after a long-term fix and your storage needs have outgrown the usual upgrade options, the Seagate Expansion 14TB external hard drive might be just what you need.</p>
<p>It usually runs you around $300, but right now, you can grab it for $230 on Amazon, after a 16% discount from its regular price. This is the lowest price we have seen it go for in a while, but the offer is going to end soon. Get your orders in before the price shoots back up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4757/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Storage for All Your Old and New Files</h2>
<p>14 terabytes is no joke. That’s enough capacity to house hundreds of movies, a million photos, and numerous work documents for years to come. If your storage needs are consistently growing (as everyone else’s) and you don’t want to find yourself in the same situation every few months, this is a nice long-term solution. Think having your entire digital library – both old and new stuff – in one portable build that goes wherever you do.</p>
<p>Getting started is simple. Plug in the adapter it comes with, connect the USB 3.0 cable, and it’s ready to go. File transfers are quick as well. Grab all that you need to transfer, drag it over it, and drop. It works well with both Windows and Mac, but Mac users will need to reformat it for use with Time Machine. There are no complicated drivers or setup procedures to worry about. It literally takes a few minutes to get everything going, even if it’s your first time with an external drive.</p>



<p>You’re also getting Rescue Data Recovery Services with the purchase. In case of water damage or a natural disaster, Seagate’s team can help recover your important files in no time. Included in the box are a Seagate Expansion desktop drive, an 18-inch USB 3.0 cable, an 18W power adapter, and a quick start guide.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’re looking for a storage solution that can take care of all your old and new data, this 14TB SSD will be a great addition to your work setup. The storage capacity is massive, so you won’t have to worry about running out of space again for years to come. The offer ends soon, so be sure to act fast to grab it for less.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A popular way to get better items and abilities in Demonfall quickly is to make use of the many October 2025 Demonfall codes. This makes Demonfall codes extremely popular among newer players of the game, as it allows them to bridge the gap between themselves and the competition fairly fast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the popular anime series Demon Slayer? If yes, we suggest that you take a couple of minutes to check out this riveting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-type-soul-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game—Demonfall. Inspired almost entirely by Demon Slayer, Demonfall drops players into the role of a demon hunter, responsible for fighting against various characters in the game. This then helps players progress through the game’s story, while also helping improve their own abilities—and you can progress faster with Demonfall monthly codes and rewards.</p>

<p>Redeeming Demonfall codes is a straightforward process and doesn’t require any specific criteria to be met before the code redemption feature gets unlocked. It’s as simple as navigating through the menus and finding the codes section. For players who may be unfamiliar with the Roblox ecosystem, here’s a simple step-by-step guide to redeeming Demonfall codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Demonfall</li>



<li>Click on the Tab button to open up the menu</li>



<li>Click on the Cog (Settings) button</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box</li>



<li>Hit the ‘Enter’ key to receive your rewards</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-demonfall-codes">How To Get More Demonfall Codes</h2>



<p>Although there is currently only one working code in the game, players are urged to wait patiently, as new Demonfall codes are surely on the horizon. Considering the popularity that Demonfall has gained since its release, the developers are almost certainly working on new content for the game, and new content updates usually mean new codes.</p>



<p>Although there’s no set timeline for code drops, they usually come out along with updates, so players would be smart to keep their eyes peeled. While tracking the game’s socials and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/eAUgs3PvD9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a> for new codes is an option, a simpler and more hassle-free way to stay ahead of the curve would be to simply bookmark this page. We update this article as soon as any new codes drop, so checking in every now and then would be the best course of action.</p>

            <p><a href="https://x.com/subonekd/status/1977237126850003005">As spotted by members of the Battlefield 6 community online</a>, reports from users of the Cronus Zen getting temporary bans for using the cheating hardware are circulating online, but the full scope of how effective the game is at banning users of this hardware remains unclear.</p>
<p>For those unaware, the Cronus Zen (and prior Cronus products) allow for the use of scripts and macros in games it's used with, and is usable on consoles including the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. These macros can be harmless in single player games, sure (back when I was younger people used it as an arcade stick adapter for the Xbox 360, which was cool). However, in multiplayer games the device has become infamous due to the ability to enable additional aim assist, recoil reduction, automatic drop-shotting, and more. <a href="https://www.cronusmax.com/">All of these specific macros and more are listed outright on the Cronus Zen website</a>.</p>

<p>However, players are questioning the validity of these temporary bans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o64hvu/cronus_zen_users_on_ps5_are_now_receiving/">due to an odd screenshot circulating online</a>. Initially, the screenshot seems real enough, but closer inspection reveals suspect details. For example, in the bottom right corner of the screenshot, the A and B buttons (which you'd expect from a console ban page) look incorrect, with the A looking more like an H. Very odd.</p><p>Heading to the Cronus Zen Discord, discussions are kept largely from public channels and hidden inside those only registered Cronus Zen users can access, but even there brief discussions about bans can be found. It looks as though the impact of these bans are in doubt, with Cronus users stating as long as you don't overuse these macros so as to be easily spotted by other players and cheat detection software, users won't be banned.</p>
<p>The flip side of the coin is prior statements made by EA, which mention Cronus specifically. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/interview-we-dont-consider-this-a-port-battlefield-6-dev-on-why-it-built-the-ps5-version-concurrently-with-pc">In an interview with Push Square</a>, technical director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> Christian Buhl stated: "Yeah, it's unfortunate that cheating has become a problem within the console space, especially with Cronus Zen machines and everything. So we've partnered with PlayStation and both Microsoft in this regard to kind of do detection. We actually have our own level of macro detection and everything.</p>
<p>"So if players are doing rapid with Javelin on the PC side. That's why we've enabled Secure Boot to help us combat the never-ending cheater problem. And we are aware of the console cheater issue, and we're going to be taking cheating very, very seriously here."</p>
<p>We know that EA intends to strike at Cronus users in Battlefield 6, but without a public statement from either EA / Battlefield Studios or Cronus itself, it's hard to  ascertain the scale of the impact on Cronus users. Cronus users have likely been put on notice though,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-players-on-ps5-and-xbox-can-block-pc-users-from-crossplay-as-studio-takes-cheating-extremely-seriously"> as the war on cheaters rages on</a>.</p>

In this instance, however, the song in question is already a mega hit that has inspired a global meme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skrilla's 6 7 blew up earlier this year on TikTok and Instagram. It's a slang term referring to gun violence but became popular when it began appearing in clips about basketball players like LaMelo Ball, who is 6ft 7 inches tall. It then went viral when a boy known as the 67 Kid used it in a meme, and now kids the world over are saying it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/gettyimages-2240370184-1760434164118.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Skrilla spilled the beans on 6 7 appearing in GTA 6.

But Skrilla, at least, sounds convinced 6 7 is in there, and you'd like to think he'd know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time GTA 6 song talk has hit the internet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A swathe of upcoming Pokémon game projects have seemingly been detailed online, via the latest release of material originating from the so-called "Teraleak" of data hacked from the servers of series developer Game Freak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cache of information, which includes development plans, concept art and early screenshots, was revealed overnight following the disclosure yesterday of data obtained in the hack that pertained to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, which launches this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-year-on-from-the-teraleak-hackers-release-pokmon-legends-z-a-files-including-gameplay-videos-showing-cut-content-and-early-builds">IGN reported yesterday</a>, the suggestion is that the hacker behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-stolen-data-on-unannounced-games-as-well-as-nintendo-switch-2-codename-leaked-online">last year's Game Freak breach</a> has sat on this latest cache of data for almost a year, until Pokémon Legends: Z-A's launch. But now, it seems, the floodgates are open for everything else obtained from Game Freak detailing the franchise's future — and its product roadmap for the rest of the decade.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The largest cache of information relates to the franchise's highly-anticipated "Gen 10" games that are expected to launch next year, in time for Pokémon's 30th anniversary. Details now being shared online include the titles' planned name, early animation tests, in-engine footage and word of several planned gameplay ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this, there's information relating to a separate, ambitious-sounding Pokémon MMO project, as well as concept art for a third Pokémon Legends spin-off title. And beyond that, there's the suggestion that Pokémon's Gen 11 will follow at the start of the next decade. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a frankly astonishing leak of information, seemingly from the same source which yesterday revealed details derived from beta builds of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and last year leaked a vast treasure trove of development data on pretty much every previous Pokémon project launched to date.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon fans are already poring over the purported plans and discussing several eye-opening gameplay mechanics. There's even early fan art for a new Pokémon species spotted in one of the new pieces of conceprt art. But it's worth pointing out that some or indeed much of what has been shared may not ultimately come to pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As yesterday's Pokémon Legends: Z-A beta build leak showed, gameplay features get cut in development. And nothing in the Teraleak can be relied upon as reflecting Game Freak's current plans — as the hack itself took place back in August 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo previously attempted to track down the culprit behind the Teraleak, and launched a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-requests-subpoena-of-discord-to-track-down-user-behind-last-years-pokemon-teraleak">legal bid to subpoena Discord</a> to divulge the hackers' identity back in April this year.

            <p>Pokémon developer Game Freak has suffered another huge leak of data, revealing the studio's purported planned projects until 2030.</p>
<p>The leak comes a year to the day after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reels-from-unprecedented-gigaleak-of-significant-internal-data">"teraleak" of "significant internal data" that revealed unannounced Pokémon games</a>. Game Freak later acknowledged it was hacked, admitting personal employee information had been obtained. Then, in April this year, Nintendo filed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-want-to-force-discord-to-reveal-pokemon-teraleak-source">request to subpoena Discord</a> for the hacker's identity.</p>
<p>This new leak, revealing alleged future projects and concept art from new and old games alike, arrives mere days before the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, amid suggestions the same hacker was holding back this information.</p>

<p>The budget for Pokémon Legends: Z-A was reportedly just 2bn yen (around $13m). Typically, Japanese game development budgets are smaller than those we see in the West (for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to lower staff salaries), but this still feels like a very small amount for what is considered one of Nintendo's most significant series. What's more, as recent Pokémon games on Switch have suffered from poor performance, there's concern among the fanbase of a lack of investment to ensure future games run more smoothly.</p><p>Across the internet, there's notable commentary on this aspect of the leak, specifically. The <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1o5wqxi/massive_pokemon_leak_purportedly_covers_nextgen/njcd9ef/">top comment</a> on a reddit thread discussing the leaks simply jokes that the whole leak is "just a Post-It note that says, 'even lower budget for next game'." <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1o5wqxi/massive_pokemon_leak_purportedly_covers_nextgen/njcg4mv/">Another comment</a> reflects: "A lot of people are going to complain about the money budget and not enough people will complain about the time budget of these games." Another poster notes: "The only leak I would care about is that they suddenly get a better engine, and actually treat Pokemon as a modern game with a high budget."</p>
<p>Within the leak itself, details have been shared purportedly covering the next four games planned until 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler warning!</strong></p>
<p>The first of these is the next mainline game, the tenth generation, which reportedly has the codename Gaia and will be known as Pokémon Wind and Waves. It's seemingly set for release next year, followed by DLC in 2027, and will be set in Southeast Asia. Leaked screenshots of concept art show open, jungle areas, while budget-wise it's reportedly costing 3bn yen - another surprisingly small budget, but hitting roughly $20m, this time, a marked bump over Z-A's $13m (probably thanks to a series of planned improvements, such as a new engine, which commenters hope will improve performance on console hardware).</p>
<p>This will reportedly be followed by another Legends game, to be set in the Galar region of Sword and Shield - with the fitting codename of Ringo.</p>
<p>Then there's project Seed, which will reportedly combine multiple regions from past games. Lastly, the eleventh generation is reportedly aiming for a 2030 release.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth questioning the validity of this information. Even if the reported details are true, the documents could well be outdated and plans may have changed since. There's also plenty of fan speculation wrapped up around the details.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for comment on the validity of the leaks.</p>
<p>The news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-pokemon-legends-z-a-spoilers-are-out-in-the-wild-ahead-of-its-release-this-week">follows leaks of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> ahead of its release this Thursday, 16th October. Copies of the game are already out in the wild, are being streamed on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and illegal ROMs are already available, meaning spoilers are abundant.</p>

We know y'all like a bit of stability with your updates.</p>
<p>The patch notes here are primarily for Steam, so there will likely be a few things that won't be relevant for us Switch / Switch 2 owners, but there's still plenty that will be of interest. There doesn't seem to be any major tweaks to the gameplay or difficulty with this one, so we're mainly looking at bugs and whatnot that have been kindly stamped out.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957gkisxw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

            <p>Shortly after you finish celebrating the arrival of next year, a plague will rock up. Well, the full version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a>, a game in which you play a doctor tasked with saving a town from a mysterious contagion will rock up. I'm sure that if you turn off all of the lights and pay someone to sit in the next room coughing every two minutes, the difference'll be negligible.</p>

<p>This full release has taken a tiny bit longer than developers Ice-Pick Lodge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-announced-with-time-travel-mechanic-due-for-release-in-2025">initially planned</a>, but it's just barely slipped out of 2025, with January 9th, 2026, being the freshly revealed release date. "That date is nailed down, screwed in, wrapped in commitments, and it isn’t moving," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199650/view/542244996316660185?l=english">Steam post</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside this announcement, they've released the first in a series of trailers, because apparently Pathologic 3's far too "hard to explain with keywords" for a single video to do it justice. Multiple trailers apparently aren't enough to accomplish that task either, as the studio have opted to release a second demo - following Pathologic 3: Quarantine's arrival this March - as part of the latest Steam Next Fest.</p><p>"This demo is a slice from the beginning of the upcoming game," Ice-Pick Lodge explained. "Daniil Dankovsky, the Bachelor, arrives in the City-on-Gorkhon. He wants to meet an immortal man. And then everything goes sideways." Sounds like the average trip into town.</p>
<p>As Brendan discussed when he delved into the plague doc sim's Quarantine demo, Pathologic 3 treads a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-devs-keen-to-avoid-premature-promises-about-bringing-back-the-changeling-in-pathologic-4">more detective-coded plague-doctoring path than its scrappier predecessor</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a>. Here's an extract from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-quarantine-drops-the-hunger-meters-so-you-can-play-doctor">his impressions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>For all its stitched-togetherness, the Quarantine demo remains good at building atmosphere. As a taster menu for the unreliable narrator story that is planned for the full game, it is flavourful and stacked with familiar names and faces for long-suffering fans. As a showcase for what the player will be doing it's also something of a disjointed mess. I'm writing out many of its features in simple terms, but the demo itself doesn't always deliver them that way, with minimal tutorials and a UI that mostly lets you figure things out yourself.</blockquote>
<p>Pathologic 3's also the first entry in the series the studio'll be releasing after the departure of founder and long-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a> director Nikolay Dybowski, who <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ice-pick-lodge-founder-nikolay-dybowski-departs-pathologic-dev">left amid allegations of kidnapping and abuse</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>The game's Next Fest demo can be found on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A huge dataleak has struck the world of Pokémon, revealing huge details about upcoming titles and the long-awaited arrival of Gen 10, said to be titled Wind &amp; Waves.</p>



<p>A series of leaks have dropped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details about Gen 10</a>, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap for future titles and DLC</a>, and teases the introduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-reveals-boss-fight-and-mmo-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MMO mechanics in the next era</a> of the franchise.</p>



<p>Keeping on top of all the leaks is practically impossible, but we’ve made it easier for you to track everything revealed about Pokémon Gen 10, Wind &amp; Waves, in this guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-we-know-about-pokemon-wind-amp-waves">Everything We Know About Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big additions. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-game-location">Game Location</h3>



<p>Pokémon’s tenth generation will return to the Asian continent, having ventured to Europe and Hawaii in recent years, with the islands of Indonesia and Southeast Asia serving as the location.</p>



<p>The island locations will certainly be reminiscent of Sun &amp; Moon, based on Hawaii, and these rumours have been circulating for some time, though it was previously indicated that it would be based on the Greek islands. That appears not to be the case, however, with Indonesia and surrounding nations set to star.</p>



<h3 id="h-seed-pokemon">Seed Pokémon</h3>



<p>Seed <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> will reportedly be introduced in Pokémon Gen 10, with a particularly unique mechanic. According to datamines, the evolution of the Seed Pokémon will be based on the unique island you discover (more on that later), meaning your evolved form will feature unique patterns and colors.</p>



<p>There has been some confusion, however, as the Japanese use of ‘Seed’ for Pokémon description is also used in the TCG to describe ‘Basic’ Pokémon, so it may be that this Pokémon is ‘Basic’ and not ‘Seed’. However, the evolution mechanics seem to stand.</p>



<h3 id="h-underwater-exploration">Underwater Exploration</h3>



<p>Underwater exploration, not seen since the Hoenn games, is returning for Gen 10 and is said to be a huge feature, with datamined images showing a player riding on the back of Lumineon. Footage leaked from the graphics engine suggests it will have free exploration, not just available on designated routes.</p>

<p>Pokémon games have had riding mechanics in the past, notably with Pokémon Legends: Arceus having various mounts with different uses, but Gen 10 is seemingly set to take that to the next level with mechanics that make every Pokémon rideable, or pettable—likely depending on their size.</p>



<p>It’s noted that these details were in the planning document from 2020, so the feature may have been adjusted or removed entirely during development.</p>



<h3 id="h-model-redesigns">Model Redesigns</h3>



<p>It’s not surprising to see Pokémon getting model redesigns in new eras of the franchise, and it seems it’s happening once again for Gen 10 as images showing several images comparing Pokémon to their new forms and older models have been shared.</p>



<p>Pikachu, Charizard, Lumineon, and Machamp are all explicity stated as receiving new models for Gen 10, though it’s likely all Pokémon will be adjusted to fit the new era.</p>



<h3 id="h-mmo-features">MMO Features</h3>



<p>MMO features are set to be introduced in Gen 10, the leaks state, with a mix of open-world and MMO elements. Though not confirmed, this sounds like exploration areas will be limited to parties and groups, while main areas, acting as hubs, will have players across the world joined together.</p>



<p>The features are seemingly going to serve as a soft-launch ahead of being expanded in the Pokémon Seed project, a game that joins several regions together including Hoenn and Sinnoh. A similar approach has been seen in the past, with large open-world areas introduced in Legends: Arceus, which occurred before the huge open-world map seen in Scarlet &amp; Violet.</p>

<h3 id="h-release-window">Release Window</h3>



<p>As expected, Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves, the tenth generation, will launch in 2026, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the franchise. This would come four years after the release of Scarlet &amp; Violet, slightly longer than the standard three-year gap we’ve seen in the past.</p>



<p>These plans have seemingly been updated; however, as documents initially stated Gen 10 was planned to release in 2025, likely as a big lure alongside the Switch 2 launch, with Legends: Z-A launching in 2024. That is not the case, however, as we know.</p>



<h3 id="h-procedural-generation">Procedural Generation</h3>



<p>Procedural generation is reportedly going to be a huge feature in Gen 10, with islands generated randomly for you to explore. If you like what you find, you’ll be able to share an island with your friends.</p>



<p>It’s not known whether you can save islands permanently and have them serve as a ‘base,’ or if they’ll merely be for exploration and catching new Pokémon. </p>



<h3 id="h-switch-2-exclusive">Switch 2 Exclusive</h3>



<p>Unsurprisingly, it has been confirmed that Gen 10 of Pokémon, Wind &amp; Waves, will be exclusive to Switch 2 and won’t be available on the original console, unlike Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>



<p>Legends: Z-A is likely to be the final Pokémon title released onto the original Switch console, with Pokopia arriving next year and confirmed to be a Switch 2 exclusive. </p>



<h3 id="h-sustainable-development-goals">Sustainable Development Goals</h3>



<p>Similar to Scarlet &amp; Violet, there will be a group of objectives rather than just the standard gym badges, with the theme said to be inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>



<p>In total, there are 18 challenges, one for each type, and completing them all allows you to challenge the champion. However, if you want to, you can skip this whole stage entirely and head straight to the final boss as soon as open-water exploration in the game is unlocked.</p>



<h3 id="h-characters">Characters</h3>



<p>Descriptions for several characters have been unearthed, including the protagonist, a child whose mother wins a lottery and a vacation to the region. A sibling is also mentioned, with their development playing a key part in the story, and there’s the customary friend/rival to challenge you along the way.</p>



<p>The antagonist is said to be the chairman of a group of hotels, who initially planned to build resorts where humans and Pokémon could co-exist. However, an accident led to the loss of a child, changing his views. There’s also a younger sibling to that child who survived and is described as “naive” about the world.</p>



<p>The role of the evil team is taken by a Land Development Team, who destroy nature to expand land for profit, likely working for the hotel chairman. Finally, the professor is younger than we usually see in the franchise, age 21, and is known as the “Survival Professor,” with survival skills being a core strength.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> is clearly off to the races if its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-having-a-massive-debut-on-steam/1100-6535370/">domination of the Steam charts</a> are any indication. Over the course of its launch weekend, EA's latest and greatest multiplayer shooter put up remarkable numbers, cresting over 740,000 concurrent players regularly. And while the game is still pretty fresh, it has impressively retained a great deal of players at all times, rarely dropping below about 200,000 active players at any given point.</p><p dir="ltr">On Steam at least, Battlefield 6 boasts the most concurrent players of any entry in the franchise, and it has ranked among Steam's most played games the entirety of the weekend. It is also the #1 top seller on Steam, which is especially prominent given the fact that the base game is going for a whopping $70. I think it's safe to say that all that momentum Battlefield 6 has been enjoying has turned it into the series' first bonafide hit in a long while.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1977395959446286661" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I think this Sunday will be good in terms of how many of you all are playing BF6! New record? I hope so!</p>  — David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1977395959446286661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Despite the momentum that Battlefield 6 had going into the weekend after its launch--a holiday weekend, no less--it wasn't able to beat out its peak of 747,000+ players, which it achieved right at release on October 10. Still, Battlefield 6's early Steam numbers are good enough to beat out Call of Duty's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/" rel="nofollow ">all-time high</a> on the platform, which is currently sitting at about 492,000, as well as other major shooters on the market like Apex Legends and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6's outstanding start isn't without precedent. A slew of leaks from the Battlefield Labs program, which invited select players to test the game out early and provide meaningful feedback, detailed many features that built up anticipation. Anticipation which eventually exploded around the game's full reveal earlier this summer, where the developers at Battlefield Studios teased inspiration from Battlefield's 3 and 4 (the darlings of the franchise) as well as a back-to-basics approach after Battlefield 2042's tumultuous launch.</p><p dir="ltr">An open beta in August seemed to crystallize the fervor around Battlefield 6, drawing in more than 500,000 players on Steam alone and proving to many that the franchise was in rare form after a series of misses. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">review-in-progress</a> confirms as much, calling it "a return to form for the long-running series, delivering chaotic, large-scale multiplayer that's as familiar as it is uproariously fun."</p><p dir="ltr">I guess all that remains to be seen now is whether Battlefield 6 can maintain this good buzz and momentum moving forward, especially as competitors like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Black Ops 7</a> inch closer to release.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, Xbox underwent a massive internal shift resulting in a number of projects <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#1">getting canceled</a>, a great deal of employees <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/">being laid off</a>, and at least <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">one studio closure</a>. Among the damage done was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/">cancelation of Everwild</a>, a third-person fantasy game that underwent a turbulent development cycle before having the plug pulled on it.</p><p dir="ltr">At the time of its cancelation, we'd only ever seen two trailers of the game. Details of the project outside of these atmospheric teasers were scarce and it seemed like we would hear very little after its untimely demise. Now though, it appears that screenshots of some early builds have leaked, at last giving players some idea of the game they'll never get to play.</p><p dir="ltr">First reported by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/screenshots-rares-everwild-featuring-ui-gameplay-details" rel="nofollow ">MP1st</a>, the screenshots come by way of an artist that once worked on the title at Rare, and reportedly resemble a version of the game close to its cancelation. In these screenshots, you can make out the game's cel-shaded art style, as well as some elements of its menu and UI, which detail some kind of farming/survival mechanics.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PastorXbox/status/1977745836097315011" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Vazou?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Vazou</a> Capturas de Tela do Cancelado Everwild da Rare 📸<br> As imagens mostravam (provavelmente) uma versão relativamente recente, de um pouco antes do jogo ser cancelado pela Microsoft<br>A interface nos lembra um pouco dos jogos da franquia Zelda modernos , embora tenhamos sido… <a href="https://t.co/7lMlrAUvXw" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/7lMlrAUvXw</a></p>  — Pastor Xbox (@PastorXbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/PastorXbox/status/1977745836097315011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">In a seemingly early build of Everwild, we get our first glimpse at a menu that is divided into tools, seeds, and figments. The latter two appear to be consumables of some sorts, with Figments specifically looking like deployable critters of some sort that come in various types, while the toolbar suggests items that the player might use more regularly, especially if Everwild was to support some sort of farming element. Reportedly, the game was being developed as a third-person title with God game and survival mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">Another screenshot shows a more developed and artistically rendered version of the same menu, though this time it also features tabs hinting at other items the player could use such as mosaics and plants alongside tools, figments, and seeds. One even shows a bit of flavor text for an item called a shrub seed which pokes fun at the player's intelligence.</p><p dir="ltr">Among the leaked images is one showing off a number of Everwild's settings. Interestingly, MP1st notes that according to the website where the images were found, Rare was going to use player data from Sea of Thieves, its ongoing pirate live-service game, to inform its settings for Everwild, though specific examples of this philosophy aren't mentioned.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the remaining screenshots show off some glimpses at the game's environment, though they also give away painfully little. In one image, the player seems to stand before a structure in a sea of fog while another provides a blurry glimpse at a forested area. Even if the images are of an early build, Everwild sure was nailing the naturalistic ambience of its cinematics.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, I expect these screenshots will be all we get out of Everwild for a long time. Still, I'm glad we got to see it at all, and now many can finally imagine a more concrete version of this regrettably axed title.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-elder-scrolls-online-battle-for-the-writhing-wall-the-game%E2%80%99s-first-one-time-world-changing-event-is-now-live-on-all-platforms.1324126/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>ZeniMax Online has released the Battle for the Writhing Wall event for The Elder Scrolls Online on all platforms, a novelty in itself given that updates usually launch on PC and Mac before consoles. The Battle for the Writhing Wall is a key component of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/eso-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-developer-qa-theres-tons-of-exciting-stuff-we-havent-talked-about-thats-coming-to-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seasons of the Worm Cult</a> because so far, players have been limited to exploring Western Solstice due to this magical barrier (made of souls) erected by the dreadful cult of necromancers. Now, though, the whole community of the MMORPG will participate in an assault on the barrier that will develop over three stages.  </p>



<p>The first phase is one of supply and defense where players must help the Stirk Fellowship (a partnership between the three Alliances and the Fighters and Mages guilds) gather resources for the upcoming battle. Both sides engage in skirmishes over siege camps, and planar incursions will affect locations across all of Tamriel. All The Elder Scrolls Online players can contribute to progressing this phase, but only those who have purchased the 2025 Content Pass can accept quests in Solstice. During this initial stage, you can expect the Worm Cult to take over various delves and public dungeons throughout Tamriel, using them as invasion sites and marking them on the map. These areas have additional monsters that are more difficult to defeat than usual and are the focus of the daily quests offered by the NPC Orinde Glenuvon.</p>



<p>In Phase 2, players must strengthen the war effort and maintain siege camp defense while the proper assault on the Writhing Wall begins. Expect vicious counterattacks as the Fellowship prepares its decisive strike against the wall. As before, all players may contribute, but only 2025 Content Pass owners can accept quests in Solstice. Siege Camp incursions will occur more frequently and be more difficult to complete. Additionally, the Daedra Ghishzor, a powerful Maldrith, will appear as a world boss on Solstice.</p>



<p>Finally, the last phase will start with the Writhing Wall exposed. At that point, it will be time to break through and clear the Writhing Fortress public instance. Unlike the other phases, which vary in length depending on player successes and mobilization, the third phase lasts one week from when the Writhing Fortress is first completed on a given server; the event ends after that period. Only players with the 2025 Content Pass can attempt and complete this phase.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Similar to the vanilla World of Warcraft event of the opening of Ahn'Qiraj, each server will progress separately depending on its players' contributions. The Xbox Europe and PlayStation Europe servers are currently slightly ahead of the others. The progress of each server can be followed <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/writhingwall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via this official The Elder Scrolls Online website page</a>.</p>



<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-qa-zos-leadership-change-game-alive-30-years-unfortunate-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed the ZeniMax Online leadership</a> to discuss the studio's changes (the layoffs, the cancellation of Project Blackbird, and the new Game Director, Nick Giacomini) and their goal to keep Elder Scrolls Online alive for 30 years.</p>

Naturally, you’d think it’ll take a lot of work to get to that stage, and you’re half right. But there are a few tips and tricks we’ve picked up along the way to help you make the sparkly garden of your dreams.</p><p>Grow A Garden is one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/">best Roblox games</a> available to play on the platform, and one of the reasons why is that you can spend a few minutes tending to your plot before leaving it to do its own thing. However, unless someone is willing to donate to you one of their most expensive plants, getting started will take some grit. Here are some tips for the early game, things to focus on once you’ve made a bit of money, and all the more obscure mechanics that help you in the long run.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Best_Plants_to_buy_in_the_early_stages">Best Plants to buy in the early stages</a></li><li><a href="#Don___t_forget_about_the_guide_achievements">Don’t forget about the guide achievements</a></li><li><a href="#Mid_late_game_tips_for_making_money">Mid-late game tips for making money</a></li><li><a href="#Mutate_your_rarest_pets">Mutate your rarest pets</a></li><li><a href="#Buy_tools_and_get_crafting">Buy tools and get crafting</a></li><li><a href="#Participate_in_Admin_Abuse_events">Participate in Admin Abuse events</a></li><li><a href="#Cook_plants_in_the_cooking_kit">Cook plants in the cooking kit</a></li><li><a href="#Look_out_for_merchants">Look out for merchants</a><ul><li><a href="#Gnome_Merchant">Gnome Merchant</a></li><li><a href="#Honey_Merchant">Honey Merchant</a></li><li><a href="#Sky_Merchant">Sky Merchant</a></li><li><a href="#Sprinker_Shop">Sprinker Shop</a></li><li><a href="#Summer_Seed_Merchant">Summer Seed Merchant</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Invest_in_expanding_your_garden_size">Invest in expanding your garden size</a></li><li><a href="#Spend_a_fortune_to_Ascend_and_gain_Garden_Coins">Spend a fortune to Ascend and gain Garden Coins</a><ul><li><a href="#Ascension_merchant_inventory">Ascension merchant inventory</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575723-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-seeds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575723" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575723-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-seeds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575723"></a><figcaption>Sam owns the Seed Shop, which regularly restocks valuable seeds you can plant to earn money.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575723-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-seeds.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Best_Plants_to_buy_in_the_early_stages">Best Plants to buy in the early stages</h2><p>When you’re just starting your garden, growing and selling carrots is a good way to make a bit of pocket change, as they grow very quickly. However, you’ll want to prioritize any plant that doesn’t disappear upon harvesting it before too long. Generally, they’re more cost-effective, meaning that you’ll recoup your money and won’t need to buy and plant replacement seeds.</p><p>While single-harvest plants don’t normally give a good return upon sale, there are a couple of exceptions. Bamboo is the most plentiful plant with the best resale value. Buy as many seeds as you can afford in the shop whenever they replenish, then plant them in the corner of your garden and leave them there. Expose them to as many weather effects as you can so that they can get as many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-grow-a-garden-mutations/1100-6534388/" data-ref-id="1100-6534388">Grow A Garden mutations</a> as possible, then sell them for a fortune. Mushrooms are also a valuable candidate for single-harvest plants that are potentially worth a ton.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575736-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-achievements.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575736" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575736-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-achievements.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575736"></a><figcaption>The Guide button on the left was added fairly recently, but it's a handy way to check the achievements to get more stuff.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575736-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-achievements.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Don___t_forget_about_the_guide_achievements">Don’t forget about the guide achievements</h2><p>The Guide Book has plenty of things you can do to gain a bunch of experience. While the rewards for reaching higher levels aren’t all that exciting, completing each page of the Guide Book’s achievement sections gives you helpful items to boost your garden, such as seed packets, pet shards, and many more.</p><p>To give you an idea of the work needed to complete the Common Achievements page, you only need to shovel 100 plants, harvest 200 carrots, sell 500 strawberries, and gift a carrot and 5 strawberries. Completing this set of quests will reward you with a cooking kit and 5 silver common seed packs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575747-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-mid-game.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575747" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575747-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-mid-game.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575747"></a><figcaption>Occasionally, you'll get a plant that has a whole bunch of different mutations, each one buffing how much it's worth when sold.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575747-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-mid-game.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Mid_late_game_tips_for_making_money">Mid-late game tips for making money</h2><p>Once you’ve made your first million Sheckles, it’s time to use tools such as the shovel to dig up plants that are no longer needed. Any common, uncommon, and rare plants are taking precious space that you can better use for when you find or buy higher rarity plants. If you’re unsure what the rarity of your plant is, hover your cursor or face the direction of the crop and look at the color of its name. If it’s grey, green, or blue, then you can probably dig it up.</p><p>Bulky single-harvest plants, such as watermelons, or replenishable ones like apples that don’t give a lot of profit, should be sold as soon as possible. Instead, you should grow high-yield trees such as coconuts, mangoes, dragon fruit, and romanesco. Bamboo is still a good investment at the mid-game, because they grow quickly and are worth a fair bit when affected by many mutations. Eventually, you’ll be able to afford the most expensive plants and dedicate all your garden space to growing them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575751-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-pet-mutations.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575751-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-pet-mutations.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575751"></a><figcaption>Some mutations, such as Inverted, give an additional boost to pet XP, while others allow pets to give bonus mutations.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575751-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-pet-mutations.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Mutate_your_rarest_pets">Mutate your rarest pets</h2><p>This is also the time when you should be investing in Grow A Garden pets. Focus initially on trying to get any event-exclusive pets that grant mutations that will disappear once a new update appears. They’re not worth much now, but hatching as many of them as you can gives you potential trades in the future. Don’t bother with any common or uncommon eggs from the shop. There are very few that are worth the hassle of hatching, while rare and higher rarity eggs can be game-changing.</p><p>As for mutations, a pet can only have one at a time, so choose carefully which one you want. To mutate them, feed them to level 50 and deposit them for 500,000,000 sheckles at the facility next to the pet shop. You can also give them a Golden Acorn from level 40 to give them a random mutation from one of the following options.</p><ul><li><strong>Shiny</strong> - provides an additional 15% boost to the pet’s XP per second.</li><li><strong>Inverted</strong> - provides an additional 30% boost to the pet’s XP per second.</li><li><strong>Windy</strong> - every 4 minutes and 47 seconds, there’s a 20.12% chance a nearby fruit gets the Windstruck mutation.</li><li><strong>Frozen</strong> - every 4 minutes and 47 seconds, there’s a 30% chance a nearby fruit gets the Frozen mutation.</li><li><strong>Golden</strong> - gives a big increase to the pet’s passive.</li><li><strong>Mega</strong> - pet is gigantic and has a 20% faster hunger rate. Gains an additional 10-40 XP per second.</li><li><strong>Tiny</strong> - pet is tiny and has a 20% slower hunger rate. Gains an additional 5-30 XP per second</li><li><strong>IronSkin</strong> - gives around a 35% to 45% chance to recover any stolen fruit.</li><li><strong>Rainbow</strong> - provides a bigger increase to the pet’s passive.</li><li><strong>Shocked</strong> - during a thunderstorm, every 45-60 seconds, it has between a 25% and 30% chance to attract lightning strikes to give nearby fruits the Shocked mutation.</li><li><strong>Radiant</strong> - every 20 to 30 minutes, it emits sunshine at a random nearby plant to advance its growth by 24 hours.</li><li><strong>Ascended</strong> - every 5 to 6 hours, there is around a 75% chance that this pet will give the Dawnbound mutation to a random fruit.</li></ul><p>There are also a handful of events in the past and present that give out Pet Shards, which you can use to apply the following mutations:</p><ul><li><strong>Aromatic </strong>- every 24 minutes and 42 seconds, a nearby fruit has a chance to get the Aromatic mutation. (Cooking event only)</li><li><strong>Fried </strong>- every 20 minutes, a nearby fruit has a chance to get the Fried mutation (Cooking event only)</li><li><strong>Tranquil</strong> - every 25 minutes, a nearby fruit has a chance to get the Tranquil mutation (Zen event only)</li><li><strong>Corrupted</strong> - every 25 minutes, a nearby fruit has a chance to get the Corrupted mutation (Zen event only)</li><li><strong>GiantBean</strong> - pet has a 15% faster hunger rate and gains an additional 0.12 XP per second for each Beanstalk planted in your garden. (Beanstalk event only)</li><li><strong>Glimmering</strong> - every 24 minutes and 45 seconds, a nearby fruit has a 20.14% chance of getting the Glimmering mutation (Fairies event only)</li><li><strong>Luminous</strong> - every 34 minutes and 15 seconds, a nearby fruit has a 20.04% chance to get the Luminous mutation (Fairies event only)</li><li><strong>Nutty</strong> - every 19 minutes and 40 seconds, the pet's main ability has a 20% chance to activate twice. If this fails, your pet loses a level. (Chubby Chipmunk event only)</li></ul><p>You can also get Pet Shards by participating in events or completing achievements. These are single-use items that permanently swap your pet’s mutation, and they include pet mutations otherwise not available elsewhere. Here are the ones currently available:</p><ul><li><strong>Silver</strong> - obtain by completing Pet Achievements</li><li><strong>Gold</strong> - obtain by completing Pet Achievements</li><li><strong>Rainbow</strong> - obtain by completing Pet Achievements</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575755-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-tools.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575755" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575755-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-tools.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575755"></a><figcaption>The Gear Shop and crafting benches provide players with access to some invaluable tools and gear to help their gardens grow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575755-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-tools.jpg"></figure><p>Another top tip is to grab some additional tools from the gear shop or craft them at the bench. These can help you improve your pet’s abilities, water your plants more efficiently, and even change cleansing sprays into ones that give plants mutations instead. We highly recommend you save a Basic, Advanced, and Godly sprinkler to craft either a Lightning Rod or Tanning Mirror for 500,000 Sheckles. When you deploy them, they give nearby plants a higher chance to be affected by the Shocked or Sundried mutations during thunderstorms and heatwaves, respectively.</p><p>You can also craft unusual plants by combining seeds and plants like some kind of Frankenstein’s courgette. It’s frankly absurd as a concept, but if you want access to Lingonberries, Mandrakes, and all the other craftable plants, then you’ll need to invest some time, money, and resources into getting them for your garden.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575780-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-admin-abuse.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575780" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575780-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-admin-abuse.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575780"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575780-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-admin-abuse.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Participate_in_Admin_Abuse_events">Participate in Admin Abuse events</h2><p>Before loading up Grow A Garden from the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/126884695634066/Grow-a-Garden" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Roblox main page</a>, you’ll want to pay attention to the section below that tells you when the next event will begin. This is because, in addition to briefly describing what the event entails, it also states that an “Admin Abuse” will occur starting an hour before the update is released.</p><p>Yes, the name is rather unfortunate, but what typically happens during an Admin Abuse is that one of the main creators of the game will appear via big messages on the game screen, similar to the ones that tell you when the shop restocks. They will announce things such as when rare items are being added to the relevant shops, and warn players about certain Admin-only Grow A Garden weather events.</p><p>Having lots of plants with a high resale value in your garden before the Admin Abuse begins is key to making millions of Sheckles per plant. Fill your garden with plants like Bamboo or regrowable plants such as romanesco at least a couple of hours before the new event switchover time to guarantee that you have plenty of valuable crops to sell once the update is complete.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575778-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-cooking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575778" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575778-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-cooking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575778"></a><figcaption>Picking up a Cooking Kit will allow you to make food, which is needed for complex crafting recipes and increasing your friendship levels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575778-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-cooking.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Cook_plants_in_the_cooking_kit">Cook plants in the cooking kit</h2><p>To get a cooking kit, you need to either complete the Common, Rare, or Mythical tier achievements or buy one in the cosmetic shop for 1,000,000 Sheckles. Place it in your garden and have a plant in your hand to then put it into the pot for cooking. You can only put in five plants to make food, so make sure they’re high-value or ones with mutations to increase the chances of getting a food with those same bonuses. The mutation gauge on the cooking kit will increase the more fruits with these multipliers are used in the recipe.</p><p>The advantage of this is that they are worth more friendship points when you feed them to shop owners. Regular food is worth 2 points, while mutated food is worth a lot more for every mutation. Given that there is a 24-hour cooldown before you can feed a shopkeeper again, having many mutations on one plant is vital for ensuring your friendship level increases with as few plants as possible.</p><p>Crafting specific Grow A Garden recipes, such as Corndogs, is simplified because only the type of plant is taken into account when cooking. For example, the corndog requires one plant to act as the stick, one as the meat, and one as the batter. You can use many plants as the stick part, but only a handful are acceptable meats. The batter, in this case, has to be either violet corn or corn.</p><p>You should also have a few cakes on hand, just in case there’s an NPC birthday, as giving them a slice will hand you one of the rarer items from their shop for free. Here are all the NPC birthdays:</p><ul><li><strong>Eloise (Gear shop</strong>) - March 4</li><li><strong>Sam (Seed shop)</strong> - July 2</li><li><strong>Isaac (Cosmetic shop)</strong> - December 1</li><li><strong>Raphael (Egg shop)</strong> - October 30</li><li><strong>Orson (Ascension shop)</strong> - Unknown</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575770-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-merchant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575770" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575770-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-merchant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575770"></a><figcaption>Some merchants will only appear once every half an hour next to the Seed Shop.

            <p>Digital Extremes has announced that its upcoming action MMORPG Soulframe will be receiving a founders pack that eager fans can purchase for exclusive items, gear, and a way to make a "permanent mark" on the game.</p>
<p>Announced during the recent Soulframe Devstream 11, the team dove into the latest updates for the nature-themed fantasy game in detail for its keen audience. What these rewards are remains largely a mystery, though we know they'll be themed around the first Envoys (names for play characters): Galene, Pothia, and Josalfar. More information is set to come in the future, but for now the price point and what these items will look like remain a mystery. Though, <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/founders">the illustration on the Soulframe website could be a pretty good clue</a>.</p>
<p>Digital Extremes also announced that Founders Pack owners would be able to invite a number of their friends to Soulframe: Preludes (Digital Extreme's version of an pre-alpha version of the game). Earlier this year, the company opened the floodgates to any pending or new applications to join these preludes as part of its annual event: Tennocon.</p>

<p>Let's break down the Founders pack. So the "permanent mark" is the initial eyebrow raiser, and could be a callback to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> Founders pack and a particularly cool perk it had. Warframe, Digital Extreme's first MMO, had Founders in-game names attached to specific missions, so players could hover over and see a list of Founders when they were looking around the star map (A sort of mission select). These days, the Founders names are found across the various Relays (player hubs), but nonetheless it's a permanent mark that went down well.</p><p>However, with that Warframe Founders pack came with Excalibur prime, Skana Prime, and Lato Prime. These are suped-up versions of pre-existing frames (playable characters) and weapons, and remain extremely cool pieces of gear that will likely never return to the game, especially given they mark a player who helped Digital Extremes out at their lowest point. However, these items also contribute to your account's mastery rank, a measure of player prestige, which has left some feeling a little sour over the years.</p>
<p>It's as such very unlikely that these Soulframe Founders items will contribute to your Soulframe account's Master level, given this continuous frustration from a portion of the fans. However, this hasn't been stated outright as of writing. An account's Master level in Soulframe provides Virtue points, which can basically be used to increase your ability damage, range, and duration. Though, it's worth noting some weapons scale with Master rank.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Digital Extremes to ask whether these Founders items will contribute to a Soulframe account's Master Rank, and received the following response courtesy of PR: "We’ll have more info to share on Soulframe Founders in the coming weeks".</p>
<p>Also announced in the Soulframe devstream was a small narrative addition to the Waste Bear Fable, a main quest of sorts currently playable in Soulframe: Preludes. In addition, a new interaction with the Witch Vermina will explore the colours of the world, unlocking the dye system for gear customisation.</p>
