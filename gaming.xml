            <p>Arc Raiders has once again smashed its own concurrent peak user count on Steam, topping 400,000 for the first time this weekend.</p>
<p>Last week, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-passes-250000-concurrent-players-on-steam-alone-breaking-records-for-the-extraction-shooter-genre">Arc Raiders had surpassed a peak concurrent player count of 250,000 on Steam just a day after its release</a>, and then again on 1st November when it topped 328,062 simultaneous players, making it the most popular Steam release for a PvP extraction shooter ever.</p>

<p>Now, over the weekend period, Arc Raiders has broken its own record once again, hitting a new high of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">416,517 concurrent users</a> on Steam, making it the fifth biggest game on Steam over the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Based on data from Alinea Analytics, market analysts believe around 69.2 percent of the game's playerbase is on Steam. That means roughly 30 percent of its playerbase - 17.3 percent on PlayStation, and 13.5 percent on Xbox - are not accounted for in that figure.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-may-have-already-sold-25m-copies-according-to-industry-analyst">As for why Arc Raiders is so popular</a> when other extraction shooters haven't reached such highs in terms of sales or player count? As Connor reported earlier in the week, market analyst Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics believes that "Arc Raiders is great because it focuses on community - NOT because it's an extraction shooter".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">Eurogamer's Arc Raiders' preview</a>, we wrote: "Arc Raiders is, simply put, a third-person extraction shooter. It is a factory that mass produces tense moments, by its own nature a source of intense anxiety: high stakes, devastating losses, rapturous victories. Pulling back, it's a game of gradual self-refinement, both of your inventory full of resources and your characters abilities, and likewise your own know-how."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has struck down co-op survival horror shooter Misery with a DMCA alleging copyright infringement.</p>
<p>After Valve said it had no option but to take down the game before it too was subject to a copyright claim, the Misery team - chiefly consisting of a solo developer called Maewing - <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2119830/announcements/detail/598542531394798467">claimed</a> it was "under attack!", insisting Misery is "a completely different concept, happening in the fictional Republic of Zaslavie, and it has nothing to do" with GSC's Stalker 2.</p>
<p>"It has nothing to do with the Stalker universe, Chernobyl, etc. Misery uses no characters, plot, storyline, assets, monsters, music, code, etc., from their games. It is all either originally created or legally licensed. We also think that this is an abuse of power against small independent developers by a large corporation, and it should not be a thing," the team wrote of its game, which released on Steam on 23rd October.</p>
<p>"We do not pose any threat to GSC or their IP, we do not compete with their games, nor do we use any of their IP. Of course, Misery was inspired by many things, including games, movies, and books, but filing a DMCA strike for that is wrong. We also want to remind GSC that their games draw heavily from Roadside Picnic and the Stalker movie by Tarkovsky, and they do not own the copyright on depressive Soviet-era buildings, playing guitar, vodka, radiation, or abandoned locations, or even the poo."</p>

<p>As a consequence of the claim, the game has disappeared from the Steam storefront.</p>
<p>"We are 100% sure this misunderstanding will be resolved, Misery will be back on Steam very soon, and we will see many amazing updates and new content," the team added. "This is very unfortunate and painful for us, both mentally and financially, but the development continues, all the updates will be delivered on time, and soon we can play Misery again."</p><p>The message from Valve included screenshots comparing Misery to Stalker 2, including side-by-side comparisons of a gloomy, Soviet-era neightbourhood from Stalker: Call of Prypiat and a similar environment in Misery. Another side-by-side comparison shows characters in both games sitting around a fire wearing gas masks, playing guitar.</p>

<p>The team closed on imploring people not to review-bomb GSC, writing: "do not insult them or other people in comments, especially for their nationality! We do not want or support that".</p>
<p>However, in the privacy of its members-only Discord channel, the developer was considerably less polite <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/comment/nno4g7j/">and posted a screed of pejorative slurs</a>, prompting a follow-up apology.</p>
<p>"[After the DMCA strike], some people found my old posts and comments that included inappropriate and offensive statements," the developer said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/stalker-dev-gsc-game-world-dmcad-a-stalker-inspired-indie-off-steam-and-the-devs-are-crying-foul-this-is-an-abuse-of-power-against-small-independent-developers-by-a-large-corporation/">PC Gamer</a>). "Many are rightfully upset, and I completely understand why. First of all, I want to acknowledge and take full responsibility for my past words. What I wrote was immature, thoughtless, and wrong. It does not represent who I am today or what I believe in, and I deeply regret posting it.</p><p>"I do not support any form of extremism, violence, or discrimination against any group of people. I truly value and respect our players and friends from all countries and backgrounds. As for the DMCA strike we will handle it calmly and professionally. There is no basis for it, and I believe Valve will review the situation fairly."</p>
<p>Since then, Reddit investigators believe they've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/comment/nnu3vzk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">found unsubstantiated evidence that assets from Stalker 2 were indeed used to create Misery</a>, which may be why GSC has cracked down particularly on this developer and not other copycat titles. Others purport it may be because the developer, and seemingly some elements of the game's fanbase, allegedly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or7deo/few_screenshots_from_the_misery_discord/?share_id=4SZ6WdPDMY2KDFHNmrF88&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">supports</a> Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-reportedly-target-of-russian-disinformation-campaign-claiming-its-used-to-draft-players-into-ukraine-war">GSC is a Ukranian studio</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-roadmap-for-2025-includes-a-life-updates-and-an-upgrade-to-a-new-version-of-unreal-engine-5">GSC Game World announced its plans for updates to Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl for the remainder of 2025</a>. Big ticket updates include tweaks and changes to the A-Life system, Unreal Engine 5 performance gains, and new night vision devices to play with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="935049b296b1e"><a title="Samus and Kandeda - the Akira Slide" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/935049b296b1e/samus-and-kandeda-the-akira-slide.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The cultural consciousness loves the ‘Akira Slide’; a single moment in the 1988 anime movie <strong>Akira</strong> where Shōtarō Kaneda, following a bike race, skids across the tarmac to slow himself down, facing the screen, his bike side-on, trails of smoke billowing up from the road. Of course, he <em>could</em> use his brakes, but it wouldn’t be as flashy now, would it? Distributors Toho knew what they were doing when they slapped Kaneda and the bike on the movie poster.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve never seen the movie, you’ve almost definitely seen the physics-defying Akira Slide. 37 years later, TV showrunners, animators, and directors can’t get enough of that effortless skid. It’s featured in everything from <strong>Batman: The Animated Series</strong> to <strong>Adventure Time</strong> to Jordan Peele’s 2022 sci-fi horror <strong>Nope</strong> to even adorable shows like <strong>Doraemon</strong> and the <strong>Pokémon</strong> anime.</p>
<p>And of course, Shadow the Hedgehog even got his own chance to do it in the <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</strong> movie last year.</p>

<p>It’s natural, then, that video games equally fell in love with this seconds-spanning moment. The latest example sees space bounty hunter and all-around badass Samus Aran in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, riding Vi-O-La and braking in the exact same motion as Kaneda nearly four decades ago (actually more than that if you count the 1982 manga, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2626551-akira-slide">where it’s a lot more low-key</a>).</p>
<p>Somehow, I’d convinced myself that Samus had <em>already</em> done the Akira Slide; Vi-O-La was revealed way back in September, and she’s never had a motorbike before. What better way to introduce her fancy new gear than by doing something flashy with it? Yet <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4s-sweet-new-trailer-builds-the-hype-for-next-months-launch">this week’s ‘Survive’ trailer</a> (below) is the first time she’s done this.</p>
<p>From what we know about Prime 4, Samus is on a planet called Viewros, and she’s trying to escape. This trailer pits her against many unfamiliar creatures, aliens, and hulking foes, many of which are new to the Metroid series. And she’s ‘surviving’.</p>

<p>Actually, she looks like she’s kicking butt. Her Akira Slide towards the end, right before Sylux makes an appearance, establishes that. Samus is powerful. And while she might be caught out by Sylux’s entrance (at least, the reaction appears to be part of the same scene), she’s still largely in control. The shot frames her as ready to take action.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to deny that Samus is cool; she’s an icon in Nintendo’s storied history <em>and</em> an important female character and role model for girls, women, <em>anyone</em>. But Metroid is a series that I don’t define for its ‘coolness’. Yes, the power-ups and the upgrades offer a power fantasy that builds over the course of the game. But Metroid is the atmosphere, first and foremost. Even the Prime games.</p>

<p>They’re also pretty damn scary at times. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a> has some unsettling moments even outside of the stressful E.M.M.I. sequences. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> will forever be one of my favourite games because of the creepy hallways of Brinstar and Norfair, of watching Crocomire’s skin melt off in the lava and then getting jumpscared by the skeleton as it attempts to take your life one last time. Or Mother Brain not just being a brain, but some cybernetic alien dinosaur that very almost <em>does</em> kill you. And don’t even get me started on the Chozo Ghosts in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Prime</a>. Samus needs those moments of cool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Akira scared me as a kid; it’s still unsettling today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Metroid’s Akira Slide is actually the perfect comparison point to the original. Because, like Metroid, Akira’s ‘coolness’ isn’t the thing that sticks with me. The Akira Slide is simply one cool moment that takes place in the first five minutes of the movie, a film full of grotesque imagery, horrifying corruption, and child experiments, and (admittedly) a lot of cool moments.</p>
<p>What I remember is the cyberpunk scenery and atmosphere soaked in rust and neon and petrol, the biker gangs and violence, and the quite-honestly-terrifying body horror sequences towards the end. Akira scared me as a kid; it’s still unsettling today.</p>
<p>But the slide is important, because Kaneda is establishing himself in the movie; he <em>is</em> the one to beat, he <em>is</em> the 'hero', he <em>is</em> the character we’ll see the world through.</p>
<p>It also sets up tonal expectations that are later dashed. Is this a cool action movie? Sometimes! Will there be body horror? At this point, you have no idea. It pairs perfectly with Samus’ own power-versus-the-unknown.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b88c566a72bd4"><a title="No More Heroes 3 Key Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b88c566a72bd4/no-more-heroes-3-key-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>This looks familiar! — <em><span></span> Image: Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most of the time, though, the slide isn’t used in that way. Suda51's <strong>No More Heroes</strong> isn’t exactly known for subtlety, so when it slapped an <a href="https://youtu.be/g2nPg42xsXg?si=HJv09pA7jWj0nHZk&amp;t=300">Akira Slide at the end of a trailer for a fake TV show</a> promoting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_more_heroes_iii">No More Heroes III</a>, I wasn’t surprised. The whole point of these games is the ultraviolence, the silliness, the meta and pop culture references, the ‘coolness’ of them. Travis Touchdown also does the Akira Slide at the end of every Bike Mission.</p>
<p>But the world of No More Heroes is pretty messed up; in the third game, mega corporations build entire islands and murderous aliens create fake, murderous competitions based around becoming a superhero. We need that goofiness, that silliness, and those moments of coolness.</p>
<p>Square Enix also couldn’t help (be careful of spoilers here) <a href="https://youtu.be/-h3FewwJibU?si=vUemzZV8DKzb88Bf&amp;t=1314">putting the slide in</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, too, another game where light relief is always welcome. I won’t talk about it here, but the bike sequence from the original is a little more fleshed-out here with higher stakes. Cloud also <em>thinks</em> he’s cool, but my favourite defining trait of his? He’s actually a bit of a doofus, and that’s emphasised in Rebirth more. We’ll let him have the slide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, obviously, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzNCGrlDCAA">had to have the famous slide in it</a>, and it’s one of the ones you can actually do, too; V can bring their motorbike to a stop by angling it <em>just</em> right. Again, who needs brakes? Cyberpunk is one gigantic homage to the genre, so as one of the defining 'things' of anime cyberpunk, this was mandatory.</p>
<p>It’s also the only way any of us will be able to do the Akira Slide without causing a traffic accident in real life.</p>

<p>Whether it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBl5_2bzVp0">character introductions in fighting games</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter VI</a>) or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSLSkPzXdwo">skidding on ink</a> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>, the Akira Slide never fails to impress. Even when it’s not used in the exact same way as the original movie. It’s just a very smooth, stylish action that makes you look pretty darn smokin’</p>
<p>But it does go beyond coolness. Amidst chaos, amidst despair, and amidst the horrors of space, the Akira Slide is there to remind you that this character means business; they're a rebel with a cause, establishing their power or dominance in a single moment, like the modern-day (or futuristic) equivalent of drawing your sword at the start of a battle, or making eye-contact during a duel.</p>
<p>Nothing will stop anyone from making sure you — and your enemies — know who's in charge. Not even the laws of physics.</p>

<p>Give Chun-Li and Ken a new look</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following the arrival of Chun-Li in the SNK title <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/fatal_fury_city_of_the_wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</a> earlier this week, Capcom has released some free "special EX" colours for the same character (and the previous CotW DLC character, Ken) in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>This will change the colours of Outfit 1 on both characters. You can redeem these colours from the game's 'News' section in the 'Notices' menu and no code input is required. Here's a look:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Chun-Li's kicking into Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves! Celebrate her arrival with free special EX colors for Chun-Li and Ken's Outfit 1!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>Although Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves isn't available on the Switch 2, if you want a slice of SNK action, you can always check out the Terry and Mai DLC in Street Fighter 6, or perhaps even some of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-three-more-titles">SNK's past releases</a>.</p>

<p>Capcom also announced its new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ghosts_n_goblins">Ghosts 'n Goblins</a> collab this week. It includes another classic game to unlock and much more. And if you don't already own the latest entry in the Street Fighter series, the base game is currently <strong>50%</strong> off its regular price in select regions - bringing it down to <strong>£17.49 / $19.99</strong>. There's also a demo you can download from the eShop.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/report/816427/no-mans-sky-album-journeys-65daysofstatic</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/65daysofstatic%E2%80%99s-new-no-man%E2%80%99s-sky-album-searches-for-humanity-in-an-ai-filled-world.1348129/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s not often that a band returns to soundtrack the same game nine years after its release — then again, most games aren’t <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. Once demoed on <em>The Tonight Show</em> with Jimmy Fallon and at splashy E3 press conferences, in 2016, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> was heralded as gaming’s future. And it was all made possible by the procedural generation that spawned its vast, sci-fi universe.</p><p>Nearly a decade later, as post-rock band 65daysofstatic returns to re-score the ever-evolving game, generated content is no longer the exciting futurism it once seemed. With AI slop flooding social media and AI-generated bands sneaking their way onto Spotify, the tech that once powered gaming dreams is slowly becoming a dystopian nightmare.</p><p>“It’s just capitalism, isn’t it?” says 65daysofstatic’s Paul Wolinski. “It’s ruining everything. It’s all these CEOs who don’t understand the difference between art and content.”</p><p>That’s where <em>Journeys</em>, a defiantly human soundtrack that stands firmly against the rise of the music-generating machines, comes in. Working alongside Hello Games’ audio director, Paul Weir, Wolinski has spent the last year transforming a series of abstract, unreleased soundscapes into full-fledged songs. Once intended as pieces to be infinitely reassembled by <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s algorithm, the two Pauls strove to reimagine these ethereal bleeps and bloops into something that sounded altogether more human. The result is a 32-track, four-LP album that combines 65daysofstatic’s reworked soundscapes with original compositions from Weir.</p><p>“For this record, we were much more interested in turning all of that infinite stuff into something more intentional — something bespoke and artisan,” says Wolinski. Where the initial soundtrack <em>Music for an Infinite Universe</em>’s pounding drums and swelling guitars match the highs and lows of jetting off into space, <em>Journeys</em> is an altogether eerier creation, channeling the quiet sense of foreboding of arriving on an unknown planet, the initial score’s optimism replaced by a more unknowable reality.</p><p>“When we first started this, I assumed it would be just remixing our old selves,” says Wolinski, “but most of the soundscapes didn’t provide an origin point for an actual song at all… It was much harder, more mysterious.” Luckily, 65daysofstatic had an ethereal expert on hand: Weir.</p><div><p>“We were much more interested in turning all of that infinite stuff into something more intentional”</p></div><p>While the band went off experimenting with procedural generation in their audio / visual live shows, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> continued to grow and evolve, and it needed the music to match. “I didn’t want to sound like a fake 65daysofstatic, you know?” says Weir, as he sat at his synth, picking up where the band of static left off. “I’m a sound designer as much as a composer, and so that’s brought in quite a lot of abstraction into some music. There’s a lot of strange noises!”</p><p>As 65daysofstatic’s prog-laden epics combine with Weir’s synth-led ambience, the result is closer to a Philip Glass score than a noise-drenched post-rock record. It’s a marked evolution from what came before, one that matches <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s journey from rocky launch into the sprawling sci-fi epic that it is today. “It’s a funny old relationship,” reflects Weir, on working on the same game for 14 years. ”We’re both constantly going, ‘All right, enough already, time to move on!’ and then simultaneously delighted by its continued strength and success.”</p><p>It’s not just Hello Games who has enjoyed the fruits of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s success. Of 65daysofstatic’s top-played songs on Spotify, nine of them were written for the game. <em>No Man’s Sky</em> songs have become integral parts of 65daysofstatic live sets, these compositions living on outside of the game in a way soundtracks rarely do. “To us, it has always been a 65daysofstatic record as much as the <em>No Man’s Sky</em> score,” says Wolinski. “We’ve been lucky enough to be associated with a few big things in our career, but to be tied to something that has had such a massive cultural impact, it’s just a lovely feeling.”</p><p>Now with <em>Journeys</em> out in the wild, could 65daysofstatic and Weir perform the music live together? “We wouldn’t rule out potentially doing something on the 10th anniversary in some shape or form,” teases Weir.</p><p>Much like the vast transformation <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has undergone since launch, the world’s relationship with technology has completely changed since 2016. When Wolinski first learned about the possibilities of using procedural generation to rearrange music, he tells me it became something of an obsession, inspiring live-coded, improvised audio / visual tours for the band, 2019’s algorithmic album <em>Decomposition Theory</em>, and even a PhD. “<em>No Man’s Sky</em> definitely sent us off in this other direction,” smiles Wolinski. “And I’m really happy that it did.”</p><div><p>“Who cares if computers can make music? That’s not what music is.“</p></div><p>Yet in 2025, Wolinski believes generative tech’s name has been sullied by prompt-based dirge. “We came back to this project being very against the associations between generative systems and AI slop,” says Wolinski. “​​I think there’s a huge difference between that and <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s generative systems … Now it’s all about making more content to churn through, just to keep people’s attention for a few seconds. The whole thing is miserable.”</p><p>“With <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, it’s all our music, everything is handcrafted. The computer does not create anything — what it does do is rearrange it,” explains Weir. Despite the clear difference between an algorithm piecing together human-made music and one simply prompting it into existence, with hardworking human artists currently <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ai-band-inspired-by-holding-absence-overtakes-them-on-spotify-its-disheartening-its-insulting-its-a-wake-up-call-3896550">fending off impersonation from AI impostors,</a> the Pauls felt compelled to push back against computer-led composition.</p><p><em>Journeys</em>, then, is more than just an album; it’s humans taking a stand against the rise of the musical machines. “Who cares if computers can make music? That’s not what music is,” says Wolinski. “The moving of the speakers to generate sound waves is such a tiny part of what gives music meaning. It’s all about the social relations around [it], the human dialogue between one person and another, even if they never meet. This is what art is — and it’s why generative AI completely misses the point.”</p><p><sup><sub>Journeys<em> is out now on streaming platforms and </em><a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/products/no-mans-sky-journeys-exclusive-edition-deluxe-double-vinyl"><em>vinyl</em></a><em>.</em></sub></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjQ5Mjg4"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Regan</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/816427/no-mans-sky-album-journeys-65daysofstatic]]></content:encoded>

<p>That may not sound like a big deal for most players - there's no danger of it happening to me - but the cap also apparently applies when there's a double XP weekend, with one player reporting you can "hit that cap in just 4-5 hours of playing".</p><p>"In a $70 'AAA' game not a mobile free2play title you're being told how much fun you're allowed to have per day," wrote one player.

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-challenges-are-being-made-far-easier-following-intense-community-feedback">EA and Battlefield Studios made sweeping changes to challenges</a>, reducing the required milestones for class assignments, weapon assignments, gameplay and mastery assignments, and more. And last weekend, Battlefield 6 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-makes-temporary-adjustments-to-xp-earned-in-strikepoint-mode-to-maintain-fair-and-consistent-progression">"made some temporary adjustments" to XP</a> earned in Strikepoint as it works on "a longer-term solution". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-drops-a-new-relaxed-way-to-earn-xp-without-the-intensity-of-a-full-pvp-lobby">introduced a new "relaxed way" to play "while still earning progression and completing challenges"</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Lieutenant Titus from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> has become one of the most recognizable faces in all Warhammer 40,000 following the enormous success of the video game. We’ve already seen Games Workshop double-down on the Ultramarines hero with merch, an appearance in the Warhammer 40,000 episode of Amazon's animated anthology, Secret Level, and various cameos across the setting. But now things have leveled up — not just for Titus as a Space Marine, but his place in the ongoing Warhammer 40,000 narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, Games Workshop unveiled Captain Demetrian Titus, Master of the Watch, which means Titus has had a much-deserved promotion since the now canon events of Space Marine 2 and Secret Level. Titus is once again Captain of the Ultramarines Second Company, a position he had already held before he was taken into custody on suspicion of heresy by the Inquisition after the events of the first Space Marine game. What does Titus' promotion mean for Sevastus Acheran, the former captain of the Second Company and Master of the Watch who we see in Space Marine 2? Let’s be real here: he’s probably dead. I guess he couldn’t spare enough men.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Titus, his promotion comes with bigger and tougher responsibilities: he’s been put in charge of defending the Five Hundred Worlds of Ultramar, the realm of Space Marine poster boys, the Ultramarines. With Primarch Roboute Guilliman off gallivanting with his Indomitus Crusade, Titus is now in charge of keeping things safe and sound back home, where new Necron threats have emerged, as they always do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop released a new trailer, below, to hype up this narrative expansion, and it features Titus front and center as he accepts his new job title and what he calls his “impossible mission.” He’s had an eye-catching glow up since we last saw him, and he has a cool new model for use in the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game to boot. Titus is joined by friends his fans will know well: Ancient Gadriel from Space Marine 2, and Veteran Sergeant Metaurus from Secret Level (he lives!).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">500 Worlds: Titus is the name for the next major narrative expansion for Warhammer 40,000. According to a post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/fm2tm39s/world-championships-preview-captain-titus-battles-nekrosor-ammentar-for-the-five-hundred-worlds-of-ultramar/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, that includes a set of four books that will tell the story of the Ultramarian Reclamation and the embattled Vespator Front, where Titus and the Ultramarines Second Company "are locked in a desperate struggle against a Necron force rife with the Destroyer curse."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a big moment for Titus but also the Space Marine video game franchise. It is evidence of the importance of the character to Warhammer 40,000, and the seismic impact Space Marine 2 has had on the setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-developer-says-a-large-chunk-of-fans-have-assumptions-about-the-warhammer-40000-universe-that-are-not-correct-as-a-result-of-the-huge-success-of-the-game">Speaking to IGN at gamescom 2025</a>, Tim Willits, development chief at Saber Interactive, said Space Marine 2’s popularity had opened the door to the grimdark Warhammer 40,000 setting for an army of new fans who weren't necessarily clued up about the intricacies of the universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I heard that lots of people now think that Thousand Sons are the only Chaos faction because that's what we had in the game,” Willits said, reflecting on Space Marine 2’s first year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And so people are like, ‘Oh, I guess Thousand Sons, they're Chaos.’ It's like, ‘Actually no it's not.’ They're actually just a small faction. But people are just like, ‘That's the one I played against.’”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This assumption about Chaos extends to the Space Marines themselves. The Ultramaines — the chapter used by Games Workshop itself when introducing newcomers to the tabletop via starter sets — are the protagonists of the Space Marine 2 campaign, although many other factions are available to play as in the PvE and PvP modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“People have assumptions about the Warhammer 40,000 universe that are not correct,” Willits continued. “Like Thousand Sons being the only Chaos faction. That is kind of humorous. And like, ‘Oh Space Marines are only blue!’ That has been quite humorous to be honest, which is good for us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big questions going into the already confirmed Space Marine 3 is whether Saber will venture beyond the Ultramarines and the Thousand Sons in terms of the next campaign. The story seems to set up the addition of the Necrons, which at this point probably wouldn't come as much of a surprise for Space Marine 3. But could other Space Marine chapters also appear? Perhaps other Chaos factions, too? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-the-inquisition-watching-tight-lipped-saber-chief-wont-say-much-about-warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-but-he-has-revealed-games-workshop-is-offering-up-some-ideas-that-are-amazing"><u>We asked Willits about Space Marine 3, but he remained tight-lipped</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But now Titus is firmly back in the fold, we have to wonder, what does the overly suspicious Chaplain Leandros think? He spent pretty much the entirety of Space Marine 2 threatening to end poor Titus at the first sign of corruption, and even after Titus’ heroics, a commendation from Chapter Master Marneus Calgar, and what some think was a word of encouragement from the Emperor himself, Leandros remained unconvinced. If Titus manages to complete this impossible task and defend the 500 worlds, will he finally win Leandros over? Somehow I doubt it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this probably feeds into Space Marine 3 in some way. Assuming Space Marine 3 picks up after the events of 500 Worlds, we may well see Titus lead armies into battle, rather than a single squad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/skip-the-macbook-hp-15-inch-windows-11-laptop-dropped-77-and-its-a-no-brainer-2000642291</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skip-the-macbook-hp-15-inch-windows-11-laptop-dropped-77-and-it%E2%80%99s-a-no-brainer.1348084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people assume that they need to spend over a thousand dollars on a MacBook Air to get a decent laptop that will run everyday tasks smoothly. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5402/">HP 15.6″ laptop flips that assumption on its head by providing solid performance, a generous 16GB of RAM, and a massive 1TB SSD for just $599, down from $2,599</a>. That’s roughly half the price of Apple’s entry-level laptop but with more storage and a bigger screen. Suddenly, this becomes a no-brainer, based on what you actually get for your money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5402/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Performance That Covers All Your Bases</h2>
<p>The processor at the heart of this HP laptop is an <strong>Intel Core i3-N305 that runs at 1.8GHz, turbocharging at 3.8GHz</strong> when you need it to. This eight-core chip runs multiple browser tabs, video calls, document editing, and media streaming without choking or forcing you to wait. The 6MB cache memory makes it possible for the processor to access data sooner because such data has been previously accessed repeatedly, which means faster performance when switching between applications or loading up programs you use regularly.</p>
<p>That 16GB of DDR4 RAM makes all the difference in the usage of the laptop: The operating systems and web browsers of today are voracious devourers of memory, so with 16GB, you’ll be able to keep dozens of tabs open at the same time, run Microsoft Office apps, stream music, and handle video conferencing-all without lag. The 1TB PCIe SSD provides blazing-fast boot times and application launches while giving you enough room for years of documents, photos, and videos.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch FHD touch screen features a 1920 x 1080 resolution for crisp text and detailed images. The IPS panel technology keeps colors accurate and vibrant when you’re looking from an angle, which comes into play when sharing content with others or using the device in different positions. Coming with a screen brightness of 300 nits, you can comfortably use this without squinting at a screen that’s too dimly lit, in well-lit rooms or near windows.</p>
<p>Touch capability brings convenience for those kinds of actions that are just awkward on a trackpad: scrolling through long documents, zooming into images, and navigating <strong>Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface</strong> are all more intuitive when you can simply reach out and touch the screen. The anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections from overhead lights and windows to help save your eyes during long work sessions. The <strong>Intel UHD Graphics run video playback and light photo editing with ease</strong>, though you’ll want a dedicated GPU if you’re planning serious gaming or professional video work.</p>
<p>The USB Type-C port transfers data at 5Gbps to let you move large files to external drives in record time. Dual USB Type-A ports accommodate older peripherals-mice, keyboards, and external hard drives that haven’t made the jump to USB-C. An HDMI 1.4b port connects to an external monitor or TV for a dual-screen setup that’s pretty much a productivity necessity. Wi-Fi 6 delivers faster wireless speeds and better performance in crowded networks than earlier Wi-Fi standards, while Bluetooth 5.4 connects your wireless headphones, mice, and other accessories with improved range and stability.</p>
<p>For $599, you’re paying less than a quarter of the original $2,599 price, which is an absurd discount that puts this laptop within reach of buyers who think decent computing power requires a four-figure investment.</p>

<p>This week marks the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> on the Switch 2, and it's packed with a <em>huge</em> cast of characters.</p>
<p>As part of the Zelda Musou's recent launch, the voice actors of many of the characters have now been officially revealed. Fan site <a href="https://x.com/ZeldaUniverse/status/1986445762134155524">Zelda Universe</a> notes how there are a total of 34 English voice actors in this new entry.</p>
<p>This includes the return of Patricia Summersett as Zelda, and talent such as Matt Mercer (known for his role as Ganondorf). You may also recognise other voices like Joe Zieja, who also voiced Claude in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_three_houses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the full credits list, and below this are as many announcement messages as we could find on social media. These attach the name (and voice) to each character in the game.</p>

<h3>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Voice Actors:</h3>





















<p>If you're still not sure whether to check out this game, be sure to take a look at our review here on Nintendo Life. Here's a summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date."</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a showdown that lived up to its billing as the ‘Telecom War,’ T1emerged victorious over KT Rolster in the 2025 League of Legends World Championship Grand Final, held in Chengdu, China. The best-of-five series went the distance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-prediction-grand-final-t1-vs-kt-rolster/">as I predicted</a>, with T1 edging out KT Rolster 3 – 2 in one of the most thrilling finals in recent memory.</p>



<p>This marks history for T1, securing the third consecutive League of Legends World Championship title, pushing Faker ever deeper into the annals of League esports.</p>



<h2 id="h-t1-and-kt-rolster-secure-record-breaking-viewership">T1 and KT Rolster Secure Record-Breaking Viewership</h2>



<p>The matchup between T1 and KT Rolster wasn’t just a battle for the Summoner’s Cup; it was a clash of legacy. It was T1 attempting to further cement its place as the most remarkable esports organization in the world, and KT Rolster’s desire to make a name for itself by winning its first LoL Worlds trophy.</p>



<p>While T1 entered the finals as the defending champion, aiming for a three-peat, KT Rolster had reached the GF of Worlds for the first time after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kt-rolster-shatter-worlds-2025-finals-first-time/">decimating Gen.G</a>.</p>



<p>The tournament shattered viewership records, with the final match drawing millions of fans worldwide. T1’s quarter-final against Anyone’s Legend peaked at a whopping 3.27 million viewers, which made up a massive chunk of the 90.3 million watch hours recorded across the entire event.</p>



<p>There’s a reason why League Worlds is considered the most valuable esports tournament in the world.</p>



<p>Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok has had a stellar year thus far, but this latest win propels him even further into the record books. Alongside his squad, he’s cemented himself as the undisputed GOAT of esports.</p>



<p>With this win, T1 not only secures their fourth overall Worlds title but also becomes the first team with three consecutive wins, a record that might <strong>never be beaten </strong>for as long as League of Legends exists.</p>

<p>This is a wild one, folks</p>

<figure data-uuid="0a54ee38e4828"><a title="Dragon Power - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0a54ee38e4828/dragon-power-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello everyone, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Last week, we checked out the wonderful Animal Crossing: Wild World for the DS and, as expected, the western design won the day with a whopping 84%. Good effort Japan, but this one just ain't it.</p>
<p>This time, we're looking at <strong>Dragon Power</strong> for the NES. Released in 1988, this was a top-down adventure game not entirely unlike Zelda II, in which you would explore environments before shifting to a side-scrolling viewpoint when facing off against enemies. It's said to be based on the Chinese novel Journey to the West in which a kung-fu protagonist is on a quest to recover the Crystal Balls.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytPA87rC9nG4k" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fynipgj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>We've got North America, Europe, and Japan all vying for the prize today, so let's get cracking!</p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="d388c84d7aea5"><a title="Dragon Power US" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d388c84d7aea5/dragon-power-us.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169272-dragon-power">Bandai / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so this is very typical of those early NES box art designs, right? We've got the protagonist in the bottom left sporting a pretty large foot with teeny, tiny twinkle toes, while the background is mostly covered by a menacing green dragon. Doesn't it look a little familiar, though...?</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="765dbbe637db7"><a title="Dragon Ball JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/765dbbe637db7/dragon-ball-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169272-dragon-power">Bandai / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hahaaa, <em>yes</em>! Some of you might have already known, but Dragon Power in the US is actually a Dragon Ball game. Released in Japan as <strong>Dragon Ball: Shenlong no Nazo</strong> and in Europe as <strong>Dragon Ball: Le Secret du Dragon</strong>, the American design basically got rid of all references to the hit manga/anime series.</p>
<p>This cover art features the iconic Goku in the foreground with Bulma and Yamcha in the background, presumably either levitating or running atop the back of the dragon Shenron.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="80009f6568181"><a title="Dragon Ball EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/80009f6568181/dragon-ball-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169272-dragon-power">Bandai / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so Europe's design basically features the same artwork as Japan, but we've also got some character portraits in the bottom left, with everything surrounded by a pretty basic blue background. Japan and Europe also share the same art style for the title, and dare we say that North America's approach with this might be a tad better..?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How Ghost of Yōtei foreshadows a dark period in Japanese history]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/09/how-ghost-of-yotei-foreshadows-a-dark-period-in-japanese-history/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-foreshadows-a-dark-period-in-japanese-history.1348057/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After the stellar reception that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> received, you might have expected that the team at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sucker-punch-productions">Sucker Punch Productions</a> were ready to wade into the nation-spanning conflict that was the Sengoku Jidai. Instead, the developers chose a timeline and setting for Ghost of Yōtei that would skip the Warring States period, and it’s a choice that really worked to their advantage.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei transports players to Ezo, the northern island region of Japan which we now know as Hokkaido. Set three hundred years after the original game, the year is 1603: the same year that Tokugawa Ieyasu is appointed shogun, ushering in an era of peace and stability after centuries of infighting between powerful warlords. Dubbed the Edo period, this golden age in Japanese history would last for more than 250 years, prior to The Meiji Restoration of 1868 and the end to the isolationism that kept Western influences at bay that this brought.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sLcksHR30UA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In 1603, our protagonist, Atsu, returns to her homeland in the shadow of the towering Mount Yōtei. At this time in history, Ezo wasn’t formally a part of Japan, and existed as a wild frontier beyond the reach of the emerging Tokugawa shogunate. It’s been sixteen years since Atsu was last here. Sixteen years since she was left for dead after a band of ronin slew her family forcing her to flee south where she became a sword for hire, fighting in the peasant infantry that lost the Battle of Sekigahara.</p>
<p>Left unchallenged, the rogue samurai known as The Yōtei Six have now established themselves as a formidable faction in Ezo, exploiting the native people and crushing any who oppose them. That’s until Atsu shows up of course, vowing to hunt down the outlaws who slew her parents and brother. She’s not the only one who has these ronin in her crosshairs: among the rebellious cast of companions that accompany Atsu, there is also the Matsumae clan.</p>

<p>Descendants of the Takeda, one of the big players during the Sengoku period, the Matsumae were considered the northern gatekeepers of Japan, establishing a stronghold in southern Ezo. From here, they began to exert their influence by forging political alliances with the indigenous Ainu people, whose descendants had occupied the land for many centuries.</p>

<p>With their own language, societal structure, and deeply spiritual beliefs, there was always going to be a culture clash between the semi-nomadic Ainu and their Matsumae neighbours. In <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, players are presented with a thoughtful insight into Ainu life when Atsu visits the many kotans (villages) spread across Ezo, learning more about their way of life. From their rituals and crafts to their gathering-focused economy, every aspect of Ainu life is conducted in a way that harmonises with the natural world, which they believe is governed by spirits known as the Kamuy. During her time with the Ainu, Atsu tracks a band of thieves who turn out to be a family stealing clothes and food for their newborn. Instead of punishing them, the villagers welcome them into their egalitarian community with open arms. Atsu also rescues an orphaned bear cub which the kotan raises as their own, promising to later kill the animal in an “iomante” ritual, honouring the bear by releasing its divine spirit back to the kamuy world.</p>
<p>Not all Ainu practices are compatible with our own sensibilities, yet there’s a wholesome spirituality there – something that the growing number of southern settlers would soon exploit. Over time, the native peoples of Ezo would become more reliant on trade with the Matsumae, exchanging natural goods such as fish and furs for sake, tools, and cloth. Predictably, as their reliance on this trade deepened, the Matsumae took the opportunity to drive up prices, unfairly tipping the scales in what was once a mutually balanced relationship. Those colonising tendrils continued to unfurl and squeeze the Ainu when the mainlanders began to eye Ezo’s rich natural resources, competing with their fisheries, and descending on the region’s lucrative gold mines.</p>
<p>In Ghost of Yōtei, we don’t get to see the full extent of this exploitation, though it’s clear that many of the Ainu are concerned about losing their autonomy and way of life as the shadow of the shogunate spreads further across their ancestral lands. One interesting example of this comes early on in-game when the Matsumae employ Atsu to guard the construction of a bridge. She discovers that the seemingly peaceful Ainu are responsible, not a group of marauding bandits. Despite the progress that infrastructure such as roads and bridges will bring to Ezo, not all of its inhabitants are willing to let the samurai extend their foothold.</p>

<p>Even when the disparate Ainu tribes united, they ultimately couldn’t prevent the steady advance of their occupiers. The Matsumae didn’t relent in squeezing them further, even driving some tribes to the brink of starvation, until they had no other option but to revolt. In 1669 the Ainu chieftain, Shakushain, led an armed rebellion that initially succeeded in driving back the Matsumae, who were severely outnumbered even if they were more technologically advanced.</p>
<p>This rebellion threatened the shogunate’s rule over Ezo. In response, several neighbouring samurai clans swiftly attacked and snuffed out the resistance, executing Shakushain and accelerating the subjugation of the Ainu. Forced to sign a peace treaty, tribe leaders were truly powerless as the Matsumae freely established more trading posts, inflating prices and tightening their economic chokehold.</p>

<p>Much later, during the Meiji Restoration (which saw Japan return to imperial rule after dissolving the shogunate) Ezo would be formally annexed, thereafter known as Hokkaido. This was part of Japan’s modern movement towards shedding dogmatic isolationist policies and fully embracing industrialisation. Needless to say, this didn’t improve the Ainu’s standing in Japanese society. Adopting a similar approach to the United States, the native Ainu were forcibly expelled from their homeland to make way for settlers, with those who remained forced to assimilate and denied the right to speak their ancestral language.</p>
<p>Again, we only see the seeds of this travesty begin to take root in Ghost of Yōtei. But behind Atsu’s katana-waving quest for revenge there’s plenty of foreshadowing that makes the game’s setting far more interesting than another spin on the Sengoku Jidai. Much like its predecessor, the sequel hones in on a fascinating historical flashpoint where the setting becomes the main character, portraying the samurai as complex and nuanced instead of idly romanticising them.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-return-dying-light-2-updates-community-what-next/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/techland-returns-to-dying-light-2-updates-and-asks-the-community-what%E2%80%99s-next.1348051/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Now that Dying Light: The Beast has been on the market for several weeks, Techland has reorganized its developers and intends to get back on the Dying Light 2: Stay Human train. In a post on social media, franchise director Tymon Smektala asked the community what it would like to see prioritized in the coming months, suggesting that at least half a year of content is planned.</p>



<p>This was always on the cards, as Techland stressed that Dying Light: The Beast represented an important stopgap in the ongoing support of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, the live-service title that debuted in 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-dying-light-2-stay-human">What’s Next for Dying Light 2: Stay Human?</h2>



<p>The post on social media published by Techland’s franchise director of Dying Light has exciting implications for Dying Light 2: Stay Human, the live-service, open-world zombie apocalypse title that dropped in 2022.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As The Beast was released we can now move more people to support DL2:SH as promised. What are the most important things we should handle? What kind of content/updates/fixes you’d expect right<br>now or in 3-6 months?</p>— Tymon Smektała (@smektalaTM) <a href="https://twitter.com/smektalaTM/status/1987249247402578122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In a community-led decision, Techland has opted to have fans decide what comes next, with Smektala reaching out to the players to see what they’d like prioritized. Techland has always been focused on the community with Dying Light, and hosts a submissions function on the game’s themed website that users can lean on to make their requests and wishes heard.</p>



<p>The Dying Light series has plenty left in the tank. Following the launch of Dying Light: The Beast, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-dying-light-3/">a new era of sorts was established</a>, and the game’s ending directly links to future projects that can easily be predicted. With a universe that still has plenty to give, there’s no telling where the road will eventually take Dying Light.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see more Dying Light 2: Stay Human content? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-9-882/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-882-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-sunday-november-9.1348039/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another week comes to a close, and I’m hopeful that your NYT Connections streak has kept up for the duration. I’m also optimistic that I’ve <strong>helped you </strong>maintain that streak by providing you with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions all week long. If you want more of that today, read on.</p>



<p>Today’s NYT Connections tips and solutions are waiting just below.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-9">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 9)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #882:</p>



<ul>
<li>NOODLE</li>



<li>BRUSH</li>



<li>CRANIUM</li>



<li>MIRROR</li>



<li>PUFNSTUF</li>



<li>REFLECT</li>



<li>TIGHT</li>



<li>MUSE</li>



<li>COMPACT</li>



<li>LUNAR</li>



<li>NAIL FILE</li>



<li>THICK</li>



<li>DENSE</li>



<li>DELIBERATE</li>



<li>CRONUT</li>



<li>TWEEZERS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think beauty tools or grooming essentials you might stash in a makeup bag or bathroom drawer.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These words all describe things that are tightly arranged, thickly clustered, or densely filled</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each of these verbs evokes contemplation, pondering, or mental wandering—perfect for a philosophical mood.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>This group blends real and invented terms that share a playful, oddball vibe—some are names, some are snacks, some are just fun to say.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 9.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

<p>ARC Raiders continues to take the world by storm, this time generating a new all-time high peak player count record on Steam more than a week after release. It’s proving to be the most sensational title to hit the market in years, and everyone from casual gamers to hardcore extraction shooter fans is getting involved.</p>



<p>On Steam, ARC Raiders just hit 416,517 concurrent players, up from the recent high of 354,000. It’s indicative of something remarkable, as ten days into the game’s lifecycle, it’s bucking trends and continuing to soar.</p>







<p>In the numbers, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/">the reviews</a>, and the ratings, ARC Raiders is the most popular extraction shooter ever made. The sentiment surrounding this game is enough to throw the likes of Escape from Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown, Arena Breakout: Infinite, and Delta Force out the window entirely.</p>



<p>People are soaking up every element of ARC Raiders, from the aesthetic that’s dripping in retro-futurism to the social mechanics that are making ARC Raiders a joy to explore.</p>



<p>On Steam, ARC Raiders just hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-hit-new-peak-player-count-broke-servers/">another all-time high</a> peak concurrent user count, which is rare considering the game has been out for <strong>ten days</strong>. In most cases, games start to inevitably ebb in terms of player count at this point, but ARC Raiders is <strong>evolving</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>What’s more impressive is that it’s only getting better. Embark Studios has lined up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-2025-roadmap/">a roadmap of content</a> and upgrades that it’ll drip feed into ARC Raiders, and the team wants to support the ambitious extraction shooter for a whopping <strong>ten years</strong>.</p>



<p>Things could take a bit of a dip this coming week, as Escape from Tarkov, arguably the most prolific spearhead extraction shooter ever made, finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">hits a 1.0 release</a> and emerges on new platforms, namely Steam. If anything can poach players from ARC Raiders, it’ll be that, so it’ll be interesting to see what loyalty ARC players have stumped up in the short term.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Global Test Ride is currently taking place this weekend, and it looks like the game engine it's running on might have been uncovered.</p>
<p>It's Bandai Namco's new in-house engine SOL-AVES. Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1or8w63/kirby_air_riders_appears_to_run_on_the_solaves/">some detective work</a>, the engine's logo has been spotted in the game demo's Intellectual Property Notices. We've taken a look ourselves and can confirm it's listed. The <a href="https://www.trademarkia.com/sol-aves-79369433">trademark for this engine</a> was filed in "late 2024", but it's apparently been in the making since around 2019, and was <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namco-is-still-working-on-new-in-house-game-engine-update-reveals/">initially revealed in 2022</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytWA6pqBIEskk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Recruitment and training for the engine is supposedly ongoing, and its first major public test appears to be this new title by legendary game director Masahiro Sakurai. Below you can see new engineers testing it out. This new game engine has also previously <a href="https://bandainamcostudios.snar.jp/jobboard/detail.aspx?id=bew5uZn3nmm_5RVLIxMdPg">shown up on Bandai Namco's official website</a> in job listings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bandai Namco Studios develops its own in-house game engine. As part of their training, new engineers had the opportunity to try out our in-house developed game engine! During the training, after learning the basic operations, the participants created a simple game. The ease of use of the in-house game engine has been very well received."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the past, Bandai Namco has made use of video game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine for major releases.</p>
