            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-assassins-creed-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-games-in-order">Assassin's Creed series</a> has had us globetrotting through history since its debut in 2007. From Renaissance Italy to Ancient Greece, Ubisoft's open world series has explored a wonderful variety of locations and settings, ensuring each conspiracy-packed game is a (semi) educational window into the past. Such an approach has made the series unique among its genre stablemates, which tend to whisk us away to fantasy lands or sprawling modern-day metropolises. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the bones of Assassin's Creed have mostly remained the same across its 14 mainline entries, the series has undergone a lot of changes over the years, including new takes on player progression and ever-expanding worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But which Assassin's Creed games are the best of the bunch? It's a tough question. After much deliberation (and only a handful of arguments), though, we’ve eventually agreed on the top 10 mainline entries in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, without further ado, here are our top 10 Assassin’s Creed games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Assassin's Creed Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Playing the latest game in the series? Check out our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/assassins-creed-shadows"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows guide</em></a><em>. </em></p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Assassin's Creed: Revelations</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2011/06/06/assassins-creed-revelations-20110606095314825-3464823.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-revelations">Assassin’s Creed: Revelations</a> wrapped up Altair Ibn-La-Ahad and Ezio Auditore’s stories, and, despite some unremarkable additions like the Den Defense mode, it was a memorable and thrilling send off. From flying down ziplines in Constantinople to hanging out with Leonardo Da Vinci, Revelations was packed full of fascinating adventures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ezio and Altair’s final chapter was, in a way, both a sign of things to come and a celebration of what came before. Not only did we get one final fling with these two after seeing them grow and learn from lives full of adventure, but we had a chance to say goodbye to the first era of Assassin’s Creed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Assassin's Creed Syndicate</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/09/24/acssc63previewsasylumzipline1443101428jpg-9b2cc6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin’s Creed games are often as defined by their locations as they are their protagonists, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a>’s 19th Century Victorian London in the throes of industrialization may be the most memorable of the bunch. Sneaking around factories, racing horse-drawn carriages down the street, and even fighting Jack the Ripper all ground Syndicate in a setting that, while still fantastical, feels real.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Contributing to this sense of place is the string-heavy score from Journey composer Austin Wintory that doesn’t sound like anything else in the series before or after: dueling protagonists Jacob and Evie Fry even have their own soundtracks. It’s a small touch, but it’s one in a string of small touches that makes Syndicate’s world cohesive. Also, it’s hard to recall any game this side of Bloodborne that lets you fight this effectively with a cane.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Assassin's Creed Valhalla</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/12/01/assassinscreedvalhallafinalcontent-blog-1669914922538.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> didn’t reinvent the wheel like Origins did, but it did make some pretty substantial changes. Combat is weightier and more impactful than ever before; traditional side quests have been replaced by world events, making exploration and discovery much more organic; and the absurd amount of loot you’d have to organize and sift through was toned down substantially, making rewards feel much more valuable on the whole.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eivor might not be our favorite of the Assassin’s Creed protagonists, but her (or his) story is an engaging one, and is one of the best blendings of historical fantasy and mythology that the series has ever seen. Fans of Norse mythology are treated with a feast; not only do the sagas play a major role within the main campaign, but an entire game-length expansion set in the world of Thor and Odin practically turns Valhalla into a cousin of God of War. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-c79ca0fa59bedea20c24e2ac0c2735e7ce2f3ae6-1920x1080-1739442669756.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-brotherhood">Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood</a> continues the story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, cementing him as a fan-favorite protagonist for the series. It trades the diverse locations of Assassin’s Creed 2 for an expanded version of Rome and its surrounding countryside and builds on the new mechanics introduced in Assassins Creed 2 – swimming, property management, firearms, and recruitable allies. This chapter of Ezio’s story is filled with charm, wit, and drama, and, thanks to its updated combat, we got to be the aggressive combat assassin we all wanted to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also the first game in the series to introduce multiplayer, allowing players to step into the shoes of the Templars to see who among their friends truly was the best assassin or hunter. It may not have advanced the formula as much as its predecessor, but it’s still cherished by many as one of the very best. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Assassin's Creed Origins</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-1a0ab42e93e51c48ad9a6bda7f408958e09a43b0-1920x1080-1739443042212.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Origins marked a turning point in the series. It was the game that turned Assassin’s Creed from a stealth-focused action-adventure, into a straight-up open world RPG with a size and scope rivaled only by very few games. But even setting the historical significance of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin’s Creed Origins</a> aside, it’s important to note that it’s also just a damn good Assassin’s Creed game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its central story involving Bayek and Aya, who initially set out to find justice for their murdered son and ultimately wind up founding the order that would eventually become the Assassin’s Brotherhood, is extremely compelling; the world of ancient Egypt is a marvel to explore; and while many facets of its mechanics were improved in later games, the shift to loot-based progression and a more action <a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-rpgs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPG</a> style of combat was just the kind of shot in the arm that the series needed to reinvigorate it in the eyes of fans.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Assassin's Creed Unity</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/06/09/acuscreencombatsworde31406094pmpst1402143761jpg-b685a9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After the tipsy sway of Black Flag’s pirate protagonist Edward Kenway, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin’s Creed Unity</a> was a return to the tone of original Assassin’s Creed. As the first AC game to be exclusively released on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (alongside PC of course), Assassin’s Creed Unity was a graphical powerhouse for its time, boasting enormous crowds of NPCs walking through the streets of a near 1:1 accurate recreation of Paris. Even today, it’s still remarkably handsome to look at.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Unity’s launch was a bit of a bumpy ride. A cavalcade of bugs, glitches, and an intensely overburdened map meant it was quickly written off by many. However, in the years since it has (thanks to several patches) blossomed into a firm favourite among Assassin’s Creed fans. Its enhanced movement system resulted in arguably the most fluid and elegant parkour the series has ever seen, which in turn allowed for excellent hit-and-run tactics. Its main assassination missions are also a series highpoint, offering a multitude of ways to infiltrate locations and bury your blade deep in a target’s neck. And frankly, seeing Notre Dame in all its glory makes AC Unity well worth the price of admission.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Assassin's Creed Shadows</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/19/acs-1742375176700.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Feudal Japan is the most-requested setting for an Assassin’s Creed game of all time, and so Ubisoft faced towering expectations when it finally decided to visit the Sengoku period. Thankfully, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> was exactly what the series needed; it brings the focus back to assassinations, putting increased emphasis on stealth and infiltration. And while still expansive, the open world and RPG elements are more restrained than those in Odyssey and Valhalla, resulting in a tighter, more balanced experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first time since Syndicate, Shadows features two playable protagonists. Naoe’s toolkit is rooted in stealth, while Yasuke is a brutal fighter who captures the period’s samurai fantasy. While Shadows is best experienced from a mix of both perspectives, taking control of Naoe and making use of her grappling hook and climbing abilities allows you the full freedom to explore what is undoubtedly the series’ most astonishing world, complete with landscapes that dynamically change with the shifting of the seasons. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Assassin's Creed Odyssey</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-16fc551879ac299dca68839da90f89d9e624db48-1920x1080-1739442948351.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassins’ Creed Odyssey</a> takes Origins’ combat style and new-found focus on role-playing, adds some extra ingredients to the mix, then sets it all against the sprawling backdrop of Ancient Greece, aflame with the war between Athens and Sparta. It’s an enormous, vibrant game, with some of the most stunning vistas we’ve seen in the series; both at land and sea (naval warfare returns here, and it’s wonderful). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new spin on Assassin’s Creed’s notoriety system sees you hunted across these environments, in a series of cat-and-mouse chases that are the most tense in any Assassin’s Creed to date, while the nation struggle system sees you fighting large scale battles in the name of Athens or Sparta. It’s also got a relatively compelling story for a game that can take 60-odd hours to beat, with some eccentric sidequests, fronted by a genuinely charismatic protagonist - whether you play as a male or female. Even after you finish Odyssey, there’s still so much to plunder and discover, and it’s a delight to simply exist in its world.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Assassin's Creed 2</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-d3967a58038cc5e59332bb0043ab1ca343112bc6-1920x1080-1739442866992.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, we have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-ii">Assassin’s Creed 2</a> to thank for not only proving the formula works but for also giving us the defining analogy of a video game sequel fulfilling the promise of its underwhelming original. Though later entries would add even more depth, ACII made assassination missions more dynamic, with increased flexibility in how you approached objectives, more options for hiding or causing distractions, better combat, and better mobility with the ability to actually swim. New catacomb missions let players put their parkour skills to the test, the upgradeable homebase villa gave players a reason to keep investing in picking up collectibles and coins, and new weapons and gear from everyone’s favorite video game character, Leonardo da Vinci, kept gameplay fresh. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these changes were also connected to a beautifully realized Italian Renaissance era that introduced an all-time protagonist, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, and meaningful additions to the current-day story that brought the two time periods together in the wildest way possible. I mean, you fistfight the pope only to have an otherworldly deity speak through Ezio to Desmond in the present day. It was an unforgettable ending to an entry that proved how incredible Assassin’s Creed could be. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/12/10/ac4bfdlc12500x1400jpg-885d49.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After a long run of assassin protagonists, Black Flag tried something different, introducing us to a main character who was a pirate first, and an assassin second - and the ensuing adventure thrived because of it. It introduced a massively entertaining sandbox playground in the Caribbean, featuring a plethora of islands teeming with treasure and activities to embark upon - and an upgrade system that made the idea of hunting wild animals and harpooning something other than a chore. Instead of relegating the idea of sailing as means to an end, it built upon the framework of Assassin’s Creed 3’s naval combat to make nautical adventures the shining point of Black Flag. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it was hunting hapless merchant ships or bracing against some of the toughest buccaneers ever to sail the seas, attacking other ships cemented itself as something too good to pass up any time one floated by on screen. Aided by its impressive seamless transition from land to sea, it allowed the freedom of choice for players to either sail circles around enemy ships while blasting them to pieces, or ramming head on to leap onto the enemy ship, before unloading a brace of pistols like a whirling dervish. Not only did <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-black-flag">Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag</a> cement itself as one of the greatest in the series, it has easily become one of the greatest pirate games to immerse yourself in as well.</p><div id="every-assassins-creed-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Assassin's Creed Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Assassin's Creed Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>You may also like: The </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-games-like-assassins-creed"><em>Best Games Like Assassin's Creed</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it!

                <p>One of Valve's most popular games, 1998's Half-Life, could have been the one and only game the company ever released, until a deal was struck that changed the company's fate forever. Monica Harrington, Valve's first chief marketing officer, said at the Game Developers Conference that publisher Sierra had the option for two more games, and after the first Half-Life became a gigantic success, Valve attempted to renegotiate with Sierra.</p><p>The terms of the deal, Harrington said, was that Valve would fund all but $1 million of the development costs of Half-Life's sequels, with Sierra retaining IP rights and giving Valve back 15% of revenue. "It felt insane," Harrington said, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/valve-would-never-ship-another-game-former-exec-forced-half-life-publishers-hand-by-saying-gabe-newell-and-the-team-would-pivot-away-from-game-dev/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Harrington said that if she and her husband Mike Harrington were to make real money out of being co-owners of Valve at the time, she knew Valve's prospects had to be "much, much brighter," and that included renegotiating with Sierra.</p><p>After getting the OK from Valve co-founder Gabe Newell, Harrington worked with Valve's attorney to hammer out a strategy for getting Half-Life's IP rights back, for the original Half-Life and all future titles. But how?</p><p>Harrington said she pushed for Valve and Sierra to strike a deal with the threat that Valve would abandon making games altogether if Sierra didn't come to the table. "Valve would never ship another game," Harrington recalled of the bargaining tactic.</p><p>"It wasn't an idle threat--we weren't going to take on all of the risk to make other people rich," Harrington said. "Besides, I knew Gabe had interesting ideas that had nothing to do with games."</p><p>One of those ideas was for Valve to create an <a href="https://medium.com/@monicah428/the-early-days-of-valve-from-a-woman-inside-bf80c6b47961" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"online entertainment platform" with Amazon</a>, but this fell through. In the end, Valve won back control of the Half-Life series from Sierra. Valve went to release Half-Life 2 in 2004 and later the VR title Half-Life: Alyx in 2020--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2020-half-life-alyx/1100-6485617/" data-ref-id="1100-6485617">that game won GameSpot's Game of the Year</a>. Valve's massively popular Counter-Strike series also traces its roots back to Half-Life, originating as a mod for that game.</p><p>Valve is much more than a game developer today, as it owns and operates the massively popular PC game store Steam. Companies have attempted to buy Valve over the years, but the company remains independent. Newell, for his part, has become a billionaire and now <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-luxury-yachts.php" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">owns a half-dozen yachts that are valued at over $1 billion.</a></p><p>One criticism of Valve today is that the company no longer releases many games, instead focusing more on Steam and hardware with its Steam Deck. It does have more games in the works, though, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-finally-acknowledges-deadlock-a-new-game-people-have-been-playing-for-months/1100-6526115/" data-ref-id="1100-6526115">including a 6v6 MOBA called Deadlock.</a> There is still no word on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/half-life-3/">Half-Life 3</a>, however.</p>

As the sun begins peeking between the clouds, the snow on the ground begins to disappear.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-making-assassin-s-creed-shadows-strengthened-ubisoft-s-process-for-bringing-history-to-life<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Assassin's Creed series is commonly praised for its stealth-action gameplay and iconic protagonists, but it would be fair to say that its greatest achievements lie in recreating sprawling historical settings for open-world exploration. Nearly 20 years since its debut, Ubisoft is now taking the series to historical Japan with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">It's a setting that many fans of the series have wanted to see, and currently enjoying increased popularity due to FX's recent tv series Shogun.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the historical setting of Japan has been the subject of many games, particularly the likes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, seeing it through the lens of Assassin's Creed is interesting. After all, this is a series that blends historical political conflicts with sci-fi and action-laden twists and the approach lends an opportunity to spotlight some often understated elements the history and politics of the era, while also reveling in the series' style of stealth gameplay and open world action.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though the shift to historical Japan seemed like an obvious turn for the series (ninjas seem like a natural fit for the Order of Assassins), the developers at Ubisoft Quebec expressed that—just like previous entries—bringing the series to Japan required education and a need to highlight different perspectives of the era.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential" target="_self" data-discover="true">'It's okay to make a small game:' Astro Bot director Nicolas Doucet says tiny ideas contain huge potential</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking with creative director Jonathan Dumont during a visit to Ubisoft Quebec in early 2025, he explained what drew the team to the setting, given it was historical period of great change.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why Assassin's Creed finally went to Japan">Why Assassin's Creed finally went to Japan</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The series featured multiple protagonists for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Syndicate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Odyssey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valhalla</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">goes about it differently by focusing on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-dual-protagonists-of-assassin-s-creed-shadows-enabled-the-series-jump-to-feudal-japan">two unique characters</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with different gameplay styles and different perspectives on the changing era of Japan. The main narrative centers on the historical African samurai Yasuke (played by Tongayi Chirisa) and his new life in Japan, and Naoe (played by Masumi Tsunoda), a female ninja seeking to live up to her family's legacy to seek revenge, all set against the backdrop of the growing conflicts of the Sengoku period, with historical figures such as Oda Nobunaga, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and outside Western influences paving the way for radical change in Japan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You always try to look for the thing that grabs you as a creator. For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we chose Greece because we found the pull was the philosophy of that time, and that it was an era where that departed the land of myths to an age of reasoning with people like Socrates becoming more known," said the creative director. "So with Japan, what interested us was the nuance of the era's communities and the different sides of everything. It was a morally grey time period and the start of a global conflict in Japan as Western nations were coming to the country during that era of unification."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Dumont, some of the reasons why Ubisoft hadn't made an Assassin's Creed game set in Japan sooner were timing, developer availability, and limitations of the tech to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="http://gamedeveloper.com/programming/7-how-assassin-s-creed-shadows-makes-environments-look-great-up-close-and-at-a-distance">fully realize feudal Japan's architecture and surrounding wilderness</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that changes with in-game seasons. With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the developers not only saw an opportunity for the series to spotlight this era of Japan, but also showcase the atmosphere and changing culture of a country after the Western world cast its sights on it—all honed through the lens of Assassin's Creed and its focus on history's secret assassins.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This setting was such a pivotal time in Japan's history, and the country became a melting pot, and life changed so dramatically during these 30 years of unification," said the creative director. "Cities were being built around castles, the samurai went from being guardians protecting [rural property] to becoming now centered around the city, and it also led to urbanization—like commerce changed quite a bit because there was such a demand at war, and so the merchants at that time became very rich, and they climbed the social ladder. All that made it such an interesting era to explore for Assassin's Creed."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-civilization-vii-s-powerful-narrative-system-helps-players-experience-unique-parts-of-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Civilization VII's powerful narrative system helps players experience unique parts of history</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This aspect of cultural change and exchange is reflected in Yasuke's story, one of the central characters of Shadows and the series' first protagonist based on a real person. During the game's prologue, players see him as an enslaved person brought to Japan by Jesuit missionaries, and on the opening walk to Oda Nobunaga's compound, citizens view him as a curiosity and comment on his black skin. After meeting with the feudal lord, Yasuke eventually begins a new life in Japan and trains as a samurai under Nobunaga, which sets him on a path to partnership with Naoe as they navigate 15th-century Japan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, Yasuke's appearance has garnered attention from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yves-guillemot-denounces-assassin-s-creed-shadows-racist-malicious-backlash">certain corners of the internet</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> who neither appreciate his inclusion as a protagonist in the game nor his place in real history— despite the fact that he's already appeared in other games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nioh </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Samurai Warriors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. What this inherently racist criticism from these communities fails to consider is that Yasuke's place during this time period makes a compelling case for him as a protagonist and puts him very much in line with Assassin's Creed's focus on the strange, secret history of humanity.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ubisoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moreover, the developers felt Yasuke's experience as a foreigner in Japan would allow a global audience of players to see themselves in his journey as he immerses himself in the culture of the country.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This approach has precedent in the realm of popular fiction. James Clavell's 1975 book Shogun and the 2024 TV series of the same name introduce the fictional British sailor John Blackthorne (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Adams_(samurai)">himself based on historical figure William Adams</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) as an audience point-of-view character.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Becoming students of history">Becoming students of history</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One particular detail that Dumont highlighted during the production was that Yasuke actor Tongayi Chirisa embodied the kind of mindset that they wanted for the character, possessing an open mind and a "student's mentality." This was the kind of aspect that they wanted for the character, but also a perspective that he wanted the developers to have as well when trying to develop Japan for AC.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I always think of making games like these as going back to school; you have to go back to the learning process—you look back on what you know, then look at what you're learning, and then compare that to what's out there in pop culture," said Dumont. "So it's really about being students ourselves, trying to learn as much as possible and being humble about it. It can be difficult to portray somebody else's culture, so you try to have a lot of people who can inform you or help you make the right choices. Traveling to Japan was awesome, working with the specialists was great, and all that changed how we viewed the setting and how we developed it as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alongside Yasuke is Naoe, the second playable protagonist who focuses on stealth gameplay and the traditional 'assassin' experience. In a way, Naoe is an outsider like Yasuke, and her experience represents the spiritual and emotional element of the game that highlights the harmony between nature and humanity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of Naoe's side activities hidden throughout the open world are meditation rituals, which open up side missions to see her growth as a ninja from her father's training. One major activity that players can engage in is the town builder, an Animal Crossing-style mode focusing on building a community of allies and creating a town of your own. In this way, players will be able to see the details of the architecture and culture of the time, as well as how people find unity during difficult times.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ubisoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Working on this game completely changes how we perceive architecture, and how much nature and humanity are linked together in harmony in Japan," said Dumont. "When you go into temples and shrines and the wilderness, it's very clear that there's a strong connection with everything. We didn't understand at the start of this project, but as we did our research in Japan, we realized we needed to focus more on that. So, looking at everything, we were like, "Oh yeah, okay! We need to spend more time on that," and it's made our experience all the better."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a clear shift away from 2020's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valhalla</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">focuses on a more tightly designed world, which aims to put a clear spotlight on a period of Japan that's opening itself up to the larger world and how the protagonists build up a community. According to Dumont, this all taps into the game's core themes of unity and community, which he says is "the importance of taking care of each other."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does focus on the traditional AC style of experience where players engage in brutal combat, pull off assassinations of key targets, and parkour across an open-world during a chaotic period, the deep historical research creates a surprisingly inviting and wholesome tone, one that breaks new ground in the world of games inspired by the dramatic history of Feudal Japan.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

We’re talking Scarlet and Violet era stuff, Sword and Shield throwbacks, and boxes that were basically extinct six months ago.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article"> Amazon International Solves Pokémon TCG Shortage With Massive Restocks</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the kind of flood the TCG community needed.

Whereas most games that release in early access could potentially be there for months or years, Netmarble says in the game's FAQ it expects Game of Thrones: Kingsroad to be in early access for a "minimum of four weeks," after which it will be free-to-play.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC-eVMvcRBQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hC-eVMvcRBQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">During the early access period not all of the game will be available, though players will be able to explore the Northern regions of Westeros, encounter characters like Jon Snow, visit several major cities, complete various side quests, participate in co-op dungeons, and complete 50 chapters of the main storyline. Game of Thrones: Kingsroad's full free-to-play launch will include more regions to explore, additional co-op dungeons, and more. Netmarble states more regions and challenges will be added post-launch.</p><p dir="ltr">To gain early access, players will need to purchase a Founder's Pack. The cheapest one is $25 and comes with a cosmetic "Northern" outfit, a Jon Snow emoji pack, and 350 of the game's Iron Mark currency. A $50 Founder's Pack nets owners the same plus the game's premium battle pass, additional outfits, horse mounts, a founder's title, and more currencies.

If the thrill of bopping <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' base game menagerie is starting to fade, you'll no doubt be wanting to know what's next for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Capcom's latest mega-hit</a>. And following a couple of previous teases, the publisher has now confirmed it'll be fully detailing Wilds' first major content update next Tuesday, 25th March.
</p>
<p>
Capcom's latest Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase - the first since last month's launch - begins at 2pm in the UK/7am PT <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/monsterhunter">over on Twitch</a>. It'll be hosted by producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and is set delve into Monster Hunter Wilds' first free Title Update (as Capcom likes to call these things), which is scheduled to arrive in "early April".
</p>
<p>
We do, of course, already have a fairly good idea of what Title Update 1 will bring thanks to Capcom's previous chatter. It's set to introduce everybody's favourite bubble dragon Mizutsune, for instance, as well as a "new place" for hunters to gather once they've completed the main story - so presumably the sort of centralised (and hopefully arm-wrestling enabled) social gathering hub we've seen in previous Monster Hunter games.
</p>

<p>
And finally in terms of earlier teases, Capcom's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-content-update-brings-a-new-level-of-challenge-in-april">previously discussed a "new level of challenge"</a> for Wilds - one that'll manifest as a monster of "formidable strength" somewhere above the tougher Tempered variants currently found in-game. That's good news for everyone who (like me, in my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">four star review</a>) felt Wilds' difficulty skewed a little low at launch.
</p>
<p>
Expect the remaining Title Update 1 blanks to be filled (and hopefully some news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">much-needed performance improvements</a>) in Monster Hunter Wilds' showcase next week. To recap, things kick off next Tuesday, 25th March, at 2pm in the UK. And in the meantime, Capcom's got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-unveils-busy-in-game-event-schedule">full schedule of in-game events</a> to keep you occupied.

The release of these new weapons comes despite the fact that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-veteran-writer-among-those-looking-for-work-after-post-dragon-age-the-veilguard-downsizing">BioWare has not only been downsized</a>, but had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-just-received-its-final-major-update">previously signalled the end of its support for Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">publisher EA described it as having underperformed</a>.
</p>
<p>
Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1jfx3qk/bioware_released_a_weapons_set_dlc_today/">reddit</a>, where the Rook's Weapons Appearance Bundle was first discovered (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-new-dlc-free-march-20/">TheGamer</a>), fans have speculated that these weapons were already included within the game's files for use in a future promotion - meaning no new work to make them has actually gone on.

Eurogamer has contacted EA for more detail on the Rook's Weapons Appearance Bundle - and asked whether these items will also eventually become unlocked for those who own the game on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>Alongside Dragon Age: The Veilguard's current deep sale on Steam, the game also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-in-playstation-plus-next-month">popped up last month as part of Sony's PlayStation Plus subscription</a>.</p>
<p>EA recently raised eyebrows by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">suggesting that the game might have sold better if it had kept its live-service elements</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/id-probably-like-quit-former-dragon-age-leads-react-to-eas-suggestion-the-veilguard-should-have-been-live-service">something previous Dragon Age developers have scoffed at</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet has some advice for GDC 2025 attendees lucky enough to find a spot in his packed out 'The making of Astro Bot' session: "It's okay to make a small game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They're pertinent words in era of burgeoning production cycles and budgets—and ones that should hold weight given the critical and commercial performance of Team Asobi's effervescent platformer, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Introducing his point, Doucet surfaces a photograph of Team Asobi's onboarding handbook that states "we aim for quality, not quantity." Better to create a michelin star morsel than a greasy platter of overcooked sliders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Doucet, thinking small means gaining more control over your work and processes. It also means your players are far more likely to actually roll credits—letting you more effectively compete for their limited time in an increasingly saturated market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The prospect of a game you can actually complete is a really, really positive argument [for small games]," he explains. "That meant being okay with the game being 12 hours, but if it had been eight hours—and the eight hours were fantastic—we would have settled for that to reach consistent quality."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doucet acknowledges concerns over game size can be a "difficult bias" to overcome and admits the prospect of developing a smaller title initially sparked discussions in Team Asobi HQ. Eventually, however, the team realized they could use the benefits of thinking small and compact to maintain a clear scope and rapidly execute on unique concepts.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a decision that was justified by the fact that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was built in just three and a half years—only six months more than the team initially envisioned. Budget was maintained by choosing to adjust the pitch of the studio's ramp-up curve to accommodate fewer developers over a longer period of time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With that mantra of 'simplicity' in mind, Team Asobi became adept at distilling ideas down to their core throughout production. For instance, although the DualSense controller has 18 buttons, the team forced themselves to utilize as few inputs as possible—relying on short and long presses and contextual controls to bridge the complexity gap.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio also simplified some of Astro's abilities. For example, they removed a third medium-sized Astro Bot from the (utterly fantastic) level that sees the titular hero turn into a sponge to absorb water and grow in size.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Initially we let players] select three sizes of sponge: small, medium, and large," says Doucet. "At first it was fine but then you forget and think 'am I small? Am I medium? Am I large?' It became too complicated so we went for a system that fluctuates between big and small. Once again, this is bias, as game designers we always think that more is better, but it's not the case."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-civilization-vii-s-powerful-narrative-system-helps-players-experience-unique-parts-of-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Civilization VII's powerful narrative system helps players experience unique parts of history</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Team Asobi sought to remove similar complications from its hero characters, such as the bot versions of Aloy and Kratos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With Aloy, the studio ensured slow-motion triggered automatically whenever players target an enemy with her bow and arrow. In Horizon, that effect had to be triggered manually. For Kratos, players need only press one button to hurl and recall his thudding axe. Again, that's different from God of War, which requires different button inputs to achieve the same outcome.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doucet says those tweaks were made in service of simplicity and with an implicit understanding that Astro Bot was targeting a different audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That pursuit of 'less is more' extended to other, perhaps more surprising, areas of production. Doucet explains it pushed the studio to tell a story "with a minimum amount of text and no voice over." He reveals Astro Bot features less than 5000 words—or 4.292 words to be exact.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are also only 12 minutes and 30 seconds of cutscenes in the entire experience, meaning players are 'active' roughly 98.3 percent of the time.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-balatro-plays-winning-hand-at-gdca-2025-receiving-game-of-the-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Balatro' Plays Winning Hand at GDCA 2025, Receiving Game of the Year</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a metric that speaks to the team's belief in creating an buoyant toybox&nbsp;by reducing distractions to champion perpetual participation. There were other benefits, too.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It kind of struck me in development, but all of these efforts towards simplicity, they've actually made the game easier to share," muses Doucet. "For example, the fact there is no skill tree—while individual powers are one-shot—means that we introduce a new mechanic all the time. That means you could have friends coming to your house, picking up the game halfway through your campaign, playing for the first time, and still having a normal experience. That becomes really powerful when we think about spreading to new audiences."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, Doucet feels actively pursuing simplicity is often viewed as criminally uncool in the world of sprawling blockbusters—but perhaps that just means those developers capable of squashing that particular insecurity will reap the biggest rewards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In order to exist in this very busy world, I think it's sometimes better to settle for a good spot in second league, rather than a bad spot in the top league," he explains. "Instead of joining the cool trendy party on a crowded beach with bars and celebrities, how about you just look for a little quiet beach and have a cool picnic over there?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A lot of the choices we made with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could be labelled double-A or maybe lacking in ambition—like the size of the team, the size of the game, the fact there's no text, no voice, and its not an open world. But that doesn't really matter. We still made a game that made people really happy, and in fact it was probably the simplicity that a lot of players made time for."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
