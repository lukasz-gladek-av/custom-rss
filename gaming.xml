<p>The Call of Duty League’s Major I tournament is unravelling in Madrid as we speak. It’s the first major CDL event in Europe in several years, and the fans are <strong>electric</strong>. One player who wants to see more events in Europe is OpTic Texas’ Shotzzy, who I caught up with after OpTic’s close win over LA Guerrillas M8.</p>



<p>It has been <strong>many years </strong>since Call of Duty esports (outside of Warzone) landed in London, but that’s a fan – and a player – favourite for a future event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-love-the-eu-crowd">‘I Love The EU Crowd’</h2>



<p>Speaking after a 3 – 2 win over LAG that was closer than many people expected, Shotzzy revealed his love for the EU crowd:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I love the EU crowd, they’re insane. I love y’all.</p>



<p>I will say you guys are definitely the better crowd than NA, but obviously we love NA, so.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When I probed and asked if Shotzzy wanted to go anywhere else in Europe, he revealed: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d say London. I had a really bad interview back then, in London, so I’ve got to get my get back.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic’s Huke, who started with the team following Pred’s sudden departure last year, mirrored Shotzzy’s sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think the EU crowd is crazy, I’m not going to lie – in a good way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic Texas came into Major I as the first seed, but a 2 – 3 loss handed down by the Miami Heretics (damn that curse) sent the team into the elimination bracket. Following a win over LAG M8, OpTic now moves forward to face the Carolina Royal Ravens.</p>



<p>At the first CDL Minor tournament, the Royal Ravens forcefully ejected OpTic Texas from the running, before being promptly eliminated by FaZe. Could this be an opportunity for OpTic Texas to, as Shotzzy puts it, ‘get their get back’?</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more of the latest news from the CDL Major I tournament in Madrid.</p>

Just put your reticle directly on the enemy’s upper head to ensure you splatter their brain matter.</li><li><strong>Eye</strong> - Since you’re probably going to be aiming for the head frequently, you’re almost certain to hit some eyeballs along the way.

Also, gross.</li><li><strong>Stomach</strong> - The stomach holds all the bile that Nazis spew, so let’s burst it. You can find this one in the upper left abdomen. If you aim a bit too high, you’ll score a lung shot, though, so this one may take some practice.</li><li><strong>Liver</strong> - The liver is located in the upper right abdomen. As with the stomach, aiming too high can result in a lung shot, so just keep at it until you figure out just the right spot.</li><li><strong>Kidney</strong> - The kidneys are located on the left and right sides of the lower abdomen. These are tiny little organs and require a pinpoint shot. Just aim right above the butt on either side and you’ll eventually get one.</li><li><strong>Testicle</strong> - Yes, you can shoot Nazis in the balls. Aim directly at their crotch and fire away. Since Nazis have such pathetic little baby nuts, this one could take a bit of time to perfect, but it’s worth it for the killcam.</li></ul><p>When you’ve shot every organ in the game, you’ll earn yourself the “Open Surgery” trophy or achievement for being such a damn good sharpshooter. Reward yourself by shooting more Nazis.</p><hr><p><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> is available now on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Windows PCs via Steam.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>One of two shots of Elon Musk’s rig, it has probably been updated since. Via: Elon Musk</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Over the last few weeks, Elon Musk admitted to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/29/elon-musk-video-games-diablo-path-exile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheating at video games</a>. While the entire story is supremely embarrassing for him, I am also offended on a fundamental level as a gear guy. Even if Musk were good at games, what I’ve seen of his streaming setup sucks – either through poor choices or bad implementation. This would be excusable if he was 12 years old and streaming <em>Minecraft</em> in his spare time, but he’s one of the richest men on Earth.</p><p>I do not know Musk’s current gaming setup, and it very well could have improved recently. Sometimes he appears to stream remotely on a laptop, such as on <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1879565812878741574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 15th, 2025</a>, when he streamed from Mar-a-Lago or on <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1876697674264813998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 7th</a> when he mentions the laptop. Musk used to appear on camera, but in the last half year or so has stopped. Most of my speculation stems from “test” streams he did on his annoyingly named gamer <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1831927900255490289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alt</a> @cyb3rgam3r420 in 2023 and 2024.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>His lighting situation at one point was a giant candle like a fucking vampire.</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>Elon had a guy move the big candle in the background. Source: @cyb3rgam3r420</figcaption></figure><p>The first thing that strikes me about Musk’s streaming setup is the atrocious lighting and camera situation he had when appearing on camera. He appeared to be lit almost exclusively by the glow of his monitor and at least one large child-sized candle, which he calls a “gaming candle.” You can see it being lit by an assistant in the background at one point during a <a href="https://x.com/cyb3rgam3r420/status/1743041116415590613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stream on January 4th, 2024</a>. During the same stream, which has at least 400,000 views according to X’s metrics, he spent a decent amount of time<a href="https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1884859938746274232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> arranging this candle in the background.</a> It is one of the most severely uncomfortable things I have ever seen the man do, which is impressive. A candle is historically not a particularly good source of light for a camera, but maybe he was trying a really elaborate ketamine Dracula bit. If that’s the case I wish him luck in his goal to be the first pro gamer illuminated entirely by candelabra ala <em>Barry Lyndon</em>.</p><h4><strong>He center-aligned his taskbar at least once.</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>Unserious task bar setup just generally. Source: Elon Musk</figcaption></figure><p>In one test broadcast on <a href="https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1MYxNMNwmPzJw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 17th, 2024</a>, you briefly see his dock in Windows which is center-aligned. This is the default for Windows 11, and I’m sorry if this offends but it’s incorrect. I understand using Windows 11 since Microsoft is going to make Windows 10 end of life soon, but for god’s sake bare minimum align your taskbar left, it’s not that hard to change in the settings. Also, he uses Streamlabs OBS, which I have never personally liked over regular OBS.</p><h4><strong>He appears to be sitting in an awful gaming chair.</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>A Razer chair and a different, unidentifiable gaming chair. Source: @cyb3rgam3r420</figcaption></figure><p>I know that a lot of people like gaming chairs, but for the most part they are not well-made objects. They disintegrate quickly, provide awful support and heat regulation and are not easy to repair. Gaming chairs are attractive to a lot of people because they’re flashy and generally cost less than 500 dollars new.&nbsp;</p><p>At one point in 2023 Musk appeared to have a <a href="https://x.com/cyb3rgam3r420/status/1708708034396951029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Razer chair (not good)</a> but later he uses another chair that I cannot identify no matter how many times I attempt to put it through Google Reverse Image search. Perhaps that chair is custom made, but if that’s the case it looks like custom made garbage.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you are super attached to the idea of a gamer chair, they <a href="https://store.haworth.com/collections/gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make really </a><a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/logitech-g-and-herman-miller.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high end gaming chairs now</a>. Or, I don’t know, just get a nice office chair. Musk is worth hundreds of billions of dollars and he’s dicking around with something that looks like you’d find by a dumpster at Best Buy that would give you a hernia, which deeply offends my sensibilities as someone who has literally <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-best-gaming-chair-is-a-used-office-chair-from-craigslist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> thousand dollar Herman Miller and Knoll chairs in a dumpster.</p><h4><strong>He does not appear to always understand how HDR works.&nbsp;</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>A lot of the video clips he posted just look like this. Source: Elon Musk.</figcaption></figure><p>Something that happens quite frequently when I get clips for my show Highlight Reel is that people send me washed-out footage. This is usually because they’re playing a game in HDR. If you’re a streamer, color space is something you have to account for when you’re setting your stream up or are recording video, otherwise your video will look like low contrast, desaturated garbage.&nbsp;</p><p>This is how some of Musk's streams and videos look (for example <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1822802959404835108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1846766563090743297" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1848966938451710318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1846706027137323008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1844533711506899115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1849695413215035775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1846712787684241533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>), which is forgivable if you’re just an amateur, but if you’re rich you can also pay someone to make your videos halfway decent. He even technically owns a streaming platform, albeit one overwhelmingly used by losers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>He often uses a gaming headset instead of a decent pair of headphones and a real mic.</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>My gut says that's a corsair headset, but if you're committed to the pro gamer bit just get a real mic and headphones. Source: @cyb3rgam3r420</figcaption></figure><p>For a lot of first time streamers, a gaming headset seems ideal: it radically simplifies your setup by combining a basic mic with a basic headset. If you’re just shooting the shit with your friends on voice chat it’s not a terrible compromise, but most of the time you end up with the worst of everything: bad audio quality, cheap construction and an ugly product.&nbsp;</p><p>Musk appears to be using some consumer-grade Corsair headset with an awful-looking RGB light at the mic tip in some of his videos. At one point during a <a href="https://x.com/cyb3rgam3r420/status/1743041116415590613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 2024</a> stream it sounds like he attempted to place some kind of mic on his desk, but it was poorly-positioned and aimed squarely at his keyboard. Roughly 30 minutes in you can see him quickly ask the candle assistant to switch back to his headset mic.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of his more recent streams where he does not appear on camera are done remotely on a 3-year-old laptop while traveling, according to a steam on <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1876697674264813998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 7th, 2025</a>, which might help explain why the audio quality is atrocious.</p><figure><figcaption>This is the laptop Elon says he is streaming from while traveling. The audio on those streams is unbearable. Source: Elon Musk</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>He looks like he’s sitting too close to a corny, curved screen.</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>Corny, and probably too close! Source: Lex Friedman/Elon Musk</figcaption></figure><p>I do not have a curved screen, but I understand the appeal: the feeling of being swaddled in a cocoon of gaming seems intoxicating. As a part of a nice system that’s fine, but coupling it with an otherwise mid battlestation and room is deeply corny.</p><p>There’s also some basic ergonomic rules you need to follow if you’re going to game with a big ass monitor. Distance is important; you need to be able to see what is happening on the entire screen. In videos, he appears to be way too close (you can see him engaging with the screen in the “candle guy” <a href="https://x.com/cyb3rgam3r420/status/1743041116415590613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stream on January 4th, 2024</a>). That said, my main objection is to someone pairing a meme monitor with a bad keyboard.</p><h4><strong>His keyboard situation has been dire.</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>Two posts from Musk and Lex Friedman showing his keyboard situation at one point. Source: Lex Friedman/Elon Musk</figcaption></figure><p>I don’t know what Musk’s current keyboard setup is, but based on what I’ve seen and heard from his various streams, it has been largely bad. The clearest photos of his setup were in response to a Twitter post by <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1708300774500102541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lex Freidman in September 2023</a>. In it he appears to be using an OK but not great Logitech mouse. He also appears to have a pretty solid SteelSeries mousepad. If I had a billion dollars I would have gone with something nicer like an <a href="https://www.artisan-jp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Artisan</a>, but I understand 3,400 yen is breaking the bank for most people.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>He may have gotten a better keyboard since then, but these are my best guesses for his keyboard situation. If I am right, that's just unacceptable. Sources: Lex Friedman, Elon Musk, Logitech</figcaption></figure><p>What really gets me is the totally mediocre keyboard setup. At one point he uses something that looks like a <a href="https://www.rtings.com/keyboard/reviews/logitech/signature-k650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Logitech K650</a> (or a <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k740-backlit-illuminated.920-000914.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Logitech K740</a> in the photo posted by Lex), which is a garbage, wireless rubber dome keyboard that’s barely acceptable for office work. In another video filmed by Shivon Zilis on Christmas Eve in December of 2023, you can hear Musk <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drewharwell.com/post/3lgv7a7wy7c25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slamming on his keyboard and mouse</a> and producing whatever the direct opposite of ASMR is. I have spent a lot of time listening to the sounds of various key switches and caps, I have soldered several keyboards from scratch, and that is by far one of the worst-sounding keyboards I have ever heard in my life.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong><strong>Gear doesn’t matter, but this is embarrassing.</strong></strong></h4><p>If you’re reading this blog and take streaming or competitive play even halfway seriously, you probably have a better setup than what you’ve seen here. None of this stuff is out of the reach of the average person any more, and there has never been more information out there about how to start streaming correctly.</p><p>Musk might have other gaming setups than the one shown in these videos, and I’m sure he could spend a bunch of money to have someone with taste fix his busted-ass setup so it looks and sounds halfway decent. And while I do admit that gear mostly does not matter that much if you have a limited budget but know what you’re doing, it does when you are one of the richest men on Earth. Musk constructs his gaming setup the way he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1528955104463814656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">builds his characters in <em>Elden Ring</em></a>: poorly optimized.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>This is the moment everyone realized he was probably full of shit gaming wise. Source:Elon Musk</figcaption></figure><p>I am aware that this is one of the most frivolous things I could be writing about in a time when many of my friends' lives are at risk, but this is also a thing I take very seriously as a tech writer, a video producer, a gamer and a person who tries to live their life deliberately. Musk wants to be perceived as intelligent and epic, but his gaming setup looks like something put together by someone without the patience or self-awareness to learn to do things correctly. If he has the capacity for shame left in him, he should at least try interrogating how mid his battlestation is and seeing where that leads.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics"><h3>James Gunn Can’t Stop Making Suicide Squads</h3></a><p>Groups of freaky little guys are the stuff of comic book history, and maybe the future of comic book movies.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/god-is-a-geek-calvin-robinson-nazi-salute-elon-musk"><h3>God Is A Geek Staff Quits Following Ex-Priest Owner’s Nazi Salute</h3></a><p>"It will be hard to start again ... but this is the right thing to do"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-1-and-2-are-coming-back-to-pc-this-week-with-all-original-expansion-packs-says-report">rumoured</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> 1 and The Sims 2 have returned to (official) PC stores. Kindly Uncle EA has taken a break from his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">busy layoff schedule</a> to rustle up a pair of Legacy collections that include a bunch of DLC. It's the very first time the original Sims has graced a digital retail platform, I believe - it was first released in 2000, back when people used to access the internet using smoke signals and semaphore. Anyway, here's the reveal trailer.</p>

<p>The Sims Legacy Collection includes the following DLC packs - sorry, just let me take a deep breath, OK let's go: The Sims Livin' Large, The Sims <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/house-party">House Party</a>, The Sims Hot Date, The Sims Vacation, The Sims Unleashed, The Sims Superstar, and The Sims Makin' Magic. You also get a bonus Throwback Fit Kit for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>.</p>
<p>The Sims 2 Legacy Collection, meanwhile, harbours the following - sorry, just let me preemptively hook myself up to a defibrillator. OK, here we go: The Sims 2: University, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sims-2-nightlife">The Sims 2: Nightlife</a>, The Sims 2: Open for Business, The Sims 2: Pets, The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, The Sims 2: Seasons, The Sims 2: FreeTime, The Sims 2: Apartment Life, The Sims 2: Holiday Party Pack, The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff, The Sims 2: Glamour Life Stuff, The Sims 2: Happy Holiday Stuff, The Sims 2: Celebration! Stuff, The Sims 2: H&amp;M Fashion Stuff, The Sims 2: Teen Style Stuff, The Sims 2: Kitchen &amp; Bath Interior Design Stuff, and The Sims 2: Mansion &amp; Garden Stuff. You also get a Grunge Revival Kit for The Sims 4.</p><p><em>Why</em> is there so much Sims 2 DLC? It's like some kind of Cambrian explosion of licensed boondoggles. I'm speaking from a position of blessed ignorance here. The only thing I know about The Sims 2 is that games journo extraordinaire Steve Hogarty once got blacklisted by EA for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/29gllx/the_sims_2_hm_fashion_stuff_review/">this PCZone review of the H&amp;M one</a>. I doubt his subsequent <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-sims-2-ikea-home-stuff-review/">review of an IKEA-themed pack</a> did much to heal the breach.</p>
<p>Find The Sims: Legacy Collection on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314060/The_Sims_Legacy_Collection/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/bundles/the-sims-legacy-collection">Epic Games Store</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-combat-is-shaping-well-based-on-the-latest-dev-diary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Chinese Room has just <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-advanced-combat-and-weapons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> the latest developer diary focused on Bloodlines 2 combat. It's a bit late on the schedule (it was originally meant to go live on January 29), but its content is well worth the wait, as the UK-based studio has provided several glimpses of what combat will look like when the first-person roleplaying game <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases later this year</a>.</p>
<p>To begin with, Senior Game Designer Max Bottomley revealed that the team has taken care to make dedicated melee animations for each of the playable clans. Banu has a sharp and quick style, Ventrue's is firm and precise, Tremere has a greater reach since they like to have some space between them and their foes, and Brujah is more brutally straightforward.</p>
<p><iframe title="1. clan attacks" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1051169795?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media"></iframe></p>
<p>Regardless of which clan you'll pick, a Dashing ability is always available to Phyre. Not only is it useful to dodge attacks, but it can even be utilized aggressively, as dashing just as an enemy is attacking will break their attack and set them up for a counterattack.</p>
<p>Kicks are available, too, and there are even multiple types. Players can opt for a big swinging roundhouse if they're dealing with a group of enemies, while a powerful back-kick is ideal to send a single enemy flying, as shown below.</p>
<p><iframe title="2. counter attack" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1051169861?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media"></iframe></p>
<p>Telekinesis is also an extremely useful tool in the Bloodlines 2 combat system. Phyre can employ it to grab an enemy and feed upon them, as shown below, or to manipulate the environment. Things like bottles and ashtrays can be thrown to make a noise to distract enemies as part of the stealth toolset, while throwing explosives such as a gas tank is a more destructive way to deal with enemy groups.</p>
<p>Telekinesis can also pick up weapons from the dead, from knives to sniper rifles. This is where things can get interesting if mixing in Discipline abilities. For example, Brujah's taunting ability, when used with mass manipulation, lets Phyre force enemies to drop their weapons and literally turn on them. When using Possession, the lead character can take control of a foe and drop them from a building.</p>
<p><iframe title="3. tk enemy to feed" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1051169920?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media"></iframe></p>
<p>The Bloodlines 2 combat system will be augmented by four Elixirs that can be found and collected by playing the game. The Mending Elixir instantly restores health, while the Blood Elixir restores Blood Points to Phyre's abilities, which is particularly useful for combo chains. The Strength Elixir boosts damage done for some time, while the Fortitude Elixir reduces damage taken.</p>
<p>When the game launches, there will be three difficulty settings available to players: Easy, Normal, and Hard. The next developer diary, which will focus on the Masquerade in Seattle, is due on February 12.</p>

            <p>Warner Bros' licensed free-to-play fighting game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> - aka, the one where Velma Dinkley and Arya Stark can team up to kick Superman's face in - will no longer be playable online as of 30th May. It'll be pulled from Steam, the Epic Games Store and the PlayStation and Xbox stores at the end of its next season, though you'll still be able to get your fill of Bugs Bunny bashing offline against either friends or bots.</p><!--more-->
<p>Season 5 is due to run from 4th February. It introduces DC's Aquaman and Looney Tunes's Lola Bunny - which, without wishing to rile up the Aquaman stans, strikes me as going out with a whimper. In-game real money transactions have been suspended as of today, but you have until 30th May to spend any in-game Gleamium currency or character tokens you already own. Players will be able to earn the new season 5 characters in-game: Aquaman is the first tier battlepass reward, while Lola is the daily calendar login reward.</p>
<p>They've put together a little guide to playing MultiVersus offline once the servers are pulled. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>All online features will continue to be available until Season 5 concludes on May 30 at 9 a.m. PST. At that point, there will be an option to play MultiVersus offline via the local gameplay mode, either solo against A.I. opponents or with up to three friends. To do this, you'll need to install/download the latest version of the game and log in during Season 5, any time between February 4 at 9 a.m. PST and May 30 at 9 a.m. PST. After logging in, a local save file will be automatically created connected to your PlayStation Network, Microsoft Store, Steam, or Epic Games Store account, allowing you to enjoy the game offline with all earned and purchased content moving forward.</p></blockquote>
<p>As snarky as I may sound here, the RPS hivemind was reasonably keen on MultiVersus for a time. It once appeared on our lists of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">best free PC games</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">best co-op games</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">best multiplayer games</a>. You can still trace its presence there, clinging on determinedly by way of the article tags.</p><p>Writing about the open beta <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/multiversus-lacks-that-nintendo-polish-but-its-still-a-slick-smash-bros-like-in-open-beta">back in July 2022</a>, Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) summarised MultiVersus as follows: "learn to cut through its barrage of boxes and cooldowns, and you're left with a cracking fighting game that's only going to evolve over the coming months." Alas, no more.</p>
<p>It's not clear what all this means for developers Player First Games, who were acquired by Warner Bros last year. Warner's games division have not been in the pink lately, with Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">cratering</a> at launch and receiving its final update this month. As with MultiVersus, Rocksteady at least took the time to add an <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-is-now-officially-finished-as-its-final-update-goes-live/">offline mode</a> before calling it a night.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's been a long time since there's been a new game in Namco's Ridge Racer series, and it's anyone's guess if the franchise will make a comeback. But in the interim, Ridge Racer 64--which was originally released in February 2000--has made a welcome return on Nintendo Switch. As seen in the announcement trailer below, Ridge Racer 64 still has that classic arcade-style charm a quarter century later.</p><p>Unfortunately, this game isn't available as a standalone purchase. It was re-released earlier today exclusively for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers--which costs $50 per year for individuals and $80 for families in exchange for access to N64, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy Advance games as well as select DLC for modern titles.</p>

      </div>
<p>Ridge Racer 64 includes a Quick Play option for anyone who just wants a fast run through the Revolution Novice course. Veteran drivers can try their hand on the Grand Prix and choose from nine different race tracks.</p><p>The game also includes Car Attack, Time Attack, Battle Mode, Stage Mode, and Team Mode. The trailer also confirms the return of the game's multiplayer option for up to four drivers at once. This might be the best way to experience any Ridge Racer game, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-feature-packed-ridge-racer-arcade-cabinet-is-only-300/1100-6509498/" data-ref-id="1100-6509498">Arcade1Up's Ridge Racer cabinet</a> is long out of production.</p><p>Nintendo Switch Online recently opened its vault and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-adds-fatal-fury-2-and-other-snes-hidden-gems-to-nintendo-switch-online/1100-6529006/" data-ref-id="1100-6529006">expanded its SNES lineup</a> with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fatal-fury-2/" data-ref-id="5000-6879">Fatal Fury 2</a>, Sutte Hakkun, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-ninja-boy/" data-ref-id="5000-17695">Super Ninja Boy</a>.

                <p>Sony has filed a DMCA takedown of a fan-made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloodborne-60fps-patch-released-by-hacker/1100-6487299/" data-ref-id="1100-6487299">Bloodborne 60 frames per second patch</a> nearly four years after its release.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bloodborne/" data-ref-id="5000-285291">Bloodborne</a> is a beloved From Software action-RPG that's only officially available on PS4, running at a frame rate of 30fps. In 2020, Lance McDonald revealed a 60fps patch for Bloodborne that he was working on, and it got a wide release on February 21, 2021. While players needed to go through extra steps, like jailbreaking their PS4, to access this patch's enhancements, it quickly gained notoriety in lieu of an official enhanced PC and PS5-enhanced port of Bloodborne by Sony.</p><p>Sony let this fan-made patch be for around four years, but it's now no longer available. McDonald took to X (formerly Twitter) today, January 31, and revealed that he complied with a Sony request to remove any links to their 60fps Bloodborne patch. This makes the process of finding and downloading the 60fps Bloodborne patch significantly more difficult than it was before.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1885347693125566806" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">On February 21st, 2021, I created and released a patch for Bloodborne which makes the game run at 60fps. Today I received a DMCA takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so</p>  — Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1885347693125566806?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>It's unclear why Sony's legal action against this 60fps patch was so belated. While many fans, including <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/mega-streamer-kai-cenat-is-streaming-bloodborne-to-call-attention-to-fan-demand-for-a-pc-port-playstation-fromsoft-this-is-one-of-the-most-highly-requested-games-for-a-remaster-and-a-pc-version/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kai Cenat</a>, have requested Bloodborne ports of PC and PS5, Sony has not publicly announced any plan to do so. It recently toyed with fans of Bloodborne by showing footage of the FromSoftware title behind the statement "it's about persistence" in its 30th Anniversary celebratory video. If you want to play Bloodborne, the PS4 version of it is part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-playstation-plus-january-2025-games-for-premium-and-extra-subscribers/2900-6131/" data-ref-id="2900-6131">PlayStation Plus Extra</a> game catalog.</p>

            <p>
After a bit of cheeky teasing earlier in the week that had <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> fans positively salivating, EA has turn speculation into truth: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims">The Sims 1</a> &amp; 2 are getting re-releases to celebrate the series' 25th anniversary. And better yet, they're out today on PC.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 1 &amp; 2 have, of course, long been unavailable in an official capacity on PC, with the 25-year-old original never getting a digital release and its sequel's short-lived Ultimate Collection being yanked from Origin in 2018. A report earlier this week, however - which coincided with some not-entirely-subtle teasing from EA - suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-2-reportedly-getting-pc-re-releases-this-week">that was about to change</a>. 
</p>
<p>
And now it's official. The Sims: Legacy Collection and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-2">The Sims 2</a>: Legacy Collection are both available for purchase on PC from today, each providing access to their respective base game and all subsequent expansions. Additionally, EA has released The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle, containing both Legacy Collections and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> base game.
