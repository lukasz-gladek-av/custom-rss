            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-2-is-getting-a-final-update-soon-developer-will-then-focus-on-state-of-decay-3/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Undead Labs announced that State of Decay 2 is set to receive a final free update soon, its 38th since the game's launch. After that update, the Seattle-based developer will focus solely on the development of State of Decay 3. Update 38 will fix some long-standing bugs, add a few quality-of-life improvements, and, more importantly, it will permanently unlock all seasonal content.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from the official FAQ posted on the game's website:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q: Is this the end of&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>State of Decay 2</em></strong><strong>? What’s changing?</strong><br>
A: The next update, Update 38, will be the final content update for&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2</em>, but it is not the end!&nbsp; Whether you’re an owner or you play on GamePass, the game will continue to be available. We just won’t be creating new content or supporting the game after Update 38.</li>
<li><strong>Q: Why is now the time to stop updating&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>State of Decay 2</em></strong><strong>?</strong><br>
A: After careful consideration, we have decided to focus on making&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 3</em> the best it can be for all of you.</li>
<li><strong>Q: Will my [insert preferred feature or bug here] be fixed/implemented?</strong><br>
A: We listen to your feedback on support tickets and the Wishlist, but we can’t get to every suggestion. Rather, our goal is to implement those changes and fixes that help the&nbsp; most players, in an effort to make the game stable and fun for years to come.</li>
<li><strong>Q: Will this affect my saved game(s) or saved communities?</strong><br>
A: No, your saved games and/or communities will not be affected. You will be able to keep playing normally for the foreseeable future.</li>
<li><strong>Q: Are you sunsetting&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>State of Decay 2</em></strong><strong>?</strong><br>
A: No. We are stopping content development and developer support for the title. The game will remain available on all existing platforms and for all owners, and included with GamePass subscriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Q: Will bounties continue to cycle?</strong><br>
A: Yes, the bounty packs from the Bounty Broker will continue to cycle automatically. You can see that schedule&nbsp;<a href="https://support.stateofdecay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413643285261-Bounty-Pack-Cycling-Schedule">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>State of Decay 2 was originally launched in May 2018. Back then, the game was fun but quite buggy and unpolished, as I noted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/state-of-decay-2-rough-yet-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>. However, the extensive post-launch support of over six years slowly made it into a much better game, so it's a great time to start if you've been on the fence. As a reminder, the game is available on Game Pass (Undead Labs was acquired by Microsoft in June 2018).</p>
<p>As for State of Decay 3, the sequel was <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-announced-to-be-early-in-pre-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in July 2020. Back then, the game was in early pre-production. We just got a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-gets-brand-new-trailer-showcasing-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer</a> from Summer Game Fest, but it's fair to guess it might be a 2026 title rather than 2025.</p>

Up to four players can cooperate online to try to escape from an enclosed area where terrifying Yokai roam.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the Japanese Horror With Your Friends</strong> – Players must attempt to escape from the cursed domain where terrifying Yokai roam.

To enhance the horror experience, the game features a distinctive art style characterized by strong contrasts of light and shadow, inspired by the works of Shigeru Mizuki, the creator of <em>GeGeGe no Kitaro</em>. The lurking Yokai emerging from the dark greatly heightens the sense of dread.</li><li><strong>Dealing With the Curse That Undermines Players</strong> – Players must contend not only with the Yokai but also with an agonizing curse. As the curse gradually consumes you, players may transform into terrifying half-Yokai creatures. Close cooperation between players is essential in overcoming this curse which is not only frightening but also a hindrance to your escape.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Gameplay With Ever-changing Item and Device Locations</strong> – In order to escape, you must perform a ritual to break the seal. However, the items necessary for the ritual are hidden in different locations each time you play. Additionally, you’ll need to search for items that can stall the Yokai or revive fallen teammates, leading to a new experience with every playthrough.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

This will start a cutscene where Willy explains that the ship used to take people to nearby islands, but it needs some repairs before it can run again.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>To repair the ship you need 200 hardwood, 5 iridium bars, and 5 battery packs. </strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-hardwood-in-stardew-valley/1100-6525034/" data-ref-id="1100-6525034">Hardwood</a> can be found in the Secret Woods, where 12 pieces spawn every day.

After providing the materials, a cutscene will play the next night showing Robin and Willy fixing the ship. After that, you can spend 1,000G to go to Ginger Island.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What to do on Ginger Island</h2><p dir="ltr">Once you make it to Ginger Island, you want to head to the eastern part of the island through the jungle. There you can find Leo, who won't speak to you unless you become friends with the parrots. The parrots can be given Golden Walnuts to unlock new areas or repair broken structures. Golden Walnuts can be found around the island, sometimes buried, in trees, or dropped by enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">To befriend Leo, you must go to the Volcano Dungeon and reach the top. There are 10 floors and at the top is the forge, which you can use to enchant weapons and tools. Once you reach the top, you can head back to Leo to befriend him and gain access to more parrots around the island. You can repair the resort, a bridge to a dig site, and more, but the first thing you should repair is the island farm, which can be found in the western part of the island. Once the island farm is restored, even more parrots are unlocked around Ginger Island.</p><p dir="ltr">There are many places to explore and unlock on Ginger Island, but once you befriend Leo and repair the island farm, you can explore and repair the island in whatever order you prefer. All unlocks and repairs are done using Golden Walnuts, so watch for them while you explore.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-space-marine-2-have-denuvo/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you regularly play video games on PC, you know there’s one word we all hate to hear: “Denuvo.” When a studio announces Denuvo in its game, it instantly kills any hype, and countless people worldwide cancel their pre-orders. With so much hype surrounding Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, Denuvo is on everyone’s mind. Is it part of the package?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-denuvo-in-space-marine-2">Is Denuvo in Space Marine 2?</h2>



<p>You’ll be happy to know that developer Saber Interactive omitted Denuvo in Space Marine 2. When asked whether they would use the popular anti-piracy software, which many claim reduces game performance, they simply said, “No.” They didn’t elaborate any further, but do they really need to? Now, anyone excited about the third-person action game who was previously worried about performance issues stemming from anti-piracy measures may rest easy and enjoy the experience on day one.</p>



<p>It’s becoming all too common for developers to include Denuvo, and it doesn’t take long for crackers to break through and release copies worldwide.</p>



<p>Alongside a satisfying lack of Denuvo, Saber confirmed they’re not using any DRM whatsoever!</p>







<h2 id="h-does-space-marine-2-have-anti-cheat">Does Space Marine 2 Have Anti-Cheat?</h2>



<p>On the topic of software packaged with the game, how about anti-cheat? As Space Marine 2 includes multiplayer components such as a co-op campaign, PvE missions, and a PvP game mode, anti-cheat is a must-have. Saber opted for Easy Anti Cheat, one of the most common pieces of software for multiplayer games worldwide.</p>



<p>How do you feel about Easy Anti Cheat?</p>

<p>Does the lack of Denuvo change your mind about the game? If you’re hopping in on day one, here’s what you should know about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-campaign-difficulty-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign difficulty modes in Space Marine 2</a>!</p>

<p>Many of us here at Insider Gaming jumped at the chance to play the Black Ops 6 multiplayer beta, and most of us walked away rather excited about October’s release.

The Black Ops 6 beta weekend 2 kicks off on <strong>Friday, September 6, and runs through Monday, September 9</strong>. A whole weekend, when most of us aren’t working, to play through the few multiplayer maps and game modes in the beta, unlock a few weapons, and a chance to earn <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-beta-progress-carry-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unique rewards that carry over</a> to the full game release in October!</p>

<p>Hogwarts Legacy isn’t going to be a one-and-done game. During a recent interview, Warner Bros. Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels&nbsp;talked about the success of the game and it’s future for the company, namely Hogwarts Legacy 2.</p>



<p>“Obviously, a successor to Hogwarts Legacy is one of the biggest priorities in a couple of years down the road,” he said per <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/harry-potter-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-game-warner-bros-1236130719/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>. “So there is certainly a significant growth contribution from that [games] business in our strategic outlook here.”</p>



<p>First released in February 2023 for PC, Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, Hogwarts Legacy was one of the best-selling games of the year. The game sold over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-sales-12-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 million copies</a> in just two weeks and over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-over-22-million-copies-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">22 million for the year</a>. The game also received an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-update-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update in June for players</a>.</p>



<p>As far as when the next Hogwarts Legacy title will come, that’s years away based on what Wiedenfels&nbsp;said. In the meantime, a Hogwarts Legacy Director’s Cut is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to be in the works</a>.</p>

Their death would be the magical rite that would forever seal the darkest of the Old Gods out of our realm and usher in a new age of bounty. So Lamb died, but then they made a deal of their own. At the crossroads of eternity, Lamb was met by the imprisoned deity known as the One Who Waits, who revealed the falsehoods and distortions of the false prophets who rule the world and the Old Faith. And so, Lamb was given a choice: Enter oblivion as intended, or return to the land of living with unholy powers and deliver a new cult unto the Earth."</p><p>If you're not in the mood to wait, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3HD157J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">buy the comics individually on Kindle</a> right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-tulip-is-a-tiny-open-source-music-making-computer-for-cheap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a deep love of synthesizers, but a very limited use for them. Part of this has to do with how tied they are to the history of game music; another is that I just know a lot of people who make techno and own a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurorack</a> modules. Most of all, I just love gear. It’s a hobby that can burn a hole in your savings quickly, so one that I mostly avoid (<a href="https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">although I have one for my MiSTer</a>). And yet, when I saw the Tulip Creative Computer–an affordable, Open Source music creation computer and coding platform for $59–I had to give it a shot.&nbsp;</p><p>The Tulip Computer is the brainchild of Brian Whitman. I first became aware of his open source work with the release of the Alles synthesizer. The Alles is a mesh synthesizer, a tiny PCB that you can shove into a cheap bluetooth speaker. It runs on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESP32</a>, a low-cost microcontroller with WiFi that powers a lot of open source and smart home devices. Imagine a gaggle of individual bluetooth speakers all working as independent synthesizers, controlled over WiFi via Python or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Max/MSP</a>, slowly playing different cooing notes similar to a Yamaha DX7 in sync with each other. Any computer can also become an Alles node, meaning you don’t even need any dedicated PCBs if you wanna mess around it. You can build one from scratch using parts you get online, or run a node locally on any computer or many single board computers like a Raspberry Pi.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Alles mesh networking synthesizer - a field of sound at your control" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8CmcsQXHVEo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>An Alles synth in action.</figcaption></figure></div><p>“I started working on Alles in 2018 or so,” Brian told me via Discord. “It was first meant to be a way to play multichannel additive synth compositions across many speakers over WiFi. To be honest, the first Alleses really were just good at sine waves, which is all I needed them for. I spent more time on the network communication side, setting up the ‘mesh’ network code for them, the multicast stuff.”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>One of the many alles PCB revisions. I have been meaning to build a bunch of these for a while.

By 2020 the synth engine got very good at being able to do FM tones similar to the aforementioned Yamaha.&nbsp;</p><p>“We realized that the synth engine could be split out from Alles, and we called it <a href="https://github.com/shorepine/amy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMY</a>,” said Brian. That synth engine now runs on a variety of lightweight devices from Pi Picos, ESP32s to Cortex M0 chips and more. “As far as we know it's the only synth of its type available to all these chips. It requires very little RAM and CPU power and can make very accurate analog-style tones (like Juno-6), FM tones, additive tones, etc. We added patch / preset support too, with baked-in default bank Juno-6 and DX7 patches.”</p><figure><figcaption>The tulip in its natural habitat. Credit: Brian Whitman</figcaption></figure><p>The Tulip Creative Computer is an extension of those efforts, with AMY powering it under the hood. “You can control everything about AMY on the Tulip itself, down to each oscillator, in Python.” The Tulip runs on an ultra cheap ESP32-S3, can be built from scratch or run locally on many computers, and is completely open source. It’s a barebones device out of the box with a tiny 7” touchscreen display soldered to a PCB, secured to a sheet of acrylic by metal standoffs. You can power it over USB via a port on the left, or you can buy and install your own thin lithium ion battery, connect it via the connector on the back and sandwich it between the board and the acrylic.&nbsp;</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/shorepine/tulipcc/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>The back of the board. Credit: Brian Whitman.</figcaption></figure><p>Under the USB-C power port on the left side there are Midi in and out ports for connecting devices, a stereo out, and a place to connect most USB keyboards (some complex keyboards like those with USB hubs give it some difficulty) to program and control the device. On the right there’s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I2C</a> port for connecting further devices or the optional DAC that can also be purchased <a href="https://www.makerfabs.com/mabee-dac-gp8413.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for just under 6 bucks</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“The first thing is, as you may have noticed, the Tulip is very cheap, on purpose. It's using a chip more suited to be in a light bulb or thermostat. We're real proud of what we could eke out of it! The rest of the components are made at a large scale for other products, so everything is in stock and relatively inexpensive. Future Tulips may get faster internals, or a better screen, but we'll always follow behind and take advantage of commodity tech.”</p><p>On bootup the Tulip greets you with a basic terminal for inputting your various commands. You can use a keyboard to set up WiFi, modify the boot process, update the device, program it, do basic word processing, mess around with graphical demos and even connect to “Tulip World,” which lets users share messages and files for the computer.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tulip, a musical computer based on Micropython" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lYFjQp7Xrw?start=433&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Floyd Steinberg is one of the best YouTubers when it comes to DIY/low cost synths, and can show the machine off better than I. </figcaption></figure></div><p>For those less technically but more musically inclined, or those who don’t have a USB keyboard handy, a touch screen icon on the lower right lets you navigate the most heavily frequented programs like an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">808-style drum machine</a>, a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Juno-60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Juno-6</a> patch editor, a built-in synth with touchscreen keyboard, and an editor for writing scripts. You can switch those programs on the fly and get them to all work in sequence with each other. It may seem like a lot, but luckily there’s both a Discord and <a href="https://github.com/shorepine/tulipcc/blob/main/docs/music.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of helpful information about music creation available on GitHub</a>.</p><p>There is something conceptually beautiful about the Tulip. By design the machine is a gorgeous experiment in how much you can squeeze out of tiny affordable consumer tech. In our chat, Brian cited Gameboy designer Gunpei Yokoi's idea of "l<a href="https://medium.com/@adamagb/nintendo-s-little-known-product-philosophy-lateral-thinking-with-withered-technology-bac7257d8f4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ateral thinking with withered technology</a>."&nbsp; Brian’s guiding vision for the device was "what if the SNES or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akai_MPC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MPC</a> shipped as a dev kit or a chip you could put in your own thing?" The limitations of the device are intentional. By starting with as much of a stripped down machine as possible, and getting it to run on C-based firmware and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeRTOS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lightweight OS</a> with a lightweight version of Python (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroPython" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Micropython</a>), costs are kept low and the code is built with scaling with other hardware in mind. Open source development allows the Tulip to do whatever you can make it do.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Sunday jam with Tulip, Reface DX and Zoom MS-70CDR+" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OZVgXl_gIR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Making music, in action.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This approach is not without its little hiccoughs, particularly with the graphics. “The jank you'll mostly see on Tulip is the screen redrawing,” Brian explained. “The ESP32S3 chip has no dedicated display driver, so we wrote our own (and got our fixes merged upstream with <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Espressif</a>f, the chip manufacturer) and it often uses up to a whole core of the dual core chip. When you do things like swap between a drum machine app and the voice selection app, the bandwidth for the memory and screen drawing fight with each other. We'll get better at this over time, and we aim to have single task stuff be as rock solid timing as possible.” It’s an impressive feat, and for sure, and I’m constantly shocked it’s able to do any of this at all. “We try to temper expectations -- ‘it's amazing it can even do X!’” Brian told me.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>You don't need the Tulip CC to try it out. You can run Tulip on the desktop.</figcaption></figure><p>After messing around with the device, I downloaded Tulip Desktop to my MacBook Air, and saw the same familiar interface as before. The open source nature of the project gives tons of flexibility, Brian explained to me. “We've seen people run Tulip on things like the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805505920840.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">T-Deck</a> (a small blackberry-looking device with a little keyboard), on their desktop computers, headless on bare development boards just to run the music engine, and we're soon going to port Tulip Desktop to the web so anyone can use it without having to install anything.”</p><figure><figcaption>Tulip installed on a T-Deck. Credit: <a href="https://github.com/shorepine/tulipcc/blob/main/docs/pics/tdeck_editor.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brian Whitman.</a></figcaption></figure><p>Much of what the Tulip CC does musically is beyond what I need, but as a device and concept I am in love with what it is doing. As an educational tool, it’s something to behold: an affordable computer that scales to whatever hardware it needs that can be used to teach both Python scripting and music. The API is open, so anybody can develop for the Tulip CC ecosystem. What’s more, you really don’t <em>need </em>to order it to try it; you can just run it on your desktop (although Windows users will need to install Linux via WSL2).&nbsp;</p><p>As a device, the Tulip represents something larger to me. The world of both music and computing are filled with wildly powerful and expensive gear that claims to do everything and often fails at doing anything. Apple has built much of its brand around this conceit – closed and expensive with limitless possibilities, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/why-apple-ipad-ad-controversy-backlash-1236017855/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often to a fault</a>. What Tulip represents is the opposite of that: affordable, efficient, focused, and open source, with the ability to scale to whatever hardware it can fit on. It is not the best at everything, but by being very good at something and running on the same microcontroller that runs a light bulb, it holds the promise of developing into something far more interesting than the oceans of technology produced every year.</p><p><em>You can learn more and purchase a Tulip <a href="https://tulip.computer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> via MakerFab.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-the-first-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/little-nightmares-3-the-first-preview.972435/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Sigmund Freud believed that the power of the uncanny came from placing the strange inside something that would otherwise be ordinary. Dolls, wax figures, settings, scenarios, people that are just off. It’s the familiar, but just strange enough to feel wrong, and it makes us anxious. I couldn’t help thinking of the uncanny as I played Little Nightmares 3. A sense of creeping dread pervaded my time with it, but I also found myself compelled to push forward, see more, and unravel the mysteries of its world. It’s a fine line to walk, but during my hour-long play session with the game, Little Nightmares 3 pulled it off, and left me wanting more when the “Thank you for playing” screen informed me my time was done.</p><p>Little Nightmares 3 might be the third game in the series, but it’s offering up a lot of franchise firsts. It’s the first game to be developed without series creator Tarsier Studios. Instead, Supermassive Games, the team behind Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and The Quarry is at the helm. Similarly, it is the first entry in the series to feature co-op play and the first to be a standalone sequel. You don’t need to have played the first two Little Nightmares games to understand this one, and as someone who has never played a Little Nightmares game before, I didn’t have much trouble following along.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Little Nightmares III Gamescom Opening Night Live Trailer</h3></div></output><p>The first thing I noticed about Little Nightmares was the way it builds atmosphere. It looks gorgeous, but what stood out to me was how it used light and shadow to highlight things you often don’t want to see or obscure things you might want to. Little Nightmares 3 understands that the scariest stuff is often what you can't see, or only get glimpses of, and it's happy to tease you along and build a sense of impending doom before the big reveal.</p><p>Then there’s the audio design; Little Nightmares 3 makes great use of environmental sounds and ambient noise to ratchet up the tension. Whether it’s the soft sound of footballs, the heavy machinery of a candy factory (more on that in a second), or the creaking of an old board that might be just stable enough to get you across that gap, Little Nightmares 3 uses what you hear in the environment to keep you on your toes. And that ambient noise? Genuinely creepy.</p><h3>The Kids Are(n’t) All Right</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Little Nightmares 3 follows Low and Alone, two kids desperately searching for a way out of Nowhere. Low and Alone didn't speak in the sections I played, but you get a feel for their relationship in the little moments where they check in on each other or help each other up. These two characters clearly know and care for one another, and there’s a tenderness in these small moments that sells that, no dialogue needed. I hope it lasts, but this is horror. A lot can go wrong.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>These two characters clearly know and care for one another, and there’s a tenderness in these small moments that sells that, no dialogue needed.</p></div><p>No matter who you play as, you’ll be doing a lot of the same things: jumping over obstacles, pushing blocks, navigating narrow pathways over very long drops, and generally solving puzzles so you can delve deeper into the Spiral. But what makes them interesting is their equipment. Alone has a wrench that she can use to turn cranks, activate switches, and even break down walls. Low, on the other hand, wields a bow that allows him to hit switches from a distance, scare away birds carrying a key you might need, or shoot down a crate hanging by a thread from the ceiling. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There are also some problems that you just can't solve alone. Sometimes, that means boosting your partner so you can pull down a switch. Other times, one of you will have to carry a light to scatter the bugs that would otherwise attack you while the other uses the safety of the light to climb a ladder and search for the way forward. And sometimes, you'll just need an extra pair of hands to open a heavy door. </p><p>The puzzles I saw in Little Nightmares 3 weren’t necessarily hard, but they always made sure my partner and I were working together and communicating. Little Nightmares 3 works fine without another player - they're instead replaced with an AI version of whichever character you aren't playing that you can call over if you need help and will sometimes show you the way forward - but co-op play is definitely the way to go.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In one particularly memorable scene, my real-life partner and I had to hide from a very scary lady with too many arms, avoiding her while figuring out the way forward before she could spot us. Those moments are where Little Nightmares 3 shines.</p><h3>The Horror, The Horror</h3><p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t touch on the environments that make this all possible. I saw two parts of the Spiral in my time with Little Nightmares 3. The first was the Candy Factory, a monstrosity of an installation that was deeply uncomfortable to navigate because we knew we weren't alone. </p><p>In addition to the scary lady with too many arms, the building was populated by unnatural workers suspended from the ceiling and the creepy hum of machinery. It was uncanny in all the best ways; something clearly familiar, but also deeply wrong. I compensated by naming each of the lollipops we ran into Steve, and carrying them with me as long as I could. Each time we parted, I was heartbroken. Thankfully, there was always another Steve on the horizon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The second was the Necropolis, an abandoned ruin in the desert. While the Candy Factory is unnerving because you're not alone, the Necropolis builds dread by reminding you that you are. Each place raises more questions than it answers. Who is the Candy Factory making all these lollipops for? Who are those people hanging from the ceiling? What are all these bodies doing in the Necropolis? What happened here? And are we really alone? In my time with it, Little Nightmares 3 balanced the uncanny and the curious, and as anxious as I was about what was around the next corner, I was also eager to see more and piece together answers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If there's one thing I don't like about Little Nightmares 3, it's that there’s no local co-op. </p></div><p>If there's one thing I don't like about Little Nightmares 3, it's that there’s no local co-op. That said, you can play with a friend online even if only one of you owns the game, which goes a long way toward making up for it.</p><p>When my time with Little Nightmares 3 ended, I was sad to say goodbye to Low and Alone, but eager to visit the earlier games and see what I'd missed. Little Nightmares 3 is disquieting in the way horror should be while being an engaging co-op game that motivates you to push through the tension to see what's around the next corner. In fact, you might even call the balance uncanny. If Supermassive Games can continue to walk that line, Low and Alone are going to have a compelling journey indeed. I hope they make it.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

We recently played a 45-minute demo of one of the game's early chapters that shows off her newfound abilities to move between parallel realities with one major difference: In one world, her friend Safi is alive; in the other, she's been murdered, and the killer in the first reality may still be at-large, leading Max on an adventure to save her friend before it's too late.</p><p>We also spoke to the game's creative director, Jonathan Stauder, and narrative director Felice Kuan, about what went into building out this new story for Max, how she ended up in Vermont, and more on the lore surrounding the broader Life is Strange universe. You can read our Q&amp;A with the team below, before the game's debut on October 29.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Life Is Strange: Double Exposure Honors Both Endings of the Original Game | gamescom 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>Note: This interview has been edited for clarity.</p><p><strong>GameSpot: Does Double Exposure declare one ending from the first game canon, and if not, how does that work?</strong></p><p>Jonathan Stauder: Oh, no. Nope. So, in the course of starting up the game, playing the first couple of scenes, you will have the opportunity to say what occurred in the first game. From that point forward, you've determined your canon.</p><p><strong>Okay. I don't know if it would've made sense, but I was thinking, maybe she is shifting between two realities that spawned from the first game's ending.</strong></p><p>JS: Yeah, no. That's been a [source] of confusion. So just to be clear, the two realities are: Safi's alive and Safi's dead. Nothing with Arcadia Bay.</p><p><strong>And she's moved to Vermont, right? What went into that decision? I can understand the idea of, 'Let's get her out of the Pacific Northwest," but why Vermont specifically?</strong></p><p>Felice Kuan: I know that we wanted her far away, right? So symbolically, literally on the other side of the country [made sense]. I don't know if there was any other specific reason. I know that we were excited about winter, because the last game took place around Halloween, so then the next immediate season, you get winter, you get Christmas.</p><p><strong>So in a story about alternate realities, how can we be sure this is <em>our </em>Max from the first game? Why don't we need to worry about that?</strong></p><p>JS: Yeah, no, so it's <em>your</em> Max. Like we were saying, we give you that moment to sort of confirm what happened with that major choice. From that moment forward, you should feel confident as a player, like, "I'm taking the Max I knew from the first game forward into this one and evolving her."</p><p><strong>The plot reminds me of the movie Another Earth. Have you seen it and was that an inspiration?</strong> [Both developers confirm they haven't.]<strong> Do you have any other specific inspirations that led you to this story?</strong></p><p>FK: From the literary side, the multiverse [concept] is very, very in and very, very prevalent. And so I think we actually wanted--not that we weren't inspired, and not that we didn't check out other media--but we wanted very much to find Max's version of that. [What is her] meaningful intersection with multiverse ideas that Max could go through?</p><p>JS: And visually, I'm a huge fan of Remedy games and their own particular brand of weird and how they find their own way to do it, whether it's alt timelines, multiverses, that sort of thing. And so I think just as a jumping-off point, we're gonna find our own way to do this particular flavor of time travel across alt universes. I think, especially later in the game, you might see some visual flourishes that feel a little bit [like] Remedy.</p><p><strong>This series always uses lots of licensed music. Should fans expect more of that here? Can you speak to specific tracks or artists?</strong></p><p>JS: it'll be a bunch of things that you don't know yet, because they're all fresh and new and original for this game. My mandate for the soundtrack and the score was, you want kind of the story of Max and the story of Safi, and how they influence and intertwine and change one another, to echo in the music and the soundtrack. And so, hopefully, you play all five chapters, and you feel that. And I know there's a lot more about the music coming out before launch, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4362123-screenshot2024-09-04145156.png" data-ref-id="1300-4362123" data-ratio="0.55905511811024" data-width="1016" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4362123-screenshot2024-09-04145156.png" data-ref-id="1300-4362123"></a><figcaption>When Max attempts to use her long-dormant powers, she finds they've changed since last time.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4362123-screenshot2024-09-04145156.png"></figure><p><strong>I've seen fan sentiment suggesting bringing Max back is simply fan service. Can you explain why it's more than that?</strong></p><p>FK: I think once you've gone through this [game], it'll be very clear that this is [necessarily] Max's story. We all found the first game very formative and felt like after a huge choice like the one she has made, there is a ton to unpack. It's also pretty much the [same] amount of time that has passed since that game's story, so our own perspectives of what it meant, I think, give us something to say.</p><p>JS: Right, so if we're looking at a list of powers that would be good for these protagonists and we're looking at this shifting between two distinctly different timelines, I think [we found] that it was a good method for Max to maybe work through all those issues coming out of the first game, and provide catharsis. So we said that, 'Oh, man, this could be a good Max game.' We go down that rabbit hole discover, 'Oh, I think we're right.' And then here we are.</p><p><strong>Is there anything a Life is Strange game couldn't do in the first game that you could do now? This could be technical or narrative-related, or something else.</strong></p><p>JS: Yeah. I mean, for sure, from a technical perspective. So this is the first Life is Strange game in Unreal Engine 5. So visually, there are a massive number of improvements. You're gonna see that in all of our performances, the fidelity, the lighting, all those sorts of things [...] Like Max's new power, the shifting, the immediacy of it--where you can pop between two versions of a space without a load screen that sort of thing. That's certainly something you couldn't have done, even say back in [2021's] True Colors.</p><p>FK: We love the first game. I think we tried to do everything it does, but more. I think that the first game set a path for having different kinds of characters that you don't normally see, and being very explicit about topics like teen suicide, things like that [games] just don't do. And so I think now we're at a place with however many there have been now, where we can do that and do it even more openly, and have it be baked into the process.</p><p><strong>Do all of the Life is Strange games share a single story universe?</strong></p><p>JS: Oh yeah, one hundred percent. Everything that Don't Nod made, everything that Deck Nine has made, that's all one continuity. But if you go, like, into the comics, into the novels, that is where things start to get a little murky. But for sure, all of the published games to date take place in the same world.</p><p>GameSpot: So in one world, all these kids are discovering that they have these powers and they're potentially like the Avengers of troubled youths. Thematically, you want to express that these kids all discover their powers at their lowest point, is that right? Something traumatic is triggering it each time?</p><p>JS: Exactly.</p><p>KF: And that means that not every power is a good Life is Strange power because the powers are intimately tied to the specific trauma, and when you find a story background and a power that, like, click, it's exciting.</p><hr><p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure launches on October 29 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.

This free-to-play adventure has a lot of efficient mechanics to help players feel like they have choices in its massive world. However, you may be wondering if that extends to cross-progression and cross-play functionality. Well, we have good news and bad news--so let's dive in and find out.</p><h2>Does Throne and Liberty have cross-progression (AKA cross-save)?</h2><p>So, the bad news first: <strong>Throne and Liberty does not support cross-progression</strong> at this time. As such, if you purchase the game on more than one platform, you'll have to start entirely new accounts and characters on each.</p>

<p>Sadly, as of this writing, developer NCSoft has not announced any plans to add this functionality in the future, but we'll be sure to keep this updated if that changes.</p><h2>Does Throne and Liberty have cross-play?</h2><p>Now for the good news: <strong>Yes, Throne and Liberty supports cross-play</strong>.

            <p>
Helldiver 2's long-awaited third enemy faction, the Illuminate - previously seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> 1, but still conspicuously absent from its sequel - has briefly appeared in-game. Which hasn't stopped developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> from declaring the incident to be "fake news".
</p>
<p>
Players began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1f8ql19/illuminate_on_map/">reporting</a> strange sightings across <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a>'s Galactic War map (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-players-get-all-wound-up-as-galactic-map-briefly-reveals-the-presence-of-the-illuminate-but-arrowhead-ceo-dismisses-it-all-as-fake-news/">PC Gamer</a>) earlier today, beginning with a mysterious cluster of purple sectors where players had previously only seen red for Automaton incursions and orange for Terminids.
</p>
<p>
If it's near-incontrovertible proof of an Illuminate presence you're after, though, then look no further than the small purple symbol players discovered when rolling over one of the mysterious new purple sectors - a symbol long-time fans will immediately recognise as the <a href="https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Helldivers_1:The_Illuminate">circle-in-a-circle design</a> representing the Illuminate faction in Helldivers 1.

<p>
Unfortunately for players hoping for answers, developer Arrowhead's immediate response was to spin up the in-game lore machine and have its Super Earth Armed Forces High Command dismiss the whole thing as a "recent server outage" caused by a lost Comms Technician decomposing in a server farm somewhere. It's a typically cheeky response from the studio, but it's impossible to tell if Arrowhead really is teasing the Illuminate's imminent arrival (it certainly has form here), or if the whole incident genuinely was an unintended glitch.

<p>
Over on social media, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani has <a href="https://x.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1831310588238037302">responded to reports</a> of recent Illuminate sighting with two words: "fake news". That, of course, brings to mind the time Arrowhead chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-infested-with-winged-bugs-and-its-up-to-us-to-squash-them">dismissed players</a> who'd claimed to have seen flying Terminids in-game as nothing but "bug sympathesers", insisting "bugs can't fly" - shortly before their arrival was made official.
</p>
<p>
Hints the Illuminate will soon be making a proper Helldivers 2 debut comes as Arrowhead continues to grapple with the fallout from August's major <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-announced-with-higher-difficulty-new-bugs-and-more">Escalation of Freedom update</a>. Players were particularly unhappy with some of the changes made as part of the patch, resulting in Arrowhead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-studio-reveals-60-day-plan-of-action-following-recent-patch-outcry">committing to a 60-day plan</a> that would see it addressing "fundamental inconsistencies in our approach to game balance and game direction."

<p>There’s some concern surrounding the campaign length in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. On average, it will take approximately eight to ten hours to finish the story mode, which isn’t too long. However, much of the game’s lifespan revolves around its PvE mode, Operations, and its PvP mode, Eternal War. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-main-missions-in-space-marine-2">All Main Missions in Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>Most players will likely start their time in Space Marine 2 by playing through the campaign. It’s an excellent introduction to the game’s core mechanics, characters, and the various worlds you’ll explore in the PvE and PvP game modes. Again, the story mode includes full co-op and will take around ten hours to finish. It features six missions, all of which are further broken up into various chapters and segments. Each mission will take quite a bit of time to play through; praise be to checkpoints.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Skyfire</strong></li>



<li><strong>Severance</strong></li>



<li><strong>Machinus Divinitus</strong></li>



<li><strong>Servant of the Machine</strong></li>



<li><strong>Voidsong</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dawn’s Descent</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Trust me when I say you want to complete the story mode, especially the chapters on Demerium. It offers some of the most memorable moments in gaming!</p>



<p>Furthermore, you can replay the story, should you wish to relive the epic moments of the campaign as Titus. Once you finish the game, you’ll start on the Battle Barge, where you can interact with the terminal by the dropship to change game modes and choose missions. From here, you can select any of the game’s campaign missions and play through them again.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-operations-in-space-marine-2">All Operations in Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>You can tackle the game’s Operations, which are cooperative PvE missions, at any point during the campaign. They’re side stories that take place simultaneously alongside Titus’ storyline. Your objectives directly support the campaign’s actions. In total, there are six Operations:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Inferno</strong></li>



<li><strong>Decapitation</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vox Liberatis</strong></li>



<li><strong>Reliquary</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fall of Atreus</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ballistic Engine</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The Operations were designed for replayability. While the map layout and objectives remain mostly the same, it’s still fun to run through the hordes of enemies repeatedly for rewards, such as cosmetics, weapons, and armor pieces.</p>



<hr>



<p>I know many people are upset about the number of missions in the game, especially the Operations, but Saber Interactive has more coming, as per its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year one roadmap</a>!</p>

Where the circle layout usually only shows two factions – the Automatons and Terminids – and their progress as represented by red and orange colors, some were beginning to spot a third, purple color, gaining ground. Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1f8qlkb/so_this_just_popped_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Helldiver343</u></a> was one of the first to share their findings and posted a screenshot of the updated map before the changes “vanished.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/17/helldivers2-blogroll-1694726613946-1708210207931.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Hellidvers 2 players think the Illuminate are on the horizon.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The image suggests that a third enemy, likely the Illuminate, will soon rear its head, but many were quick to write it off as a glitch, mistake, or even fake. Players then grew more suspicious when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1f8ql19/illuminate_on_map/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>additional reports of purple map progress</u></a> started to show up. Developer Arrowhead Studios had been silent about the strange sightings, adding to the confusion. Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1f8qlkb/comment/llg8h2h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>MoonlitSaiyan</u></a> said that they “didn’t know what to believe” before an in-game message suggested that Arrowhead was already very aware of player concerns.</p><p>“Some Helldivers may have noticed a recent service outage in the Major Order Communication Display,” the message says. “The issue has since been resolved.”</p><p>Arrowhead continues, explaining that a Comms Technician got trapped in a server room and died due to “exposure,” resulting in “organic tissue degradation on electronic equipment.” Of course, the technician's family has already been fined for damages, too.</p><p>It’s gross and par for the course for Helldivers 2 in a few ways. Arrowhead has been known to mislead players in the name of liberty in the past, with one past example seeing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-just-quietly-added-flying-bugs-ceo-insists-bugs-cant-fly">the team deny the existence of flying Terminids</a> despite numerous first-hand reports that the bug faction had managed to mutate. Arrowhead eventually admitted that flying creatures had indeed started to sprout from the ground, so don’t be surprised if the Illuminate finally makes their grand entrance in the near future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The alien group has existed since the days of the original Helldivers but was thought to be extinct by the time the events of Helldivers 2 began. However, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-helldivers-2-players-are-convinced-the-illuminate-are-coming"><u>fans began to guess that they may soon return</u></a> shortly after launch thanks to the appearance of mysterious blue lasers in the sky. New models for the Illuminate have also <a href="https://x.com/HelldiversAlert/status/1766878355633164706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>leaked in the past</u></a>, so despite <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1768765861463035956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Arrowhead insisting that there is nothing to worry about</u></a>, all evidence has pointed to an eventual Illuminate takeover. That said, it's best to stay on your toes for something else or nothing at all until the studio has more to share.</p><p>Helldivers 2 launched in February and exploded into one of the biggest releases of the year. We gave it a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review"><u>our review</u></a>, saying, “Helldivers 2's combat feels fantastic, its missions stay fresh and interesting, and its smart progression system doesn’t nickel and dime you.” For more on what’s to come, you can read up on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-working-to-address-complaints-after-escalation-of-freedom-what-matters-most-now-is-action"><u>how Arrowhead plans to win back player trust in the coming months</u></a>.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

<p><em>Minecraft</em> is among the most successful and influential games of the early 21st century, winning many awards and selling over 300 million copies (so far) since its 2011 release. So it was only a matter of time before Hollywood gave us a feature film based on the 3D sandbox game, simply titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Minecraft_Movie"><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></a>. Sure, one might have reservations about yet another video game-based movie, but on the plus side, we've got Jason Momoa and Jack Black co-starring. And the first teaser is full of eye-popping candy-colored cubic visuals and sly references to the game that should please fans.</p>
<p>Within a year of <em>Minecraft</em>'s initial release, Mojang Studios was fielding offers from Hollywood producers about making a TV series based on the game, but the company wanted to wait for "the right idea." There was a 2014 attempt to crowd-source a fan film, but game creator Markus "Notch" Persson didn't agree to license that effort since he was already negotiating with Warner Bros. about developing a film based on the game. Thus began a long, convoluted process of directors and writers being hired and leaving the project for various reasons.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>When the dust finally settled, Jared Hess (who worked with Black on <em>Nacho Libre</em>) ended up directing. The COVID pandemic and 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike delayed things further, but filming finally wrapped earlier this year in Auckland, New Zealand—just in time for a spring 2025 theatrical release. Per the official synopsis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Eugene Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Jack Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative… the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Game players will recognize Steve as one of the default characters in <em>Minecraft</em>. The teaser is set to The Beatles' "Magical Mystery Tour" and opens with our misfits encountering a fantastical Tolkien-esque landscape—only with a lot more cube-like shapes, like a pink sheep with a cubed head. &nbsp;We get the aforementioned Piglins and other creatures before Black appears and dramatically announces with great fanfare, "I.... am Steve." Honestly, we'll probably watch it just for Black's performance alone.</p>
<p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> hits theaters in April 2025.</p>
