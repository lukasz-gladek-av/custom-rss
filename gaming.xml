<figure data-uuid="1165974a982f9"><a title="Switch 2 - Dbrand" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1165974a982f9/switch-2-dbrand.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>When Nintendo announced the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-reveals-first-new-joy-con-2-colours-for-switch-2">new alternative colour Joy-Con controllers for the Switch 2</a> this week, one thing became adamantly clear: it's quite possible that we'll never get any solid colour Joy-Con. Those little accents around the analogue sticks are likely all you'll see when the Joy-Con are attached to the console. And that's fine, y'know?</p>
<p>But if you're not especially pleased about this, then accessory manufacturer Dbrand might have you covered. The company has revealed that it is launching 'ColorMatched' skins that will effectively take the accented colours of the new Joy-Con and apply the same colour to the entire controllers. The result, provided to apply them properly, is pretty neat.</p>

<p>Now, we've never really been fans of Dbrand's 'edgy' humour, since it often borders on being completely unprofessional, but there's no denying its quality when it comes to controller skins. So if you're in the market and you want your Joy-Con controllers to look a bit more like the OG Switch, then it might well be something to look into. They cost <strong>$19.95</strong> directly from <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/skins/nintendo-switch-2-skins">Dbrand's website</a>.</p>
<p>As for the new 'Light Purple / Light Green' Joy-Con, these will launch very soon on <strong>12th February 2026</strong>. They'll set you back <strong>$99.99</strong> in the US and <strong>£74.99</strong> in the UK.</p>

In other words, a pretty awesome year for those that love variety and don't stick to a particular set of genres. Though, I bet there was some killer game for those people too, no matter what genre they play.</p><p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2025 Game of the Year Award for the best game of the year, whose sum of its parts is greater than any other.</p><ul><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>Hades II</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Silent Hill f</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/awards" rel="nofollow">Check out here</a>&nbsp;for our other award categories.</p><hr><picture>

  </picture><h2>Fifth Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><p>Developer: Team Cherry | Release Date: September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p>Everything about <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> just feels right. The movement, the animations, the frenetic pace to combat, the wonderfully weird world to explore... It's no surprise to see this rank on our list.</p><p>Sometimes <em>Silksong </em>can feel unfairly hard, but there is a certain ethos to most of the game. There's always an advantage to be found, a pattern to be learned. It's never cheap deaths, but certainly punishing ones as you learn new enemies or boss encounters (though I could do without some of those delivery quests).</p><p>As one of the most highly anticipated games in the last few years, I think <em>Silksong </em>lived up to expectations. There's a lot to love for action platformer fans, metroidvania fans, those that love the lore of the series, and just generally gaming fans as it's just solid through and through.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Fourth Place - Ghost of Yotei</h2><p>Developer: Sucker Punch Productions | Release Date: October 2nd, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>I got around to <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> in December, a couple of months after it was initially released. Maybe it’s because I was trying to avoid spoiling myself, but I didn’t see a great deal of talk about <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. At least, not when compared to other PlayStation exclusives.</p><p>Nonetheless, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> deserves your attention. It took TechRaptor’s top spot for Best Visual Design of 2025, and well, go figure. Take one look at the game and you’ll see why: It’s jawdroppingly gorgeous. The world is large but densely-packed, so it’s very easy to find yourself going off course and completing various quests or side objectives, though it also doesn’t feel like a collect-a-thon, a common pitfall many open world games fall into.</p><p>Outside of visuals, though, we get to see the journey of Atsu as she sets out on a journey of revenge many years in the making. She’s out to kill the Yotei Six, a group of evildoers that killed her family and now threaten to control all of Hokkaido.</p><p>In this quest for revenge, gameplay is a standout. Combat is smooth but weighty, as Atsu delivers devastating blows with her varied arsenal, including katanas, spears, and shinobi weapons. Atsu is more in-your-face than <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s Jin Sakai, so while you can resort to stealth, there’s a larger focus tackling your foes up front and in their face.</p><p>For a game as long as <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is, one would think combat gets stale after a while, but that never happened. Enough new weapons and enemies are introduced to make encounters feel fresh, and man, the feedback from that DuelSense is really somethin’ else.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Hades II</h2><p>Developer: Supergiant Games | Release Date: September 25th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Hades II builds on its predecessor in arguably every department, both in terms of quantity and quality. There are twice as many levels, even more bosses, and a nearly doubled soundtrack. All that centers around the already-impeccable gameplay loop that Supergiant built in the previous game.</p><p>It would be so easy to say<em> Hades II</em> is just its predecessor but bigger, and that captures a majority of it. It's a classic case of not breaking what worked so well while iterating to make parts of it fresh.</p><p>Playing as a witch instead of a warrior comes with some nuances, like how Melinoe has to play it safe at the start. But usually by the end of a run, you're melting entire rooms of enemies with a chaotic chain of curses and effects.</p><p><em>Hades II </em>features a satisfying combat gameplay loop peppered with narrative moments from characters in the Crossroads and out in the wild. Even the bosses all have their own stories, making the world feel that much richer.</p><p>So yes, <em>Hades II</em> is just <em>Hades </em>but better—but the first game didn't win our GOTY in 2020 for no reason, after all.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><p>Developer: Sandfall Interactive | Release Date: April 24th, 2025&nbsp;</p><p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p><p>Sandfall Interactive's <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> was a major success by all accounts for the studio. Their debut title managed to gain a spotlight in the gaming community thanks to its modern blend of stunning visuals, gripping character performances, and impressive symphonic musical score.</p><p>The biggest secret to its success is how <em>Clair Obscu</em>r manages to put a new look and feel on familiar turn-based RPG gameplay. While the individual elements aren't new to veterans of the genre, the distinct mix presented helped lower the barrier for many who were dismissive of the genre's merits.</p><p>For those accomplishments, this title deserves its spot.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Blue Prince</h2><p>Developer: Dogubomb | Release Date: April 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p><p>There hasn't been a game that I've thought about more this year. Stepping into Blue Prince you're met with an entertaining puzzle roguelite experience of trying to build your way through a house of ever-changing rooms. This simple plan gets bogged down as suddenly you need to learn how to unlock a door, or reach a basement, unlock a side gate or get into an orchard.</p><p>Blue Prince does a fantastic job of starting simple, with a clear goal for the player to complete, while simultaneously seeding in other mysteries and puzzles. By the time you are at the end of one thread, there are four or five other threads that have come up. Simple mechanics get iterated upon until you complete the game, and this serves as a fine point to step off the ride, but for those wanting further puzzles to complete the game doubles in length.</p><p>Blue Prince is a true indie development story of how time and a single great idea were able to capture the minds of thousands and leave us wanting just one more puzzle to complete, even after it's all over. Blue Prince joins the ranks of many other meta puzzle games that I'll be recommending to friends for years to come.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
       
    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/divinity-gen-ai-larian-bg3-reddit-ama-2000658429</link>
            <guid>1401550</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke has now shared more details about how the acclaimed RPG studio will be approaching the use of generative AI tools for developing its next game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><em>Divinity</em></a>. Speaking to fans in an AMA on Reddit, the director walked back a previous statement that Larian would use generative AI to help with references for concept art, but did say that <em>Divinity</em> could include gen-AI assets in the finished game as long as the studio is “100 percent sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data.”</p> <p>The gaming veteran landed in hot water last month <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">over comments in an interview with<em> Bloomberg</em></a> about how Larian was experimenting with AI tools in the production of its next game, including generating references for concept art, producing PowerPoints, and other early production work that could help speed up the prototyping trial and error phase. At the same time, the CEO doubled down on the idea that no AI elements would appear in the finished game and stated that the studio wasn’t turning to the controversial tools to try and cut its headcount.</p>

 <p>In today’s AMA, which was promised in response to the prior backlash, Vincke said that AI will no longer be used at all in the concept art phase, but did suggest the studio is looking at ways to use gen-AI tools trained exclusively on the company’s own material. Here’s his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">full statement</a>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>So first off – there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity.</p> <p>I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration. We already said this doesn’t mean the actual concept art is generated by AI but we understand it created confusion.</p> <p>So, to ensure there is no room for doubt, we’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development.</p> <p>That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art.</p> <p>Having said that, we continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out. The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is.</p> <p>We think GenAI can help with this and so we’re trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.</p> <p>The important bit to note is that we will not generate “creative assets” that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data. If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own.</p></blockquote> <p>Larian’s new position addresses two of the chief criticisms of generative AI tools. The first is that they’re used by companies to undercut and replace human creatives. The second is that they produce content stolen from the millions of people whose work they were trained on. A set of gen AI tools trained entirely on Larian’s own proprietary game assets could potentially side-step that second critique, though it also suggests that <em>Divinity</em> could include at least some assets that were generated with the help of AI.</p>

 <p>Developers have long used machine learning and procedural generation to help create pieces of a game that humans can then go and tweak as needed. It would be impossible to craft the beautiful cosmos of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> by hand. The bulk of its universe is generated from algorithms designed by the team at Hello Games. But as technology advances, algorithms have been able to produce more and more of the stuff that players might find in a finished game, leading many fans to balk at things like sloppy gen-AI loading screen art and even at the use of algorithms to generate spoken performances for NPCs, a subject of some controversy for <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"It's shaping up to be a monster."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Over two years after it was announced, Ubisoft is still working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-3">The Division 3</a>. And while it has yet to show off the game, its chief developer has said he thinks it will have as big an impact as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division">The Division 1</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Division 1 was announced at E3 2013 with a trailer that went down as one of the most talked about of the show. After a series of delays, The Division released on March 8, 2016, breaking sales records for Ubisoft. The Division 2 followed in 2019, although it failed to make as big a splash at launch as its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s no release date for The Division 3, the hope is Ubisoft will show it off at some point this year. Now, Julian Gerighty, executive producer of The Division franchise at Ubisoft’s Massive Entertainment, has provided a brief but tantalizing update.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking during the New Game+ Showcase 2026, Gerighty said: “So, The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret. It's been announced. It's shaping up to be a monster. I can't really say anything more than that. But this is, within these walls in Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will be as big an impact as Division 1 was.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not much to go on, but clearly Ubisoft is hoping that The Division 3 will rekindle memories of The Division 1, which was certainly a hot topic when it was announced and enjoyed huge sales when it eventually came out. The pressure is on to deliver, especially with Ubisoft’s recent high-profile struggles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, support for The Division 2 continues with various updates, and a team in Paris is putting the final touches of a The Division mobile game. The Division Heartland, a free-to-play spin-off, entered development in 2020 but was canceled in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two months ago, Massive Entertainment introduced what it called a 'voluntary career transition program,' (the studio asked its staff to volunteer to be laid off) as part of a move to focus on The Division franchise and its Snowdrop game engine. It came as part of significant restructuring at Ubisoft that has seen multiple studio closures and rounds of layoffs. Massive Entertainment's Star Wars Outlaws, released in 2024, was a big sales disappointment for Ubisoft, despite significant development and marketing costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Nearly a year ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-spin-off-gets-a-new-name-and-more-details/1100-6529319/" data-ref-id="1100-6529319">Krafton launched the beta test</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pubg-blindspot/" data-ref-id="5000-648845">PUBG: Blindspot</a>, the first-ever spin-off from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/" data-ref-id="5000-462692">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a> (not counting PUBG Mobile). Now, Krafton has announced that Blindspot is getting an early-access release on February 5.</p><p>This title differs from its predecessor by embracing a top-down perspective and focusing on 5v5 battles in a tactical showdown. Attacking teams are tasked with making their way through a building in order to break into a vault and install a device called the Decrypter. Specific weapons like grenade launchers and explosive hammers can break down the walls standing between the players and their goal. Defending players can set up barricades to slow down their adversaries, but these are battles that ultimately come down to gunplay.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PUBG: BLINDSPOT | Early Access Announcement Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The newly released trailer shows off some of the improvements coming to the early-access build, including enhanced visuals and UI, as well as balance adjustments and control refinements. Krafton describes it as a "launch-ready level of quality" in support of ongoing development.</p><p>"Early access will allow players to directly participate in the development process," said the game's production director, Seungmyeong Yang, in a statement. "Through free-to-play, open development, we aim to communicate closely with the community and complete PUBG: Blindspot together."</p><p>For now, PUBG: Blindspot will only be available on PC. The game is free-to-play, and Krafton has announced plans to support the game through monthly updates while incorporating player feedback via the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/pubgblindspot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord channel</a>.</p><p>Krafton has previously shared its desire to see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/krafton-wants-pubg-to-become-a-platform-similar-to-fortnite-and-roblox/1100-6533550/" data-ref-id="1100-6533550">PUBG become a platform like Fortnite</a>. The company has also taken some heat for its stated goal of becoming an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">"AI-first" company</a>. PUBG creator Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene has gone on record as saying that he is "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-says-he-is-really-heartened-about-the-backlash-to-ai-in-gaming/1100-6536304/" data-ref-id="1100-6536304">really heartened</a>" by the backlash to AI in the gaming space.</p><p>Greene is still affiliated with Krafton, but he is working on new titles including his open-world survival experience <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prologue-go-wayback/" data-ref-id="5000-505925">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>, which debuted in early access last year.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/" data-ref-id="5000-483376">Starfield</a> has had a somewhat divisive response from players since it debuted in 2023, but there is a Star Wars mod that transforms it into a more rewarding experience. The Star Wars: Genesis mod was released in 2024, but this year, it's adding lightsabers and a more immersive experience for Starfield PC players who want to take the plunge.</p><p>Star Wars: Genesis was created by a modder who goes by DeityVengy, and it's available for free on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/11114" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>. The mod features an original story that's set between the prequel and original Star Wars trilogies. There is an update coming before the end of January that adds even more content to the mod, and DeityVengy showed off some of those new features in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMqk-PvEak" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmMqk-PvEak" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the video, DeityVengy notes that using a lightsaber forces players into a first-person perspective because Starfield's melee animations weren't up to the challenge of depicting lightsaber combat. The story featured in this clip also focuses on the player's character confronting one of the Nightsisters of Dathomir before letting them decide whether to spare or slay her.</p><p>On the <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mod's official site</a>, DeityVengy states that Lucasfilm provided "express permission" for the Star Wars music used in this mod, which is sourced from Star Wars games like Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2, The Force Unleashed, and Star Wars: The Old Republic. DeityVengy also acknowledges that the mod uses "licensed AI-generated voices" as well real voice actors.</p><p>Star Wars: Genesis is only available for players who have Starfield on PC. Bethesda has previously confirmed that Starfield will get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-getting-a-second-story-dlc-and-more/1100-6534318/" data-ref-id="1100-6534318">an additional story DLC</a>, and some of its new features were recently disclosed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-second-dlc-reportedly-pushed-back-because-of-gta-6-delay/1100-6537116/" data-ref-id="1100-6537116">during a closed-door preview</a>.</p>

              <p>Following <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-ninja-shroud-embark-patch-2000657708">a number of high-profile streamers stating they had had enough of a new plague of cheating</a> in extraction shooter hit&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, developers Embark have responded with word that “significant changes” are coming to try to address the issues.</p> <p>Posting to the official Discord for the game, Embark’s community lead OssenJ assured players that the developer was aware of the conversation, and “taking this issue very seriously.” Assuring that feedback was being heard, she continues, “Over the next few weeks, we are implementing significant changes to our rulesets and deploying new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters.”</p>

 <p>It seems Embark was a little slow in responding to the growth of cheating due to much of the team being away for winter vacation, and having to play catch-up on their return. However, with everyone back hopefully things will start changing. The plans include “updating our Anti-Cheat systems for improved detection and bans,” and speaking directly to one of the main sources of complaint, “applying client-side fixes specifically addressing the ‘out of map’ glitch.” There are also plans to bring in measures and tools for streamers to “help mitigate stream sniping”—the issue where players can see where streamers are on a map and what they’re doing, and using this to the sniper’s advantage.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658426">© Discord / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s not clear if these measures will be enough to address the concerns of some of those who’ve previously spoken out. Alongside the likes of Ninja and Shroud yelling at Embark to improve things, Nadeshot argued that the only hope he sees is for the studio to put into practice the tactics of Epic, where legal action is threatened (and carried out) against those who supply cheating software and aids. Others pointed out Epic is a multi-billion dollar company with the <em>Fortnite</em> infinite money machine, whereas Embark is a small-ish Swedish developer on their second game. However, Embark is a subsidiary of Korean firm Nexon, which itself is worth around $20 billion, so it’s not&nbsp;<em>impossible</em>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My experience on Arc Raiders over the last week has been hell. Just to be clear, I love this game and think it’s already moved in to my personal top 10 all time.</p> <p>But the egregious amount of cheating genuinely might be worse than peak Call of Duty. I’m not trying to bring…</p> <p>— 100T Nadeshot (@Nadeshot) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nadeshot/status/2007926647295492467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Given the anti-cheating measures are due “over the next few weeks,” we won’t immediately know how much improvement they bring. And for the less violent players, it’s likely you are being matchmade with other PvE-orientated players, and as such completely avoiding any cheating altogether.</p>

<p>A new Born In Chaos Battle Pass accompanies the arrival of South Park to Fortnite. As with all passes, it comes loaded with customizable items and conditions that need to be met. This guide looks at the South Park and Fortnite Battle Pass’ end date, and more.</p>



<p>Everyone is goin’ down to South Park to have themself a time. If you didn’t know, it’s full of friendly faces everywhere, humble folks without temptation. Non-South Park fans might struggle to get the joke, but rest assured, many of you will. The cartoon series has left an indelible imprint on society and culture.</p>



<p>It’s still incredible to think that a child-friendly game like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> has crossed over with South Park, but it’s better for it. The new Born In Chaos Battle Pass is at the heart of the collab’s progress.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-the-fortnite-amp-south-park-battle-pass-end">When Does The Fortnite &amp; South Park Battle Pass End?</h2>

<p><strong>All Fortnite players have until February 5 to wrap up every challenge and complete all the content in the South Park Born In Chaos Battle Pass that was brought in alongside the mini-season update.</strong></p>



<p>If you go to the Born In Chaos pass screen and look in the top-left corner, you’ll see a live timer that says ‘Event Ends In.’ This is a constant reminder of how long you have to enjoy the South Park drop.</p>



<p>Eventually, it will hit zero, and it will be on February 5. After this, the AWESOM-O content and pass will be gone.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-the-fortnite-amp-south-park-battle-pass-cost">How Much Does The Fortnite &amp; South Park Battle Pass Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>The Born In Chaos Battle Pass is completely free in Fortnite, and everyone is entitled to claim rewards from it.</strong></p>



<p>You don’t need to acquire V-Bucks or spend your current V-Bucks to obtain the South Park pass. It’s a free addition, and all rewards from it can be earned as normal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Devs Fired Over Leaks Sent to Influencers, Rockstar Says]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-devs-fired-over-leaks-sent-to-influencers-rockstar-says/</link>
            <guid>1401511</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rockstar has stated that GTA 6 employees were fired in 2023 and 2025 after leaking confidential information to third parties, who were reportedly influencers. </p>



<p>Rockstar, the developer of GTA 6, is under investigation for alleged union-busting. However, the company firmly denies these claims, stating that the recent firing of 34 employees was due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-game-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaking of features</a>. This situation has prompted the community to speculate about the nature of these leaks.</p>











<p>A Rockstar spokesperson has shared additional details about the recent firings in a statement to <a href="https://in.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-vi/250412/news/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, remaining firm that leaking was the only reason for the decision. The statement comes in response to IWGB’s claims, which state that Rockstar “broke the law” when it fired these employees, who were “organising for better conditions.” </p>



<p>The GTA 6 developers state that they took action against employees from the UK and Canada for sharing “highly confidential information”, including revealing game features from upcoming and unannounced titles, in an “insecure and public social channel.” This action was considered “a breach of long-standing and well-understood confidentiality policies.”</p>



<p>Rockstar adds that the channel that these employees were using consisted of “25 non-Rockstar employees”, including devs from competitor teams, a video game journalist, and other unidentified members. Employees who posted “union-supportive messages” and didn’t breach their policies weren’t fired. </p>



<p>It was revealed that a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK, was fired in April 2025 for sharing information with a third party, who then posted it to social media. Additionally, an employee was fired in November 2023 in the US and in November 2025 in India for two more acts of leaking GTA 6 information. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Rockstar has pointed to its well-established zero tolerance approach to leaks, highlighting that it dismissed a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK in April 2025, who it alleged disclosed confidential information about GTA 6 to a third party who published the information to social…</p>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/2009055571190653411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-community-speculates-leaks-from-2023-and-gameroll-could-be-true">GTA 6 Community Speculates Leaks From 2023 and Gameroll Could Be True</h2>



<p>Since the November 2023 firing was revealed, a Reddit post from the same year has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q775cn/potential_gta_6_plot_leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">come into the limelight</a>, with players speculating that it could be the information that led to the employees’ firing. The leak itself talks about the plot and some new game mechanics. Players are also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1q6xoma/gamerolls_leak_basically_confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suspecting</a> that the leaks from Gameroll, who accurately predicted Jason and Lucia’s last names, could be true as well. </p>



<p>However, players should note that this is just speculation, and there is no official confirmation that these were the GTA 6 leaks that led to the employees being fired. </p>







<p>In other news, GTA 6 might not be content complete, and it is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-might-not-be-content-complete-hard-to-say-if-it-will-be-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard to say</a>” whether the game will be delayed again. Additionally, we almost received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-tokyo-almost-happened-says-former-rockstar-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Tokyo</a> title.

		<p>I’ve been ill. Wallowing in a horrible flu-ridden morass, and sleeping a hell of a lot. I have had some companions through this Lemsip-flavoured fog, though, and I’ve especially loved my time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/07/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-review/">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>. This is a football game that doesn’t feel like a football game, and it’s just a cracking JRPG that happens to feature kicking a ball. Besides that, I’ve been playing the demo for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/06/a-surprise-dragon-quest-7-reimagined-demo-is-coming-this-week/">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>, and that’s just lovely, while I’ve been balancing things out with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontier of Pandora’s</a> bombastic newest expansion, From The Ashes.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> was first up this week, and he’s played Ghost of Yotei, Borderlands 4, and also delved into Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, though he worries, “I’m trapped beneath countless open-world games!”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been revisiting a couple of his favourites after wrapping up his playthrough Mafia: The Old Country (which was also a great game). He says, “For the first time in many months, I stepped back into the sandbox realm of Calradia for Mount &amp; Blade 2’s War Sails expansion. As the name implies, this DLC is all about naval gameplay, having also introduced a Viking-influenced faction. I’m learning the ropes of how to run my own ship while making lucrative trade runs between cities, hoping to save enough to buy a big ‘ol warship.”</p>
<p>He continues, “I’ve also been playing Warhammer 40,000: Darktide after picking up the post-launch character DLCs. The nimble, punk-styled Hive Scum is fun to play as though I’ve decided to main the Arbites class, channelling my inner Judge Dredd as I dole out justice beneath the Undercity.”</p>


<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Aran</strong> has played a bit of Star Wars Outlaws, but most of his time has been split between Big Hops and MIO: Memories In Orbit for review.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> “thinks” he finished Hades 2 this week. That’s not due to some Roguelike dementia, but rather the difficulty level, saying, “There’s a few challenges remaining but they are well beyond my abilities. All in all, what an incredible game!” He also played ‘real-life’ games, telling us, “My son and I had an epic battle of Warhammer 40k down our local games shop. His Tyranids versus my Battle Sisters, pretty much everyone died after an epic battle, with us drawing on victory points. It was great fun and we’re booked in again for a rematch next week!”</p>

<p>And finally for this week, <strong>Tef</strong> has been having fun with skirting board in his free time, so hasn’t really carried on from his holiday Switch 2 gaming. And the thing that he has played? He can’t tell you about it until Monday.</p>
<p>What about you? Have you played any New Year games?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>Note. At the time of publication, the Switch 2 update is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/psa-stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-update-and-european-release-on-the-way">not yet live</a> on European eShops. However, it is accessible from the North American eShop if you have a Nintendo Account from that territory.</em></p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:195779 @ 1767966560 -->
<hr>
<p>I’ve spent close to 300 hours with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> since it landed on Switch in 2018. That feels like rookie numbers compared to other people, but even with the portability, the Switch version has always been <em>slightly</em> behind other versions in the multiplayer department, which is where ConcernedApe’s surprise Christmas treat comes in handy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley</a> on Switch 2 is almost the best way to play the game (without mods) – just a few bugs, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2004474989119160737">which the developer is currently working on</a>, hold it back from perfection.</p>
<p>I’ll start with the Iridium-quality stuff: Mouse Mode. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-oh-no-im-not-a-fan-of-switch-2s-mouse-mode-at-all">I don’t really like Mouse Mode</a>, but here, it's perfect for two aspects of Stardew Valley that were always a bit finicky with a controller: decorating and inventory management.</p>
<p>The former is now effortless, as with the click of a button and drag of the Joy-Con 2, you can move or pop down furniture without relying on your character’s positioning. I no longer need to block out multiple days of in-game time to decorate my house. The latter also eliminates the need to use the shoulder buttons to shuffle through pages, making my speedy Skull Cavern dives a breeze.</p>
<p>I thought Mouse Mode would be good for farming, but this still only works if you’re right next to whatever you need to till or hoe. Not a big deal, but the other two uses make it a vast improvement over solely relying on the controller, which makes tabletop play a dream.</p>
<p>Online multiplayer now supports up to eight players; this was bugged on launch day, but quickly fixed. Five of us got together on a brand new co-op farm and, after a few days of running around, fighting over where to plant seeds, buying and selling random junk, fishing, and ganging up on the same trees to chop them down, it was pretty flawless, save a few little pauses and stutters when others moved between areas.</p>
<p>Improved split-screen co-op is another huge boon, as you can now play with up to three other people on the same farm on the same screen. The magic of better processing power! Or you can GameShare with up to three others to Switch 2 <em>or</em> Switch 1 – this works perfectly in handheld mode, but docked, the bottom half of the screen gets distorted.</p>
<p>There’s also a <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2006086790311272546">crafting bug</a> at the time of writing which causes some items to disappear; most of the recipes affected are pretty easy to avoid for me, but it’s something to be aware of.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this is Stardew Valley as you know it. Between three different farms and playing on friends' and families’ save files, I can safely say that this is one of my favourite games ever, and the best farming sim of all time. And once it's fully up-to-date, Switch 2 might rival PC as the best place to play it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

  </picture><h2>Fifth Place - Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</h2><p>Developer: The Game Kitchen | Release Date: July 31st, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>It’s been a hot minute since we’ve seen <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> in 2D (it’s been, well, decades) so it was about time we saw this coveted series go back to its roots with <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>.</p><p>With <em>Blasphemous</em> developer The Game Kitchen at the helm of this project, we’re met with a hard-as-nails, fast-paced 2D platformer that feels like a faithful homage to <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> of yesteryear.</p><p>Ryu Hayabusa takes the bench as two new characters get some time to shine: &nbsp;. These two become fused together and have a wide range of exciting powers at their disposal. The player feels like the ultimate badass, slashing through demon enemies like butter and avoiding obstacles with the finesse only a shinobi can accomplish.</p><p>Furthermore, the two ninja’s personal dynamic holds a lot of promise too, so here’s hoping The Game Kitchen brings us a sequel!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Fourth Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><p>Developer: Team Cherry | September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is an experience that can easily be overshadowed by the fervent attitude of its fans. There was an almost zealous anticipation for Team Cherry's follow-up to the critically acclaimed <em>Hollow Knight</em>. That anticipation continued to grow in excitement as the developers went radio silent over years of development.</p><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> releasing this year wasn't just a release, it was an event. An event so momentous it crashed all major digital game storefronts; a feat no other release this year pulled off.</p><p>As for the game itself, it is a remarkable achievement of an action-platformer. It builds upon the foundation of its predecessor, pushes the limits of exploration and difficulty, interweaving it with a narrative about the dangers of organized religion.</p><p>For that achievement, Team Cherry's sophomore effort deserves its praise.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Ball x Pit</h2><p>Developer: Kenny Sun | Release Date: October 15th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Every now and then, an indie game comes around and mashes a couple well-known genres together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. That's exactly what<em> Ball x Pit</em> does. It takes the tried-and-true formula of <em>Arkanoid </em>and twists it into a roguelike, with a dollop of city building and pinball to round it all out.</p><p><em>Ball x Pit</em> has that classic "just one more run" hook to it, especially since each run only lasts a couple minutes. Punctuating each run is a little bit of base building, which slowly snowballs into arguably the more important part of the game.</p><p>The <em>Arkanoid</em>-style gameplay starts out pretty fun, and it only evolves into something more clever as you unlock more characters, items, and abilities. You'll find different strategies based on specific builds, and the endless combinations and low-stakes gameplay makes it so easy to lose hours to what was supposed to be one or two runs.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Dispatch</h2><p>Developer: AdHoc Studio | Release Date: October 22nd, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>When<em> Dispatch</em>’s main character, Robert Robertson gets defeated by a villain, leaving his mechanical suit in shambles, he’s out of a job and rent is due. He still wants to make a difference with his strong sense of justice, and as fate would have it, he’s given an offer he can’t refuse: dispatch heroes for Torrance, California’s Superhero Dispatch Network, and they’ll help him get back on his feet and repair his suit.</p><p>While at first glance <em>Dispatch </em>plays like any other “choose your own adventure” type of deal, where your choices have impacts on the outcome of the story, this game innovates by fusing a strong narrative with the interactable dispatching mini-game.</p><p>With <em>Dispatch</em>’s lovable cast of villain-turned-heroes, Robert will send them from job-to-job in order to fight crime. Take into consideration if a hero is suited for the job, or else you might experience failure; though, failure isn’t always a bad thing as the writing leads to some pretty funny outcomes. In between your dispatching job, the narrative that gradually amps up over eight strong episodes is sure to capture your heart as much as it did for us at TechRaptor.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Blue Prince</h2><p>Developer: Dogubomb | Release Date: April 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p><p>In a world of AAA titles and never-ending sequels and remakes, it's always incredible when such a unique indie experience comes along. <em>Blue Prince</em> is an outstanding game with a simple idea that gets iterated upon, and iterated again, and used in ways that will break your brain to try to interpret.</p><p>Tonda Ros' story of creating <em>Blue Prince</em> is one that perfectly embodies the spirit of Indie game development. After enjoying games and seeing documentaries like <em>Indie Game The Movie</em> came the realization 'Yeah, I can probably do that'.&nbsp;</p><p>Eight years later, <em>Blue Prince</em> released as a game that you can "complete" in what you can consider a normal amount of time, rewarding players' interest and lateral thinking. Though, for those who are as interested in puzzle solving as Ros is for putting puzzles together, you'll get rewarded time and time again as you dig deeper and new discoveries teach you about an incredible larger world without leaving the grounds of the mansion.</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> has truly infected my mind and the mind of many other gamers wanting to scratch just that little bit deeper. It more than deserves it's place as the Indie GOTY.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-invicta">Terra Invicta</a> publishers Hooded Horse are imposing a strict ban on generative AI assets in their games, with company co-founder Tim Bender describing it as an “ethics issue” and “a very frustrating thing to have to worry about”. </p>
<p>“I fucking hate gen AI art and it has made my life more difficult in many ways… suddenly it infests shit in a way it shouldn’t,” Bender told <a href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179">Kotaku</a> in a recent interview. “It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, ‘no fucking AI assets.'” I assume that's not a verbatim quote, but I'd love to be proven wrong.</p>
<p>The publishers also take a dim view of using generative AI for “placeholder” work, or indeed any ‘non-final’ aspect of game development. “We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process because some of them might otherwise think, ‘Okay, well, maybe what I’ll do is for this place, I’ll put it as a placeholder,’ right?” Bender went on. </p>
<p>“Like some, people will have this thought, like they would never want to let it in the game, but they’ll think, ‘It can be a placeholder in this prototype build.’ But if that gets done, of course, there’s a chance that that slips through, because it only takes one of those slipping through in some build and not getting replaced or something.” As an example of this slipping-through, see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner">the accidental presence of a generated placeholder in The Alters</a>.

</p><p>Hooded Horse employ two artists for marketing, and Bender feels “it would be a betrayal of them to work with anything that is using gen-AI art, like, I wouldn’t be able to face them if we had that right. And we’re absolutely committed ethically, for all the reasons you know, against this.”</p><p>As with much discussion of generative AI, the difficulty of Hooded Horse’s position is pinning down what they're trying to ban. Does an artwork count as generated if somebody used the tech to make a base image of some kind, then fleshed it out and finished it off at length by hand? In general, genAI has become pervasive and hard to quantify across the divisions of game development, thanks not least to the deliberately imprecise, all-enveloping language of the companies selling it. There’s the gloomy underlying reality that a lot of genAI tools are being forced into operating systems and search engines in order to artificially boost “uptake” - it's hard <em>not</em> to use genAI, at this stage. </p>
<p>I write all this not to suggest that bans are useless, but that they need to be more detailed and specific. In general, whether they favour the tech or not, companies need to start talking in-depth about their usages of generative AI. As a small and slightly weird example from the world of education, James Allen’s Girls School in South London recently unveiled an <a href="https://www.flipsnack.com/jamesallensgirlsschool/jags-ai-charter-and-curriculum">AI charter</a>, stipulating what they consider fair game both for teachers and for pupils.</p>
<p>I’d love to see similar documents from publishers, though I’m not expecting miracles in a world where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">the largest PC storefront’s approach to generative AI disclosures is practically useless</a>. But still, perhaps Larian will surprise me at their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-announce-plans-to-let-folks-ask-anything-about-their-generative-ai-use-asserting-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation">imminent Q&amp;A about generative AI usage in the forthcoming Divinity</a>.</p>
<p>Bender acknowledged the trickiness of policing generative AI when working with external partners, while reiterating the need for a blunt ban. “The reality is, there’s so much of it going on that the commitment just has to be that you won’t allow it in the game, and if it’s ever discovered, because this artist that was hired by this outside person slipped something in, you get it out and you replace it. That has to be the commitment. It’s a shame that it’s even necessary and it’s a very frustrating thing to have to worry about.”</p><p>As an example of the difficulty of policing generative AI usage by third parties, consider the discovery of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/publisher-reveals-and-immediately-cancels-new-postal-game-after-fans-accuse-it-of-using-ai-generation">AI-generated material in trailers for Postal: Bullet Paradise</a>, which has now been cancelled - developers Goonswarm have attributed this oversight to external artists.</p>
<p>The minutiae of different genAI applications aside, the broad cultural or political case against generative AI has, IMO, remained pretty consistent (yes, this is the point in the 'news post' where I deliver the customary lecture, please skip to the comments if you are weary of such things). The biggest bots operate by parasitically appropriating and undermining the work of theoretically any and all human workers, whether or not you define this as actual theft or copyright infringement. Their actual utility beyond the grand promises is broadly unproven, and in some cases, obviously non-existent.</p>
<p>Being companies, the companies pushing them aren’t following the public interest: they are helping to drive up energy usage and emissions, and saturating daily life with “companion” technologies that may distort online discourse and in some cases, contribute to mental illness. Within the games industry, the tech is viewed by many executives and shareholders as a quick fix for unsatisfactory profit margins, and a tacit excuse for cutting staff.</p>
<p>That doesn’t make every usage of generative AI abominable – I can understand the appeal for smaller devs with minimal resources, and I am myself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">interested in art that makes genuinely imaginative and substantial use of generators of all kinds</a>, rather than just calling on them to “enhance productivity” - providing those technologies are responsibly operated.</p>
<p>But generative AI needs to be understood as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">a form of class war</a> that will principally benefit the already-filthy-rich, and which is fundamentally anti-social in encouraging greater reliance on profit-driven corporate tools rather than solidarity with coworkers and peers.</p>
<p>Lecture over! For a more open-ended and nuanced discussion of generative AI in games, here's Sam Horti's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horrible-boring-and-cheap-experts-pan-new-chatbot-npcs-but-some-leave-room-for-optimism">recent excellent catch-up</a> with a brace of developers, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">80 Days</a> and Thirsty Suitors writer Meghna Jayanth and Failbetter's narrative director Chris Gardiner.</p>

<p>Use these active Roblox Fireworks Playground monthly redeem codes to get your hands on free rewards like coins and more.</p>



<p>Fireworks Playground is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-walk-or-die-codes/">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a vibrant world of pyrotechnics and explosive celebrations. Players can immediately begin lighting various fireworks upon launch, and from there, progress through the game to unlock the best pyrotechnic displays available. With over 2,163 different fireworks to collect and launch, ranging from simple firecrackers to elaborate multi-shot aerial displays, pyrotechnic enthusiasts will have a fantastic time playing Fireworks Playground.</p>



<p>Having been released in beta during 2023, Fireworks Playground has gradually gained traction over the course of the following years and now boasts a dedicated player base with over 360,000 members. The game, developed by Pseudo Studio (specifically by creators PseudoDaemon and YuckMaster), offers a unique experience where players can enjoy realistic firework sounds and visuals year-round without annoying their neighbors.</p>







<p>Although simply lighting fireworks is enough for players to earn coins to unlock more spectacular displays, using redeem codes to get some extra rewards is never a bad idea.</p>

<p>Redeeming Fireworks Playground codes is a fairly straightforward matter, and they have made sure that even newer players to the game can navigate to the codes section and claim their rewards without too much fuss. Here’s how:</p>

<li>Scroll through the menu and click on ‘Code’</li>



<li>Paste or type the code into the textbox</li>



<li>Click on confirm and enjoy the freebie</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-fireworks-playground-codes">Where to get more Fireworks Playground Codes</h2>



<p>Fireworks Playground codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Pseudo Studio Discord server, which has a dedicated codes channel where all new codes are posted first, and the developer’s social media accounts (specifically the PseudosStudios X page) where they announce updates and milestones for this popular pyrotechnic-inspired game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

		<p>Ghost Ship Games has announced details for Deep Rock Galactic’s new season, including the name, date, key art and other content details. Deep Rock Galactic Season 6 is called Relics of Hoxxes and it will begin on January 29th for PC, with the console release coming two weeks afterwards on February 12th. While a new trailer for all the content has not been released, you can check out some new cosmetics.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/n8LG8V0hnws?si=zh8bceNSbjK8nUw5</p>


<p>In Deep Rock Galactic Season 6 Relics of Hoxxes, players will be sent to the new biome of the Ossuary Depths with the new Heavy Excavation mission giving the objective to find and dig up Resinite Mass deposits to send spaceward. It will not be smooth mining though as along with the normal Glyphids players will also need to deal with the new Ossiran enemies that have their own attacks to use.</p>
<p>The ‘Relic Raider’ DLC Pack, which is what the trailer above shows, will include the Relic Raider’ Armour Framework for all four classes, one ‘Relic Raider’ headgear for each class, the ‘Relic Raider’ Armour Paintjob for all armor sets, the ‘Relic Raider’ Weapon Paintjob, the ‘Relic Raider’ Pickaxe Framework, the ‘Relic Raider’ Pickaxe Paintjob, the ‘Relic Raider’ Bosco Framework, and the ‘Relic Raider’ Bosco Paintjob. The pack will be released at the same time as Season 6 on January 29th.</p>

With 4K resolution at 27 inches, text and gaming graphics were both incredibly sharp and easy on the eyes. It’s <em>also</em> a dual-mode 4K 240Hz or 1080p 480Hz panel, so you can switch to an even higher refresh rate.</p><p>It’s not the brightest or highest-resolution screen we saw at CES, where brilliant 5K 1,500-nit monitors were also on display — this one has 1,000-nit peaks — but it’s the one I’d pick for work and play. Asus might be one of the first to use it in the ROG Swift OLED PG27UCWM, which’ll have DisplayPort 2.1a, HDMI 2.1, and a 90W USB-C port so you can dock and charge a laptop, but it didn’t share price or availability. <em>— Sean Hollister, senior editor</em></p><div><p id="best-keyboard"><h2>Best keyboard</h2></p></div><p>There are always a lot of cool keyboards at CES. This year might be one of the best, if only because among all of the new, interesting models was Corsair’s $350 Galleon 100 SD that’ll be available later this month. It’s a full-size wired mechanical keyboard that just so happens to have a Stream Deck built in. Its greatest feat is that it manages to not look like a botched experiment.</p><p>While part of the Stream Deck’s appeal comes from the fact that it’s typically sold as a peripheral, set off to the side on your desk where you can easily reach it to mute your mic, launch an app, or configure your smart lights, it looks and feels right at home fused into this keyboard. This particular hardware is closest to a Stream Deck Plus, with a screen, two rotary knobs, and 12 buttons, each of which can be customized however you’d like via Elgato’s vast marketplace of app plug-ins, icons, sounds, and more.</p><p>The Galleon looks cutting-edge, although the keyboard aspect doesn’t necessarily stand out compared to many models already available. It has Corsair’s own mechanical switches, a hot-swappable PCB, up to 8,000Hz polling rate, and it can be configured in the company’s browser-based utility, negating the need for a software download. I’m actually using the Galleon to type this, and I don’t have much to complain about so far. <em>— Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor</em></p><div><p id="best-tv"><h2>Best TV</h2></p></div><p>TCL made a bold move for CES 2026. Instead of focusing mainly on RGB LEDs like its competitors, it instead went all in on its new X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, which uses blue LEDs like the mini-LED TVs we’re familiar with. But there are two major improvements TCL made that set it apart, and that you won’t find on any other TV this year.</p><p>The X11L uses reformulated quantum dots that provide more color and an upgraded color filter TCL calls UltraColor Filter that delivers more accurate color. The two combine to cover 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space. It’s an innovation that I expect will eventually filter into other, more affordable models — both from TCL and other manufacturers. In addition to the vibrant colors, the X11L is capable of reaching 10,000 nits of peak brightness and has up to 20,000 dimming zones.</p><p>The innovation doesn’t come cheap, with the smallest X11L at 75 inches going for $6,999.99, but by the end of the year, it will very possibly be almost half that price. — <em>John Higgins, senior TVs and audio reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-smart-home-device"><h2>Best laptop</h2></p></div><p>Asus is back for round two with its ROG Zephyrus Duo dual-screen gaming laptop, and I think this one could be a real knockout. The new Duo has two matching edge-to-edge 16-inch OLED displays, up to RTX 5090 graphics, an Intel Panther Lake processor, and a removable wireless keyboard / trackpad deck. It’s a clamshell laptop, a top-and-bottom or side-by-side multiscreen setup, and even a tented convertible all-in-one machine. Dual-screen laptops are nerdy fun, but I’ve seen firsthand how handy they are for productivity in my time testing the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. Taking that power-user formula to a gaming laptop seems like a recipe for success in my book.</p><p>We sadly still don’t know the price of the new Zephyrus Duo — just that it’s due out in Q2 2026. Dual-screen laptops will always be a pricier niche, and I’m afraid it’s gonna be really up there; especially with two large OLEDs and the ongoing RAM shortage. Here’s to hoping the premium over the Zephyrus G16 it’s based on isn’t astronomical, because it looks awesome. I can’t wait to review it and see how I can simultaneously mix work and play on its lovely dual displays. <em>— Antonio G. Di Benedetto, laptop reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-smart-home-device-1"><h2>Best smart home device</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Image: Jennifer Pattison Tuohy</cite></p></div><div><p>Smart locks were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/603957/uwb-hands-free-unlocking-schlage-aliro-apple-samsung-hands-on">once again the smart home stars of the show</a>, with companies launching models <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853844/ultraloq-ces-smart-lock-face-palm-reading">featuring palm-</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/852978/switchbot-lock-vision-deadbolt-facial-recognition">facial-recognition</a> unlocking, as well as a new type of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/851239/lockin-v7-max-optical-wireless-palm-vein-smart-lock-video-doorbell">wireless charging</a>.</p></div><p>But the standout was <a href="https://us.aqara.com/products/smart-lock-u400">the Aqara Smart Lock U400</a> — not because of any particular innovation on Aqara’s part. It’s a fairly standard-looking smart lock. Rather, it represents how open standards, interoperability, and some genuinely cool technology are making the smart home smarter and easier to use.</p><p>The first smart lock to support <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180813/apple-home-hands-free-unlock-smart-lock-uwb-wwdc-2024">Apple’s hands-free Home Key unlocking</a> using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/603957/uwb-hands-free-unlocking-schlage-aliro-apple-samsung-hands-on">ultra-wideband technology</a>, the U400 can <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTLDTD_jiNW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">securely unlock as you approach</a> with your phone in your pocket or your Apple Watch on your wrist. As a Matter-over-Thread device, it can work with any Matter-compatible smart home platform, including Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Home Assistant, and Samsung SmartThings.</p><p>While this magical hands-free unlocking experience (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854757/aqara-u400-apple-home-key-hands-free-uwb">I tested the lock</a> ahead of CES and it works very well) is currently limited to Apple, the U400 is Aliro-ready. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/854091/aliro-smart-lock-standard-launches-2026-apple-uwb-nfc%E2%80%99">Aliro is a smart lock standard</a> developed by Apple, Samsung, Google, and lock and chip makers that will bring Home Key-style hands-free unlocking — along with NFC tap-to-unlock — to Android phones and watches. That’s a meaningful step toward solving the fragmentation and ecosystem lock-in that has long plagued the smart home. — <em>Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, senior smart home reviewer </em></p><div><p id="best-car"><h2>Best car</h2></p></div><p>My pick for best car at CES was kind of a no-brainer, because it was the only thing real enough for us to test ourselves. That would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/852880/nvidia-autonomous-driving-demo-tesla-fsd">Mercedes’ Drive Assist Pro</a>, which is a Level 2 partially autonomous driver assist feature for city driving as well as highways.</p><p>The system is powered by five radar sensors, 10 cameras, and 12 ultrasonic sensors. And all that sensor data is shoveled into a supercomputer from Nvidia that is capable of running up to 508 trillion operations a second.</p><p>I went on a test ride through San Francisco and was pretty impressed with how the system handled all the chaos of a crowded city. There were bike messengers, double-parked cars, delivery trucks, and people pushing baby strollers, and the Mercedes navigated all of it pretty effortlessly. It’s not a fully autonomous system yet, and the driver still needs to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. But you can see how those restrictions could eventually be lifted if Mercedes decides it’s safe enough to do so.</p><p>Think of it as Mercedes’ answer to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving, but arguably a lot more robust thanks to all those extra sensors. In my opinion it beats Tesla’s camera-only approach just in terms of redundancy. Also it’s backed by Nvidia’s safety-certified silicon chips and AI software, all of which are going into a lot more cars in the years to come. — <em>Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor</em></p><div><p id="best-health-tech"><h2>Best health tech</h2></p></div><p>This year’s show was all about longevity tech, and some pretty cursed ways to tackle that concept. Mostly involving several bodily fluids and inconvenient tests. The Withings Body Scan 2, however, is a scale, and everyone knows how to use a scale.</p><p>The interesting thing: Withings is positioning this device less as a scale and more as a “longevity station.” It measures over 60 biomarkers, concentrating on cardiovascular and non-invasive metabolic health. It does the latter by measuring minuscule amounts of foot sweat. (And while technically foot sweat is a bodily fluid, I’ll take that over urine or blood.)</p><p>More so than the fancy metrics, what I like here is the concept of decentering weight from the entire purpose of a scale. It’s encouraging users to view their weight as one part of their health — not the <em>entire </em>measure. My only gripe is that the scale will cost a whopping $600, but hopefully the price for this kind of tech comes down over time. — <em>Victoria Song, senior reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-wearable"><h2>Best wearable</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo by Owen Grove / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>This was a ho-hum year for wearables at the show, so I was pleasantly surprised by L’Oréal’s take on an LED face mask — a product category I generally hate. It’s conceptually based on a sheet mask, meaning it’s much easier to wear than the typical, Jason Voorhees-esque LED masks you’ll find on the show floor. It’s made of a flexible, silicone-esque material, and the light sits much closer to your skin. There’s also a smaller version that fits just under the eyes. The flexible material also means that, down the line, you could see this technology applied to other body parts, such as the neck or decolletage. Plus, you only have to wear it for five to 10 minutes.</p><p>What I appreciate about this mask is that L’Oréal has disclosed it uses 630nm and 830nm wavelengths, and that it’s going through the extra hoops of 510(k) FDA clearance. No one <em>needs</em> red light therapy masks, and it’s totally fine if you don’t believe it’s a useful therapy.

It’s got drift-resistant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks with reactive LED lighting at their base, Hall effect triggers with adjustable stops, two sets of shoulder buttons, motion controls, and four haptic feedback motors. It connects to recent Xbox consoles using an included 2.4GHz dongle, and other devices using Bluetooth or a USB-C cable.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E is also extensively customizable. It works with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software X so you can remap its controls and adjust the sensitivity of its triggers and sticks. You can swap out its standard joysticks with replacements that are taller or thicker, or upgrade its metal D-pad to one with a circular design. You can even change how the Ultimate 3E’s ABXY buttons feel. They’re all contained in interchangeable button modules featuring either squishy silicone membrane buttons or clicky micro switches.

A folding phone that folds <em>again.</em> Yes, it’s almost certainly going to be outrageously expensive. Yes, Huawei already did a trifold. And yes, it’s kind of nonsense to call it a trifold when it only folds twice. But gosh dang it, it’s so cool.</p><p>Just to recap: The TriFold is on sale currently in Korea, and Samsung plans to sell it in the US later this year at a to-be-disclosed price. It folds up like a wallet, with a 6.5-inch outer screen for when you want it to be a phone and a massive 10-inch inner screen when you need a tablet. Mostly I’m just impressed that it’s really <em>here.</em> Samsung started hinting at its existence last January at Unpacked; just under a year later, it’s a reality that I was able to touch, hold, and flex.</p><p>And it’s all the more appealing because, in true Samsung fashion, you can do whatever the hell you want with it. Particularly with the inner screen — it functions like an Android phone by default, but you can put it into <em>DeX mode</em> if you want a more PC-like experience with windowing. <em>– Allison Johnson, senior reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-audio-product"><h2>Best audio product</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo: Antonio G.

So when I put a pair on my head and immediately enjoy what I hear, I take notice. From the moment I put the Fender Mix headphones on my head, I knew I had found something special.</p><p>The audio tuning sounded full without being overpowering. The ear cups were cushiony and the headphones had a strong amount of clamping force, but not so much that I got a headache, to keep them securely in place. And they felt well built and durable.</p><p>But the best part about them are the details. By removing one of the ear cups, you can access a door that opens to allow you to change the rechargeable battery if it ever fails. The battery gets you 100 hours of listening time (52 with ANC). And under the other ear cup is a USB-C dongle you can plug into your device to allow it to transmit an Auracast broadcast to the headphones. The headphones support low-latency, lossless, and high-res audio at 24-bit/96kHz. And if your battery runs out, you can connect a cable to the 3.5mm port and listen to them passively.</p><p>The short time I was able to spend with the Fender Mix headphones was one of the highlights of my CES. <em>— John Higgins, senior TVs and audio reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-robot"><h2>Best robot</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Image: Andru Marino / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>It was the year of the robot at CES, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/853973/hyundai-boston-dynamics-atlas-robot-factory-2028">Boston Dynamics’ Atlas</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855233/lg-cloid-robot-laundry-ces-2026-keynote">LG’s CLOiD</a> making their Las Vegas debuts alongside hundreds of humanoid bots hanging around every booth.</p><p>But while some of these robots gave (somewhat) impressive demos and hinted at a more compelling narrative as to how they could one day be useful in our homes, it’s clear that the Rosie the Robot-style home helper is still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855329/rosey-robot-roomba-ces-2026">firmly part of science fiction</a>.</p><p>Instead, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855329/rosey-robot-roomba-ces-2026">best robot at CES</a> was the one that simply climbed the stairs and cleaned them.</p><p>Robot vacuum maker Roborock debuted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/852121/roborock-saros-rover-stair-climbing-robot-vacuum-ces-2026">the Saros Rover</a>, the world’s first robot vacuum that can both climb stairs and clean them.

This fairly thin, unassuming office keyboard from HP is actually a desktop computer. Inside is an AMD Ryzen AI 300-series processor, RAM, storage, a fan, stereo speakers, and mics — it’s the full package. It even comes with a pre-paired Bluetooth mouse and options for a user-replaceable battery and fingerprint reader embedded in the power button. You just need to plug into a monitor delivering power via USB-C.</p><p>It’s surprisingly fun and quirky for a device designed for dull enterprise and IT duties. It feels like a throwback to the days of the legendary Commodore 64 with Raspberry Pi 500 DNA sprinkled in, though with a number pad and much more power. A laptop probably makes more sense for most people (even office workers), but the Eliteboard G1a is much more unique.

In other words, a potential game changer in the world of electric vehicles. Of course, the landscape is littered with the corpses of companies promising solid-state breakthroughs, so Donut Lab needs to back its claims up with real proof.

Last November Ikea introduced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/827516/ikea-bluetooth-speaker-solskydd-kulglass-lamp-spotify-tap">new collection of colorful Bluetooth speakers</a> that can double as home decor, but at CES it announced a much smaller alternative that’s priced to be an impulse purchase.

If one isn’t loud enough, you can pair and sync up to 100 Kallsups to fill a larger space with sound. Battery life is expected to be up to nine hours at half volume on a full charge, and the battery is user-replaceable so you’re not left with e-waste when it stops taking a charge.</p><p>There’s a long list of gadgets announced at CES 2026 that <em>The Verge</em>’s staff <em>wants</em>, but the Kallsup is the one device we’re probably all going to actually buy. <em>— Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter</em></p><div><p id="best-concept"><h2>Best concept</h2></p></div><p>Lenovo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/717491/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-laptop-review">ThinkBook Plus Gen 6</a> was our best in show last year because it was a one-of-a-kind rollable laptop you’d soon be able to own. I really, really hope we’ll be able to soon say the same for Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable concept. It takes the rollable OLED formula and extends it horizontally instead of vertically, now attached to a beefy gaming laptop. It’s what I’ve wanted since I saw Lenovo’s first rollable proof of concept back in 2023.</p><p>What starts out as a conventional 16-inch, 16:10 gaming laptop extends to a 24-inch ultrawide, with a 21.5-inch middle-ground option for good measure. Lenovo didn’t have any games on the laptop for us to test (for shame, Lenovo), but I’ve tested the Legion Pro 7i that the rollable concept is based on, and I liked it enough to give it a nod in our gaming laptop buying guide. Lenovo just needs to make this thing a reality now. If executed well, like in the ThinkBook rollable, this could be the perfect gaming laptop.

While other companies have opted for cuddly aliens and Totoro-inspired critters, Ecovacs has simply done its best to make a fluffy little pup, and it’s done remarkably well. LilMilo has soft fur and little black toe beans, and thanks to a camera and microphone, it can react to your presence, maintain eye contact, and recognize its owner, supposedly developing its own unique personality over time.</p><p>I’m more comfortable with AI toys that do this little than I am with the ones that stuff ChatGPT in a teddy bear and hope for the best. But what’s really impressive about LilMilo is that it really does feel strangely alive, an effect only let down by the unsettlingly human eyes. I instinctively gave the little guy the same pets and scritches I usually do my cats, and felt an affection that I know has no rational basis whatsoever.</p><p>Ecovacs hasn’t confirmed how much LilMilo might cost if and when it launches, and you probably shouldn’t buy one either way — again, it really doesn’t actually do anything.

For me, this year’s CES was a blur of robots that don’t work, vacuums, lawnmowers, and AI chatbots shoved into just about anything. It was a welcome surprise when I stumbled across the booth for Haply, a company that makes haptic controllers for interacting with 3D objects. Haply’s booth showed off a variety of demos, like articulated robot arms that you could control with enough precision to play a real game of <em>Operation</em>, physics demos where you had to push your controller through a gelatinous, spongy 3D object on a screen, and 3D modeling software where you could mold and shape clay.</p><p>What really surprised me was how much I could <em>feel</em> the objects and their textures through the screen with these controllers, especially its consumer-priced 3D haptics mouse, <a href="https://www.haply.co/minverse">MinVerse</a>. I used MinVerse briefly in a 3D software application I’ve never used before called <a href="https://hexagon.com/products/geomagic-freeform">Geomagic Freeform</a> and instantly felt comfortable using it because of how tactile the controls were. I’ve dabbled in 3D modeling before as a hobby, but largely gave up on it because typical mice and tablet workflows made the process so cumbersome. 3D sculpting tools were the exact kind of thing I’d always wanted to try but found way too expensive to ever consider, with ranges from $3,000 to $15,000. MinVerse is priced at $1,500, and the company intends to push for further API integration with more affordable programs like Blender, ZBrush, and Maya. While it’s still a hefty cost for a hobbyist, I’m inspired to try 3D modeling again knowing that this tool is out there. — <em>Owen Grove, video director</em></p><div><p id="best-sequel"><h2>Best sequel</h2></p></div><p>In between the flashy new TVs, a laptop with a rolling display, and a smartphone that folds in three ways <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/850488/birdbuddy-2-mini-ces-2026">is the Birdbuddy 2</a>. It’s the successor to the smart bird feeder that Birdbuddy <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mybirdbuddy/bird-buddy-a-smart-bird-feeder">launched</a> as part of a Kickstarter campaign in 2020, and now it’s back with a new model that builds upon all the best parts of the Birdbuddy Pro.</p><p>The Birdbuddy 2 comes with a circular camera housing in the center of the feeder, encapsulating a sensor capable of recording 2K HDR video in a wider 135-degree field of view. The device can capture your feathered visitors in both landscape and portrait mode based on the orientation you choose by physically rotating the camera. It can also record in slow motion, similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23528786/bird-buddy-hummingbird-feeder-ai-camera">Birdbuddy’s smart hummingbird feeder</a>.</p><p>The company claims that the Birdbuddy 2 is supposed to start recording as soon as birds land on the feeder. That sounds like a pretty exciting improvement on its own, as I often find myself missing a bird’s initial arrival when reviewing clips from my Birdfy smart feeder. But a better camera isn’t the only upgrade coming to the Birdbuddy 2. The feeder can hold a larger six-cup capacity of bird food and even comes with roof-mounted solar panels, so you don’t have to bring it inside to charge.

A real product with a real price coming this March, not a concept or prototype. And it was genuinely fun to play with!</p><p>When you drop one of these Smart Bricks on a Lego creation, it becomes whatever Lego’s nearby smart NFC tags and figures tell it to become. It can be a spaceship that swoops and soars and refuels and plays a blasting minigame with other ships nearby. It can be a musical instrument that plays certain tunes, a birthday cake whose candles you blow out. It can be a car that accelerates and swerves and crashes and sounds alarms if a bad guy tries to nab it. It can be a Lego creature that purrs when you stroke its back. It can simultaneously roleplay the characters that drive the cars and ships, having them react to a kid’s actions.</p><p>Kids can mix and match and combine the smarts with normal Lego bricks, repurposing the same lights and sounds and minigames the toymaker has devised for their own creations — powering up <em>any</em> Lego spaceship they build by using the Star Wars X-wing tag, or building a helicopter that quacks like a duck.</p><p>And it sure sounds like these Smart Bricks won’t just be for kids.

            <p>The regular modpocalypses which tend to erupt when a fresh update for a game comes down the pipeline - an especially terrifying prospect if it's an older game and the tweaks/additions aren't something you're happy to temporarily switch back to vanilladom in order to enjoy - may now be less of a ballache. Well, at least when it comes to the Steam Workshop, which has just had new version control pipes welded to its pulsating metal frame.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Building on the features they already has in terms of letting developers offer older versions of games as optional branches if they wish, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/497183817277113901?utm_source=SteamDB">have announced</a> the release of some new Steam APIs and Workshop item options designed to "make it easier for developers and mod authors to work together in ensuring compatibility of mods as games evolve". Basically, devs are able to "better define" previous game versions , while modders can upload different versions of their mods which are compatible with those game versions and make clear what should work with what.</p>
<p>It's a process we've seen be necessary on a larger scale with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> total conversion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a>, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-london-modders-still-have-no-plans-to-port-it-to-next-gen-fallout-4-unless-a-console-version-becomes-possible">only available in a form</a> which works with a specific pre next-gen update version of that game. In this case, it should be easier to keep the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> working with your regular load order if you've delved into the workshop and downloaded 25 million custom livery mods for your favourite MAN lorry which are suddenly out of date. Though, obviously that still depends on developers and modders having gone in and made use of these new tools for their works.</p>
<p>According the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/workshop/itemversioning">full documention</a>, devs will be able use Steam's API to detect which version of the game a player's using, which mods they have installed, and put up an interface splash asking the player if they'd like to switch to the right game version if necessary. That sounds like it could make troubleshooting much more of a doddle, with an extra step even suggesting Steam can subsequently be prompted to close the game, switch branches and relaunch the game once the right version's installed. As for a more in-depth picture of what you'll see when checking out which mods work with different versions, the following passage from the guidance for modders sheds a bit more light on how they might use the tools:</p>
<blockquote>We know that many mod authors will not have the time to check whether their mod supports the latest version of a game. So we built this system to support ranges that include or exclude future updates. If the mod item is generally a simple item and likely to work with new versions of the game, then it may make sense to leave the supported range open-ended. However, if the mod is complex and the mod author wishes to test their mod with new game versions before declaring support, that can be easily done when configuring the supported ranges.</blockquote>
<p>We'll see how it plays out in practice, but anything that might help keep us all from the scourge of corrupted or unusable saves with thousands of hours put into them is welcome news.</p>

<p>The cartoon crossovers keep coming in Fortnite. The wackiness of Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s South Park world has entered the holy grounds of Fortnite, and there’s a bunch of hilarious skins to unlock and use in the shooter.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> eventually has to run out of collaboration ideas, right? The Simpsons was a monumental achievement for Epic Games, and having Harry Potter content is always a blessing. But now South Park has entered the game, bringing skins sure to put a smile on the faces of long-time fans.</p>



<p>Epic knows how to pull off a collab, and the South Park skins prove this.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-south-park-skins-in-fortnite-crossover">How Many South Park Skins In Fortnite Crossover?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a collaboration. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five fun South Park skins to choose from in the January 2026 Fortnite crossover.</strong></p>



<p>You’ve definitely got a decision to make with the South Park skins. Each of the series’ main characters—and another fan-favorite—has been given the honor of a Fortnite skin.</p>



<p>Cartman’s is instantly recognizable, but it may come down to who’s your favorite character.</p>







<h2 id="h-every-south-park-skin-in-fortnite-collab">Every South Park Skin In Fortnite Collab</h2>



<p><strong>There are Eric Cartman, Kenny McCormick, Kyle Broflovski, Stan Marsh, and Butters Stotch South Park skins to choose from in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>The four main heroes who’ve graced TV and movie screens for nearly 30 years were always going to be first in line for skins. Then you’ve got Butters, who quickly morphed into another of the main characters, and could be considered the ‘fifth’ member of the friends’ gang.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-south-park-skin-in-fortnite-cost-explained">How To Get Every South Park Skin In Fortnite, Cost Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cough up the V-Bucks. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are no special quests tied to skins; you simply need to pay a fixed fee of V-Bucks to acquire any of the South Park skins found in the Fortnite collab.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick rundown of each skin and the cost.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">South Park Skin Name</th><th data-align="center">Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Eric Cartman</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kenny McCormick</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kyle Broflovski</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stan Marsh</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Butters Stotch</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Each skin (if purchased separately) comes with the base skin, a couple of customizable styles, and a Back Bling item particular to the character.</p>



<p>You can also buy them as a fixed group with the ‘Gonna Have Myself A Time’ bundle, which will set you back <strong>4,000 V-Bucks</strong> at present.</p>



<p>How A.W.E.S.O.M.-O are these skins, seriously? But, with over 20 seasons’ worth of material, the time has come to let IG know which ones you’re sad didn’t make the cut, and what future South Park content the game needs. The place to do this is the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Microsoft</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-playground-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially confirmed</a> that the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong> will feature three games: <strong>Playground</strong>'s <strong>Fable</strong> reboot and <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, and <strong>Game Freak</strong>'s new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/beast-of-reincarnation-is-a-game-you-wouldnt-expect-from-pokemon-series-developer-game-freak-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beast of Reincarnation</a></strong> intellectual property.</p>



<p>However, out of three Xbox Developer Direct presentations, on two occasions there were also secret announcements that Microsoft held off until the actual show. The very first time, in 2023, there was the reveal and shadow drop of <strong>Tango Gameworks</strong>' <strong>Hi-Fi Rush</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hi-fi-rush-stealing-the-show-with-style-sss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was critically acclaimed</a> but still proved insufficient to prevent Microsoft from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>shutting down the studio</strong> just over a year later</a>. Thankfully, the Japanese developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was later resurrected by KRAFTON</a></strong>, which also acquired the Hi-Fi Rush IP.</p>



<p>Last year, the surprise came once again from Japan as Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">shadowdropped</a> <strong>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</strong>, an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the acclaimed action game, and also announced <strong>Ninja Gaiden 4</strong>, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to a great reception</a> in late 2025.</p>



<p>Well, according to the trustworthy insider <strong>shinobi602</strong>, there's going to be another surprise in the Xbox Developer Direct 2026. In a post <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot36-oops-all-obsidian.1310962/post-149812867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the ResetEra board</a>, he wrote:</p>



<p><em>There's a 'secret' fourth game.</em></p>



<p>When asked by a fellow user if he was excited about it, he replied that he actually wasn't very excited about this game, but that was only due to his personal taste. At this point, it is really anyone's guess what it could be, so all bets are off.</p>



<p>Still, the three confirmed games should be enough to carry the show on their own. Forza Horizon 6 is the sure bet: if Playground keeps the upward trajectory of the previous few games, we're in for a treat, and the studio's claim that its open world rendition of Japan <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will 'blow fans' away</a></strong> definitely raised the excitement.</p>



<p>Fable is a bit more of a wild card. Playground has worked on this project for eight years, and we still know very little about it (although <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-looks-fantastic-has-the-witcher-like-combat-says-corden-character-selection-reportedly-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors have hyped the game</a> as being reminiscent of The Witcher 3 in some ways). However, the show announcement blog mentioned we'd get the first in-depth look at new 'stunning' gameplay, reportedly portraying all of the franchise's tenets: British humour, choices and consequences, drama, and chickens.</p>



<p>Then there's the third-party game, Beast of Reincarnation. It's the first non-Pokémon project of Game Freak, and thus there's a lot of hype for it, although we don't really know much except that it chronicles the journey of one man and their dog in post-apocalyptic Japan. The game, just like the other two, is due to launch this year on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct 2026 airs on<strong> January 22</strong> at <strong>10 AM Pacific / 1 PM Eastern / 6 PM UK</strong> on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-shaping-up-to-be-monster-dev/</link>
            <guid>1401424</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This year, The Division celebrates its tenth anniversary, having emerged way back in 2016 as a solid post-apocalyptic MMO of sorts. It plunged players into a devastated New York City, torn apart by a viral pandemic and taken over by factions hellbent on twisting the city into their crime-fuelled playground.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft gave us an encouraging update regarding the future of the franchise, specifically targeting The Division 3, which is officially in production. Julian Gerighty, the game’s executive producer, said the game is ‘shaping up to be a monster.’</p>







<h2 id="h-the-division-3-could-be-the-biggest-game-in-the-series">The Division 3 Could Be The Biggest Game in the Series</h2>



<p>In a recent appearance on the New Game+ showcase, Ubisoft’s Julian Gerighty spoke about the past, present, and future of The Division. Last year, it was revealed that The Division 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/">was almost shuttered</a> until a dynamic team of five developers stepped up to ‘resurrect’ the game.</p>



<p>Now, the series is booming, and that includes the production of The Division 3, which is yet to be formally revealed by Ubisoft.</p>



<p>However, Gerighty had bold promises for the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it’s been announced. It’s <strong>shaping up to be a monster</strong>.</p>



<p>Within these walls at Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will have <strong>as big an impact as Division 1</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From beautiful, cinematic trailers to a solid and original premise, the first Division game was released to a very positive reception almost a decade ago. It became a key pillar in Ubisoft’s portfolio and was expanded in 2019 with The Division 2, an evolution of sorts.</p>



<p>Fans of the franchise have long been calling out for an update regarding The Division 3, and while it’s only a small one, they finally have something to mull over.</p>

It pioneered the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">magiteck</strong>" aesthetic and delivered one of gaming’s most chilling antagonists in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kefka Palazzo</strong>. However, if a modern reimagining of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Terra’s</strong> story ever breaks ground, it won't be under the direction of the man who spent the last decade <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">rebuilding Midgar and the world of Gaia </strong></a></p>



<p>In a new interview with <strong><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamerBraves">GamerBraves</a></em></strong>, <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> talked about his love for <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>: <em>"I grew up admiring <strong>Final Fantasy VI</strong> and <strong>VII</strong> as a child, and they were the titles that inspired me to become a game creator. They are undoubtedly at the origin of my creativity,"</em> he said.</p>



<p>This love for <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>, however, didn't translate into bringing elements of the game into the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy.<em> "Because I am working on the <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong> series, I believe the 'origin' for this work should be <strong>Final Fantasy VII</strong>,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> said. <em>"I wanted to bring out the best of the original <strong>FFVII</strong>, so I don't recall taking many elements from <strong>FFVI</strong> for this project."</em></p>



<p>Although the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy director harbors so much love and respect for the sixth entry in the series, he <strong>wouldn't direct</strong> a <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong>. After being involved in the <strong>Remake trilogy</strong> series for <strong>10 years</strong>, and finally seeing the end of it, rather than "spending another enormous amount of time to do another remake project," <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> would rather <strong>support a new young creator</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi's</strong> decision not to direct a potential <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong>, after having worked on the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy for over a decade, is more than understandable. While the development team has been rather creative in terms of gameplay, it was still constrained by the <strong>boundaries of the original game</strong> in some way, boundaries that would likely chafe anyone if they had to be kept in mind during creative work for over <strong>10 years</strong>.</p>



<p>In addition, a <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong> would pose some massive challenges that the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> didn't. Recreating the <strong>entire cast of 14 characters</strong> for the game would be a challenging undertaking, as would expanding a story that often shifts between different characters to deliver an <strong>ensemble narrative</strong>. Still, much like the community, I would love to experience the <strong><em>World of Ruin</em></strong> open-world second half of the game with modern gameplay and visuals, which would be a <strong>monumental task</strong>, much like recreating characters and narrative.</p>



<p>No matter Naoki Hamaguchi's sentiment on a potential Final Fantasy VI Remake, we are unlikely to hear much about it until some time after the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy has concluded. With the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong>close to reaching a state where it can finally be shown</strong></a>, and with the original's 30th anniversary coming up next year, we are likely going to get the first glimpse at the conclusion of the trilogy, which promises to be explosive (and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">f</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/"><strong>illed with air travel on the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Highwind</em> airship</strong></a>).</p>

<p>Season One Reloaded has kicked off in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, bringing a new Fallout collab that includes a stacked Event Pass of rewards, though some are locked behind an additional purchase.</p>



<p>The Fallout collab in Black Ops 7 is widespread, with limited-time game modes, unique challenges, and items available to purchase in the shop, showing that the collab is not just about cosmetic items.</p>



<p>If you’re on the fence about splashing out on the Fallout Event Pass, Insider Gaming has all the details on the price, the rewards available, and a verdict on whether it’s worth grabbing.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">How Much is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to earn. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Upgrade Track for the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is priced at 1,100 CoD Points, which works out at around $10 for the extra content.</strong></p>



<p>Splashing out on the Upgrade Track provides 10 additional rewards alongside the 10 free rewards in the Event Pass, most of which are cosmetics.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">All Rewards in The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<p><strong>The Fallout Event Pass in Black Ops 7 comes with 20 rewards, 10 of which are available for free, with the other half limited to those who purchase the Upgrade Track.</strong></p>



<p>Free rewards in the Event Pass include two Operator Skins, a loading screen, XP Tokens, and a new base weapon, while the Upgrade Track includes a new Operator, alongside an additional Operator Skin, a finishing move, weapon blueprint, Emote, and more.</p>



<p>A full breakdown of the rewards available in the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is shown in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Name</th><th data-align="center">Type</th><th data-align="center">Event Pass</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Dweller</td><td data-align="center">Operator Skin</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Power Armor Maximus</td><td data-align="center">Operator</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Enjoy Your Stay</td><td data-align="center">Loading Screen</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Torch Blade</td><td data-align="center">Melee Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">1 Hour Double Weapon XP</td><td data-align="center">XP Token</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Minigun Teardown</td><td data-align="center">Finishing Move</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Power Powe</td><td data-align="center">Emblem</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Brotherhood’s Armanent</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">Brotherhood’s Armament</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">1 Hour Double Level XP</td><td data-align="center">XP Token</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Maximus</td><td data-align="center">Operator Skin</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wanderer</td><td data-align="center">Operator Skin</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Brotherhood Launch</td><td data-align="center">Calling Card</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Smooches</td><td data-align="center">Sticker</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bobble-Head Bobble</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vault Boy</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Charm</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Power Armor Helm</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Charm</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vault-Tech</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Camo</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wasteland Buck</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sturmwolf 45</td><td data-align="center">Base Weapon</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Ghoul</td><td data-align="center">Operator</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass-worth-it">Is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass Worth It?</h2>



<p><strong>If you’re a fan of the Fallout TV Series, the Blacks Ops 7 Event Pass is worth the cost as it provides the best content from the major collab.</strong></p>



<p>Unlocking the Upgrade Track is the only way to obtain the Power Armor and The Ghoul Operator Skins, two iconic looks from the famed series, along with other eye-catching additions, including the Torch Blade Weapon Blueprint and Minigun Teardown Finishing Move.</p>



<p>The Free Track, meanwhile, features much smaller collab items, with the two Operator Skins not being characters from the TV series, and the other cosmetic items being much less eye-catching.</p>
