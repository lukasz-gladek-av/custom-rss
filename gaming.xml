			<p><strong>Funcom</strong> has announced that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-chapter-3-brings-bigger-better-endgame-new-content-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune: Awakening Chapter 3</a></strong>, the game's <strong>biggest update yet</strong>, is <strong>live now</strong>. This patch continues the main story following the events of Chapter 2 and <strong>significantly revamps the previously lackluster endgame content</strong>, introducing numerous new locations, systems, and gear. Wccftech watched a remote presentation by the developer to learn the key details and features of Chapter 3; you can read our in-depth report below.</p>



<h3 id="h-in-this-article">In This Article:</h3>

</ul>



<h2 id="landsraad-overhaul">New Landsraad Mission System</h2>



<p>To start, <strong>the Landsraad system has been completely overhauled</strong>. It is now a contest between the Atreides and the Harkonnen to gain support from minor Houses. Previously, players gained standing by manually submitting resources, but this has been replaced by the new Landsraad Mission system, where missions are grouped into five distinct categories:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Crafting</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gathering</strong></li>



<li><strong>Exploration</strong></li>



<li><strong>Combat</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sabotage</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>These missions will lead Dune: Awakening players to various maps and reward them with a new type of Experience Point (XP) specific to their category. Upon accepting a mission, <strong>players can choose which noble house will receive the standing gained from their success</strong>.</p>



<p>The XP earned through Landsraad missions opens a new endgame progression path called <strong>Specializations</strong>. Players can unlock and purchase various traits using a small amount of <strong>Refined Spice Melange</strong>. These Specializations serve the purpose of allowing players to customize their characters based on their preferred playstyle, such as increasing headshot damage in the combat track or yield rates in the gathering track.</p>



<p>These upgrade tracks go up to level 100. Upon reaching level 75, players receive a unique helmet to show off their expertise in that field. Progression is capped at 35 missions' worth of specialization XP per week, effectively allowing for up to five missions per day.</p>

<h2 id="new-pve-dungeons">New PvE Dungeons(Imperial Testing Stations)</h2>



<p>Dune: Awakening Chapter 3 also expands the world of Arrakis: several new locations have been added, including the <strong>Ardent Garrison</strong> and <strong>Smuggler's Run</strong>. Another side of the endgame improvements is the long-anticipated introduction of five new <strong>Imperial Testing Stations</strong>, which function as themed PvE dungeons. Each station is centered around a specific hazard or element:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Darkness</strong></li>



<li><strong>Radiation</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fire</strong></li>



<li><strong>Electricity</strong></li>



<li><strong>Poison</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>These dungeons are instance-based and can be tackled solo or in a group. <strong>The number of enemies scales with party size</strong>, and players can manually adjust the difficulty level. Higher difficulty levels scale enemy health, damage, and environmental hazards (such as increased electrical damage) while increasing drop rates for high-quality loot.</p>



<p><strong>Each testing station features a unique boss with distinct mechanics</strong>. For instance, Funcom showed that the boss in the electrical dungeon uses a disruptor pistol, and the combat arena features increasingly difficult environmental puzzles as the fight progresses. Boss health bars are split into four phases; the boss becomes immune during phase transitions as the room's hazards shift.</p>



<p>That said, <strong>I specifically asked whether there were any group mechanics, and the developers replied that there aren't</strong>. Which makes sense, I guess, since the dungeons are soloable. It is, however, disappointing for those specifically looking to get a PvE MMORPG-style experience; since they are fundamentally designed to work with just one player, they are unlikely to pose a serious challenge to a coordinated group, even if the number of enemies scales with the group size.</p>



<p>PvE players who are going to be exploring these dungeons can expect to find schematics for <strong>Augmentations</strong>, a new system for improving gear. These Augments can be applied to <strong>Tier 6 (Endgame)</strong> melee weapons, ranged weapons, and armor. The ability to apply multiple augments is tied to the <strong>Crafting Specialization</strong> level. For example, a level 10 crafter can apply an augment to their armor, with more slots unlocking at higher levels. Furthermore, Augments can be traded with friends, shared within guilds, or sold on the Exchange at social hubs.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="story-weapons-qol">Story Progression, New Weapons, and QoL Tweaks</h2>



<p>As briefly mentioned earlier, Dune: Awakening Chapter 3 also advances the plot as players pursue a murderer revealed to be a <strong>Face Dancer</strong>. Their investigation eventually leads to a <strong>Harkonnen Dueling Ring</strong>, where the Face Dancer is suspected of being the arena champion. Players must fight through various bosses, such as <strong>Thrax the Flamer</strong>, to reach the top of the ranks. The story will also introduce the leader of the <strong>Smugglers</strong> at their headquarters on Arrakis.</p>



<p>The patch also introduces two brand new weapons, the <strong>Pyrocket</strong> and the <strong>Dual Blades</strong>. The former is an area-of-effect (AoE) weapon dropped by the fire dungeon boss, while the latter is a fast melee weapon with a unique move set that consumes less stamina. Moreover, the Rapier weapon type has been completely reworked with new animations, flourishes, and a fencing-style parry-and-reposte mechanic.</p>



<p>The developers then highlighted that they've also introduced several quality-of-life (QoL) improvements, most of which were requested by the community. First and foremost is <strong>the complete removal of the tax system that required players to pay a tax to maintain their bases in the game</strong>. Additionally, players can now use the Base Backup Tool to store their entire base, allowing them to take a break from the game and redeploy it upon their return. Players can now also apply house swatches (color schemes) to crafting machines, containers, vehicles, and wind turbines, showing their allegiance more clearly. As a way to entice some of the lapsed players to return, the developers are also giving away the free <strong>Welcome Back Pack bundle</strong>, which provides resources, gear, and vehicles based on the player's previous research progression.</p>

<h2 id="raiders-broken-lands-paid-DLC">New Raiders of the Broken Lands Paid DLC</h2>



<p>Going live with the free Dune: Awakening Chapter 3 update is the premium DLC<strong> Raiders of the Broken Lands</strong>, which is priced at <strong>$9.99</strong> (alternatively, it's included in the <strong>Season Pass</strong>, which costs <strong>$24.99</strong>) and provides access to the following items:</p>

<li><strong>Building Set:</strong> Includes 74 industrial and natural-looking building pieces, such as rounded walls, industrial pipes, and metal or tarp roofs.</li>

<p>Additionally, the <strong>Observer</strong> building set, previously available via Twitch drops, is now available to all players for in-game purchase with the Solari currency.</p>



<p>During this presentation, Funcom <strong>provided no updates on the console ports</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-launch-console-cross-play-sony-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they previously said would be released around a year after the PC launch</a>. If that's still the case, they're only about four months away, but they could still slip a bit. We'll let you know once Funcom shares an official release date.</p>

			<p>The <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> won't be <a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/">toppling <strong>Steam</strong> anytime soon</a>, but the numbers shared by Epic in its <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2025-year-in-review">Epic Games Store 2025 Year in Review blog post</a> clearly show that the digital storefront is growing. The digital storefront best known for giving away <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-free-game-saved-you-over-550/">free games</a></strong> also saw quite a few players doing more than just claiming a free title each week, spending more time and money in third-party titles.</p>



<p>2025 was a year of record-setting for the EGS, as player spending on third-party games grew by <strong>57% compared to last year</strong>, reaching a record-high <strong>$400 million</strong>. Epic also added that the $400M number doesn't even include what players would've spent in third-party titles that process their own payments, like <strong>EA Sports FC 26, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, </strong>and <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong>. </p>



<p>Developers behind those games, and any other that has its own payment processing, receive 100% of the revenue made from those purchases. Which, frankly, is what you would expect, seeing as how Epic spent <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-claims-victory-as-apple-appointed-to-accept-no-tax-ruling-on-web/">years in litigation against <strong>Apple</strong> over the issue of not being able to process its own payments in <strong>Fortnite</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Other record-setting numbers include the <strong>2.78 billion hours players spent in third-party games</strong> through the Epic Games Store, an increase from 2024's 2.68 billion hours in third-party titles. That said, when looking at gameplay hours spent overall, players logged only <strong>6.65 billion hours,</strong> a decline from 2024's 7.72 billion hours.</p>



<p>It also reached a record-setting high in <strong>monthly active users (MAU)</strong>, hitting <strong>78 million MAU on PC in December 2025</strong>. Overall, player spending was up by 6%, reaching $1.16 billion, up from 2024's $1.09 billion. There are now over <strong>6,000 games</strong> available on the Epic Games Store for players to purchase. </p>



<p>When it comes to the Free Games Program, which seems to be driving a fair amount of engagement on the storefront, Epic gave away <strong>100 games</strong> in 2025, with players claiming a total of <strong>662 million copies</strong>. The value of the games claimed, in US dollars, totalled <strong>$2,316</strong>. The post also notes that the free games increased engagement in those titles on Steam, which feels like a nod towards a story from last month, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/">an indie publisher noted that having their game go free on the EGS was great advertising for Steam sales.</a></p>



<p>Lastly, the EGS grew from 2024's 295M users to a whopping <strong>317 million users on PC</strong>. If you want to compare all of the EGS's numbers from 2024 to 2025, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-year-in-review-released-players-spend-2-68-billion-hours-playing-third-party-pc-titles/">you can check out its 2024 report here.</a></strong></p>



<p>As for what Epic has planned in 2026, the Fortnite company says it will focus on "<em>delivering long-requested features and deeper platform improvements</em>," specifically citing that the company is in the process of "<em>rebuilding the underlying architecture of the Epic Games Store Launcher</em>," with plans to ship these changes in Summer 2026.</p>



<p>The changes promise a more responsive launcher that feels "<em>good to use</em>," with better stability and faster load times. It also promises community spaces in the Epic Games Store and the enhancement of the EGS's social capabilities, even adding voice chat and game-independent parties. It'll also add cross-platform libraries between PC and mobile games, and the introduction of regional storefronts with localized discovery systems.</p>



<p>"<em>In short: we're building a fairer, more open marketplace for players and developers</em>," the blog post reads. "<em>As we move into 2026, we remain committed to empowering developers and delivering the best possible experience for players, wherever they play</em>."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-riffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller-for-xbox-drops-to-all-time-low-officially-licensed-by-microsoft-2000665101</link>
            <guid>1423975</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For most of us, Guitar Hero and Rock Band are just those gimmick games that were briefly popular for a couple years back in high school. But for some of us, it is life. The dream of peripheral-based rhythm gaming isn’t as long dead as you might think. The PDP Riffmaster wireless guitar controller is seeing a hefty sale on Amazon at the moment. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7014/">Normally sold for $150, it’s now down 33%, saving you a whopping $50. That’s brings it down to an even $100.</a></p>
<p>There are three models of the PDP Riffmaster wireless guitar controller, each designed for Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo consoles. The controller is suitable for Rock Band games, as well as Fortnite Festival, though I’m sure there’s someone out there attempting to beat <em>Bloodborne</em> with this thing. Each model is officially licensed for the system its designed for. The Xbox one is also compatible with PC if that’s where you’re looking to play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7014/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>If you’ve only ever played any of the Guitar Hero or Rock Band games using the controllers that came with the game, then you’ll find this one to be more closely resembling the Rock Band’s guitar controller. The five main buttons take up the entirety of the frets, and they’re also all duplicated higher up on the neck of the guitar if you want to switch up the way you play. The strumming trigger is also more akin to its Rock Band counterpart than it is the Guitar Hero one.</p>
<h2>Designed for Everyone</h2>
<p>The PDP Riffmaster wireless guitar controller is also designed for both righty and lefty guitarists, having a strap attachment available on both sides of the guitar. The buttons being the whole fret also support make playing righty or lefty feel more closely aligned. The strap itself is included with the controller as well.</p>



<p>Built into the front of the guitar controller is both a D-pad as well as a traditional analogue stick for easier navigation. The analogue stick is actually built into the neck of the guitar, while the D-pad is found on its face, beneath where you strum. The controller even has integrated volume controls so you can adjust on the fly, mid-song. And of course, gotta have the whammy bar.</p>
<p>Being a wireless controller, it works off a rechargeable battery. That battery should last you a solid 36 hours of playtime per charge. When playing, it has a 30-range of low latency wireless connection to work with, so feel free to rock out all across your friend’s basement.</p>
<p>When you’re done playing, the controller can even be collapsed for both easy transportation and for more flexibility when it comes to storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7014/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>There's a lot of bangers in that list, as well as some day-one Game Pass launches that are certainly worth checking out. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-2-given-february-2026-release-date-and-confirmed-for-xbox-game-pass">High on Life 2 is a big new release this month</a>, with skateboarding as a major new addition to the typical humour-focused FPS gameplay.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-review">You've got Kingdom Come Deliverance</a>, the historical RPG that kicked off the story of Henry and his rough and rowdy quest across Bohemia. It received a critically acclaimed sequel last year, but if you've not played the original now may be the perfect time to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">There's also Avowed</a>, the latest big-budget RPG by Obsidian Entertainment. A first-person action RPG with a lot of love poured into it, it's perhaps the polar opposite to Kingdom Come Deliverance, but matches it in terms of quality. A big month for RPG fans for certain.</p>
<p>As with all prior months, Game Pass is also waving goodbye to a number of games. This month, it's just <em>Madden NFL 24</em>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/five-takeaways-from-my-time-with-virtual-boy-on-nintendo-switch-online</link>
            <guid>1423963</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="b5fc6f7f14faa"><a title="Virtual Boy 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b5fc6f7f14faa/virtual-boy-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Given that fans were expecting (or perhaps hoping, to be more accurate) to see DS games added to Switch Online, the upcoming inclusion of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy</a> on <strong>17th February 2026</strong> is quite possibly the biggest surprise from Nintendo in recent years.</p>
<p>Did anyone really ask for this? Probably not. Is it pretty neat regardless? Definitely. Although the Virtual Boy's small library of games have been widely playable through, shall we say, 'unofficial' means, the headset itself isn't the easiest piece of hardware to come across these days.</p>
<p>So to finally go hands-on with the upcoming NSO variant of the Virtual Boy headset was both surreal and thrilling. I didn't get a great deal of time with it, but I managed to play enough to come away with five key takeaways. Needless to say, it reinforced my admittedly rash decision to pre-order the full-fat headset at <strong>£66.99 / $99.99</strong>, and I can't wait to get stuck in.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196709 @ 1770129002 -->
<h2><strong>The headset feels high-quality</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="751314974af8a"><a title="Virtual Boy 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/751314974af8a/virtual-boy-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is probably a given when you consider how much this thing is, but the Virtual Boy headset is really impressive from a build point of view. I was only able to handle it with a Switch 2 console already inserted, but it feels pretty weighty (while not being too heavy) and the dial you use to adjust the headset angle is strong and durable.</p>
<p>Even if you wind up not playing the NSO app all that much, the headset will make for a really eye-catching decoration to place on your desk or shelf. I like it a lot.</p>
<p>If the replica is a little pricey for you, there is also the cardboard version coming on the same day — though I didn't get to try that one out.</p>
<h2><strong>The lack of a Virtual Boy controller sucks</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="d58b52299d9c7"><a title="Virtual Boy Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d58b52299d9c7/virtual-boy-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I honestly wouldn’t be surprised to see Nintendo add this later down the line (gotta squeeze every penny, y’know?), but I think it’s a real shame that the proper Virtual Boy headset doesn’t come bundled with a matching controller. I can understand the cardboard variant not including one, but I really wish we could get the complete Virtual Boy experience if I’m paying top dollar for it.</p>
<p>My hands-on session utilised the Joy-Con 2 nestled within the grip, which wasn't ideal. I suspect using the Pro Controller will provide a better experience, but man… I need a proper Virtual Boy pad.</p>
<h2><strong>Once you fine-tune the screen view, it looks incredible</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="778d140af7dd2"><a title="Mario Odyssey" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/778d140af7dd2/mario-odyssey.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I first wiggled my face into the Virtual Boy’s display, everything looked a bit off. The screen was tiny, and the focus was completely out of whack. I don’t know what the person testing it out before me was doing, but goodness, what a mess.</p>
<p>Thankfully, small software tweaks via certain prompts on the controller (similar to adjusting the controls in other NSO apps) allow you to customise the view, so you can shift the image left or right slightly to increase the focus, and you can increase the size of the screen so that it fits your entire viewpoint. Once you do this, the edges fade out slightly, almost as if they’re exceeding the boundaries of your peripheral vision. It looks really cool.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you wear glasses like I do, you'll probably be absolutely fine using the Virtual Boy. Unless they're massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heston_Blumenthal">Heston Blumenthal</a>-style frames.</p>
<h2><strong>You’ll need a really specific environment in which to play</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="54fbf2b353c10"><a title="Virtual Boy 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54fbf2b353c10/virtual-boy-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is true for the original Virtual Boy too, but if you want to play this thing for a reasonable length of time, you’ll need to set up the right environment. You can’t play it without placing the VB accessory upon a flat surface, and you’ll need to make sure you’re at the right height so that you’re neither stretching up or crouching down.</p>
<p>Case in point, the Virtual Boy I tried was set upon a counter while I was sat upon a pretty basic high stool. The height of the stool meant that I had to curve my back forwards in order to get low enough to use the headset. If you've ever popped your chin on one of those tonometer machines at the opticians, it's a similar setup. I’m getting old, man, it hurts to do this stuff!</p>
<p>I suspect the ideal solution would be to set it upon a desk, then use a height-adjustable chair to get in the right position. Angling the Virtual Boy to the optimum position does help a lot too, naturally.</p>
<h2><strong>Many of the Virtual Boy’s games are genuinely great</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="3c21836befda5"><a title="Virtual Boy Wario Land" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c21836befda5/virtual-boy-wario-land.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s no secret that the Virtual Boy failed spectacularly when it originally launched back in 1995. As such, you might be under the impression that its games just aren’t very good. Well, not so! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a> is an incredible 2D platformer that makes spectacular use of perspective, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a> is a solid wireframe shoot-em-up with clear <strong>Star Fox</strong> inspirations.</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to try <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/zero_racers">Zero Racers</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/d-hopper">D-Hopper</a>, since neither of them will be available at launch. But the sheer fact that both will be fully playable for the first time <em>ever</em> is reason enough to celebrate. What a time to be alive.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pragmata-might-wind-up-being-the-biggest-surprise-of-2026</link>
            <guid>1423960</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="9fe39e760f36c"><a title="Pragmata 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fe39e760f36c/pragmata-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>I have to be honest, I really didn't expect to love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> as much as I do.</p>
<p>Early trailers were certainly intriguing, but from a gameplay standpoint, I thought it looked bland and uninspiring. Maybe Capcom’s uncharacteristically lengthy development for the game played a part (it was originally revealed in 2020), but it’s been sitting near the the bottom of my wish list for a pretty long time. I’m happy to say, however, that I was very, <em>very</em> wrong. After 40 minutes with Pragmata on Switch 2, I’m ready for more – much more.</p>
<p>Taking place in a futuristic space station of sorts, the demo introduces the basics with a few combat encounters and a sprinkling of light puzzles, all before ending with a challenging yet cinematic boss battle. Protagonists Hugh and his android companion Diana must work together to defeat their enemies, with the former focusing on ranged weaponry and the latter providing crucial support with a unique, engaging hacking mechanic that manifests in real time.</p>
<figure data-uuid="35c374d8d0a44"><a title="Pragmata 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/35c374d8d0a44/pragmata-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before I even get onto the gameplay, I absolutely adore the relationship between Hugh and Diana. Several games have attempted to portray the father/daughter dynamic over the years, and they've often been laced with tragedy or drama that makes the father figure in particular seem overly gruff in nature. Hugh, by comparison, is lighthearted and whimsical, teaching Diana how to do a high five after defeating the demo's boss. It's lovely.</p>
<p>The bulk of Pragmata controls like your average third-person shooter. You navigate Hugh through the environment (with Diana sitting comfortably atop his back), jumping up ledges, dashing to dodge attacks, and chipping away at your enemies’ health with a basic pistol. You can pick up beefier weapons on the fly, but these tend to come loaded with pretty limited ammunition, with the game often encouraging you to mix up your loadout.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for the hacking, Pragmata probably <em>would</em> be a bit bland. But by targeting your enemies, you instantly initiate a real-time minigame in which you navigate a 4x4 grid with the right analogue stick.</p>
<p>Your main goal is to move through this grid and locate the green completion tile, while other tiles offer up additional perks along the way. Some, however, immediately kick you out if you accidentally land on them, so you’ll need to quickly load it up again and start from scratch.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a9b59df51c489"><a title="Pragmata 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a9b59df51c489/pragmata-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key is to create a path and activate every available bonus before completion in order to dish out maximum damage. While this probably sounds simple on paper, it’s all done in an average of about 3 or 4 seconds with no pause in the action, so you’ll need to complete each hack while keeping a close eye on your positioning and what your enemies are doing.</p>
<p>The combination results in an incredibly satisfying gameplay loop that has the potential to keep me hooked throughout the entire game. It also, however, has the potential to be somewhat repetitive if this is really all there is to it. My gut says that it’s not, and that Pragmata will introduce a bunch of fresh twists on the concept as the story progresses. For now, however, I’m quite eager to jump back in as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to the combat, some light puzzle-solving focused entirely on Diana's hacking abilities. These consisted almost entirely of activating nodes within the environment to open doorways or activate elevators. Like the combat encounters, each hack brings up a separate UI, so you might have to simply tap a combination of face buttons as displayed on-screen, or use 'ABXY' to rotate arrows so that they're facing the right direction. It's not taxing in the slightest, but it's quick and intuitive.</p>
<figure data-uuid="16ab65c264ad8"><a title="Pragmata 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/16ab65c264ad8/pragmata-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for how it runs on the Switch 2, Pragmata is about as good as I could reasonably expect. It was only available in docked mode with the performance locked at 30fps, but it felt pretty stable and consistent during my time with it. There are a few visual downgrades compared to the likes of PS5 with some muddy textures and a slightly fuzzy resolution, but it’s a handsome game nonetheless with impressive lighting and a strong art style.</p>
<p>All eyes are on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> for this year, but Pragmata definitely has the potential to be something really special come <strong>24h April 2026</strong>. Unlike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami</a>, it feels like Capcom is making a real solid attempt to create its next big IP here, and while it certainly still has much to prove – I didn’t get a whole lot of narrative context during the demo, for example – its gameplay has done more than enough to bump it up to the top tier of my ever-growing wish list.</p>

Both <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> have been plagued by players using devices like XIM, Cronus Zen, and ReaSnow S1 to enable unfair advantages that exploit aim assist, and now Activision is introducing new detections to ban the devices.</p><p>“These devices are not permitted in <em>Call of Duty</em>,” <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2026/02/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-02">says Activision’s Richochet team</a>. “They are cheating tools, even if they masquerade as accessibility devices.” Activision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/4/23669939/call-of-duty-warzone-xim-ban-suspension-warning">originally cracked down</a> on these devices in <em>Call of Duty: Warzone </em>and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em> nearly three years ago, with mixed results.</p><p>“Stopping these devices takes more than looking for a specific piece of hardware because they are designed to hide, adapt, and change configurations to avoid simple detection,” says Activision. It’s a constant game of cat and mouse for anti-cheat developers, especially when these devices are regularly updated by the manufacturers and sold at big retailers.</p><p>Activision is now updating its detection software to focus on player inputs, rather than attempting to detect the actual devices. “We analyze input timing, consistency, and response patterns to distinguish natural human play from machine-modified input,” says Activision. “This allows us to identify recoil control, aim behavior, and input precision that exceed what is physically possible through a standard controller or mouse.”</p><p>These new third-party device detections will be introduced alongside season 2 of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>later this week. Microsoft-owned Activision is also introducing stronger cloud-based anti-cheat technology, which verifies a PC using Microsoft Azure Attestation to prevent attempts to bypass system-level security protections. This stronger detection is coming first to Ranked Play matches, and builds on top of the existing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/720007/call-of-duty-pc-anti-cheat-secure-boot-windows-black-ops-7">TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot requirements</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/872976/call-of-duty-xim-cronus-reasnow-s1-ban-detections]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/872769/epic-games-store-fortnite-year-in-review-2025</link>
            <guid>1423954</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Fortnite</em> is going to be getting <em>a lot</em> more crossovers featuring characters from video games. As part of the Epic Games Store’s <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/news/epic-games-store-2025-year-in-review">year in review for 2025</a>, Epic shared details about its official program for developers that will give people who purchase their game on the Epic Games Store a related cosmetic they can use within <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>Eventually, the goal is to scale the program to “over 100 partnerships per year,” Epic Games Store GM Steve Allison said on X <a href="https://x.com/halfbakedSteve/status/2014813374362878317">last month</a>. In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Allison says that there will be “about 40” this year and “60-plus” so far set for 2027. The program starts with Capcom’s <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which launches <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681325/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-date">on February 27th</a>, and other publishers with crossovers in the works include miHoYo, Pearl Abyss, S-Game, MintRocket, and Kakao Games.</p><p>“It’ll help a bunch of our partners, and it’ll be cool for our players,” Allison says about the program. But it benefits Epic, too; players might be more willing to buy a game on the Epic Games Store instead of Steam because of a <em>Fortnite</em> tie-in, and more people making more purchases on the Epic Games Store might make the platform more appealing for developers and publishers in general.</p><p>In its year in review, Epic also highlighted how player spending in third-party PC games grew 57 percent year over year to an “all-time record” of $400 million. The platform saw an all-time record of 78 million monthly active users on PC, too. And users claimed 662 million titles through Epic’s free games program, which Allison says will continue through 2026. “It’s basically our marketing budget,” he says.</p><p>This year, Epic is planning to make some updates to the Epic Games Store launcher on PC, including rebuilding the underlying architecture as part of a string of improvements it plans to ship this summer. The launcher has been criticized for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/p57148/epic_games_launcher_is_terrible/">being slow</a>, and the improvements should lead to faster load times and better stability, according to Epic. “We know the criticism,” Allison says. “We don’t disagree with it.” He says that Epic wants the app to feel “instant” and “snappy.”</p><p>Epic is also still invested in its efforts with its mobile stores. The mobile Epic Games Store has seen more than 50 million installs, Allison says, which is a far cry from the 100 million it was targeting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">by the end of 2024</a>. “We expected more,” according to Allison, but the friction from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789421/epic-games-store-ios-android-installations">scare screens</a> is the “real deal.” (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259634/we-lose-half-of-people-that-intend-to-install-the-store">He’s said as much before</a>.) Still, Epic is planning to launch the store in Japan in March and Brazil in June because of regulatory changes in those countries.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/872769/epic-games-store-fortnite-year-in-review-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-slashes-16-1-portable-gaming-monitor-to-15-6-pricing-hitting-lowest-price-and-selling-fast-2000665165</link>
            <guid>1423951</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A single screen isn’t always enough. You might need to multitask with multiple programs at once, or maybe share your screen with colleagues during a presentation. There are plenty of portable options on the market that can come in handy during situations like this. One of our favorites is the 16.1-inch Arzopa gaming monitor, and Amazon is offering a limited-time chance to grab it for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6601/">It’s now sitting at $97, after a sweet 25% off its usual $130 price</a>. This $33 discount isn’t huge, but it still makes the upgrade much more affordable. Act now before the price shoots back up again!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6601/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lifelike Picture Quality</h2>
<p>For under $100, you’re getting an impressive 16.1-inch portable monitor that delivers a stunning 1080P FHD high-definition resolution and 106% sRGB gamut, bringing your favorite content to life. You’ll enjoy detailed, vibrant, and lifelike picture quality, whether you’re streaming a show, working on an office project, or gaming with friends. The size is also slightly bigger than the standard 15.6-inch options in this range, so you’ll have more space to work and play comfortably. Additionally, the anti-glare coating makes it easy on the eyes, so extended sessions won’t be a problem.</p>
<p>The screen lets you switch the view between horizontal and vertical modes, based on your needs. Go for the horizontal mode when catching up on tasks, and switch to vertical when you need to read a long document or scroll through social media. Gamers will appreciate an ultra-fast refresh rate of 144Hz that allows for immediate action, resulting in smoother, clearer movement in your favorite titles.</p>



<p>It also features plug-and-play functionality, which means you don’t need to install any dedicated drivers or follow complicated installation processes to get started. There are two fully functional USB Type-C connections and a Mini HDMI port, which you can use to connect the screen to a laptop, Mac, Xbox, PS5, Steam Deck, etc. Once paired with your device, you can prop it up anywhere you want, however you like. That’s thanks to a built-in stand which makes it easy to set up and adjust to your preferred viewing angle. For instance, you can have it upright for when you’re catching up on a work task on your desk, and switch to a more relaxed angle when streaming at night.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been looking to add a second screen to your setup without overpaying for one, this deal makes that possible. The 16.1-inch Arzopa portable gaming monitor offers crisp visuals, plus is ultra-lightweight for easy portability. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6601/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $130 to enjoy these features, but the current 25% discount at Amazon lets you do that for just $97.</a> But again, it’s a limited-time discount that wraps up soon. It’s best to get your orders in before it’s too late.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-ai-genai-podcast-patent-kratos-aloy-2000665334</link>
            <guid>1423948</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Have you ever sat down and thought about how you’d like a podcast hosted by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-live-action-series-amazon-kratos-ryan-hurst-2000659874"><span>Kratos</span></a><span> telling you about all the cool games you could be buying and playing on the PlayStation Store? Me neither, but it seems someone at Sony did, as the company has been granted a patent for AI-generated podcasts starring PlayStation characters as a kind of bespoke marketing tool to target players’ specific interests.</span></p> <p><span>The patent (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-patents-ai-generated-podcasts-voiced-by-characters-from-its-games/"><i><span>VGC</span></i></a><span>) was granted to Sony last month, and is called “LLM-Based Generative Podcasts for Gamers.” The company applied for the patent back in July 2024, long before we saw some of the other AI-generated performance tech Sony had been working on with the leaked tech demo of an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-ai-aloy-ps5-horizon-zero-dawn-1851769086"><span>AI-powered Aloy from </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span> in 2025</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Video game platforms currently lack the ability to provide unique and targeted content to gamers to update the gamers about things that are happening on the platform,” the patent reads. “There are currently no adequate solutions to the foregoing computer-related, technological problem.”</span></p> <p><span>Sony’s idea to combat this made-up problem is to create a daily AI-generated podcast in which characters like Parappa the Rapper, Ellie, or Jin Sakai give you recaps on your gameplay and updates on games that are out or on the way. This is framed as another way of personalizing the experience, as the character who reads off the marketing copy might be one from a game you’ve played recently, and would pull from your recent play history and friends list to cater the generated podcast to you. Examples in the patent include having someone like Nathan Drake tell you about your friends getting the Platinum in a game and recommending it to you, or having Ratchet keep you posted about patches and updates for the games you’re playing. The characters may also roast you for eating shit in your favorite game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Companies patent things that never actually come to be all the time, and considering how much legal red tape you’d need to get past to use actors’ performances to train these models on, along with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-game-darth-vader-1851784189"><span>SAG-AFTRA having recently negotiated AI guardrails</span></a><span> into its contract requiring actors to opt into such arrangements, I have a hard time seeing this ever come to fruition. Even so, this is just another example of a company trying to shoehorn AI into its products to solve problems that don’t exist. Turning your beloved characters into AI slop is another way of diluting your brand, one that Sony </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-2025-ghost-yotei-sales-plus-price-hike-2000653527"><span>has spent the better part of a decade crafting an image of prestige around</span></a><span>. I can’t imagine why the company would fuck that up and damage relationships with actors wary of AI being used to replace them, all for so little benefit.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/reanimal-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>1423942</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2026 is starting to ramp up for big releases, and Reanimal looks set to be one of the biggest horror titles of the year, attracting players across various platforms.</p>



<p>The Tarsier Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horror</a> title isn’t a platform exclusive, launching on the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X</a>|<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S</a>, but questions always revolve around the latter and whether the title is included in a Game Pass subscription.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for details on whether Reanimal is on Xbox Game Pass, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-reanimal-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Reanimal on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Horror. Image via Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Reanimal will not be available on the Xbox Game Pass service when the game launches on February 13.</strong></p>



<p>Reanimal is not a Microsoft-published title, and therefore is not eligible for automatic inclusion into the subscription service, and no announcement has been made about an agreement to bring the title onto the service at launch.</p>



<p>If Reanimal were to be available on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft would have made a big song and dance about its inclusion, and the silence on the matter confirms you’ll need to splash out to purchase the game if you want to play it.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-reanimal-be-added-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Reanimal be Added to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no news suggesting Reanimal will be available on Xbox Game Pass in the future, though this doesn’t mean it definitely won’t be available.</strong></p>



<p>Microsoft is constantly working with publishers around the world to secure new additions to the Game Pass catalog, and a deal could be made with THQ Nordic to bring the title to the subscription service later down the line.</p>



<p>Little Nightmares 2, which was also developed by Tarsier Studios, was added to the Game Pass service last year and remains available, showing that Microsoft has experience working with the developer.</p>



<p>Additionally, several games published by THQ Nordic are available through Game Pass, including Wreckfest and Way of the Hunter.</p>



<h2 id="h-games-like-reanimal-on-xbox-game-pass">Games Like Reanimal on Xbox Game Pass</h2>



<p><strong>Although Reanimal is not available on Game Pass, there are several games like the title that you can play with your subscription.</strong></p>



<p>Little Nightmares 2 is undoubtedly the closest thing to Reanimal you can play on Game Pass, as it was made by the same developer, Tarsier Studios, but the most recent edition in the franchise had a different developer and is not available on the service.</p>



<p>Other co-op experiences you can jump into with a Game Pass subscription include The Outlast Trials, while any of the Resident Evil games available with your subscription are worth trying out if you’re chasing the scare factor.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Nintendo Switch is officially the company's best-selling console ever, surpassing the Nintendo DS, which long held the record at 154.02 million units sold. As of December 31, 2025, 155.37 million Switch units have been sold, making it Nintendo's best-selling console ever, according to the company's latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">financial earnings report</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This doesn't necessarily come as a surprise, as the Switch has been trending toward taking that top spot for a while now, but it is perhaps surprising that the achievement occurred <em>after </em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-launches-in-june-for-44999">the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 last summer</a>. Of course, there are plenty of people still buying Switch consoles, especially with sales happening more frequently to liquidate stock in light of the Switch 2's launch, but it's a funny coincidence nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/ommYYipEGow?si=-kbhvEHrYIHIRftl" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ommYYipEGow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Through the third quarter, cumulative sell-in of Nintendo Switch surpassed that for Nintendo DS, reaching the highest sales volume of any Nintendo hardware," the earnings report reads. "The most recent figure shows that the number of annual playing users has remained steady. Even at this juncture between platform generations, the number of annual playing users remains above 100 million users, as in the previous year."&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo says that in prior generational leaps, its relationship with consumers was disrupted and challenged as consumers upgraded to the latest console. "In contrast, the Nintendo Switch install base, which is our largest ever, and the fact that many consumers continue to play on the platform, provide a strong business foundation that has supported the launch of Nintendo Switch 2," it notes in the earnings report.&nbsp;</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has already sold through 17.37 million units, according to the report, with 15 million of those sold in the console's first six months. Nintendo says Switch 2 adoption is growing at the fastest pace ever, "significantly outpacing even the Switch."</p><p url="https://youtu.be/fSK9ZOh9Wsc?si=GwPRHaqu7zw4Sdhq" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSK9ZOh9Wsc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Perhaps the Switch 2 will surpass the Switch's total units sold, but if that were to happen, it's years away at this point.&nbsp;</p><p>For more about the Switch 2, check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/08/new-joy-con-2-colors-will-launch-alongside-mario-tennis-fever-next-month">the new Joy Con 2 colors launching alongside Mario Tennis Fever</a> this month, and then check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/05/the-top-10-nintendo-switch-2-games"><em>Game Informer's </em>list of the top 10 Nintendo Switch 2 games</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Have you picked up a Switch 2?

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> keeps on rolling following its long-awaited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-reduced-installation-size">downsize of the PC installation size</a>. After a generous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-siege-breakers-warbond-adds-hammer-new-explosive-weapons-teases-new-enemy-faction">tease</a> last week, the Siege Breakers warbond plus the heavy Bastion Tank are now in the game.</p>
<p>As promised, 3rd February was the date in which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/506226349467240138?l=english">Patch 6.0.1</a> dropped. According to the in-universe live narrative, the Automaton Collective has stolen the schematics for the big superweapon Star of Peace. Thus, the mighty forces of Super Earth must break the robot resistance on its "own turf." Does that ring a bell? <em>Are we the baddies?</em></p>
<p>It doesn't really matter, as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> have been given new tools of destruction that will be used to spread democracy across the cosmos, whether the xenos want it or not. As the tip of the spear in this update, we have the Helldivers 1 classic <a href="https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Helldivers_1:TD-110_Bastion">Bastion Tank</a>, which offers scary firepower and high defence perfect to endure the most brutal enemy onslaughts. It'd been on many wishlists for months, so longtime fans will be happy to get their hands on it finally.</p>
<p>The Siege Breakers premium warbond (which you can farm for free as always) adds the bulk of new hard-hitting weaponry, with the LAS-16 Trident gun making a return, a huge hammer with explosive charges packing some pop, and the GL-28 Grenade Launcher and EAT-411 Leveller stratagems filling the scorched battlefields with grenade barrages and high-yield missiles respectively.</p>

<p>As always, plenty of cosmetics are also part of the non-rotating battle pass, as FOMO isn't part of Helldivers 2's language. The new melee weapon specifically may be the most fun to use, as melee damage has now been increased across the board to shake things up.</p><p>Additionally, plenty of regular guns have received changes to sway and other core stats, and victory poses and emotes are now interchangeable. Last but not least, a premium War Horse cosmetic set is now confirmed to arrive on 10th February through the Superstore if you need new preem swag.</p>
<p>It's all impressive and an excellent start to 2026, but Chinese-speaking players are probably celebrating the arrival of a complete Chinese voiceover to the game over everything else. If you've been plagued by instability following recent patches, more fixes have been included in this update as well, but it may take a while to check whether they're having the intended effect or not.</p>

		<p>It’s an exciting time to be a fan of Grasshopper Manufacture. With nearly three decades of bewildering punk-personified video games, the studio doesn’t seem to be slowing down at all. The team has spent the last few years celebrating their greatest hits, with the hotly anticipated finale <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/27/no-more-heroes-3-review/">No More Heroes 3</a> and a sharp remaster of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/shadows-of-the-damned">Shadows of the Damned</a>. Now, sights are set on new horizons, new worlds, and a new hero with the upcoming release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo Is a Dead Man</a>.</p>
<p>For all the change that Grasshopper Manufacture has gone through over the years, the unorthodox and endlessly inventive vision of studio head Suda51 has seemingly never wavered. We jumped at the chance to sit down with him and check in on how he’s feeling about his upcoming game, and reflect on some of his favourite projects, collaborators, and giant robot anime.</p>

<p><strong>TSA – &nbsp;Well it’s really awesome to be talking to you guys – especially right before Romeo Is a Dead Man, a new game of yours is launching. How are you feeling about it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> We’re really happy to be talking to you right now too, and thanks a lot for, you know, for covering us.</p>

<p>It’s kind of like, ‘Wow, it’s really, actually, finally coming out,’ you know? We’ve been really busy. We’re doing this promotional tour right now, we’re also still making final tweaks on everything, making sure everything’s in line. So it’s been really busy and pretty exhausting, but it’s also just super exciting, again, to finally have the game come out!</p>
<p><strong>TSA – I can tell you guys have been putting a lot of work in – Romeo Is a Dead Man looks incredible. It’s definitely the most high-fidelity, graphically detailed game that Grasshopper Manufacture has made up to this point. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] Wow, thank you.</p>
<div id="attachment_468410"><p id="caption-attachment-468410">Romeo Is a Dead Man features a more traditional “AAA” art style to previous Grasshopper games.</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – Was there a specific reason you guys wanted to go for that AAA graphic style for this game, instead of a more stylized or simplified style?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Well, when development really first started kind of getting going, I spoke with our art director, Tanawaki-san [<strong>Kunihiko Taniwaki],</strong> and he had the opinion that this time, we should go with not exactly a photo-realistic style, but more realistic graphics in general. More high-quality graphics, instead of, like, creating a whole new style of art and visuals just for this game.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for that is, obviously, it takes a lot of time and brain power and creativity to come up with a whole new style. The other thing is, when you’ve got a whole studio full of people working on the same game, it takes a lot of time and effort to everybody on the same page and get everyone to really understand ‘OK, so this is what everything’s supposed to look like. This is how I should make this.’</p>
<p>That was part of the reason there – it would just take a lot of time, it would take a lot of effort. And also, we kind of just wanted to see what we could do making more high-quality, more realistic graphics than we were used to doing.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – In the game, Romeo Stargazer is an FBI space-time special agent, and it’s the first time Grasshopper Manufacture has made a game about being on that side of the law since The Silver Case and 25th Ward. </strong><strong>Why make a game about an interstellar FBI agent instead of, for example, a demon hunter or assassins?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> This is kind of a weird way to start off the answer to this question, but when I first came up with the idea for the story and the character, as you could probably tell by playing the game, I was mainly inspired by Back to the Future and Rick &amp; Morty. Not only the space-time travel stuff but the relationships and everything.</p>
<p>So when I started thinking about what kind of main character I was going to make, to be honest, even I’m not sure of the <em>exact </em>reason why I decided this, but I thought ‘OK, this time I want to basically portray just a regular young dude, and write the story of how he kind of grows and develops into a grown man. And, you know, gets tough and stronger and really fulfils his own potential and stuff.’</p>
<p>Then came the ideas of him getting the special helmet and becoming Deadman and having to overcome all kinds of challenges and stuff. But yeah, I didn’t really set out with the idea of ‘OK, this time I’m going to go against the grain of Grasshopper titles – I’m going to make the guy somebody on <em>this </em>side of the law!’&nbsp;It just sort of happened, to be honest, and I don’t really have a specific reason why.</p>
<div id="attachment_468411"><p id="caption-attachment-468411">Romeo Stargazer is an FBI space-time special agent.</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – It’s interesting that you talk about the idea for the character kind of being about wanting to see a young man become stronger and grow. It feels like that’s a little different than a lot of your previous characters, where they start already kind of being these rough, mean, weird dudes. Was there a reason why that kind of story really appealed to you this time for Romeo Is a Dead Man?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Up ‘til now, like you said, there’s been a lot of characters who are kind of the exact opposite. For example, Travis Touchdown – you got this guy who, he’s a grown man, but pretty immature and kind of screwed up and, you know, he’s got a pension for being a bit rough and violent.</p>
<p>I think it might have been subconscious – or might have actually been a little bit of a conscious decision and I just didn’t really notice until recently – but I think part of me was probably like, since I’ve been working on characters particularly like Travis Touchdown for so long, I think maybe this time I’m going to go the other way and have the character start out <em>not </em>fully developed yet. And also, you know, not be this kind of… funky asshole, I guess you could say. I think that probably did, at least on a subconscious level, influence my decision to start with this sort of character in this sort of story and how he was portrayed.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – You’ve talked in the past about how your team works collaboratively to share ideas and build them together. Is there an idea that made it into the final version of Romeo Is a Dead Man that surprised you? Like something you didn’t come up with yourself at all, or something you would have never thought of or expected to work in the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] Uhh… oh, there’s a part of the game called [Deadgear Cannonball], where you can use it to power up Romeo and the stuff he can do. And at the beginning [of development], one of the staff members said ‘Hey, I want to put this type of mini-game thing in the game, it’ll become like a Pac-Man style thing, and you just power up, and this is how it would work.’</p>
<p>When they explained it, I was kind of like ‘What the hell are you talking about, like why…’ and they were like, ‘No, I really want to do this, we should try this out.’ And then, you know, it got put in the game, and when we started the debugging phase, bit by bit, I tried it out and I was like ‘Yeah…I still don’t really get it. Like, again, what is this Pac-Man rip-off thing? What’s this really even for?’</p>
<p>But then, when development progressed even further and it got to the point were we could play through the game linearly, I started realising not only does it fit in really well and it kind of flows really well with the rest of the game, but it’s actually a really important element in the game. Yeah, that was a really good idea. I’m really glad we put that in.</p>
<p>To be honest, I haven’t told that person that! [Laughs]
</p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GhM Direct 30 Seconds: Ep. 14 - Deadgear Cannonball" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6v8ncSULh0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>TSA – In Romeo Is A Dead Man, and a few other Grasshopper Games, you’re credited as “SUDA51” for the Directing and the Story, but Producer gets credited to your real name, Goichi Suda. Why the distinction?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] I feel like Suda51 is more connected to the creative side of things, and naming wise it kind of fits better with that. But using my real name, you know, Goichi Suda, that sounds a bit more serious, like, you know, CEO-ish, than just Suda51. Like a dude wearing a suit with, like, a proper tie and everything. And so I thought it might be best to kind of split the way I use my names in that way.</p>
<p>Also, to be honest, I’m also just trying to look cool.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – You could look cool wearing the leather jacket and the necktie. Could be interesting?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Sounds like a pretty bitchin’ style. I might try it out.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – I know that your original vision for Shadows of the Damned ended up spawning multiple drafts, and some of those drafts inspired later works like Kurayami Dance and Black Knight Sword. Did any ideas from those drafts end up inspiring Romeo Is A Dead Man?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Nothing from Shadows of the Damned, no. All the different drafts that got made for Shadows of the Damned either just got trashed, or got canned, or turned into something else. But none of them had anything to do with Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – The last few games from Grasshopper Manufacturer almost feel like Avengers movies with how many returning characters there are. You’ve brought back characters from Let it Die, Killer 7, Shadows of the Damned, and even your short story ‘Aka to Ao to Midori to’.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Woah, haha. You did thorough research!</p>
<p><strong>TSA – &nbsp;For Romeo Is a Dead Man, did you have any characters you’ve wanted to bring back, but couldn’t?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Actually, yeah: Fleming from Shadows of the Damned. I believe it was the seventh draft, maybe, that I had him actually appear as one of the bosses in the game. It’s really unfortunate, but things changed and he ended up not being able to make it. It’s a shame.</p>
<p>I actually wanted to put Fleming in No More Heroes 3, as well. That also, as you know, ended up not working out. But in my mind, Fleming is this character that I want to have battle all these other characters in my other games and stuff. I just really don’t want him to be a one-off thing – I want to use him again, you know?</p>
<p>And this is just, like, talking out of my ass here, but if someday, like 20 years from now or something, if we end up doing like a remake of No More Heroes 3, then I’m hoping to be able to kind of shoehorn him in there.</p>
<p>But I really do want to see him head into battle against a lot of the other characters that I make. Actually, for both Romeo Is a Dead Man and No More Heroes 3, it got so far, to the point where I actually wrote the scenario with Fleming in it – both with Romeo and with Travis in the two different games. Again, unfortunately, it just ended up not working out, so, what are you going to do? But it wasn’t just kind of like a one-off idea that I had and said ‘oh no, never mind.’ I actually did put the effort into it.</p>
<div id="attachment_468409"><p id="caption-attachment-468409">Fleming from Shadows of the Damned never quite made it into later games.</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – What was the reason for Fleming not making it, in that case? Was it kind of just that creatively the draft and your vision for the game went in a different direction where it didn’t make sense to have him there for Romeo Is A Dead Man? Or was it some sort of outside reason?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> It’s actually a really simple reason, to be honest. Just scheduling reasons. We have to deal with both scheduling, and someone’s got to pay for this stuff too. When it came down to it, we were like, ‘Okay, we’re gonna end up going way over schedule on this. We have to tweak some stuff, we’re gonna have to cut some stuff.’</p>
<p>And honestly, just one of the parts that happened to be easiest to cut without screwing up other parts of the game would have been the Fleming part. So he got cut because of that.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – You’ve regularly collaborated with surprising multimedia artists for your games, like Boneface for Travis Strikes Again or AC-BU for the Velvet Chair Girl scenes in No More Heroes 3. How do you decide when to bring in outside artists like this to collab with, and how do you pick them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> It really just comes down to the artist, and the art they make, and whether I dig it, and whether I feel like it’d be something that would be a good fit. For example, Boneface, I’ve been aware of his art, I’ve seen it online and in different places and just thought it looked really cool, and reached out and said ‘Hey, would you like to maybe do something with us for this game series that I got going here?’</p>
<p>For AC-BU, I happen to know a guy who had connections with them, and went through with the director named Mizuno and ended up being able to talk to them directly and show them what we were trying to do and the kind of thing we were trying to achieve. And, also, I’ve seen the stuff that they’ve done before, and just thought it was really cool and thought ‘okay, considering what it is we’re trying to achieve now, considering the stuff that these people are obviously able to do – I think this would be a pretty good fit, so let’s try and work it out.’</p>
<p>Sometimes, it’ll be that somebody introduces me to these people and I’ll check their stuff out and be like ‘Oh, yeah, that’s somebody I’d like to work with.’ And sometimes it’ll be somebody that I’ve kind of found on my own and just kind of reached out to on my own and been like ‘Oh, hey, this is who I am. You want to work together?’</p>
<p>But yeah, as far as how I choose the different artists to work with and why? It’s pretty much sort of a case-by-case.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Are there any artists you’d like to collaborate with for the next Grasshopper Manufacture game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> I don’t really have a concrete idea yet for ‘This is the person I want to work with for our next game!’ or ‘This is exactly what our next game is going to be!’. But we do have a couple projects that we’re sort of <em>not</em> working on, as in actually developing, but planning and fleshing out the ideas for and everything. We have a couple of those in the works and I do have a couple ideas for those. Like if we really are going to do this project, then <em>this </em>is somebody that I’d like to work with for this particular one.</p>
<p>Actually, there is one guy that I just thought of who I’d like to work with a little more, in a much more full capacity, you could say. He’s a manga artist name Asano Inio, he did the art for Midori Midorikawa and Kamui in No More Heroes 3. Not only did I really like the art that he did for that game, but I’ve seen the manga he does, I’ve seen the art he does before, and I think it’s awesome.</p>

<p>Instead of just having him be sort of like a guest artist or guest creator on a game, I’d really like to get into a whole game with this guy, do like an actual collaboration where instead of just doing one or two characters, this is the guy who’s doing a whole lot more art for the game. I’d love to do some sort of collaboration with him at some point.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Oh, I’m a big fan of that author. He did that manga, Dead Dead Demon’s Dededede Destruction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Yeah! That one! Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – One of my favorite games of yours is Let It Die, and it’s also the only console game you’ve worked on with online interactions, where you send NPC hunters from your game to other player’s worlds to hunt them. Is there a reason you haven’t returned to that online style for your games since?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> To be honest, as far as Let It Die goes, it’s known to be a Grasshopper Manufacture game, but I don’t really consider that to be the case.</p>
<p>Technically, I did participate, and some of us did participate in development, but it was a GungHo game, basically. And, you know, the online stuff is because GungHo is basically an online game company.</p>
<p>I consider Let It Die to be, not necessarily a Grasshopper Manufacture game, but a Supertrick Games game. They’re the ones who did most development. So yeah, the online elements aren’t exactly our thing, that’s much more of a GungHo thing. Nothing wrong with that – it’s just not really something that we’re into, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Well now I feel embarrassed for saying it’s one of my favorites from you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Don’t worry, it’s cool, technically we were involved in the development and stuff! So it’s not wrong, don’t worry about it.</p>

<p><strong>TSA – Well, <em>another</em> one of my favorites from Grasshopper Manufacture is Travis Strikes Again, and it felt like an incredibly personal video game, where so many of the stories and characters seemed to be reflections of your own history in the world of game development. Did you face any challenges making that game and writing it the way you did?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> For Travis Strikes Again, I wouldn’t say that it was hard or difficult to write the characters and write them the way that I did. It definitely felt different than the way it usually does to write characters. […]
</p><p>Travis Strikes Again was actually done around the 20th anniversary of Grasshopper Manufacture being established, so we wanted to do something special for that, and we got a lot of leeway from companies – for example at Capcom, they were like ‘OK, well seeing as how it’s their 20th anniversary and stuff, you can use stuff from Killer 7,’ and things like this.</p>
<p>I did include a lot of characters that, for most players, probably seemed to be new characters, and a lot of familiar characters from previous games. But the thing is, a lot of the characters that people hadn’t seen before, they weren’t made necessarily for Travis Strikes Again – they were characters that I’d come up with either for other games that ended up not making it into that game, […] or the game itself ended up getting canned for some reason, or just ended up never coming to fruition.</p>

<p>So a lot of the story and the characters that I wrote for Travis Strikes Again, it was almost an elegy to these characters who, you know, they… not necessarily died. I mean, most of them in the game died, but you know, they were kind of stuck in this limbo. By finally being able to get them out there and put them in the game, I was kind of trying to help them to finally just ascend and finally move on, you know what I mean? And not just for the characters, but for myself as well.</p>
<p>So, I did put a lot of my older ideas and past ideas and characters into the game. Again, that was also partly because it was for the 20th anniversary of Grasshopper. I personally wanted to do something special for this game. That’s why you see so many things that kind of feel like they come out of left field. Sometimes they feel a little bit more natural, but they’re clearly, you know, ‘Oh this is this guy from that other game!’</p>
<p>And again, a lot of the stuff that people assumed were new were actually, you know, they may have showed up, or almost showed up in 1, 2, 3, 4 past games, but ended up not. So, yeah, Travis Strikes Again, it was a big sort of jumble of these characters, and me not only trying to help these characters kind of move on and finally, you know, get what I felt they deserved, but also sort of letting myself kind of let them go. Finally being able to say, okay, I was finally able to put them out there. I’ve done for them what I can have done for them, what I owe them. This is their elegy.</p>
<p>That’s kind of what Travis Strikes Again was like writing, for me.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – I know batting centers are important to you, so important you made sure to include one in The Silver Case. When you’re travelling abroad for work, is there a place you go to that feels like the overseas version of going to the batting center to be alone with your thoughts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] Yeah, I’m kind of too scared to like, actually go out on my own when I’m overseas to like, find a place where I can just kind of be alone with my thoughts and stuff. That would mean that I have to go out all by myself like a big boy and, you know, find some place to chill and everything. And I can’t really do that.</p>
<p>So, I’d probably say my hotel room. [laughs] I guess that would be my overseas batting center.</p>
<div id="attachment_333568"><p id="caption-attachment-333568">Uh, here’s a screenshot from RBI Baseball 19, which we have handy…</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – I also know that bars and beer have been important to you for a long time, no matter where you are in the world. What is it about drinking at ‘bar plastic model’ in Golden Gai, hunting for Blue Moon when you’re overseas, and going to your old “third meeting room” Motsuyaki Kawakami that you enjoy the most?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interpreter</strong> <strong>–</strong> I mean, have you had beer before?</p>
<p><strong>TSA – [Laughs] I have had beer before. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Have you been to ‘bar plastic model’ before?</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Yeah actually, I was in Japan two years ago and went!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong>&nbsp; To me, it’s kind of like a present to myself, kind of like a reward to myself. I don’t know how people outside of Japan feel about this, but to a lot of Japanese people, that’s kind of what having a beer after work is. So you finished a day, a long day of hard work, and ‘OK, I’m going to reward myself with beer.’ You know?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, during Corona I just kind of stopped drinking that much and kind of stopped being able to. Partly because I stopped being able to go out to drink so much, I also stopped being able to drink so much at all. […] I get wasted a lot easier than I used to. So instead of staying out having a bunch of drinks, yeah, usually I just keep it to like one beer or so and that’s enough. I’m like ‘OK, yeah, that was some good work I did today. Just pound one back and that’s cool.’</p>
<p><strong>TSA – I can tell you’re a big fan of beer because you called it Corona instead of Covid.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] that’s just what it’s called in Japan, but that’s a good one!</p>
<p><strong>TSA – What haven’t I asked that you would like to talk about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Hmmmm, I’m not sure. Let’s see… have you beaten the game yet?</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Not yet! I’m on the second boss right now.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Ahhh, okay. When you beat it, there’s gonna be a lot of questions you want to ask, and a lot of things i want to talk about. So let’s save those, and after you beat it let’s talk again.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Alright, I’ll beat it, and we’ll talk about that, and we’ll talk about Char’s Counterattack. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Oh, have you seen GQuuuuuuX? [Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX]
</p><div id="attachment_468407"><p id="caption-attachment-468407">Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – Oh, I <em>loved</em> GQuuuuuuX. </strong><strong>I have the model kit for the GFreD mobile suit!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Oh. Nice, nice. I was waiting for ‘How much influence did GQuuuuuuX have on Romeo Is a Dead Man?’ – that’s one question that I was hoping you’d ask.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Well, I definitely wanted to talk about anime. I’d love to know what you thought about GQuuuuuuX, being such a big fan of the original Char story. Did you like GQuuuuuuX?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> There’s one part of the game where it’s really clear that this part was really, really inspired heavily by GQuuuuuuX. So, yeah, once you’ve cleared the game, once you got to that part, let’s talk about that again!</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Thanks to Suda51 for taking the time to talk to us about Romeo Is a Dead Man and everything else! <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/05/grasshopper-manufactures-romeo-is-a-dead-man-lands-in-february/">Romeo Is a Dead Man is launching on 11th February 2026</a> for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</em></p>

		<p>Revisiting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/super-mario-bros-wonder-review/">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> in 2026 is an experience as full of delights and surprises as it was in 2023. NIntendo absolutely knocked it out of the park with their trippy, transformative levels that just brought so much playfulness back to the 2D platformer… but that was paired with a fairly by-the-numbers multiplayer.</p>
<p>Super Mario Bros. Wonder – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> + Meetup in Bellabel Park improves on this in some ways, but sticks to that classic Nintendo stubbornness in others.</p>
<p><iframe title="More fun is coming to the Flower Kingdom March 26th! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-LgNT3oIw6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Meetup in Bellabel Park is all in on multiplayer shenanigans, with multiple areas devoted to different ways to play. Local multiplayer is still the only way to actually share a level together, while any kind of online multiplayer turns everyone into ghosts, so you’re not really playing together. The sneaky way out of this tangle is that Switch 2 has GameShare to let you stream the game to another console, which can be local or via online GameChat. It’s not the same as native online multiplayer (the resolution is lower and there’s a big info bar shrinking the screen), but it will have to do.</p>


<p>So, that’s how you can play the new Local Multiplayer Plaza with people outside of your postcode, but what is it? There’s 17 different stages here, with some co-operative and others competitive, all for up to four players, and all putting a much more inventive spin on the core 2D plaforming.</p>
<p>Phanto Tag takes Prop Hunt and the classic game of Tag and puts them in a blender, as masked players need to track, chase and catch the others within a single screen arena. They can run, of course, but they will also need to hide by disguising themselves as items and props, trying to make use of the shifting objects and shading of the screen. It’s a good bit of competitive fun.</p>
<p>On the complete opposite end of the scale, another stage invokes the spirit of the Wii U Gamepad and New Super Mario Bros. U, tasking some players with drawing donut block platforms across the screen so that others can make it through the level, and also using them to solve puzzles. It’s a great use of the returning idea, not least because you can use the Joy-Con 2 in mouse mode to draw the platforms.</p>

<p>Then there’s Bob-omb Relay, where you need to throw the bomb back and forth when prompted, but also have to get it into the correct player’s hands, or you could each be trying to feed your own Baby Yoshi the apples that spawn all over the screen through a level, while having to deal with the Baby Yoshi getting bigger and fatter and slowing you down.</p>
<p>After sampling a couple of those levels, we then ran around the Bellabel hub to reach the Game Room Plaza, and the six attractions for up to 12 players online (or up to 8 players with local wireless). These take a simple ideas and Wonder Flower effects, like riding on a Propeller Flower or hanging onto a giant bouncy ball, and spin them into competitive modes where you’ll race as ghosts through to the finish. They’re simple fun, but deceptively so. Bouncing the ball and needing to hit the right angled surfaces to bounce yourself forward faster, and avoid the back-tilted ones that would sap all your momentum is something I didn’t quite master, but the shmup-like obstacle dodging of the Propeller Flower races? I was pretty good at those!</p>

<p>There’s more to this expansion and update that we didn’t delve into, such as the Co-Star Luma, using the Assist modes, or how the Koopalings have sprinkled new challenges through the Flower Kingdom of the main game, but if you were wanting just a little bit more spark to the multiplayer of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, then you might want to schedule your meetup… in Bellabel Park.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hands on with Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/03/hands-on-with-virtual-boy-nintendo-classics/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s easy to think of Nintendo as this unstoppable family-friendly gaming juggernaut, given their most recent track record, but for every golden patch, there’s been struggles and ill-fated projects. The Wii U is the most recent example, and beloved as the GameCube is, it still ended up in third place in its generation. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/virtual-boy">Virtual Boy</a>, though, was on a whole other level, a critical and commercial flop that barely lasted a year.</p>
<p>Perfect, then, for a revival within the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online</a> + Expansion Pack game library for both Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, with a pricey plastic recreation (or cardboard equivalent) needed in order to play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics – Introducing games and features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QvskekdB9t4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Virtual Boy accessory looks utterly authentic to the original –&nbsp;having only ever been released in Japan and the Americas, it’s sadly not a console I’ve seen in the flesh. It’s a chunky plastic red and black visor mounted onto a pair of angled legs at a fixed height. Where the original had a bespoke red LED display that sought to balance cost, price and usability, that’s now substituted out for a Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 to provide the screen, which is then passed through lenses and a red light filter to recreate the original’s stereoscopic effect. The cardboard edition will likely have a lot in common with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/11/labo-vr-is-the-most-creative-use-of-virtual-reality-yet/">the Labo VR kit</a>, from Nintendo’s 2019 cardboard experiments.</p>
<div id="attachment_468403"><p id="caption-attachment-468403">The original Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED and Switch 2 can all be used to provide the screen for the Virtual Boy accessory.</p>
</div>
<p>While we’re much more familiar with VR headsets since 2016, with evangelists for the tech still happily strapping screens to their heads for the latest experiences (or just more Beat Saber), the mid-90s were much, much more cautious. There’s the spectre of eye-strain and headaches that have stuck in the Virtual Boy’s legacy, but I wonder how much of that was down to the way you have to use the headset.</p>
<p>It comes with a set of fixed legs to position the Virtual Boy on a table, and you then have to place your face into the headset. You can’t adjust the height of the headset, though, only tilt it back and forth, so for me that meant leaning forward and arching my back to view inside, which is bound to give you a bad back after too long playing like this. I know I’d be stacking this on boxes and thick textbooks if playing at home. Why didn’t Nintendo take this opportunity to fix this?</p>
<div id="attachment_468398"><p id="caption-attachment-468398">I wish I’d brought a stack of books to preview the Virtual Boy accessory.</p></div>
<p>The other issue is that this means your view is constantly moving when using it, and through the lenses, that can lead to shifting focus and sharpness through the lenses. A big part of modern VR is getting the headset mounted in the sweet spot and then having it stay there, and this can’t manage the same.</p>
<p>All of the Virtual Boy games will be wrapped up in the familiar Switch Online classic game library interface and features, though these are all rendered in red and black, just like the games themselves. You can pause the game at any time to check the controls, set a new suspend point, swap back and forth between games at will – it’s just a solid and to the point emulation wrapper at this point.</p>
<div id="attachment_468399"><p id="caption-attachment-468399">Virtual Boy Wario Land has some nicely layered environments and pioneered the multi-plane 2D platformer trope.</p></div>
<p>So what of the games? Naturally the Virtual Boy’s library is rather small, and seven of these games will appear on day one. Virtual Boy Wario Land is immediately the main attraction, launching a year after his Game Boy game and giving a similar feeling platforming experience. Wario is more brutish in his actions, charging into enemies and slamming into breakable objects, and the levels are more open-ended here as you explore an underground cave. What’s rather nice is the 3D depth to the parallax effect, and I was surprised at how smoothly things could move along the Z-axis of my view. Things like spiked balls swinging in and out of the screen, which you need to dodge with Wario. It’s pretty neat and likely the first game most people will play.</p>
<p>I also gave a few other games a quick go, including Teleroboxer. It’s a fairly straightforward Punch Out! style game, though pitting you against robot boxers, made of layered parallax elements, giving a simple but effective 3D depth as the fists come out towards you. Galactic Pinball, meanwhile, is exactly what you expect from a pinball game, but it’s in a low resolution 3D, making the distant parts of the table feel really rather distant and with a ball that moves rather slowly.</p>
<div id="attachment_468402"><p id="caption-attachment-468402">Teleroboxer layers sprites to create your robotic adversaries.</p></div>
<p>The last title I dipped into with my hands on time was Red Alarm, a 3D rail shooter in the vein of Star Fox, but with a wire-frame 3D instead of shaded surfaces (which would be very difficult to manage with a monochrome screen). The additional quirk was a lack of occlusion, so you can see enemies clearly through the obstacles and walls you fly past.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Virtual Boy library will also feature 3D Tetris, Golf and the formerly Japan exclusive The Mansion of Innsmouth, coming to the West for the first time. A further nine games are then set to release through the rest of 2026, including the previously unreleased titles D-Hopper and Zero Racers. There’s also the upcoming feature to switch from red-only pixel art and change the graphics colour to yellow, green, white and potentially other colours. I really think that an off-white might end up being the best visual colour, balancing brightness with the clarity of a Game Boy Pocket (which was able to do away with the green tint of the original Game Boy screen). I’m also rather curious to see whether the Switch OLED provides a better screen for the Virtual Boy accessory than the LCD-based Switch 2.</p>
<div id="attachment_468401"><p id="caption-attachment-468401">This sure is a pinball game, and it looks 3D…</p></div>
<p>The Virtual Boy accessory and library of games coming to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is both great to see and pretty baffling. It’s great to see Nintendo revisit such a fleeting console and revive and preserve another facet of their legacy like this, but it’s baffling that they haven’t made an effort to tweak the design even slightly to make it more adjustable and comfortable. And it also just leaves me wondering, why didn’t they port these games to Nintendo 3DS? Surely that would have made the most sense?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Preview: So Far, Super Mario Bros. Wonder On Switch 2 Isn't Making A Great Case For Itself]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/so-far-super-mario-bros-wonder-on-switch-2-isnt-making-a-great-case-for-itself</link>
            <guid>1423888</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="e0fbf79984e66"><a title="Bellabel Park 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0fbf79984e66/bellabel-park-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> launched in 2023, I felt an overwhelming sense of relief. Finally, after a deluge of perfectly serviceable yet uninspiring ‘<strong>New</strong>’ entries, it felt like 2D Mario had gotten its mojo back. Fast-forward to 2026 and Wonder is making its grand return with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> on <strong>26th March</strong>, but after recently going hands-on with the multiplayer segment, I have to admit that it’s yet to conjure up any excitement within me.</p>
<p>I should caveat this immediately by clarifying that I’m not the biggest fan of multiplayer games in the first place. I’m at my happiest when I’m able to just block out the real world and get lost in a game with no outside distractions, so do keep that in mind when reading my thoughts. If you <em>are</em> partial to some multiplayer mayhem, then you may well feel that the ‘Meetup at Bellabel Park’ additions are worth it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2eb2168b1edbf"><a title="Bellabel Park 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2eb2168b1edbf/bellabel-park-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My session consisted of one co-op mode and three PvP modes (or 'attractions', as the game calls them). The first makes use of the Switch 2’s Mouse Mode, with two players directly controlling characters, and two more creating Donut Blocks on the fly to allow passage across wide gaps and directly manipulate the trajectory of enemy attacks. It was… fine. It kind of hints towards some of the potential for a <strong>Mario Maker</strong> game that utilises mouse controls, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>In practice, having two players create Donut Blocks at the same time makes for a pretty messy, confusing experience, since you’re constantly at odds with one another regarding where to actually place the blocks. In addition, if you accidentally move vertically when placing your blocks, you might find yourself completely blocking the way forward for your player-controlled companions. In this instance, you’ll need to make some more blocks in a random corner of the screen in order to cause your previous creations to eventually disappear. As I said, it's very messy.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e48af1b58e1e6"><a title="Bellabel Park 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e48af1b58e1e6/bellabel-park-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Two of the three PvP modes were racers, with one seeing you speed through the air on a flying vehicle, and the other rolling everybody up into balls and subsequently using physics to bounce you across the map. They last for about a minute at a time, tops, and although there’s a brief thrill in witnessing a photo finish and seeing who comes out on top via the results page, it’s all pretty forgettable stuff. I struggle to imagine many people jumping into these modes more than a handful of times.</p>
<p>And finally, the last PvP mode I played was essentially a game of hide and seek. Three players jump into Lakitu Clouds and fly around. When you press ‘A’, you can make your character invisible, effectively blending your Lakitu Cloud with dozens of others dotted around the screen. The person who’s ‘it’ will then try to find you, shooting out puffs of magic to help reveal your location. If you’re caught, you become ‘it’ – simple. The aim of the game is to remain hidden until the time runs out, so there's a frantic rush within the last 20 seconds or so to stay out of reach.</p>
<p>It’s a laugh, but again, if I mentally take myself away from the highly curated environment in which I tested these modes out, am I really going to bother with these in the comfort of my own home? Honestly, probably not.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2f03af36c9c71"><a title="Bellabel Park 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f03af36c9c71/bellabel-park-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might think differently, but all of the modes felt like minigames you might play in a <strong>Mario Party</strong> title. Taken within that context, they could be a lot of fun, but as standalone games that you have to consciously choose from the Bellabel Park overworld, they lack substance and feel throwaway.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I’m struggling to find much of a reason to splash out on the <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> Upgrade Pack for Mario Wonder so far. I did take note of just how sharp, clean, and vibrant the visuals were in the Switch 2 Edition, so that <em>might</em> be just enough to convince me to make a leap. But if the multiplayer modes were meant to tempt me into a purchase, I’m afraid they’ve largely failed in their task.</p>
<p>There's definitely more to the Switch 2 Edition, including challenges via the Toad Brigade, the return of The Koopalings, an Assist mode — something which should help with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-my-daughter-made-me-realise-that-mario-wonders-difficulty-options-need-work">an issue I encountered with my daughter</a> in the base game — and of course, playable Rosalina. Though whether these features warrant an upgrade remains to be seen.</p>
<p>As an aside, I also had a chance to briefly check out the upcoming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR4W3e-_3zs">Talking Flower</a>, uh... toy? Yeah, let's go with toy. It honestly wasn't the best environment in which to test it out; I really had to strain to hear what it was saying. Regardless, it's a fine little thing if you're after a charming little accessory for your office desk.</p>
<p>Sorry... what do you mean it's meant for kids? Don't be silly.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-offloads-45w-nano-usb-c-wall-charger-at-record-low-on-amazon-2000665169</link>
            <guid>1423864</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Anker Nano USB-C Wall Charger takes a regular single-port brick and transforms it into a 45-watt USB-C fast charger that has brains and flexibility. It provides sufficient power to rapidly charge recent iPhone models, compatible iPads, and a large number of other USB-C devices, and it features a front display that shows you exactly what is happening while your equipment is charging. The very compact body makes it easy to place the charger on a strip with multiple other chargers or to toss it into a bag. Additionally, the folding plug rotates, so it will sit neatly even in an odd-shaped outlet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7012/">You can head to Amazon and grab the Anker Nano USB-C Wall Charger for just $30, reduced from $40.</a> That represents a savings of $10 and 25% off the original retail price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7012/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A fast-charging wall unit that’ll get all your devices to 100%</h2>
<p>The Anker Nano’s output adjusts the power provided as your battery level changes. When a supported phone is low, the charger delivers as much energy as possible to quickly get you out of the red zone, and once it’s nearly fully charged, it slows power delivery to prevent overheating.</p>
<p>The smart display is located on the front of the charger and converts the charging process from a mysterious activity into one you can easily see. A single tap displays real-time power usage and general status; a double tap alternates between modes; and a long press turns the display around when the charger is attached to a strip or wall outlet, so it can be viewed when it’s plugged in upside-down. The display will also automatically shut off after a brief period of non-use, so it won’t disturb you as you sleep.</p>



<p>While Care Mode is engaged, the charging profile is modified to keep the adapter and phone at a lower temperature than a standard high-output 45W brick would. This is particularly beneficial for those who plan to charge their phones overnight on a nightstand. Over time, gentle charging can help maintain long-term battery health. Having this logic built directly into the wall charger itself eliminates the need to manually toggle through individual application settings to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Design and compatibility complete the charger. Both prongs on the charger fold into the housing for travel and can be rotated, allowing them to fit tightly in outlets without blocking nearby sockets. A single USB-C port is located on the top of the charger, keeping the design simple. Also, the Nano supports charging of both iPhone and iPad models, Samsung phones, and many other types of USB-C devices. Included in the package are the 45-watt smart display wall charger and a welcome guide. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7012/">At $30 on sale, down from the usual $40, it’s an easy upgrade over a basic slow cube.</a></p>

<p>Map Conditions are a crucial aspect of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, as each one can shift how you engage with your next raid. Some might encourage you to fight an elite ARC enemy, like the Queen or Matriarch, whilst others lock off certain POIs until you open them.</p>



<p>It’s not just for fun, though, as some Conditions can offer better—or sometimes exclusive—loot. However, you can’t jump into these various Map Conditions whenever you’d like, as they’re on a strict schedule, meaning you’ll need to plan your raids accordingly.</p>







<p>If you’re looking to play a specific Map Condition in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-pve-mode/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-pve-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, then look no further, as Insider Gaming has all of the timings for each one listed below.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-arc-raiders-map-conditions">All ARC Raiders Map Conditions</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You can’t fight it all the time. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are currently 10 Map Conditions in rotation for ARC Raiders, and these are split into two categories: Minor and Major Map Conditions.</strong></p>



<p>Each Map Condition has its own unique gimmicks that change up gameplay, and Embark Studios is regularly adding new ones or altering pre-existing ones. Additionally, some are exclusive to certain maps, as they’re dependent on the setting; for example, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bird City</a> is exclusive to Buried City, meaning you’ll only find the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/epic-rubber-ducks-in-arc-raiders-how-to-find-all-rubber-ducks/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/epic-rubber-ducks-in-arc-raiders-how-to-find-all-rubber-ducks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rare Rubber Ducks</a> when that Minor Map Condition is in rotation.</p>



<p>Here’s the list of every ARC Raiders Minor Map Condition currently in rotation:</p>



<ul>
<li>Uncovered Caches</li>



<li>Husk Graveyard</li>



<li>Matriarch</li>



<li>Launch Tower Loot</li>



<li>Harvester</li>



<li>Bird City</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the list of every ARC Raiders Major Map Condition currently in rotation:</p>



<ul>
<li>Night Raid</li>



<li>Electromagnetic Storm</li>



<li>Hidden Bunker</li>



<li>Locked Gate</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-every-map-event-schedule-in-arc-raiders">Every Map Event Schedule In ARC Raiders</h2>



<p><strong>The ARC Raiders Map Conditions run on a regular schedule, with each map rotating every hour. </strong></p>



<p>Every Map Condition runs for an hour at a time, and once the timer’s up, a new Event will take its place. However, not every map has an Event always running, and there are often downtime periods. It encourages experiencing different maps and working with different strategies, but you’ll need to plan ahead if you’re hoping to play during a specific one.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has the entire ARC Raiders Map Condition schedule listed below, but it’s according to the Pacific time zone. If you live in another time zone, be sure to alter the timings according to the time zone converter below:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Events Return After Blip Removes Them From The Game]]></title>

            <guid>1423855</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last night, ARC Raiders players were busying themselves with querying the <strong>disappearance of events </strong>in ARC Raiders. In social circles worldwide, fans of the extraction adventure were asking why there were no ARC Raiders events live, given that they’re a persistent feature that rotate non-stop, keeping things fresh for players.</p>



<p>In a post on the game’s Discord server, it was confirmed that an ‘issue with the map conditions schedule’ has been resolved and that events are <strong>back in rotation</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-events-are-back-and-bird-city-has-changed">ARC Raiders Events Are Back, and Bird City Has Changed</h2>



<p>In a post on the ARC Raiders Discord server, the community team confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Last night there was an issue with the map conditions schedule. We just pushed an update enabling this week’s schedule while also increasing the frequency of Bird City. No download required, but please restart your game to update. We will keep revising and try to find a schedule for all conditions so that all time zones get a chance to play.</p>



<p>There is no store rotation or patch this week, but keep an eye out for the update coming next week.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That statement refers to the disappointment from fans regarding the rotation for Bird City, a minor map condition introduced in the most recent update. It had an awkward schedule, prompting some to stress that ‘those with jobs’ couldn’t access it.</p>



<p>For several hours last night, ARC Raiders events disappeared from the game, leaving a blank map palette that offered no special conditions under which to explore Embark Studios’ extraction title. That meant no Harvester, no Hidden Bunker, and no Electromagnetic Storm, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Fans began to panic, thinking it was an indication of something awful happening at Embark Studios, but it was little more than a momentary blip that was rectified by the team.</p>







<p>Were you worried about the disappearance of ARC Raiders events? Let us know which one you missed the most during the outage on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is High on Life 2 on Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/high-on-life-2-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>1423852</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new foul-mouthed shooter is on the horizon with the release of High on Life 2, and, like with any release, there is discussions about whether the game is available on Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>The action-adventure <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shooter</a> from Squanch Games releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X</a>|<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-s/">S</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/high-on-life-2-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 13</a>, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch later down the line.</p>



<p>If you’re an Xbox player and want to know if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> is included with your Game Pass subscription, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-high-on-life-2-on-xbox-game-pass">Is High on Life 2 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Landing zone. Image via Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, High on Life 2 is included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription and will be playable on day one when it launches on February 13.</strong></p>



<p>The approach is not a surprise, as a similar launch was taken with the original game, and means those with a subscription to Game Pass won’t have to splash out to purchase High on Life 2 outright.</p>



<p>However, following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes made to the Game Pass service</a> last year, the availability of High on Life 2 depends on which tier of subscription you are signed up to.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-game-pass-subscription-tier-is-needed-for-high-on-life-2">What Game Pass Subscription Tier is Needed For High on Life 2?</h2>



<p><strong>A Game Pass Ultimate</strong> <strong>subscription is required to jump into High on Life 2 on Xbox Series X|S or PC without purchasing the game separately.</strong></p>



<p>The Ultimate subscription is the only way to obtain day one releases on Xbox Game Pass following Microsoft’s changes in 2025, though the Game Pass Premium tier adds new games within 12 months of their launch.</p>



<p>Neither the standard PC Game Pass nor Xbox Game Pass Essentials provides access to High on Life 2, so Ultimate is the only choice if you want to play immediately at launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-edition-of-high-on-life-2-is-included-with-xbox-game-pass">What Edition of High on Life 2 is Included With Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>An Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription provides access to the Standard Edition of High on Life 2, with no advertised bonuses.</strong></p>



<p>High on Life 2 does have a pre-order bundle available, providing the ‘I PRE-ORDERED HIGH ON LIFE 2’ hat for select weapons, and, while it provides no benefits, Squanch Games says “if you don’t pre-order, you’ll never be allowed to have it.”</p>



<p>As this is merely a cosmetic bonus, there isn’t much need to splash out, unless you really want to, and the Standard Edition that comes with a Game Pass subscription is sufficient.</p>

data-cy="paragraph">Melee weapons and Armor passive with increased melee damage re-balance</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Intent is to make the Armor passive that increases melee damage less mandatory but

are and also make it so you need to use less "quick weapon functions" inputs.</li><li>Weapon function modes that affect Programmable ammo, Ammo types, Volley modes, Safe modes, Guided modes will now be in the left direction. </li><li>We have not moved the underbarrel weapon switching option to the left yet, but we are looking into moving it to the left direction so all ammo altering switching is in the left direction even if it is an underbarrel selection that usually is in the down direction.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Difficulty on difficulty 9+</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Made changes
