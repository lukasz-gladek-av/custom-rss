<p>Difficulty levels and better checkpoints in the works</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a> is a pretty good game; we should know, we gave it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">7/10 in our review</a>. But many folks have, understandably, criticised it for its often punishing difficulty and stingy checkpoint system.</p>
<p>So, to address this, Bandai Namco has announced update 1.1.0, an upcoming patch that looks to "redesign the play experience and evolve Shadow Labyrinth into a game that more people can enjoy". It will focus primarily on three key areas: difficulty, movement when controlling PUCK, and the checkpoint system.</p>
<p>Here's what the full announcement entails:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First and foremost, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who played this game. Each and every one of your opinions is our greatest_asset and the driving force propelling us forward.<br>
<strong><br>
Reflections</strong></p>
<p>We developed Shadow Labyrinth aiming for a unique experience: “Wandering the labyrinth, devouring, and evolving.”</p>
<p>We sincerely acknowledge the many evaluations of the game we’ve received, along with the numerous opinions shared by our players.</p>
<p>Particularly:</p>
<p>- Inconvenience of saving / traveling<br>
- Mini-PUCK play control in MAZE sections<br>
- High difficulty</p>
<p>These were challenges felt by many players, and we strongly feel they are points the development team must sincerely address.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the Version Update</strong></p>
<p>The upcoming version update is not merely a bug fix or adjustment. Its purpose is to redesign the play experience and evolve Shadow Labyrinth into a game that more people can enjoy.</p>
<p>A flexible system allowing players to choose difficulty levels, and improved immersion through comfortable controls and appropriately placed checkpoints.</p>
<p>We will build the next update around those core elements. We hope you look forward to the updated version of Shadow Labyrinth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while we can't exactly say what "improved immersion through comfortable controls" means, the prospect of difficulty settings and more generous checkpoints will no doubt come as good news to fans.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to keep you up to date on when this new update is scheduled to drop on Switch and Switch 2.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">My review</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> begins with a retelling of the first unexpected curveball the RPG threw my way. Barely out of the intro and having made exactly two vending machine purchases, I was offered the consumerism flaw. This puzzled me. As it turns out, this event had good reason to puzzle me.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You see, since the game emerged into early access late last week - a time frame during which only those who spunked around £30 extra for the game's preorder premium edition can play it - other folks have run into this flaw, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-outer-worlds-2-dunks-on-you-with-a-consumerism-flaw-that-secretly-makes-you-stupid-if-you-bought-its-usd100-version-for-early-access-promotions-and-sales-have-riddled-your-brain/">assumed that it must be dunking on them</a> for having bought that more expensive edition.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense, and honestly I'm a bit narked with myself for not making the connection immediately. In my defense, the flaw isn't listed among the extra bits offered by the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/the-outer-worlds-2-preorder-premium-edition/9P65228JL613/0010/B1G720SRQH3P">premium edition</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449110/The_Outer_Worlds_2/">storefronts</a> as far as I can tell. Nor is it explicity labelled with the words 'premium' or 'deluxe', as the corporate appreciation premium pack moon man gear which has been hanging out in my inventory all 40 or so hours is. So, since my character was given dialogue which suggested them to simply be very dumb due to my accepting of this flaw designed to make fun of my superfluous spending, I guess you got me, Outer Worlds 2. Touché, Obsidian. Well played.</p>
<p>But, wait just one second. If the flaw's designed as a fun little Borderlandsy meta dunk on premium edition purchasers, it's taken on rather a different meaning in this case. You see, as is usually the case with reviews outside of instances in which companies decide not to send out codes for whatever reason, I was given an early copy of The Outer Worlds 2's all-singing, all-dancing premium edition for free by publishers Microsoft. We certainly didn't specify an edition we wanted, so as often happens it was the publishers' understandable decision to send me, a person who'd be critiquing the game and publishing thoughts, the swankiest version of it.</p><p>In 99% of cases, that boring behind-the-scenes admin wouldn't be something worth telling you about, but in this one, it's created a set of circumstances which have turned Obsidian's joke totally on its head and into something I honestly find a fair bit funnier. I promise that isn't just because quirks of fate mean it's not ended up a gag at my expense, either. I love a joke, be they good, bad, or indifferent. As long as the circumstances/company are appropriate, I'm generally in favour of firing away the funnies, even if they're tortured punchlines doomed to fall flat.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Obsidian / Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's something uniquely hilarious about this one. A studio who, whether at their own behest or under duress from their corporate overlords, are doing a swanky premium edition offering the chance to play early and having a little laugh about people, er, buying that thing they're selling. Then it inadvertently pings right back around. Cue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDo6g4CCeU">this Faith No More cover</a> I'm fond of. After all, even if my position as a journo who hadn't bought the thing wasn't anticipated, what about folks who might get the premium edition free through the likes of competitions or just wait until sales eventually render it cheaper than the standard edition of the game is at launch?</p>
<p>I know, I'm giving far too much thought to the ramificiations of this harmless and fun little gag, but having realised what's happened, I can't help but feel it rather sums up the Outer Worlds 2 experience in a way I hadn't intended. Instead of a scenario with promise of something that could be New Vegas-level great, but to me ends up feeling closer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>-level good, you get something skewered by reality into a version of itself that doesn't quite match what was anticipated or hoped. It's a lot like many of the lines uttered in jest and parody by the conniving corporatists of Auntie's Choice sounding akin to something you might find in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">very real layoff memo</a> or <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">marketing pitch</a> from Obsidian's parent company Microsoft.</p><p>Folks might well still laugh if your jokes are funny or self-aware enough, but it's a lot more difficult to satirise or mock something if you're part of it, without risking those efforts ringing a bit hollow. Especially if you're deliberately working a lot of your wink wink, nudge nudge corporate spoofing into the more expensive edition of a product you're trying to sell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bully-doesnt-sound-like-your-typical-rockstar-game-1845413977"><em>Bully</em> didn’t support online multiplayer when it launched in 2006,</a> but that didn’t stop a team of dedicated fans and modders from seeking to turn the game into a full-featured online experience. And now, they are close to releasing <em>Bully Online</em>, a free mod that essentially turns the school-themed open-world game into something like <em>Grand Theft Auto Online.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On October 28, Rockstar Games superfan, YouTuber, and modder SWEGTA announced<em> Bully Online</em> and showed off the upcoming free mod via a trailer on his YouTube channel. The mod will include a large roster of playable characters, new drivable vehicles, mini-games, player housing, roleplay support, online racing, and more.&nbsp;<em>Bully Online</em> is built using DSL script loader, a plugin for <em>Bully</em> that allows SWEGTA and his team to extensively mod the original game. Using this plugin, the YouTuber says a lot of “things we thought were impossible just a few years ago can now be done,” including adding full online multiplayer support.</p>

  <p>As explained in the video above, SWEGTA and his team are adding a lot to<em> Bully Online,</em> including the ability to buy cars and even lock them using car keys via a newly added inventory system. The upcoming mod even features a first-person shooter mini-game starring oversized rats, which is presented in-game as a video game you can play against other <em>Bully Online</em> players. Don’t worry, <em>Bully Online</em> isn’t adding guns to Rockstar’s boarding school game. That’s something SWEGTA and the team didn’t want to do. Instead, this FPS mini-game will provide players with some shooting action without handing assault rifles to the students at Bullworth Academy.</p>

 <p>Some fans are worried that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ambitious-gta-underground-mod-shutdowns-after-six-years-1847619249">Rockstar Games might show up and shut all of this down</a> because SWEGTA is a high-profile creator and is making a big announcement out of <em>Bully Online’</em>s reveal. And that’s possible. But I think <em>Bully Online</em> might be safe simply because it’s not directly competing with <em>GTA Online </em>or <em>Red Dead Online.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>According to SWEGTA, <em>Bully Online</em> has been in development for a “very long time,” but he and the team didn’t want to reveal it until it was far enough along that they all felt confident in showing it off to the public. That time is now, with SWEGTA confirming that <em>Bully Online</em> will be available to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbG85NU1zU1Y3YnF5SkdOdHJqZ2h3RjZhbjJhZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttWjBNZ0k5bTMtdUQ0aDZ5SGtxQnItaE1rMkVwd3oxQXRXLVZGa2c5NTdZWVVqTWJIMGNScWc0MVQ2MWRXZEwyZDRwZ0tGRDlUbF9pNFlxWXNCVE5wOGd6SEVVZ0FkUmFGOTdmNjZWSW1VOHM1OER0TQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fko-fi.com%2Fbullyonline&amp;v=2J0_BnWKvEA"><em>Bully Online</em> paid Ko-Fi subscribers</a> starting in December. The plan is to eventually roll out a fully public server available to anyone who owns <em>Bully</em> on PC and installs the mod. <a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-s-dan-houser-teases-bully-sequel-max-payne-3-5860860">It’s not quite <em>Bully 2</em>, but it’s better than nothing</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-have-solo-mode.1337209/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 REDSEC Battle Royale is the game’s marquee BR mode. A Solo playlist is the ideal avenue for BF 6 owners who prefer to walk in isolation like calculated lone wolves. Let’s check out the latest Solo news for Battlefield 6 BR. </p>



<p>Even though it can be an absolute sweatfast full of campers and players desperate to occupy most windows and keep bathroom corners warm, Solos has a certain charm to it in battle royale. You’re relying on yourself, so it’s technically <em>your </em>fault if you die. There’s also an added feeling of anxiety knowing there are over 100 of you all vying to be the final player left standing—knowing every footstep could be one move toward your next elimination, or your own demise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-bf-pro-battle-pass-worth-it-battlefield-6-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> introduced the fabled REDSEC battle royale mode after launch. It has the electric <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gauntlet-mode-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gauntlet mode</a>, but let’s see if Solos gets any love.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-solos-in-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-right-now">Can You Play Solos In Battlefield 6 REDSEC Battle Royale Right Now?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>But, why? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield Studios has opted not to include a Solo playlist at Battlefield 6’s REDSEC battle royale launch.</strong></p>



<p>Don’t shoot the messenger! We’re just as disappointed as you are, and it really is a glaring oversight and an odd omission from REDSEC. There are no figures to back this up, but don’t be surprised if Solos is the most popular battle royale mode across all BR games.</p>



<p>It’s just easier for an individual player to pop in, without needing a squad, and trust their own survival instincts. REDSEC’s launch debuted with two playlist options: <strong>Duos and Quads</strong>—but no Solos.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-solo-in-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale">Is There Any Way To Play Solo In Battlefield 6 REDSEC Battle Royale?</h2>



<p><strong>The only way to sort of play Solos is to join a random team in Duos or Quads and play your own game in Battlefield 6 REDSEC battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>No, this isn’t genuine Solos, and yes, we know—but what else are you going to do? Duos is about as close as you’re going to get for the time being, and, to be honest, there’s a good chance <strong>many players will do the same thing</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s likely many Duos lobbies will be full of teams in name only, and both players are acting independently of one another. You too can do this, and go to the opposite end of the map to your ally if you want to prove a point.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-solo-playlist-coming-to-battlefield-6-redsec-br">When Is Solo Playlist Coming To Battlefield 6 REDSEC BR?</h2>



<p><strong>EA or Battlefield Studios hasn’t specifically mentioned Solos in any of its press releases or blog posts, but the use of “at launch” in a blog post is a dead giveaway that a Solo mode is coming.</strong></p>



<p>Logically, more content will be added to Battlefield 6’s REDSEC BR. There’s no direct mention of Solos in the Battlefield 6 Season 1 roadmap, and, again, we still find the lack of Solos bizarre.</p>



<p>However, a Season 1 roadmap <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-full-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> does say this: “REDSEC’s Battle Royale experience is built on Battlefield’s foundation of iconic all-out warfare, tactical destruction, and squad-based gameplay defined by its Class System. The standard Battle Royale match holds up to 100 players in either four-player squad or duo formats <strong>at launch</strong>.”</p>



<p>It’s coming, we all know it’s coming. Once it does, or it gets leaked, we’ll be the first to update you.</p>



<p>You can now vent your anger in the comments about Battlefield 6’s crazy decision to leave out a Solo playlist. Is Solos the best way to play battle royale?

<p>Only one mission can be activated at a time, with any squad member able to select one to be completed. Once a mission is accepted by one player, no missions can be selected by another player in the squad until later in the match.</p>



<p>Rewards are available for successfully completing each mission, ranging from Rare Weapons and Drop-Ins to immediate access to Custom Weapon Drops, and a Vehicle Key Card required for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-tanks-in-battlefield-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaining access to a Tank</a>. Missions can be both PvP and PvE in nature, though the PvP aspects with other players in the Battle Royale will be constant.</p>



<p>Additionally, some missions will appear as a ‘Counter Mission’, which indicates a nearby squad is completing a mission and tasks you with disrupting their plans. This almost always involves head-to-head combat with enemy players, however, so only dive into these when you feel you are prepared for a battle.</p>



<p>The table below details all of the mission types that can appear in REDSEC Battle Royale, and details on how to complete them.</p>

            <p>
Following Amazon's decision to cuts 14,000 jobs, a new report has claimed the company is "gutting" its video games division as part of the move.
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who, referencing a memo sent to Amazon employees, says the company plans to reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly MMOs. In the memo, Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and Game) wrote, "While we're proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team."
</p>
<p>
While Amazon hasn't revealed the exact number of jobs being cut across its games division, affected employees are already taking to social media, suggesting teams from two projects - New World and the Lord of the Rings MMO announced back in 2023 - are impacted. On LinkedIn, former senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7388974384306221056/">wrote</a>, "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)."
</p>
<p>
Amazon entered the video games market in disastrous fashion, cancelling its free-to-play shooter Crucible <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-cancels-crucible-five-months-after-release-and-four-months-after-un-release">just five months after its release</a> in 2020, and four months after it was "unreleased" back into beta. Its other failures include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-announces-fresh-stab-at-turning-the-lord-of-the-rings-into-an-mmo">first stab at a Lord of the Rings MMO</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-cancels-its-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">cancelled in 2021</a> following a dispute with Chinese mega-corp <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>. New World, too, has struggled to sustain interest after a strong start in 2021. Amazon's other major project is its upcoming Crystal Dynamics-developed upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">said to be "going well"</a> in August last year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Francis Coulombe and publisher Devolver Digital have announced a major new update for pixel horror RPG&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>, and it's adding new quests, new monsters, and more to the apartment building-bound adventure today.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer, the Final Vision update, which is free for everyone who owns the base game, is adding a number of new features, including "multiple new endings", so you'd better get started on that new playthrough right now.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new interactions, new areas to explore, and new quests to complete, as well as "dozens" of new monsters to battle.&nbsp;<em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>is also getting new boss encounters as part of this update, as well as "horrible new secrets", which is enticing. I think.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/look-outside-2.0-update-vincent.jpg?itok=V0a5qYGV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/look-outside-2.0-update-vincent.jpg?itok=h4jvEO-_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Vincent wants you to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>2.0, and you wouldn't want to upset Vincent, would you?</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>, it's a horror RPG that was created using RPG Maker. Much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rv-there-yet-sales" rel="nofollow">fellow indie hit&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em></a>, the game began as a game jam submission, but in&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>'s case, developer Francis Coulombe expanded on its initial content thans to positive feedback.</p>

<p><em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>sees you playing as Sam, a young man who's trapped in his apartment building thanks to a horrifying cosmic entity that turns everyone who looks at it into monstrous abominations.</p>

<p>Together with whatever survivors you can find in your building, it's up to you to explore the high-rise in order to find out whether there's a way for you to get everything back to normal, fighting off the monstrosities you encounter along the way.</p>




<p>I'd thoroughly recommend&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>, honestly; much like&nbsp;<em>Fear &amp; Hunger&nbsp;</em>(although it's significantly less punishing than those games), Coulombe's RPG is infinitely more unsettling than many higher-budget titles thanks to its lower-fidelity artwork, and it's a non-linear joy to play as well.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373660/Look_Outside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-duckov-sales-2m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-duckov-sales-reach-2m-in-under-two-weeks.1337152/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Soda and publisher bilibili have announced yet another huge sales milestone for single-player&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>riff&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em>, so it's safe to say the two studios have a solid hit on their hands.</p>

<p>As revealed by Team Soda and bilibili <a href="https://x.com/GameDuckov/status/1983053864820453385" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on X</a>,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell a whopping two million copies since launching earlier this month. It's achieved that figure in less than two weeks, which is impressive.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the newly-announced sales figure means that&nbsp;<em>Duckov&nbsp;</em>has picked up another 1.5 million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-duckov-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">since October 20th</a>, when Team Soda and bilibili revealed that their game had shifted 500,000 copies in its opening weekend alone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/escape-from-duckov-2m-sales-gameplay.jpg?itok=ptRHXCDq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/escape-from-duckov-2m-sales-gameplay.jpg?itok=FTlot79H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>has quacked - sorry, racked - up two million sales in its first two weeks.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>seems to deserve its high sales, as it's earned itself an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Overwhelmingly Positive rating</a> on Steam across over 3,000 reviews in the last couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Despite the name,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>doesn't actually share too much in common with&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>; it's a survival-focused looter-shooter, but it adopts a top-down isometric perspective as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>'s first-person shooting.</p>

<p>Obviously, the game is also largely focused around ducks, which...well, I can't confidently state&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>doesn't have any ducks, but it's certainly not quite as duck-centric as Team Soda and bilibili's game.</p>

<p>If you want to get a feel for what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>is, you can check out a trailer for it, which shows off some of the (entirely single-player) gameplay as well as the game's overall aesthetic, right here.</p>




<p><em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>is just one of several indie hits currently storming the gaming charts.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Nuggets Entertainment revealed that its indie driving adventure&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rv-there-yet-sales" rel="nofollow">crossed 1.3 million sales</a>, and they both follow hot on the heels of climbing sim&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" rel="nofollow">hit two million sales itself</a> back in June.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Early backers can get it discounted to €99, or around $115, but that’s still far more expensive than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314884/anbernic-rg34xx-handheld-emulator-retro-nintendo-game-boy-advance">many of Anbernic’s handheld emulators</a> that are far more capable and ready to play right out of the box.</p><p>The more capable BrickBoy Gamer Kit that adds support for Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games, compatibility with Bluetooth headphones, and a rechargeable battery is €169, or around $197, without discounts.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>'s battle royale mode REDSEC is out now, a "genre shifting free-to-play destination" that includes both the promised Fortnite functionality and a new squad-based competitive mode, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gauntlet">Gauntlet</a> - no, not that Gauntlet, auto-keyword tool, stop it, you're making me look daft, UGH I don't have time to argue with you, please just go away - together with additional gubbins for Battlefield's Portal editor. You can find it either via your Battlefield 6 install or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3028330/Battlefield_REDSEC/">as a separate release on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
REDSEC's battle royale map is Fort Lyndon, pictured below, with takes place in the backyards and beaches of California, and is apparently the series' biggest map ever. The setup is familiar: 100 players divided into squads are dropped into the world and must scrounge for pick-ups and do shooticuffs and fistibangs within a shrinking (and partly destructible) playspace.

<p>
As for the Gauntlet mode, this is a tournament affair in which eight teams of four compete in round-based missions, with each round giving you five minutes to complete an objective. Each round, map and mission has different variables.
</p>
<p>
What, you think all of that sounds rubbish? Hie thee to the Battlefield Portal editor, then, where you can rip REDSEC's skin off and fiddle around with various parameters. The developers give the example of restricting everybody to sledgehammers or making use of scripting tools to put together more bespoke chains of events and objectives.

REDSEC - or Redsec, as it shall be known from this point on, because I am weary of bellowing at you through my keyboard - launches alongside the first season of Battlefield 6's live service offerings, which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">read about here</a>. I'm not much of a battle royaler, certainly nowhere near as battleregal as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Aphid Leggings</a> enthusiast James, but I'll try to get a game going later and let you know how I fare.

"Hold my beer," interjected <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> publishers Hooded Horse, before diving into a flyblown burlap sack and fishing out the press release for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkwood-2">Darkwood 2</a>. Did you ever play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkwood">Darkwood</a>? It's the survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game about being a hermit in a horrible, horrible, top-down forest. It's the game that persuaded Adam Smith to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-wicked-and-the-weird-darkwood-impressions">mercy-kill his dog</a>. The new one is set in "the scorched deserts of a dying sea" that is slowly being engulfed by evil trees. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>This dramatic change of setting isn't even the most startling thing about the game. Nor is the fact that Hooded Horse, hitherto known for banger <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy games</a>, are publishing it. No, the most surprising thing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> is that it's being developed by Ice-Pick Lodge, developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a>, with original Polish creators Acid Wizard monitoring the production from afar like lurking creatures in the underbrush.

<p>Pathologic and Darkwood are, I think, neck and neck for the title of Video Game Most Likely To Actually Give You The Plague. Asking the makers of one to make a sequel to the other is like, I don't know, putting Jack the Ripper in charge of the Manhattan Project. To top it all off, the key art reminds me of the main menu art for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a>. Truly, this is a videogame tailored to my tastes, though I do have some concerns about Ice-Pick Lodge's ability to craft a top-down horror game and also, how they're faring following the departure of their co-founder amid allegations of kidnapping.
</p><p>Darkwood 2 is set amid the dry salvages of a real-life body of water, the Aral Sea. Lying between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, it used to be the third largest lake in the world at 68,000 square kilometres, but began shrinking in the 1960s after rivers were diverted to Soviet irrigation projects.</p>
<p>Today, it's largely toxic dust, though there have been attempts to replenish the waters. Darkwood 2 takes place in the 1990s. Assuming the game sticks to real-life history, that would be following the abandonment of Soviet Russian efforts to restore the lake by way of a massive canal system, and in the midst of a phase of irrigation system building over in newly post-Soviet Uzbekistan. All that's according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea#History">Wikipedia</a>, anyway - if you happen to be a proper historian of the Aral Sea, I'd appreciate your input on the screenshots and trailer.
</p>
<p>As for how it plays, Darkwood 2 looks to be treading squarely in its predecessor's stinking, gore-filled bootprints. It's a foetid real-time exploration and scavenging sim in which visibility is swallowed and splintered by encroaching trunks. It's still about scraping together resources and fortifying a lair with barricades and traps, before the sun goes down and the real monsters come out. But there are new monsters to discover - hark at that giga-catfish in the footage - and there are "new reasons to pray for the morning light". Set a few years later, the game seems to build on the events of Darkwood, but Hooded Horse assure us that it can be treated as a standalone story.

<p>There are marshes to squelch through, meandering paths amid dunes, and deep waters to row over (I would probably row quite fast). There shall be no quest markers or waypoints, none of your modern cartographical frippery, only the madness and desperation of local humans fighting to keep the invading trunks at bay.
</p><p>All this appetising misery notwithstanding, returning players may have misgivings about the departure of original developers Acid Wizard. The first game's creators <a href="https://x.com/TheAcidWizard/status/1688551878974398464?s=20">suspended operations indefinitely in 2022</a>, after failing "to create a work environment that would not be destructive to our personal lives". They had struggled to find an audience for their follow-up project, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-studio-behind-darkwood-are-making-turn-based-tactical-football-and-you-can-try-it-free-now">jarringly upbeat football game Soccer Kids</a>. 
</p>
<p>"Crafting the world of Darkwood was a very challenging and long journey for the team," Acid Wizard co-founder Gustaw Stachaszewski comments in a press release for Darkwood 2. "After an experience like that, you become emotionally attached to your work. We know that the fans have been eagerly awaiting a continuation of Darkwood. For years, the idea of handing over our baby to another studio was something unthinkable for us. But, after it became evident that working together is not viable anymore, we decided that Darkwood should live on, even if not directly through our work.
</p>
<p>"We're genuinely excited to pass on the torch to Ice-Pick Lodge - creators whose work on Pathologic has inspired us for years," Stachaszewski goes on. "The team at IPL really gets what makes Darkwood a unique experience. We believe they will not only honor its spirit but will create something truly exceptional. As for us, we'll be in the background, making sure it stays true to the original vision."
</p>
<p>In the same release, Ice-Pick Lodge's executive producer Alexander Souslov has some additional thoughts for people who might question the blend of developer and publisher here - again, Hooded Horse are better known for city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builders</a> and 4X than spooks and squalor. "I believe the most interesting things are created when people with very different backgrounds work together on creative projects," he observes. "Ice-Pick is known for its focus on narrative and on the design of semiotic systems. Hooded Horse, on the other hand, is renowned for its expertise in strategy. What kind of game could come from that?"

<p>Ice-Pick Lodge have been on a complicated journey of their own, these past few years. The developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-announced-with-time-travel-mechanic-due-for-release-in-2025">announced Pathologic 3 in October 2024</a>. Due for release in January 2026, it includes story materials and other elements that were once supposed to be part of Pathologic 2. There was a certain amount of frission over this and the dropping of the original game's open world elements, with our own Brendy (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-quarantine-drops-the-hunger-meters-so-you-can-play-doctor">commenting of one demo</a> that it felt simultaneously designed for and designed to annoy returning Pathologic players.
</p><p>Then, in March this year, founder Nikolay Dybowski suddenly <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ice-pick-lodge-founder-nikolay-dybowski-departs-pathologic-dev">left the studio</a> after Pathologic players discovered that he had been accused of kidnapping and abuse, with allegations dating back to 2021. Former Ice-Pick developer Aleksey Luchin responded to these reports, branding Dybowski a "manipulative sociopath that is very good with words." I've asked Hooded Horse and Ice-Pick if they'd like to offer any further comment on Dybowski's departure. More positively, Ice-Pick Lodge were among the first Russian developers to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pathologic/comments/t3e0es/ipl_statement_regarding_recent_events/">speak out</a> against their country's invasion of Ukraine, telling social media followers that "a crime is being committed in our name. This is not only a crime against our friends. It is a crime against our dignity."
</p>
<p>There's no release date yet for Darkwood 2, but you can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3708010/Darkwood_2">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9NVRB86ZP7XR">Microsoft Store</a>. You might also want to check out Alex Wiltshire's old interview with Acid Wizard about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-killing-permadeath-in-darkwood-led-deeper-into-the-forest">how the original Darkwood "kills permadeath"</a>. We never reviewed it, but Darkwood appears nonetheless on our list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">the best horror games on PC</a>. Here's hoping Ice-Pick Lodge can do it justice.</p>

A release date was not announced. It will also be available via Game Pass. <span id="more-1003103"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Hooded Horse:</p><blockquote><p>Set merely a few years after the events of the critically acclaimed survival horror game <em>Darkwood</em>, the sequel brings with it new lands and waters to explore, new creatures to fear, and new reasons to pray for the morning light. Featuring an entirely new story and new characters, the unfolding events of <em>Darkwood II</em> stand on their own, and can be equally enjoyed regardless of whether you’ve played the first game in the series.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse, the dying Aral Sea has become the site of an anomaly—an eerie forest that swallows everything in its path. No one knows where it came from, or why—retribution, perhaps, for humanity’s abuse of nature.</p><p>All around lie the ruins of a vanished world—deserted villages, rusting ships marooned in sand, derelict oil rigs, power stations, and factories on the verge of collapse. A secret biological lab sits in silence on a remote island as roving gangs of looters, bikers, and former soldiers control the remaining population through fear. Nomads travel through these lands with no rest or respite, day or night—even walls can’t guarantee safety. </p><p>As the world loses its humanity, and as the so-called corruption of the forest spreads, one can’t help but wonder—is it really better to remain human? Or would it be best to give in?</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Only the heart of the forest holds the answer.</p><p><em>Darkwood II</em> sends you on dangerous meandering paths across barren deserts, through thick marsh, and on deep waters alike. As the locals fight to keep the slowly spreading woods at bay, you must rely on your wits to overcome your fears and find your way—there are no quest markers or waypoints to guide you.</p><p>Scavenge for resources, craft weapons to protect yourself, and seek out shelter by night, building barricades and traps to hide behind, securing yourself against an enemy that can strike from any direction. Will you cower in a cellar as the doors creak open and close a few floors above you, or will you stand against the horrors that stalk the night? Or perhaps you’ll choose to rely on strange concoctions to gain new skills and capabilities that may just keep you alive—in a manner of speaking.</p><p>Meet twisted characters, each with their own motivations—learn their dark backstories and make decisions that will determine their fates and impact the world itself, changing your story as you move through it.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Darkwood 2 - Announcement Trailer | Survival Horror Game" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CR99LP_nays?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/darkwood-ii-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 10 Minutes Of Battlefield 6 Season 1 New Maps Gameplay (Blackwell Fields and Eastwood)</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">A first look at all three maps can be found below. We also covered all of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-battlefield-6-weapons-in-season-1-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6535768/">new BF6 Season 1 weapons and attachments</a> can be found here.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Rogue Ops - Blackwell Fields</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592681-bf6_s1_map_blackwellfields.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592681" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592681-bf6_s1_map_blackwellfields.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592681"></a><figcaption>Blackwell Fields</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592681-bf6_s1_map_blackwellfields.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Season 1 kicks off with the Rogue Ops update, which introduces the new <strong>Blackwell Fields</strong> map. This is a large-scale map set on a massive oil field in California, with lots of open ground for snipers and long-range combat. Structures like oil wells, construction equipment, and other items serve as cover on the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Blackwell Fields features the normal selection of vehicles, including helicopters, planes, and tanks. It also introduces the season's first new vehicle. The <strong>APC Traverser Mark 2</strong> is a brand-new land vehicle. This armored vehicle seats four: one driver, one roof gunner, and two backseat passengers who operate as side gunners.</p><h2 dir="ltr">California Resistance - Eastwood</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592682-bf6_s1_map_eastwood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592682" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592682-bf6_s1_map_eastwood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592682"></a><figcaption>Eastwood</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592682-bf6_s1_map_eastwood.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the second phase coming in November, California Resistance takes the fight to the Cali suburbs with the <strong>Eastwood</strong> map. Pax Armata is attacking a Southern California town, and the fights take place in and around suburban homes, through backyards, and even across a golf course. The houses will give plenty of cover for close-quarters fights, but the golf course provides open ground for long-range engagements.</p><p dir="ltr">And speaking of golf, Eastwood introduces the <strong>golf cart</strong> as a new vehicle for the map. When the map launches in November, you'll be able to use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/10-minutes-of-battlefield-6-season-1-new-maps-gameplay-blackwell-fields-and-eastwood/2300-6466468/">golf carts to cruise around the map</a> and create some interesting new shenanigans on the battlefield.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Winter Offensive - Ice Lock Empire State</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592683-bf6-s1-winteroffensive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592683" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592683-bf6-s1-winteroffensive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592683"></a><figcaption>Ice Lock Empire State</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592683-bf6-s1-winteroffensive.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The third and final phase of Season 1 is themed around the winter holiday. For this seasonal content, Battlefield 6 adds a winter-theme variant of the Empire State map. This is just a visual update that covers the New York map in ice and snow.</p><p dir="ltr">As of now, a new vehicle has not been announced for the Winter Offensive update.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-guides-hub/1100-6533950/">Battlefield 6 guide hub</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/darkwood-on-ps5-it-goes-much-deeper-than-jump-scares">Gloomy and unsettling top-down horror game Darkwood</a> is getting a sequel and, it turns out, a surprise new developer. Original creator Acid Wizard, and publisher Hooded Horse, have brought in Pathologic developer Ice-Pick Lodge to do the work.</p>
<p>Acid Wizard hasn't disappeared entirely, however. It remains the IP holder and will oversee and consult on the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/darkwood">Darkwood</a> 2, as the sequel will be called, will move the action away from a murky and foreboding forest to the parched lands of a dying sea, spreading the playing area across deserts, swampy marshes and deeper waters, where anything might lurk. This dramatic change of biome will bring new sights to see and new creatures to fear, and face. All the more reason to shore up your base and hang on until morning breaks.</p><p>Darkwood was a deceptively slight and harmless-looking game. Its top-down presentation didn't necessarily scream "fear!" at you, but its clever use of line of sight kept unpleasant surprises concealed, and its inky black heart and remorseless nature soon made itself felt. The idea was to survive long enough to work out where you were and what was going on. That meant venturing further and further afield into a strange dream-like world while avoiding the merciless perils of night.</p>
<p>Pathologic is a series with a similarly uncompromising nature, and Ice-Pick Lodge has been around long enough to acquire significant expertise. It's an interesting pairing, for sure.</p>
<p>Darkwood 2 is in development for PC and, apparently, PC Game Pass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Acclaimed indie developer Simogo is celebrating its 15th birthday today, but it feels like we're the one getting presents. Fans of the Swedish studio are going to be thrilled with the projects the team has revealed, so buckle up.</p>
<p>First up (thanks, <a href="https://vgc.news/news/simogo-reveals-7-game-collection-for-switch-and-pc-confirms-sayonara-wild-hearts-for-switch-2/">VGC</a>!) are Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sayonara-wild-hearts-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a>, two of our favourite games on the Switch. Sharper visuals and frames are likely part of these packages, and we only have to wait until <strong>early next year</strong> to try them out. No upgrade path has been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Second, we have the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on <strong>2nd December 2025</strong>. This is a compilation of the studio's first seven titles <em>and</em> a whole host of bonus content which, as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/simogo-legacy-collection-announced-for-switch-2-switch-and-pc">Gematsu</a> highlights, including an E-book, an audio drama podcast, unreleased music and art, and a handful of playable prototypes.</p>
<p>All the games in this collection were originally released on iOS, and while some did come to Wii U, most of these have never seen a console release. Simogo actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-dev-teases-switch-port-of-critically-acclaimed-text-adventure">teased one of these earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>The titles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kosmo Spin</strong> (2010) - a circular arcade game where you're trying to save a planet full of breakfast cereal</li>
<li><strong>Bumpy Road</strong> (2011) - a road trip adventure where you control the road and not the car</li>
<li><strong>Beat Sneak Bandit</strong> (2012) - a rhythmic-based puzzler where you need to sneak inside the mansion to win</li>
<li><strong>Year Walk</strong> (2013) - a first-person adventure based on the Swedish tradition of årsgång, "year walking"</li>
<li><strong>DEVICE 6</strong> (2013) - a text-based puzzler where you guide a woman through an island who doesn't remember getting there</li>
<li><strong>The Sailor's Dream</strong> (2014) - a narrative adventure that changes based on the real-world clock</li>
<li><strong>SPL-T</strong> (2015) <em>-</em> a block-splitting puzzler</li>
</ul>
<p>Last, but by no means least, Simogo has teamed up with the lovely folks at Lost in Cult for <strong><a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/simogo?mc_cid=574d33de01&amp;mc_eid=a503eeac91">Heartbeats, Dreams and Laser Eyes: 15 Years of Simogo</a></strong>, a stunning book covering the studio's history, philosophy, and inspirations.</p>

<p>Essays from writers Holly Nielsen, Christian Donlan, Nadia Oxford and Aaron Riccio will dive deep into the studio's projects and games, and the book as a whole promises to "provide readers with a deeper understanding of one of the most consistently inventive studios in the business."</p>
<p>The Deluxe Edition will be available for a limited time and it'll cost <strong>£69.99</strong> (the standard edition is much cheaper at <strong>£39.99</strong>) — the first 300 copies will come with a signed bookplate from co-founders Simon Flesser and Magnus 'Gordon' Gardebäck. Check out the <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/simogo?mc_cid=574d33de01&amp;mc_eid=a503eeac91">website for more details</a>.</p>

<p>Well, that's a darn good slate; every single game Simogo has released will be on Switch 1 <em>and</em> Switch 2 come early next year. Plus that book is tasty.</p>
<p>If you haven't played either Lorelei or Sayonara Wild Hearts, what are you <em>doing?</em> Okay, we get it, lots of games — check out our reviews for both (below) if you're curious.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amazon is laying off more than 14,000 corporate jobs today, and per a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTY2Nzc5MywiZXhwIjoxNzYyMjcyNTkzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNFVOSThHUTdMSEIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.gpW2CyZmAypCDjxGr-gBHrW6EnUxZkFspCrjiLV-dwc">Bloomberg</a>, the video games division, Amazon Game Studios, is not immune to the cuts.</p>



<p>While Amazon doesn't specify exactly how many people from its video games division will be laid off, a statement from Steve Boom, Amazon's head of audio, Twitch, and games, does call the cut "<em>significant</em>," and says that the cuts are happening despite Amazon being "<em>proud</em>" of the success it has had. While the studio's MMO, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/">New World</a>, isn't mentioned by name, the statement does say that Amazon is halting its game development work "<em>specifically around MMOs</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>While we're proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing</em>," the statement reads, "<em>we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work - specifically around MMOs - within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in or studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team</em>."</p>







<p>A report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/807825/amazon-job-layoffs-2025-ai">The Verge</a> adds that the driving force behind these cuts comes from Amazon pushing further into AI, with senior executive Beth Galetti writing in a memo to staff, "<em>The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well</em>. <em>This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly</em>."</p>



<p>While Amazon calls out MMOs as the genre it is specifically halting work in, it's unclear if the company will move forward in other areas of game development and publishing. Or, this could be the first major sign that Amazon is getting out of games entirely, and will stick to producing TV and film adaptations of video game properties, like its highly popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/">Fallout series</a> and upcoming series adaptations of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">Mass Effect</a>.</p>

              <p>Amazon is pulling back from blockbuster games. The company is laying off 14,000 people, including some across its gaming division. According to an internal memo reviewed by <em>Bloomberg</em>, those cuts include halting a “significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work–specifically around MMOs–within Amazon Game Studios.” The company had previously announced an ambitious<em> Lord of the Rings</em> MMORPG.</p> <p>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work–specifically around MMOs–within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” Amazon head of games, Twitch, and audio Steve Boom wrote in an email to staff, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division">reports<em> Bloomberg</em></a>.</p>

 <p>Amazon has mostly struggled in the world of game development outside of 2021’s MMO <em>New World</em>. It’s only other hits like <em>Lost Ark</em> and <em>Throne and Liberty</em> were developed by external partners. It’s currently set to publish the next <em>Tomb Raider</em> game as well as several other unannounced projects, including an internally developed <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO and an online AAA action-RPG. It’s now unclear if those projects will move on or be canceled.</p>

 <p>The latest cuts come amid a recent overhaul of Amazon’s cloud gaming service Luna, with an emphasis on party games including one <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=snoop+kotaku&amp;sca_esv=f60ecab60e0aa489&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifOXDxq2ETzQl4cY3e3JzPgqEeaJrw%3A1761669797715&amp;ei=pfIAaaqvK-Ot5NoP87KVmQ0&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqlYS0q8eQAxXjFlkFHXNZJdMQ4dUDCBE&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=snoop+kotaku&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDHNub29wIGtvdGFrdTIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGJ8FMgUQIRifBTIFECEYnwUyBRAhGJ8FMgUQIRifBTIFECEYnwVIrglQAFjGCHAAeACQAQCYAY0CoAHYCaoBBTkuMi4xuAEDyAEA-AEBmAIMoALRCsICChAjGIAEGCcYigXCAgQQIxgnwgILEAAYgAQYkQIYigXCAgsQLhiABBiRAhiKBcICDhAuGIAEGLEDGIMBGIoFwgIREC4YgAQYsQMY0QMYgwEYxwHCAgoQLhiABBhDGIoFwgILEAAYgAQYsQMYgwHCAgsQLhiABBjRAxjHAcICCxAuGIAEGLEDGIMBwgIOEAAYgAQYsQMYgwEYigXCAgUQABiABMICCBAuGIAEGLEDwgIOEC4YgAQYsQMYgwEY1ALCAggQABiABBixA8ICGhAuGIAEGJECGIoFGJcFGNwEGN4EGN8E2AEBwgIREC4YgAQYkQIYsQMYgwEYigXCAiAQLhiABBiRAhixAxiDARiKBRiXBRjcBBjeBBjfBNgBAcICDhAuGIAEGLEDGIMBGMkDwgIIEAAYgAQYkgPCAgUQLhiABMICCBAAGBYYChgewgIGEAAYFhgewgIUEC4YgAQYlwUY3AQY3gQY4ATYAQHCAgsQABiABBiGAxiKBcICBRAAGO8FmAMA4gMFEgExIEC6BgYIARABGBSSBwU4LjMuMaAHpr0BsgcFOC4zLjG4B9EKwgcJMC4xLjguMi4xyAde&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">powered by an AI Snoop Dogg avatar</a>.

<p>Amazon is laying off more than 14,000 corporate employees. Within those layoffs, Amazon Games and Twitch will be hit in some capacity.</p>



<p>Bloomberg says, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTY2Nzc5MywiZXhwIjoxNzYyMjcyNTkzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNFVOSThHUTdMSEIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.gpW2CyZmAypCDjxGr-gBHrW6EnUxZkFspCrjiLV-dwc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">without going into</a> specifics, that both video games and the cloud-computing area of the company will be affected. Insider Gaming has reached out to Amazon to ask how many people were set to be let go from the gaming division and Twitch. As of publishing, a response has not been received.</p>



<p>According to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, the cuts “would largely fall on its offices in Irvine and San Diego, as well as its central publishing division.”</p>



<p><strong>“The company will reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly surrounding massively multiplayer online games or MMOs,”</strong> the report reads.</p>



<p><strong>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,”</strong> an email sent by vice president of audio, Twitch, and games Steve Boom to employees said.</p>



<p>Included in the layoffs was Tarfu, who had been with Twitch for 11 years.</p>



<p><strong>“I started off working in trust &amp; safety, then moved to customer experience,” </strong><a href="https://x.com/Tarfu/status/1983196834698015164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he shared.</a> <strong>“I was the person who built the entire fraud program at Twitch. One of the reasons I never told people what I did for work.</strong></p>



<p>“<strong>I was the one keeping bad actors off Twitch who steal and abuse revenue on the platform. I guess I did my job too well since they let me go. But do I have some great stories of being there over a decade.”</strong></p>



<p>News of the mass layoffs was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/amazon-targets-many-30000-corporate-job-cuts-sources-say-2025-10-27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first reported</a> by Reuters. The cuts would be, according to the outlet, the largest cut since 2022, when Amazon let go of roughly 27,000 people. This new set of layoffs would be the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/amazon-to-announce-sweeping-corporate-job-cuts-starting-tuesday.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">largest in company history</a>, with impacted employees to be notified via email.</p>
