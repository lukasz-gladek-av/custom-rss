			<p>Ukrainian developer Frogwares is currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-shows-off-gameplay-and-launches-kickstarter-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking funds</a> for The Sinking City 2 on Kickstarter. After two weeks, and with another two left before the end, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2/description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign</a> has so far gathered over €383K, nearly four times the minimum amount of €100K. Of course, the studio hopes that the momentum continues; according to <a href="https://kicktraq.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2/#chart-exp-projection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kicktraq projections</a>, it could land anywhere between €424K and €483K.</p>
<p>It has not been smooth sailing for Frogwares in the past few years. In 2019-20, their games were delisted from digital stores twice in the span of a year due to problems with French publishers <a href="https://wccftech.com/frogwares-claims-to-be-endangered-by-focus-home-interactive-policy-games-being-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Focus Home Interactive</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-delisted-from-storefronts-frogwares-cites-breach-of-contract-with-nacon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nacon</a>. Then there was the pandemic, of course, which affected everyone. Just as things were looking better, the Russian invasion of Ukraine suddenly happened in early 2022.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/frogwares-ceo-talks-about-the-wars-tragic-impact-on-the-ukrainian-game-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked with them</a> just a few days after the war started, learning of all their fear and day-to-day troubles. Thankfully, Epic <a href="https://wccftech.com/frogwares-receives-epic-games-megagrant-to-help-support-ukranian-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awarded the studio a MegaGrant</a>, offering them a reprieve of sorts. Even so, they had to re-evaluate their roadmap and decided to develop <a href="https://wccftech.com/frogwares-announces-project-palianytsia-game-project-for-sinking-city-and-sherlock-holmes-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Palianytsia</a>, which turned out to be Sherlock Holmes The Awakened, a reboot of the first entry in the franchise that was funded via Kickstarter. The ongoing war <a href="https://wccftech.com/sherlock-holmes-the-awakened-delayed-due-to-continued-russian-strikes-in-kyiv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused</a> a short delay, but the studio still managed to release a solid game, as outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sherlock-holmes-the-awakened-the-only-way-forward-is-the-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our review</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the studio has returned to what it really wanted to make: The Sinking City 2. This one <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-announcement-ue5-horror-frogwares-deliver-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be a full-fledged horror game</a>, whereas the first entry was more of an open world investigation game with horror undertones. Right in the middle of the Kickstarter campaign, we reached out once more to Sergiy Oganesyan, Publishing Director at Frogwares, to discuss how the project evolved over the past couple of years (including the switch to Unreal Engine 5), what fans can expect from it, and how the war is still affecting the development team.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Our vision for The Sinking City 2 is a Lovecraftian survival horror game with deep investigation mechanics, and that hasn’t changed much. But there’s still a huge difference between the first vertical slice we created back in 2023 and the recent playable footage that we published for Kickstarter, and that, thanks to the feedback from playtests, has definitely shown us where we need to adjust our priorities.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Exactly a year ago, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-goes-to-kickstarter-soon-as-frogwares-needs-a-safety-net-from-the-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> fans the Kickstarter campaign would open up soon, but then you went dark for a while. Can you disclose what happened?</strong></p>
<p>A few things really. Over the past year, we made the decision to focus on giving ourselves some time to develop the game so we could showcase real gameplay for Kickstarter, rather than just concept art. Along the way, we also refined some of our designs to better fit actual gameplay, ensuring a stronger experience.</p>
<p>When we announced it in 2024, we had some closed playtests very soon after that with a group of our closest fans. Through their feedback, we started refining even more on where we should place our focus and efforts, which dictated a lot about how we’d present the game in our campaign. Much of what we showed in the gameplay and dev diary we just released is due to our work with our fans. Additionally, we took the time to carefully map out and design physical rewards for the campaign, making sure they are meaningful and high-quality for our backers. It’s the first time we've done something like that, and there was a lot of fog of war to deal with.</p>
<p>Lastly, we are all still mostly working remotely as a team due to the war. So, we work more around our team and their needs. We didn’t want anyone to feel rushed on the campaign. Progress on the game was the priority, and then getting what we needed for the launch of the Kickstarter came when everyone felt ready to help. So these factors all stacked up, but we’re glad we could take our time.</p>
<p><strong>How has your vision for The Sinking City 2 evolved since the game's announcement?</strong></p>
<p>Our vision for The Sinking City 2 is a Lovecraftian survival horror game with deep investigation mechanics, and that hasn’t changed much. But there’s still a huge difference between the first vertical slice we created back in 2023 and the recent playable footage that we published for Kickstarter, and that, thanks to the feedback from playtests, has definitely shown us where we need to adjust our priorities.</p>
<p>If you take combat, for example, we spent a lot of time improving the overall feeling of it. How enemies behave, how they react to being shot, how impactful the shotgun is, that kind of thing. There’s still a lot of work ahead, but we are happy to see that most people are satisfied with where this particular mechanic is going.</p>
<p><strong>How recent is the Pre-Alpha gameplay footage that you just shared? How much more polished do you expect the full game to be?</strong></p>
<p>Well, this is sort of the downside of a Kickstarter campaign—you often have to launch it at a time when you can’t really show anything totally final. Much of what we showed was recorded in&nbsp;late 2024, but in order to really understand how much things can change, we need to take into consideration how game development works.</p>
<p>For example, we create our levels in a vacuum of what we call Vitaras (visual targets) - separate maps inside the engine where you don’t have any real gameplay. So while the work on those continues, inside the real game you have placeholder assets, which, as you can imagine, are very far in terms of the quality of what we want to achieve. But when those Vitaras are fully migrated to the real game, you suddenly have beautiful meshes, materials, lighting and so on and the difference is like night and day. The same goes for your enemies and everything else, really. What I’m trying to say is that there wasn’t anything in the trailer that was truly final, locked, and won’t ever be touched again. Once we fully integrate our locations, combat, and other gameplay together, you’ll see the difference for the better.</p>
<p><strong>One of the big areas of focus for this sequel is combat. Can you talk about some of the improvements fans will see compared to the first game?</strong></p>
<p>Where do I even begin? I have already mentioned that we are putting a lot of emphasis on how combat feels because it must feel fun and convincing. You must enjoy landing a shot, and this is achieved through a number of things, primarily VFX, sound design, recoil, enemy hit reaction, etc. We mentioned a wound body system for our enemies in our recent dev diary - it’s essentially a second layer of muscle, ligaments, and blood mass underneath the skin, which reacts when hit. It’s all a bit gory, but in my opinion, very satisfying to see working under the hood.</p>
<p>So, a lot of work is being done on enemy visuals, animations, attacks, and, of course, enemy placement around each map to make this all come together. I’m not going to lie; combat is probably the most challenging aspect for us, especially since this is now a core focus of the game compared to the original. One enemy can take months of work, and that’s just the visual design, without any gameplay. But so far, the results we and our closed playtesters have seen prove we’re on the right track. We’ve still got a lot more work to do, and we’ll likely be refining this right to the end, but we’re really happy with the progress so far.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'You must enjoy landing a shot, and this is achieved through a number of things, primarily VFX, sound design, recoil, enemy hit reaction, etc. We mentioned a wound body system for our enemies in our recent dev diary - it’s essentially a second layer of muscle, ligaments, and blood mass underneath the skin, which reacts when hit. It’s all a bit gory, but in my opinion, very satisfying to see working under the hood.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Will players be able to dodge out of the way and perform some melee actions in combat?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are experimenting with some dodge and “last-resort” melee mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of narrative and atmosphere, how is The Sinking City 2 going to set itself apart from its predecessor? Are there going to be any easter eggs or even returning characters for fans of the original?</strong></p>
<p>So, the two games are set in the same universe and time setting. 1920s United States drenched in a gloomy, Lovecraftian horror vibe. And just like before, a supernatural flood has taken hold of a city and is changing it in unfathomable ways. But that’s mainly where the similarities end. The Sinking City 2 features a new, stand-alone story entirely separate from the one told in the original game. So we’re not going back to playing as Charles Reed, nor are we going back to the city of Oakmont in any way, and we made all these narrative and atmosphere choices for a reason. We wanted to create a story and setting that wasn’t burdened by what we created in the original game, especially since players have various endings they favor or consider the “true ending” to that story.</p>
<p>This way, we can let existing fans come back into this familiar world fresh, while anyone who never played the original can also step in without feeling like they are missing a big chunk of the story. So while we might have some small Easter eggs or hints here and there, they will be there mainly as a wink and nudge for us and our most devoted fans.</p>
<p><strong>You've said that while this isn't an open-world game, it will feature plenty of secrets and large explorable zones. Considering side content, how long should we expect the game to be?</strong></p>
<p>That’s not something we can answer right now, as there are still parts of the game we haven’t finalized yet. However, it’s a survival horror game, so it would be fair to look at some recent releases in the genre to get a ballpark idea.</p>
<p><strong>The Kickstarter campaign appears to have gone very well so far.</strong></p>
<p>Yup. Just yesterday we unlocked another stretch goal - a new giant monster type, the Shoggoth. Now, just to be clear, we already did promise a Shoggoth encounter in the game, but these are two very different enemies, both visually and mechanically. We’ll probably hit one more stretch goal after this one is funded.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game launch in early access or straight to full release?</strong></p>
<p>The game will launch in full on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox X/S at the same time. At one point, we considered the Early Access route but decided we were better off using Kickstarter and closed playtests to help develop the game.</p>
<p><strong>Was it hard to transition to Unreal Engine 5? Are you leveraging all their technologies (Lumen, Nanite, etc.) to elevate the visuals?</strong></p>
<p>There was a learning curve for sure, but it was quite smooth. It was really helpful that we knew from the start that The Sinking City 2 was going to be made in Unreal 5. Speak to any team who made the transition, and almost all of them will tell you to make the switch at the start if you can. It will save you so much time and effort in the long run. So, we finished our last game on UE4 and started pre-production for TSC2 from scratch. All our internal tools were developed as separate plugins, so although the migration took some time, it was fairly straightforward. This also provided a great opportunity to get rid of a bunch of legacy code and finally perform a long-overdue refactor.</p>
<p>The tools UE5 brings have been amazing, for sure. Lumen has significantly improved our lighting and reflection systems, creating a more immersive and visually stunning environment. For us, especially where The Sinking City 2 has many wet surfaces, Lumen allows us to achieve much more realistic and dynamic lighting effects that were previously really difficult to attain.</p>
<p>With Metahuman, we were astonished at how fast, simple, and realistic the results were. After our initial tests, we reviewed our entire cutscene and dialogue creation process and reworked everything to better utilize these tools.</p>
<p>Nanite significantly changed our approach to asset creation, allowing us to use highly detailed models without compromising performance. This has been particularly beneficial for creating the much more detailed environments that were required for this game. Since we are going for that feeling of isolation and a more contained play space, we need the environment itself to do a lot of the immersion heavy lifting.</p>
<p>That said, while new technologies are fantastic and help solve old problems, they can also bring new issues to tackle. Nanite was no exception. For instance, in our previous projects, a single Static Mesh asset did not take up more than 200MB of disk space, but now it is pretty common. So, managing the increased asset sizes and optimizing our workflows to accommodate this change has been a significant task.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The tools UE5 brings have been amazing, for sure.

[...] Lumen already supports software ray-tracing out of the box. Our team is also looking at the hardware one, but it’ll depend on the optimization.'</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Will you support ray traced effects like global illumination, reflections, etc.?</strong></p>
<p>Lumen already supports software ray-tracing out of the box. Our team is also looking at the hardware one, but it’ll depend on the optimization.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to prepare enhancements for the PS5 Pro console?</strong></p>
<p>It’s likely, but I can’t say which enhancements yet.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to share anything about Ukraine's situation and how it's still impacting your daily work?</strong></p>
<p>Missile strikes and drone attacks almost every goddamn night. Just yesterday, around 20 drones attacked the city of Kropyvnytskyi. In Kyiv, you can’t fall asleep without listening to air defense fighting off another swarm of Russian drones. In a way, we have become used to it, but not exactly in a healthy way. You have to just accept it and try to keep living, not knowing if your luck will run out soon.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time, and stay strong.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that a&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie is in the works, and that several major Hollywood studios are already engaged in a bidding war over the rights to said movie.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, media company Story Kitchen is currently scouting writers and directors, as well as cast members, for the project. You might also recognize Story Kitchen's name from the likes of the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-dredge-movie" rel="nofollow"><em>Dredge&nbsp;</em>movie</a>, which was announced last year, as well as the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-movie-and-tv-adaptations-in-works" rel="nofollow"><em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation</a>.</p>

<p>Citing "sources at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco", Variety says that a number of "top Hollywood studios" are currently making offers for the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie, although it sounds like nothing has been decided yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-movie-report-barriers.jpg?itok=9mK7HXCQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-movie-report-barriers.jpg?itok=72JyqCAo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation is apparently in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>Given&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s close focus on gameplay, I'm having a bit of a hard time imagining how a movie would work; I can only imagine some of the game's uniqueness will be lost in the transition. Still, it's testament to&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s popularity that a movie adaptation is already underway.</p>

<p>Of course, the movie makes a lot of sense from a financial perspective, too. After all,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>managed to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">two million sales in a single week</a>, so creating more media based around the IP is sound logic.</p>

<p>It's the same logic that drove Story Kitchen to create the&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>adaptation, and that game recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">passed the 20 million sales mark</a>. It just remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s gaming audience would also be interested in a non-interactive version of the story.</p>




<p>In case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest co-op adventure from&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight, led by Josef Fares.</p>

<p>The game casts you and your co-op buddy as Mio and Zoe, two writers who must learn to work together when they're thrust into a diabolical machine that threatens to steal all of their ideas.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/split-fiction/9n1wxxd1rl8d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

Although they’re all viable depending on the situation, these are the perks to lean toward if you want to be the best Tank for your team.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,197298" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h858"><a id=""></a>D.Va</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Ejection Suit</strong> is the ideal perk choice for D.Va as it gives her 75 temporary overhealth for ten seconds in Pilot form.

<p>A new PlayStation patent describes a controller that can be charged with solar energy, which might solve all your battery-related problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-solar-power-controllers/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJIDShleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHVwVHGQueVMZZupV-8DT_-KIESWvFQMimNqN7_WL90EACfvjRBhqzmNO1g_aem_pn2iGOc8pztrFDDWfs47hQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment has published a new patent called ‘<a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025046814&amp;_cid=P21-M80ZRL-19120-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Operation Device</a>’. The patent is for a PlayStation controller that features “a plurality of photovoltaic elements” on its housing and a storage area that “accumulates power generated by the plurality of photovoltaic elements”, which in turn will charge the device with solar energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The diagrams provided on the website suggest that the photovoltaic elements will be placed on the top half of the body, around the analogue sticks and the different buttons. This controller can then be placed under sunlight to charge itself.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has also mentioned the problem they are trying to solve with the solar-powered PlayStation controller. Sony has stated that a conventional controller needs a replaceable or rechargeable battery to run, and without this power source, it cannot operate. With their new patent, they wish to solve this problem with technology that charges a controller’s secondary or primary battery through an external power source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the first patent PlayStation has published. Last year, we saw a controller concept <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-new-patent-reveals-a-controller-concept-with-conductive-ink/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that uses conductive ink</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-adaptive-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox’s one-handed ‘adaptive joystick</a>’ controller is now available. What are your thoughts on a solar-powered PlayStation controller? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>OpenAI is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/what-does-phd-level-ai-mean-openais-rumored-20000-agent-plan-explained/">quietly seeding expectations for a "PhD-level" AI agent</a> that could operate autonomously at the level of a "high-income knowledge worker" in the near future. Elon Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/elon-musk-ai-will-be-smarter-than-any-human-around-the-end-of-next-year/">says</a>&nbsp;that "we'll have AI smarter than any one human probably" by the end of 2025. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei thinks it might take a bit longer but similarly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/">says</a> it's plausible that AI will be "better than humans at almost everything" by the end of 2027.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A few researchers at Anthropic have, over the past year, had a part-time obsession with a peculiar problem.</p>
<p>Can Claude play Pokémon?</p>
<p>A thread: <a href="https://t.co/K8SkNXCxYJ">pic.twitter.com/K8SkNXCxYJ</a></p>
<p>— Anthropic (@AnthropicAI) <a href="https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1894419011569344978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Last month, Anthropic presented its “Claude Plays Pokémon” experiment as a waypoint on the road to that predicted AGI future. It's a project the company <a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1894419011569344978">said</a> shows "glimmers of AI systems that tackle challenges with increasing competence, not just through training but with generalized reasoning." Anthropic made headlines by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/visible-extended-thinking">trumpeting</a> how Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s "improved reasoning capabilities" let the company's latest model make progress in the popular old-school Game Boy RPG in ways "that older models had little hope of achieving."</p>
<p>While Claude models from just a year ago struggled even to leave the game’s opening area, Claude 3.7 Sonnet was able to make progress by collecting multiple in-game Gym Badges in a relatively small number of in-game actions. That breakthrough, Anthropic wrote, was because the “extended thinking” by Claude 3.7 Sonnet means the new model "plans ahead, remembers its objectives, and adapts when initial strategies fail" in a way that its predecessors didn’t. Those things, Anthropic brags, are "critical skills for battling pixelated gym leaders. And, we posit, in solving real-world problems too."</p>

<p>But relative success over previous models is not the same as absolute success over the game in its entirety. In the weeks since Claude Plays Pokémon was first made public, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon/">thousands of Twitch viewers</a> have watched Claude struggle to make consistent progress in the game. Despite long "thinking" pauses between each move—during which viewers can read printouts of the system’s simulated reasoning process—Claude frequently finds itself pointlessly revisiting completed towns, getting stuck in blind corners of the map for extended periods, or fruitlessly talking to the same unhelpful NPC over and over, to cite just a few examples of distinctly sub-human in-game performance.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

<p>Watching Claude continue to struggle at a game designed for children, it’s hard to imagine we’re witnessing the genesis of some sort of computer superintelligence. But even Claude’s current sub-human level of Pokémon performance could hold significant lessons for the quest toward generalized, human-level artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2>Smart in different ways</h2>
<p>In some sense, it’s impressive that Claude can play Pokémon with any facility at all. When developing AI systems that find dominant strategies in games like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-alphago-ai-beats-worlds-best-human-go-player/">Go</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/08/ai-bot-takes-on-the-pros-at-dota-2-and-wins/"><em>Dota 2</em></a>, engineers generally start their algorithms off with deep knowledge of a game’s rules and/or basic strategies, as well as a reward function to guide them toward better performance. For Claude Plays Pokémon, though, project developer and Anthropic employee David Hershey says he started with an unmodified, generalized Claude model that wasn’t specifically trained or tuned to play Pokémon games in any way.</p>
<p>“This is purely the various other things that [Claude] understands about the world being used to point at video games,” Hershey told Ars. “So it has a sense of a Pokémon. If you go to claude.ai and ask about Pokémon, it knows what Pokémon is based on what it's read… If you ask, it'll tell you there's eight gym badges, it'll tell you the first one is Brock… it knows the broad structure.”</p>

<p>In addition to directly monitoring certain key (emulated) Game Boy RAM addresses for game state information, Claude views and interprets the game's visual output much like a human would. But despite <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/farewell-photoshop-googles-new-ai-lets-you-edit-images-by-asking/">recent advances in AI image processing</a>, Hershey said Claude still struggles to interpret the low-resolution, pixelated world of a Game Boy screenshot as well as a human can. “Claude's still not particularly good at understanding what's on the screen at all,” he said. “You will see it attempt to walk into walls all the time.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Hershey said he suspects Claude’s training data probably doesn’t contain many overly detailed text descriptions of “stuff that looks like a Game Boy screen.” This means that, somewhat surprisingly, if Claude were playing a game with “more realistic imagery, I think Claude would actually be able to see a lot better,” Hershey said.</p>
<p>“It's one of those funny things about humans that we can squint at these eight-by-eight pixel blobs of people and say, ‘That's a girl with blue hair,’” Hershey continued. “People, I think, have that ability to map from our real world to understand and sort of grok that... so I'm honestly kind of surprised that Claude's as good as it is at being able to see there's a person on the screen.”</p>
<p>Even with a perfect understanding of what it’s seeing on-screen, though, Hershey said Claude would still struggle with 2D navigation challenges that would be trivial for a human. “It’s pretty easy for me to understand that [an in-game] building is a building and that I can’t walk through a building,” Hershey said. “And that's [something] that's pretty challenging for Claude to understand… It's funny because it's just kind of smart in different ways, you know?”</p>

<p>Where Claude tends to perform better, Hershey said, is in the more text-based portions of the game. During an in-game battle, Claude will readily notice when the game tells it that an attack from an electric-type Pokémon is “not very effective” against a rock-type opponent, for instance.&nbsp;Claude will then squirrel that factoid away in a massive written knowledge base for future reference later in the run. Claude can also integrate multiple pieces of similar knowledge into pretty elegant battle strategies, even extending those strategies into long-term plans for catching and managing teams of multiple creatures for future battles.</p>

    <div>
          
          

<p>Claude can even show surprising “intelligence” when Pokémon’s in-game text is intentionally misleading or incomplete. “It's pretty funny that they tell you you need to go find Professor Oak next door and then he's not there,” Hershey said of an early-game task. “As a 5-year-old, that was very confusing to me. But Claude actually typically goes through that same set of motions where it talks to mom, goes to the lab, doesn't find [Oak], says, ‘I need to figure something out’… It's sophisticated enough to sort of go through the motions of the way [humans are] actually supposed to learn it, too.”</p>

<p>These kinds of relative strengths and weaknesses when compared to “human-level” play reflect the overall state of AI research and capabilities in general, Hershey said. “I think it's just a sort of universal thing about these models... We built the text side of it first, and the text side is definitely... more powerful. How these models can reason about images is getting better, but I think it's a decent bit behind.”</p>
<h2>Forget me not</h2>
<p>Beyond issues parsing text and images, Hershey also acknowledged that Claude can have trouble “remembering” what it has already learned. The current model has a “context window” of 200,000 tokens, limiting the amount of relational information it can store in its “memory” at any one time. When the system’s ever-expanding knowledge base fills up this context window, Claude goes through an elaborate summarization process, condensing detailed notes on what it has seen, done, and learned so far into shorter text summaries that lose some of the fine-grained details.</p>
<p>This can mean that Claude “has a hard time keeping track of things for a very long time and really having a great sense of what it's tried so far,” Hershey said. “You will definitely see it occasionally delete something that it shouldn't have. Anything that's not in your knowledge base or not in your summary is going to be gone, so you have to think about what you want to put there.”</p>

<p>More than forgetting important history, though, Claude runs into bigger problems when it inadvertently inserts incorrect information into its knowledge base. Like a conspiracy theorist who builds an entire worldview from an inherently flawed premise, Claude can be incredibly slow to recognize when an error in its self-authored knowledge base is leading its Pokémon play astray.</p>
<p>“The things that are written down in the past, it sort of trusts pretty blindly,” Hershey said. “I have seen it become very convinced that it found the exit to [in-game location] Viridian Forest at some specific coordinates, and then it spends hours and hours exploring a little small square around those coordinates that are wrong instead of doing anything else. It takes a very long time for it to decide that that was a ‘fail.’”</p>
<p>Still, Hershey said Claude 3.7 Sonnet is much better than earlier models at eventually “questioning its assumptions, trying new strategies, and keeping track over long horizons of various strategies to [see] whether they work or not.” While the new model will still “struggle for really long periods of time” retrying the same thing over and over, it will ultimately tend to “get a sense of what's going on and what it’s tried before, and it stumbles a lot of times into actual progress from that,” Hershey said.</p>

<h2>“We’re getting pretty close…”</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting things about observing Claude Plays Pokémon across multiple iterations and restarts, Hershey said, is seeing how the system’s progress and strategy can vary quite a bit between runs. Sometimes Claude will show it's “capable of actually building a pretty coherent strategy” by “keeping detailed notes about the different paths to try,” for instance, he said. But “most of the time it doesn't… most of the time, it wanders into the wall because it's confident it sees the exit.”</p>

<p>One of the biggest things preventing the current version of Claude from getting better, Hershey said, is that “when it derives that good strategy, I don't think it necessarily has the self-awareness to know that one strategy [it] came up with is better than another.” And that’s not a trivial problem to solve.</p>
<p>Still, Hershey said he sees “low-hanging fruit” for improving Claude’s Pokémon play by improving the model’s understanding of Game Boy screenshots. “I think there's a chance it could beat the game if it had a perfect sense of what's on the screen,” Hershey said, saying that such a model would probably perform “a little bit short of human.”</p>
<p>Expanding the context window for future Claude models will also probably allow those models to “reason over longer time frames and handle things more coherently over a long period of time,” Hershey said. Future models will improve by getting “a little bit better at remembering, keeping track of a coherent set of what it needs to try to make progress,” he added.</p>

<p>Whatever you think about impending improvements in AI models, though, Claude’s current performance at Pokémon doesn’t make it seem like it’s poised to usher in an explosion of human-level, completely generalizable artificial intelligence. And Hershey allows that watching Claude 3.7 Sonnet get stuck on Mt. Moon for 80 hours or so can make it “seem like a model that doesn't know what it's doing.”</p>
<p>But Hershey is still impressed at the way that Claude's new reasoning model will occasionally show some glimmer of awareness and “kind of tell that it doesn't know what it's doing and know that it needs to be doing something different. And the difference between ‘can't do it at all’ and ‘can kind of do it’ is a pretty big one for these AI things for me,” he continued. “You know, when something can kind of do something it typically means we're pretty close to getting it to be able to do something really, really well.”</p>

Shiny Pokémon are coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> as part of the game's next themed booster pack, Shining Revelry, which launches next week on Thursday, 27th March.
</p>
<p>
Cards featured in Pokémon TCG Pocket's next pack include fan-favourite Shiny creatures such as the cool-looking black Charizard, golden Lucario, and pink squirrel Pachirisu.
</p>
<p>
Shiny Pokémon are the ultra-rare alternate-coloured versions of regular creatures that have been found in the Pokémon games since the series' earliest days. Hunting for them, however, has grown in popularity more recently and been boosted further by the popularity of Shiny Pokémon in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.

<p>
In Pokémon TCG Pocket, Shiny Pokémon cards will have their own sparkling effect when tilted. You'll also be able to buy a Shiny Charizard display board and binder. 
</p>
<p>
Shining Revelry will feature some non-Shiny creatures too, most notably Pokémon and characters from the recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-walkthrough-tips-9015">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> for Nintendo Switch, including sushi creature Tatsugiri and Grass-type Starter cat Sprigatito.
</p>
<p>
Next week will also see the arrival of Ranked Matches, with the gfirst in-game season beginnin next Friday, 28th March at 6am, and lasting for a month. Ranked Play will let you battle and achieve an emblem on your player profile that shows off your ultimate end-of-season rank.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-overhauls-trading-following-player-backlash">Pokémon TCG Pocket recently announced an overhaul to its trading feature following player backlash</a>, though the changes won't come into action until later this year. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-pokemon-tcg-pockets-success-digimon-getting-free-to-play-mobile-card-game">long-time rival Digimon is also getting into the action</a>. Digimon Alysion, a free-to-play smartphone card game, is now in development.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-revival-could-give-doom-the-dark-ages-a-run-for-its-money.1141320/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/painkiller-revival-fall-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and developer Anshar Studios have announced a revival of the classic FPS&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, and it's coming to PC and current-gen consoles sometime this fall.</p>

<p>The two studios describe&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>as "an intense new spin on the classic action-shooter" that you can experience either solo or in co-op play. According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>will support "online co-op for up to three players", which is a little odd given that it has four playable characters.</p>

<p>In any case, the game is promising "gruesomely detailed gothic environments" and the chance to "blast your way through hordes of demons and titanic terrors", so it sounds very much like Saber and Anshar are hoping to give Bethesda's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marty-stratton-dark-ages-like-nothing-players-have-had-their-hands-on-in-doom-game" rel="nofollow">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>&nbsp;</em>a run for its money.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-revival-pistol.jpg?itok=VeV-bHOr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-revival-pistol.jpg?itok=drZT-ZK2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>is back. Rejoice.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will boast an emphasis on traversal, promising the ability to "jump, dash and hook" across each stage while engaging in "bloody, fast-paced combat". You can also look forward to a host of new weapons, as well as the return of some of the original's classic arsenal.</p>

<p>Four playable characters will be available: Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch. They'll each have "unique perks" you can take advantage of, and your abilities are upgradeable via the use of signature&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>tarot cards as well.</p>

<p>It sounds as though those extra characters will be crucial to&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, too, since the game will replace your co-op buddies with bots if you're playing on your own.</p>

<p>All of this will, according to Saber and Anshar, be set to a "powerful metal soundtrack". There's no other genre suitable for this kind of thing, really, but if Judas Priest's "Painkiller" doesn't feature in this game, I will be very disappointed indeed.</p>




<p>Saber and Anshar's&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot comes to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/p/9NMSW622HWNH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in the fall. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It’s been a a bit too much for those with too little free time to invest in such a sprawling storyline with dozens of objectives and other side content. But old-school <em>AC</em> titles, and even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175">the more recent <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a></span> were shorter and more manageable. How about the latest entry? How long does it take to beat <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>? It’s a mixed bag, but it primarily depends on your playstyle and how you’d like to immerse yourself in the expansive world of feudal Japan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-interview-with-producer-hisashi-fujii-setting-village-building-romance-and-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a title="Companies > Gematsu" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gematsu">Gematsu</a> recently had the opportunity to sit down with <em><a title="Games > Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a></em> producer Hisashi Fujii ahead of the game’s launch in May to discuss what players can expect in the Eastern-inspired entry in the farming <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,537 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a> franchise. <span id="more-950904"></span></p><p>Get the full interview below.</p><p><strong><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> has a noticeably different tone and setting compared to previous <em><a title="Series > Rune Factory [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/rune-factory">Rune Factory</a></em> games. What inspired the shift to a more Eastern-inspired world?</strong></p><p><strong>Hisashi Fujii, Producer:</strong> “As you know, up until now the <em>Rune Factory</em> series was set on a Western continent. And previously in the series there have been several references to the Eastern country, and several characters from the Eastern country who would make appearances in the games. One of the reasons we set <em>Guardians of Azuma</em> in this Eastern country is to have a new approach to the series outside of the numbered titles—basically to try a new approach and new gameplay elements that we wouldn’t necessarily do in the numbered titles. So that’s the main reason why we decided to set <em>Guardians of Azuma</em> in the Eastern country of Azuma.”</p><p><strong>With this game, you are introducing the concept of the Earth Dancer. How did the idea of using dance as a combat and purification mechanic come about?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “With the move to the Eastern country as the setting, we wanted to emphasize the Japanese-ness of the world—the ‘Wa.’ And part of that was introducing a traditional Japanese dance style into the gameplay, so that includes the <a title="Genres > Action [2,588 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> and other parts of the gameplay as you mentioned. That was the main impetus for the focus on dance in this title.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>The village rebuilding system is something entirely new for&nbsp;<em>Guardians of Azuma</em>. Can you talk a bit about that—how large it is, what types of building features players can expect?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “There are four villages in the game based around the four seasons, and in each village there’s an area that you can completely and freely edit using the village building system. And the areas actually differ depending on the village. So the Autumn Village has the largest area, and we think that players will actually have difficulty potentially even filling it in—it’s so massive. This gameplay feature itself is something that’s fairly new to the series—it’s really never been done before. And one of the ways it changes the gameplay is that, by revitalizing the villages over the course of the game, you’ll attract more villagers to come to the villages. And those villagers can be assigned tasks in the edit area, such as farming or collecting lumber. And so in some ways the player basically no longer has to do that kind of work if they don’t want to, which can change the gameplay cycle if that’s not where you’re focusing as a player.”</p><p><strong>Do different setups offer different benefits or change the way NPCs interact, or does customization mostly fall into the category of aesthetics?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “Basically, the choices that the player makes in the village building area, depending on what they place down—such as buildings or decorations—can impact their basic stats. So if you place a certain building, you may get a certain stat increase. There are still the typical stats that have been in the series up until now—things like HP, Rune Points, strength, and magic attack—and the choices that the player makes when customizing their village can be used to essentially level up these parameters.”</p><p><strong>Are the villages different in terms of gameplay? Do they have their own farming mechanics, enemies, and event types?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “As I mentioned, there are the four seasonal villages. Each village has plants that you can grow that are characteristic of that village. So if it’s the Spring Village, spring plants and spring flowers are more suited to growth in that village. And of course the enemies outside of each village are also themed around the villages, so they do differ depending on which village you’re in. In terms of gameplay differences, there are certain objects that you can place in the village building mode that will only have an effect on the player—like a positive effect—if they’re placed in a certain village. If you place something in the Winter Village, it will give you a specific effect that you wouldn’t get by placing it in the Spring Village. Finally, each village has its own seasonally themed special festivals that you can hold.”</p><p><strong>The Blight appears to be the main threat standing in the player’s way. Is it a persistent threat that players have to manage over time, or is it something tackled through progression?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “The Blight is something spread by the Black Dragon that appears in the game. And as it’s spread, it affects the earth, causing plants to wither and impacting the natural world. The player will receive what are known as Sacred <a title="Companies > Treasure [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/treasure">Treasure</a>s from the gods in the game, and those Sacred Treasures can be used to purify the Blight and remove it from the world. At the beginning of the game, they’ll only be able to get rid of certain kinds of Blight from the world. And then as they receive more Sacred Treasures, the kinds of Blight they can purify and how far they can progress in the game will expand.”</p><p><strong>Do Sacred Treasures only function as key items? Or do they work as traditional equipment that can be used during gameplay as well?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “Other than purifying the Blight, Sacred Treasures can be used in battle as well as in the farming gameplay as regular items. In battle, they replace what was previously the magic system. Basically, they can be used for very special attacks, depending on which one you’re using, as well as for very powerful attacks. When it comes to farming, they have different roles. For example, the Drum can be used to restore withered plants or encourage their growth. The Umbrella can be used to water plants, and to water a much wider range of space than would be normally possible. So they have a lot of benefits if you use them for farming.”</p><p><strong>Romance is always a core element of a <em>Rune Factory</em> game. Have there been any new mechanics or major changes to relationship building? </strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “Up until now, when you were trying to advance a romance with a character, pretty much all you could do was give them presents and say ‘Hi!’ to them every day. But in this game, we’ve added some new features to deepen those mechanics. You can choose conversation topics from a list of set topics, and different characters will respond differently to different topics. You can also invite them to do all sorts kinds of activities. And similarly, there are certain activities that will raise your affection level with some characters more than others. So there’s a lot more depth in the different kinds of interactions you can have with them this time.”</p><p><strong>Romance candidates can be recruited for battle. Can you talk a little bit about how that works? Does their combat effectiveness depend on how far into a relationship you are with them? And are you limited to just one romance candidate in battle?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “You have a bond level with each character in the game that’s developed as you talk to them more—typically as you grow closer to them. In battle, as the bond level increases, characters will learn new abilities and become more powerful as allies in battle, the closer you are with them. And being in battle with them also increases their bond level with you. So the more you battle with them, the higher their bond level will get, and the more skills they will learn. In total you can take up to six characters with you into battle, so you’re not limited if you’re dating one character, as that doesn’t mean you can’t bring the other romance candidates into battle. You can, again, recruit up to six—or seven if you’re including the player.”</p><p><strong>What does a post-marriage life look like? Does it unlock any special sorts of interactions or events?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “Once you marry, your spouse will come and live with you and there will be a rhythm to your life together. When you wake up each day, your spouse will have a bento ready for you and give it to you. And then, eventually, you will be able to have a child. So that’s pretty much the kind of main flow of the post-marriage life.”</p><p><strong>Before we go, which one aspect of the game are you most excited about players experiencing?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “The main new feature of the game is village building, so I’m really excited to see what kinds of different villages players will make. Because they can make things that are totally different, so I’m just really looking forward to seeing what kinds of different villages are created in the game once it’s out!”</p><p><strong>Thank you so much for your time, Fujii-san!</strong></p><p><em>*Gematsu also asked for a status update on <em><a title="Games > Rune Factory 6 [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rune-factory-6">Rune Factory 6</a></em>, which was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/05/rune-factory-6-announced">announced</a> alongside <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> in 2023, as well as whether there are any plans to release <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> for PlayStation, Xbox, or <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,817 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> 2, but <a title="Companies > Marvelous [1,331 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/marvelous">Marvelous</a> was not able to provide any information beyond what has already been announced.</em></p><p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> is due out for Switch and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,667 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864560/Rune_Factory_Guardians_of_Azuma/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> on May 30. </p><p>View a new set of screenshots <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma/march-21-2025/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_951789"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Near the end of 2024, CD Projekt Red shifted away from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a> updates as the developer focused on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-has-more-than-400-people-working-on-it-full-production-begins-this-year/1100-6522263/" data-ref-id="1100-6522263">putting The Witcher 4 into full production</a>.

If players want to reenter the Cyberpunk universe in the meantime, they'll have to find an entertainment location that has the Cyberpunk 2077 Turf Wars arcade game.</p><p>CD Projekt Red didn't develop this elaborate Cyberpunk 2077 shooting game, but it did endorse Turf Wars developer LAI Games during the creation of its "next-gen futuristic tactile shooter." The trailer for the arcade cabinet below doesn't share much gameplay footage of Turf Wars, but it does show off the gun controllers and a shooting gallery. It also reveals that Turf Wars has three game modes: story mode, co-op/versus mode, and sniper mode.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaQWL76uZVE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WaQWL76uZVE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of arcades left in the US, so venues like Dave &amp; Buster's and Chuck E.

			<p>In 1957 in North West England, the worst nuclear accident in UK history happened – the Windscale fire. If you’re not familiar, this was when a fire burned for three days in a nuclear military facility in the Lake District, spreading radioactive fallout across the UK and the rest of Europe. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a> is set in the wake of this disaster, inside a quarantine zone errected around the facility, where things are somehow even worse than they were in real life.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Pre-Launch Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RL57lHE-xvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game begins with you waking up in a bunker with no memory of who or where you are. Stepping out into the open you’re greeted by a view of the glorious Cumbrian countryside. Also the Atom Plant shrouded in a hazy purple glow and an out-of-place red telephone box that starts ringing as you come closer. Should you dare to pick it up, an unsettling and very mysterious voice comes down the line, telling you that “Oberon must die” and to go power up something called the Interchange.</p>


<p>A lot of Atomfall is like this; flummoxing, strange, and thoroughly endearing. It’s easy to draw comparisons to Fallout with the setting, and it’s remarkable how well that comparison can stick – it’s set in the early 60s after five years of quarantine, so any sci-fi robots are right out of the vision of futuristic tech from that era, and could fit right in with a Fallout or The Outer Worlds. Atomfall has its own identity, though, both with the setting and the gameplay.&nbsp;I’m actually from the North West of England and hearing accents local to me in this game was actually a little strange at first.</p>


<p>Being set in the Lake District also brings with it some stunning environments, as well. Sharing a game engine with Rebellion’s Sniper Elite series, the game can look great as you look out across the landscape, but it’s fair to say that character models, lighting and animation feel pretty dated – this game is also coming to last gen consoles. It’s nothing too egregious, but it is noticeable in comparison to the quality of the environments.</p>
<p>The main thing that sets Atomfall apart, though, is that the threat here isn’t just radiation and we’re not in a post-apocalyptic world. Sure, there’s radiation around, even some poison, and an occasional electric wire hanging from the ceiling that always manage to walk into, but the biggest threat here is actually an infection. Ominous blue-y purple clouds and growths have taken root in places around the quarantine zone, seemingly the cause of people hearing voices and of the blue-y purple zombies known as Ferals that you’ll find.</p>
<p>Atomfall leans in on this for a good part of the mystery running through the story, but there’s no getting away from the familiarity of the gameplay they present. Ferals are tough to kill, growths explode when you go near them, it hurts when you stand on infected floors, and an infection meter fills up when you’re in the gas. It’s all rather standard. The novelty of unwrapping the game’s mystery wears off a bit after fighting off the third wave of zombies. I’m still very much interested in getting there, I just wish there was a little less stuff in the way.</p>

<p>Even when facing against roving groups of bandits and druids, there’s a roughness to the combat that starts to wear on you. The survival game leanings mean that you’ll be crafting throwables, using your ammo supplies sparingly, and wanting to use stealth and melee as much as possible. When you do go toe-to-toe with someone, the lack of a block means you’ll almost inevitably take damage – that always feels like failure to me.</p>
<p>Enemies tend to be in groups when they’re patrolling the open world, some of which will have ranged weapons. Getting the drop on a group or using stealth is key, whether that’s trying to do a stealth takedown or going all in with thrown Molotovs and shotgun blasts. They’ll happily empty multiple magazines of ammo in your direction, given the chance, but in true survival game fashion, they will only ever have a few bullets on them when you loot their bodies.&nbsp;Ammunition is conspicuously scarce in this game and only through meticulously looting everything – sometimes whilst in the middle of combat – was I able to find enough to avoid melee combat. Thankfully the shooting itself feels good enough.</p>
<p>Another issue is that your inventory is very limited. Important items you need take up space in there, including quest items. A single bandage, which heals maybe a third of my health, takes up one of your twelve inventory slots and they don’t stack, so just healing supplies will always take up a big chunk of space. Atomic batteries, an essential item for powering up the Interchange, also take up slots, as do any pistols or small melee weapons, painkillers I’m saving for a tough fight, or anti-infection drugs. This is addition to carrying items to sell to traders as there is only a bartering system and no currency, means you’re constantly evaluating and dropping stuff, which feels like it really gets in the way. The most generous part of the inventory is having four slots for long guns and weapons, and you’ll need all of them for switching as you run through your ammo stocks. Crafting supplies are gathered separately, thankfully, though this is constrained in its own way to keep you from having too big a surplus.</p>

<p>The main driving force is really the desire to keep exploring the lore and background of the world and setting. The narrative is structured around finding and following leads, whether they come from talking to people or picking up scraps of paper and notes from around the environment. You’ve got maps of each area, but points of interest are only filled in as you find them, and you’ll often find clues that lead you to map coordinates, or have someone mark a spot for you to follow up on. You can also just merrily stumble your way into some discoveries, giving a freeform feel to some parts of how the game’s story unfolds, beyond picking dialogue options and deciding which faction you want to align with.</p>
<p>A lot of the game experience can be adjusted and tweaked in the granular difficulty settings. There’s a bunch of presets that can put the focus more on survival or narrative, when compared to the standard suggested difficulty, but within that there’s individual settings to tweak up and down if you want to really customise it to your tastes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s some bugs that give the game a few blemishes, though mostly of the amusing or slightly advantageous varity. I cleared out a whole station of soldiers by climbing into a cafeteria and shooting them as they took cover behind two pillars, only to clip through to the other side. I’ve also had other AI oddities with enemies that inexplicably lose interest in me, or struggle to get to me, and I once saw one of BARD robots just shooting at a wall for some reason. I wasn’t even behind that wall, so maybe it was a random swarm of rats that the AI could detect, but I couldn’t see? I also encountered a couple of frame rate drops in combat on PS5, one specifically when I shot a giant robot in its gas cylinders, with accompanying fire and explosions. A patch is coming for release to address some issues, but we’ve found some that weren’t noted in the patch notes we’ve seen.</p>

<p>There’s a few quirks and hang ups, but I’m enjoying Atomfall. The world, setting, and story have me very interested in seeing how it pans out, though there’s a little voice in the back of my mind that says I’ve seen these story themes many times before, so maybe the ending won’t be as novel or unique as it wants to be. I still don’t know just yet, but it’s been an enjoyable time so far. Keep an eye out for our finished review, once I’ve finished exploring the deepest, darkest parts of Cumbia.</p>

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation 4 &amp; 5, Xbox One &amp; Series S/X</span>
						</p></div></div>			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/rebellions-atomfall-single-player-survival-action-game-is-out-on-march-27-2025/">Atomfall</a> is a game that came out of nowhere for me. I was browsing Steam a few weeks ago, having taken a little break after the gaming marathon of Civilization VII and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and there it was: a post-apocalyptic game set in Britain. Considering I'm from Britain and have been to where this is based—that being Windermere—and I love Metro, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Fallout, and other similar games, it was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>With people running around in masks, battering innocents to death with cricket bats, or using a shiv to watch the life bleed out of them as they mutter utter gibberish about returning to the soil before telling you to "fack off", Britain in 2025 is an interesting place. Then we get Atomfall, set in a fictional post-apocalyptic Britain following the Windscale disaster, not the current post-apocalyptic Britain hoping to recover from the incompetent Tory government only to have a new Tory Labour government, mercilessly taking from the poor and disabled while catering to their wealthy overlords.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Taking place inside a quarantine zone following a disaster at a nuclear power station, it's not an open world but a connection of multiple open areas, Metro: Exodus style. Rebellion has captured the feel of the North-West quite well, to the point where I have been on Google Maps to figure out the exact location it's set in; I blame the road sign to Kendal for doing this to me. In terms of the story, there is more than just the nuclear accident, including a government coverup surrounding the accident and how it links to Oberon - the code name for a government project, which I won't spoil more of - and the impact on the surrounding area the combination of these have had.</p>
<p>The direct impact you will see is the area's abandonment and how quickly it delved into chaos. There are five open zones in the core playable area; Wyndham Village is controlled by the Protocol (the army) and is generally friendly and accessible except in a few places. Three of the other zones are controlled by the Raiders, Druids and Protocol, respectively, but parts of the areas are completely off-limits, and if you are spotted, you will be attacked. The remaining area is The Interchange, where the secrets of Atomfall are primarily revealed.</p>
<p>You'll find yourself moving between these areas, following clues and tasks from NPCs in the area, aiming to escape. You don't know why you're there, but you know you don't want to be. The way you move between the different objectives you find is how Rebellion has tried to differentiate Atomfall from other games. Rather than a quest log, you have "leads". It's a distinction with at least a little difference, as you have a collection of the notes and conversations to do with a "lead", and you can read through these to figure out exactly where and what you should be doing next, and more often than not the clues are reasonably obvious. What is more interesting is that you can frequently find the objective of a quest - or lead - before you've even seen the start, depending on your proclivity to explore.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Through this and the interconnected maps, where shortcuts can be revealed to make your life easier, Atomfall rewards exploration in a way many larger games forget to do. I should clarify that even when doing a significant amount of exploration, as I have been, you'll find Atomfall may only take about twenty hours to complete. Now, there is replay value in the fact that you have various stories, many of which can collide and result in one being cut off early.</p>
<p>Two, for example, are scientists around at the start of everything. One is hiding in the village, infected, but working on a cure and weapon to stop the source. Another left has come back and has been imprisoned. If they work on both stories but tell the first where the second is, he kills her - spoiler warning. This cuts off one possible story on escaping the quarantine zone. I don't know exactly how many threads are in the game, but at least five lead towards an escape. Do they differ? I can't tell you; I am keen to find out.</p>
<p>If I have an issue with the leads system, there are a few where you can be left a little clueless about what you need to do. There are a few where you are more likely to stumble across the next step than intentionally find it. Also, as mentioned in the above example, a decision you make can result in a part of the story being completely cut off from you. I don't want to say "with no warning" because when you listen to the audio logs and read the notes surrounding the two characters, only a moron wouldn't be able to figure out the outcome. I said to myself "he's going to kill her", before I even gave him the location. Some people may argue you need it made a little too clear.</p>


<figure></figure>

<p>Outside of the exploration and story, Atomfall is still more than serviceable. Combat isn't too dissimilar to other titles. Melee and Ranged weapons will be found or picked up from the corpses of enemies, and you have a limited ammo capacity. When the respective skill is selected, I think the ammo capacity is expanded alongside the capacity of your materials used for crafting. Either way, it feels pretty balanced, mainly as you can only hold a limited number of items.</p>
<p>Often, I've found myself hoarding enough ammo to then go into one of the - I'll call them dungeons - when I get out of the other end, I'm low on ammo and even low on some crafting gear since I've been making Molotovs on the fly. I've rarely found myself in a position I can't get out of, one way or another, even if it's just trying to be stealthy to avoid people, then doing a runner. I want to say the options are limitless, but they never are. It's either fight, run, sneak, or a combination of two or more.</p>
<p>Combat feels quite responsive, though; I will certainly give it that. Aside from lobbing a Molotov Cocktail, the most valuable skill in your arsenal is the option to kick an enemy. If you unlock the ability that gives it a better stun and knockback, you become challenging to beat in close quarters. Some of the stronger enemies, the thralls, will eventually get to you, but it becomes instrumental in the areas you find them. Creating space to reload your shotgun, to pump some extra shells into their heads. Also, aim for the heads; it does the damage. Even better, though, get a good rifle, keep your distance, and go for the head.</p>
<p>Once you realise how useful it is, the crafting becomes quite essential. I didn't touch the crafting system for much of the game beyond creating random Molotovs or sticky bombs. However, since the materials don't use inventory space, strategic thinking becomes all the more critical. Why carry multiple bandages with you when you can craft some? Later, when you learn how to upgrade weapons, you need to. Improving their damage, range and aim is crucial to surviving the late-game events.</p>


<figure></figure>

<p>I won't argue that Atomfall will be the next Metro: Exodus or something like that. I don't think it is. Atomfall sits in the realms of the games that died out a while back but are in a resurgence. Your non-Triple-A games aren't budgeted to blow apart the biggest releases, but they can do well if they get it right. The original Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a similar title, and look at what happened with the sequel. Atomfall strikes me as a similar title, with a style designed to reach as broad an audience as possible.</p>
<p>That this is on last-gen systems is proof enough, though I have to say that when playing it on the PC, with settings to max, I have no issues with the visuals. I'd argue that the more colourful and less realistic style adds charm to Atomfall, and frankly, I would say it looks and plays better than any of Bethesda's post-apocalyptic output. Hell, even it's more space-faring production.</p>
<p>I've only encountered a small number of bugs while playing through Atomfall; a few characters have clipped into each other, and beating robot enemies is a chore once you realise you can break their paths by having them spot you, and then you disappear. Without fail, they never seem to be able to go back to their patrol. Also, the most glaring issue is that enemies cannot see you or shoot you through windows - I can't explain how or why, other than maybe Rebellion forgot windows are transparent and break when a bullet hits them.</p>
<p>If I have another criticism, the audio, specifically the voice acting, can also be off. I understand the army having a mixture of accents, but the residents and other locals of the area should sound like they're primarily from Cumbria. There's something just a little off, though the reality is that nobody outside of the North of England will ever notice. I can't say anything massive about the soundtrack, to be honest. It works as it doesn't stand out, but at the same time, it doesn't stand out. Other audio effects are generally strong; nothing stands out like it shouldn't be.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As I've said, I can't honestly argue that Atomfall will be the next post-apocalyptic masterpiece. What I will say, though, is that it is a game I've had a fun and enjoyable time with. This is the sort of game you can pick up at a lower price-point (£45) than your traditional £60 "Triple-A" games, and you can have a good twenty-plus hours, or more, with it.</p>
<p>Atomfall looks good, plays well, and has a decent atmosphere. It has a reasonably interesting semi-open collection of maps to explore and the dungeons (for lack of a better word) that come with such a game. The combat doesn't feel janky, and the AI isn't terrible. It has an interesting story and tries something a little different with the quests system to enhance exploration. I hope this does well enough that we get the sequel treatment in the same vein as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> because we could see the next leader of the post-apocalypse.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Atomfall is a thoroughly enjoyable game which looks and plays well, and offers a compelling narrative with surrounding exploration to keep you entertained. It's well-polished, offers good replay value, encourages you to do things a little different, and isn't bad on the eyes either, with a good design that allows it to both look good and support last-gen consoles. The score likely doesn't reflect the game as well as it should, as I would heartily recommend this to anybody, with the added advantage that it's coming to game pass.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>An interesting story, adding to the generic "nuclear fallout" plot found in other similar titles.
</li><li>A "leads" system that successfully does quests a little different, adding to exploration.
</li><li>Good art design which enables it to look good, while also catering to last-gen consoles.</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Can feature a few bugs with AI and pathfinding, here and there.
</li><li>Why can't enemies see you or shoot through windows?</li>						</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-the-diver-like-dragon-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mintrocket has announced the release date for its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>crossover, and the aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>is making its way to the cozy diving game-slash-restaurant sim next month.</p>

<p>As revealed by Mintrocket in a new Dev Dive video,&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>is coming to&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>on April 10th. It'll be available across all platforms on which you can play the game, and it'll introduce everyone's favorite lovable goof Ichiban Kasuga to the Blue Hole.</p>

<p>This will be the latest in a long string of&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro" rel="nofollow">collaborations</a>; the game has also entertained the likes of fiendishly addictive roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, potion sim&nbsp;<em>Potion Craft</em>, and Shift Up's&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke</em>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dave-the-diver-like-a-dragon-dlc-ichiban.jpg?itok=Cik3khLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dave-the-diver-like-a-dragon-dlc-ichiban.jpg?itok=_T-5qCxc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>brings Ichiban Kasuga to the world of&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>in April.</figcaption></figure><p>In the new video,&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>director Jaeho Hwang and community manager Zoe Shin discuss how the collaboration with&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>came about, as well as what you can expect from the upcoming DLC.</p>

<p>Rather sweetly, Hwang shows off some of the goodies he got when meeting longtime&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>producer Masayoshi Yokoyama at last year's Tokyo Games Show, including signed copies of&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth&nbsp;</em>and a Korean translation of the script for the first&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>As for the crossover DLC itself, it'll see Ichiban and the bartender of his hangout spot Survive visiting Dave and Bancho's restaurant. As you might expect, it's not peaceful for long, and soon, Ichiban finds himself drawn into yet another adventure.</p>

<p>You can look forward to a new side-scrolling beat-'em-up minigame, as well as&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>'s signature karaoke and appearances from several other franchise favorites. Hwang says he "basically put everything [he likes] about&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>into this collaboration".</p>

<p>Atomfall’s world has fallen into chaos and is a windswept wreck thanks to the Windscale disaster. You need to venture into the game to explore and exterminate threats if you hope to complete the Atomfall Trophy list and dust off all Trophies and Achievements along the way.</p>



<p>Rebellion’s 2025 is a hot one with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>. Resistance is a one-man crusade through Nazi-occupied France, whereas Atomfall is an alternate-history England where the infamous Windscale nuclear disaster turned out to have more serious consequences than we all thought.</p>



<p>We’ve called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-played-again-most-anticipated-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall one of our most anticipated games of the year</a>. The setting, the subplots, and the scarily eerie nature of its world all play a factor. There’s a lot to uncover, and you need to undertake a heavy workload for the Atomfall Trophy List.</p>



<p><strong>Spoiler Warning: Atomfall’s list has hidden Trophies and Achievements. We will show you the known objectives first, and it’s up to you if you want to see the rest.</strong></p>

<figure><figcaption>Alright, guv’nor? Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://atomfall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Atomfall</a> Trophy List is split in two—like an atom. You have Achievements and Trophies that appear the second you start up the RPG. But, closer inspection reveals that half of the accomplishments are hidden.</p>



<p>Here’s every Trophy and Achievement shown from the beginning.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Atomfall Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</th><th data-align="center">How to Earn</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pride of Britain</td><td data-align="center">Unlock all other trophies</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Detectorist</td><td data-align="center">Pick up the metal detector</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Where there’s muck there’s brass</td><td data-align="center">Find 10 metal detector caches</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Packed lunch</td><td data-align="center">Find 5 buried lunchboxes</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Avid Collector</td><td data-align="center">Find 10 comics</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Radiophonic</td><td data-align="center">Find 5 audio logs</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mate’s Rates</td><td data-align="center">Find 5 traders in the Quarantine Zone</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">We Want Information</td><td data-align="center">Read 50 notes in the Quarantine Zone</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Refer to Manual</td><td data-align="center">Learn 12 skills</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Orna mental</td><td data-align="center">Find and destroy 10 Garden Gnomes</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Homemade</td><td data-align="center">Find and learn 10 recipes</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Make do and mend</td><td data-align="center">Upgrade a firearm to pristine condition</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Fast Bowl</td><td data-align="center">Kill 10 enemies with a thrown weapon</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hit for Six</td><td data-align="center">Redirect a thrown grenade with the cricket bat</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Burglar</td><td data-align="center">Use the Signal Redirector to unlock 5 doors</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Batteries Not Included</td><td data-align="center">Power up a deactivated robot</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Caught Red-handed</td><td data-align="center">Cause an enemy to drop their Molotov cocktail</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Target Practice</td><td data-align="center">Get 6 kills with the MK.VI Revolver without reloading</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Grand Slam</td><td data-align="center">Take out at least 5 enemies in one explosion</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">High Tea</td><td data-align="center">Consume a Cornish pasty, English tea, and a slice of cake in 30s</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>As promised, these are the secret Trophies and Achievements. This is your <strong>final spoiler warning</strong> as I’m about to reveal each of the hidden tasks.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-trophies-amp-achievements-in-atomfall">How Many Trophies &amp; Achievements in Atomfall?</h2>



<p><strong>A grand total of 37 PlayStation Trophies and 36 Xbox Achievements await you in Atomfall.</strong></p>



<p>Veteran hunters know why there’s a notable difference between PlayStation and Xbox. But if you’re new to this game, PlayStation users are awarded a Platinum Trophy for earning all 36 other Trophies. Microsoft hasn’t implemented a similar system yet, but you still get a hefty amount of Gamerscore instead.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-might-have-set-a-record-with-endgame-credits.1141248/</guid>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is enormous in more ways than one. It has a gigantic open-world map, a staggering array of enemies to assassinate, and branching skill paths spread across two playable characters. It also has a stream of endgame credits that scroll up your screen for a whopping <strong>two hours</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s right – the credits that roll at the end of Assassin’s Creed Shadows will occupy two whole hours of your life if you intend on watching them through to the end, which is a painful thing for any developer wanting to wait around to catch their name in the mix.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-speed-it-up">Speed It Up</h2>



<p>Admittedly, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has a two-hour roll of credits because the text goes by so slowly – for no real reason.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, Video Game Credits captured the PC credits and uploaded the full segment to YouTube, with the video totalling <strong>three and a half hours</strong>. The soundtrack that plays behind the credits is pretty impressive, but nobody needs to wait around that long to catch their name.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows (Credits) (Windows)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5VYcPXnuDA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>For reference, Video Game Credits has documented the following feature-length credits segments:</p>



<ul>
<li>GTA V Enhanced – 01h08m</li>



<li>Hearts of Iron IV – 01h06m</li>



<li>Gangstar New Orleans – 01h07m</li>



<li>Battlefield 2042 – 1h15m</li>



<li>The Sims 2: Ultimate Collection – 1hr19m</li>
</ul>



<p>Don’t worry, though. You can speed up the credits by tapping (and holding) fast-forward, just in case you want to scroll through to a team you perhaps worked on for a nice social media snapshot.</p>



<p>If anything, it’s indicative of the sheer scope of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which is going down in reviews as one of the best games the series has seen in many years. It’s great, but it’s not perfect, and if I had to put a number on it, I’d say it’s an 8 out of 10.</p>



<p>The game has had a couple of issues since being released on March 20, though. For instance, a day one patch was released that stripped the ability to damage shrines, which was in response to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japan-government-worried-attacks-assassins-shadows/">the Japanese government</a> expressing concerns about ‘imitation attacks’ at shrines across the country.</p>



<p>Do you plan on watching the entire Assassin’s Creed Shadows credits roll? Let me know in the comments why you would and what’s wrong with you.</p>

Valhalla adopted a different approach when it first launched on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and even Google Stadia in November 2020. While it was available on PC as well, it was an Epic Games Store exclusive until November 2022. When it reached Steam, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2208920" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it peaked at 15,431 concurrent players</a> in December 2022.</p><p>On its first day, Shadows eclipsed that with a peak of 41,412 players and that number has already grown to 42,415. In comparison, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/3035570" rel="nofollow ">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> has a peak player count of 7,837, and at the time of writing, Shadows hasn't beaten <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/582160" rel="nofollow ">Origins</a> (41,541 concurrent players) or <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/812140" rel="nofollow ">Odyssey</a> (61,984 concurrent players) numbers yet. Concurrent players typically increase on the first weekend after launch as well, so these numbers could still potentially increase further.</p><p>With Ubisoft undergoing financial struggles recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-is-bit-of-an-existential-moment-for-ubisoft-analyst-says/1100-6530208/">analyst Joost Van Dreunen explained how Shadows</a> could be a "bit of an existential moment" for the company.

<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a>, as well as to buy outright. It's a "mid-priced" game that will have free post-launch DLC along with paid cosmetics. FBC is canon to Control and some characters from that game could appear in FBC, Kayatta told Kotaku.</p><p>As for Switch 2, it's set for release later this year, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">major reveal planned for April 2</a>. Given the immense success of the existing Switch, many are expecting strong third-party support, but as mentioned, it's too early to say if FBC could be among the list of titles coming to Switch 2.</p>

			<p>The Xbox UI is set to change significantly in the future, and it may soon show Steam games that are installed on the system, judging from an image shared online that was promptly removed shortly after.</p>
<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a>, an image was shared in a new blog post titled&nbsp;<em><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/">"Opening a Billion Doors With Xbox</a>," </em>which highlighted changes in the game industry and users now tending to engage with games across multiple devices, showing how the Xbox UI could change in the future to account for this tendency. What makes this new interface interesting is a clearly visible Steam label in all variants of the interface: TV, tablet and handheld. According to unspecified sources, Microsoft is working on an Xbox app update that will show every game installed on a PC, including games purchased on other digital storefronts like Steam and the Epic Games Store. As this Xbox app update is still in the early stages of development, however, the inclusion of all installed PC games in the interface may be scrapped as work continues.</p>
<p>Besides working on a new Xbox UI and app update, Microsoft is also hard at work on the hardware side of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">next-generation plans</a>, which include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X and a handheld console. In addition, the company is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">reportedly working with ASUS</a> on a handheld known as Project Keenan that will launch later this year. This handheld system, which will look markedly Xbox, will run full Windows with a focus on the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass. As such, it will definitely be able to run games purchased on Steam and other digital storefronts, so it wouldn't be surprising for the new UI featuring the Steam label to launch alongside the system.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date-set-for-june.1141221/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nightdive has announced the&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>release date, with the reworked version of the classic FPS coming to PC and consoles in summer.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>'s remaster will be launching across PC and consoles (that's current-gen and last-gen consoles, happily) on June 26th.</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering what happened to Nightdive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition-is-being-ported-to-kex-engine" rel="nofollow">previously-revealed</a>&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition</em>, this is, in fact, that very thing; the project was renamed to&nbsp;<em>25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>earlier this year, but it's still the same, ahem, enhanced edition Nightdive has been working on for the past few years.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-remaster-release-date-robot.jpg?itok=u9-8m4kP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-remaster-release-date-robot.jpg?itok=J5FgeGFv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>System Shock 2</em>'s remaster is coming in June.</figcaption></figure><p>As you've probably come to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease" rel="nofollow">expect</a> from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poed-definitive-edition-nightdive" rel="nofollow">previous</a> Nightdive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-studios-remastering-shadow-man-restoring-cut-content" rel="nofollow">remaster projects</a>,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>will bring a number of new features to the iconic 2000 FPS-RPG.</p>

<p>You can expect a visual revamp that will touch up some of the game's rougher edges and models without deviating from Irrational and Looking Glass' artistic vision, as well as some minor quality-of-life improvements, controller support, and more.</p>

<p>The game will also support Steam achievements, as well as achievements and trophies on the relevant consoles, and it'll boast 144fps and ultrawide support too, so this'll likely be the best-looking version of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>you can play (without mods, of course).</p>

<p>On the subject of mods, Nightdive is also promising expanded mod support for&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>, so if you want to turn all the enemies into Mr. Blobby and work out some very specific trauma, you should find it pretty easy to do so.</p>




<p>It's worth remembering that although Nightdive is the studio responsible for 2023's excellent&nbsp;<em>System Shock&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-goes-gold-release-date-for-pc-announced" rel="nofollow">remake</a>, this project isn't on the same scale; it's not a full reimagining, but a remaster, so bear that in mind if you pick it up.</p>

<p><em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>launches for PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shockr_2_25th_anniversary_remaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013043" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/System-Shock-2-25th-Anniversary-Remaster/9P4FK543SMZF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch on June 26th. Make sure you pick this one up if you're interested in a revamped slice of FPS history.</p>

<p>It’s time for a new expansion with Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s Shining Revelry content. We’re already putting Triumphant Light behind us as we’re being blinded by the long-awaited arrival of Shiny Pokémon&nbsp;in Shining Revelry.</p>



<p>The next main-set Expansion is here, and it’s called Shining Revelry. A fitting name as it welcomes Shiny Pokémon&nbsp;variations into Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket. Shinies have become part and parcel of the Pokémon&nbsp;experience in the mainline games and Pokémon&nbsp;GO.</p>



<p>It’s Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s turn to have Shinies, and they are the centerpiece attraction of Shining Revelry.</p>

<figure><figcaption>I’ve looked at this for hours. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket Shining Revelry expansion comes to us on <strong>March 27</strong>—giving you only a few days to fill in the gaps of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-triumphant-light-secret-missions-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a> and other sets.</p>



<p>The headline-makers we’ve seen—so far—in <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Pocket</a>‘s Shining Revelry set are a <strong>Shiny Charizard ex</strong> and a <strong>Shiny Lucario ex</strong>. They look absolutely stunning, and it introduces a new form of rarity to the grading system.</p>



<div><article><p><span>It’s time to shine ✨ in the latest </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonTCGPocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PokemonTCGPocket</a><span> expansion!

Shiny Pokémon arrive alongside Pokémon from the Paldea region in the upcoming expansion, Shining Revelry! Available on Thursday, March 27.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket Shining Revelry’s debut likely coincides with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-ranked-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-period-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Battles</a>. The PvP mode was announced a while back after being a rumor. So it’s a double-whammy for Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket players as the mobile app continues to Rock Smash it.</p>

Rank them here.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest in Ubisoft’s long line of stealth-action open worlds, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, is finally here. But where does it rank in the series? We’re asking you to make that decision. There have been over 30 games released under the Assassin’s Creed banner, but we’re just including the “mainline games” here, so no mobile, side-scrolling, VR entries, or spin-offs like Bloodlines or Liberation here, I’m afraid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">AC started all the way back in 2007 when Desmond Miles stepped into the Animus to fill the shoes of his ancestor Altaïr, and now finds itself in 16th-century Japan 18 years later as players take control of Naoe and Yasuke. This latest adventure is the 14th in the core series, and I’ve had a go at ranking them via one of our IGN Tier Lists, based purely on my personal enjoyment of each game. Take a look at my tier list here:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/19/screenshot-2025-03-19-at-12-11-28-1742386309547.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Simon Cardy's Assassin's Creed Tier List</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag is still the entry I hold closest to my heart. The mix of island exploration, ship combat, and colourful cast provides the best all-around AC experience in my mind. It’s joined by Assassin’s Creed 2 in the S-tier, the game that really catapulted the series into the limelight. I also have Valhalla in the A-tier, which may surprise some, but I really loved the Viking-influenced combat, and am a sucker for the Orlog minigame. Alongside it is Unity, a game whose recreation of French Revolution-era Paris still looks stunning a decade later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t agree with me? Think that Valhalla is far too bloated for its own good? Think that Assassin’s Creed 2 is actually overrated? Well, why not have a go at ranking all of the mainline AC games yourself in a tier list below where you can compare your own S, A, B, C, and D tiers with the whole of the IGN community. </p><div id="every-assassins-creed-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Assassin's Creed Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Assassin's Creed Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Enjoying Assassin’s Creed Shadows?
