            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-douglas-slocombe-cinematography-cutscenes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span>Lucasfilm</span><span>|</span><span><p>Harrison Ford (L), cinematographer Douglas Slocombe (C) and director Steven Spielberg (R) on the set of Raiders of the Lost Ark</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>There are loads of great things about <em>Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</em>, loads of very immersive<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and funny things</a>, but one&nbsp; thing you notice before anything else—and this is obvious even from watching trailers, let alone playing the game is that it's visually breath-taking. I don't want to take anything away from the amazing animators and modellers and concept artists who worked on it, the whole game looks incredible, but for this blog in particular I wanted to talk about how <em>Great Circle</em> (and particularly its many, many cutscenes) has been framed and lit.</p><p>There are moments playing and watching this game when I've simply taken my hands off the keyboard and mouse and gasped. So many moments when what I'm seeing on the screen looks cinematic not in the over-used video game sense of the word, but in actual motion picture sense of the word.</p><p>There are of course good reasons for this! <em>Great Circle</em> is, if nothing else, a painstaking labour of love from a team who knows exactly what makes <em>Indiana Jones</em> tick. It's an adaptation that hasn't just slapped a license on a generic experience, it's been designed from the ground up to make you feel like you're spending hours in Dr. Jones' shoes. The game's music is the music you remember from the films, Troy Baker's voice acting is perfect and even stuff like the animation is a work of reverence, nailing Harrison Ford's mannerisms down to the most minute detail, from his smirks to his finger-wagging.</p><p>That love can also be found in the game's eye for the cinematic. Watching <em>Great Circle</em>--the framing, the colours, the lighting, the emphasis--looks just like watching an actual <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie, or at least it looks like watching the first three films, which all featured the cinematography of Douglas Slocombe, a legend in the field who was nominated for three Academy Awards across a career that saw him work on everything from <em>The Italian Job</em> to <em>Rollerball </em>to <em>The Great Gatsby</em> to <em>Close Encounters Of The Third Kind</em>.</p><p>It's the latter where Slocombe first met Steven Spielberg, and the director was so impressed that he brought Slocombe on to work on 1981's <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, a film that Spielberg thought he had very specific noir-like ideas for, but whose look ultimately gave way to something else when running into Slocombe's penchant for practical considerations and high contrast shooting.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Beauty Of Indiana Jones" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-zZaIvckiqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Spielberg recalled this transition in 2017,<a href="https://theasc.com/articles/flashback-raiders-of-the-lost-ark-directing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in a feature he wrote for American Cinematographer</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I originally wanted a much moodier, almost neo-Brechtian style of light and shadow for this film. I wanted the film to resemble more, say The Informer — the film being more film noir than I eventually accomplished. But I found that the movie was beginning to paint itself out of the corner I put it in, by the kind of sketchy brightness which is Dougie's forte and I began to see what Dougie was doing. He was giving it a fuller look, not a flat look; he was giving it a very nice backlit look, but a very full backlit look and because of that he was getting amazing depth of field due to the number of lights he was using. In the dailies, of course, it looks very dark and moody and atmospheric, while on the set it looked very bright, but he was not shooting wide open, to say the least. He was stopping down. So between my original discussions with Dougie about film noir and subsequent results from our collaboration, and seeing a couple of days' dailies that looked kind of sketchy — very sketchy — perhaps film noir, and then seeing other scenes that were fatter and richer in contrast, I began to say, "Hey, this movie is much prettier in color than it is in black-and-white."</p><p>I believe that the photographic style of this movie happened by itself through an interesting compromise between what Dougie loves to do and what I wanted from him. We each came halfway and we found what will now be, hopefully, the continuing style of the Raiders saga.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The result was a trilogy with a visual style so distinctive that Slocombe was nominated for an Oscar in 19081 for his work on <em>Raiders</em>, and one so memorable that someone like me with only a passing knowledge of the films and the people who made them could look at <em>Great Circle's</em> cutscenes and think, boy, they sure do look like they're shot exactly the same as those movies they're based on. Just like the early films, <em>Great Circle</em> features a ton of heavy contrast, a lot of incredibly moody lighting relying on candles and sunlight, loads of thick shadows and plenty of very, very close shots of Indiana's face.</p><p><em>Raiders</em> went on to become Slocombe's most recognised work (<a href="https://britishcinematographer.co.uk/douglas-slocombe-obe-bsc-raiders-of-the-lost-arc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even though it cost him the use of one eye after a freak jeep accident!</a>) and while he's sadly no longer with us--<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/23/douglas-slocombe-obituary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he lived until the grand old age of 103, only passing away in 2016</a>--the fact he left behind such a legacy while being self-taught is incredible. How many other cinematographers do you even <em>know</em>, let alone could so quickly point to the visual signature they've left behind on modern pop culture?</p><p>It's impossible to play <em>Great Circle</em> and not see Machinegames' best attempts at building on that legacy. Just look at some of these shots! Most are from cutscenes where the inspiration can be most literally seen, but there are even moments during gameplay when some light pours through a mysterious tomb's door and you think, uh huh, this is <em>Indiana Jones</em> all right. When you're watching something like this and John Williams' score kicks in and Troy Baker is channelling Harrison Ford you realise this isn't just something cashing in on a beloved license, it genuinely understands every aspect of it and feels like a continuation that could have involved Spielberg and George Lucas themselves.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>I've read reviews of this game that are almost critical of <em>Great Circle's </em>cutscenes; they wish this had been a movie and not a game, or that the cutscenes had focused less on action scenes and allowed the player more agency over them. I think Machinegames got the balance just right, because the cutscenes here don't feel like a lesser version of Indy's story, they feel like a thoughtful continuation of it, in ways infinitely preferable to sitting down and watching the last two dogshit movies.</p><p><em>Great Circle</em> is an adaptation so considerate and understanding of the source material that it didn't just stop at copying Indy's voice and hat, it made sure his mannerisms were correct,<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-immersive-machinegames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that his limitations were made clear</a>, that the music was perfect and that down to the most minute, oft-overlooked detail--like the lens through which we view the action and the cutscenes--it understood what made Indiana Jones <em>Indiana Jones</em>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/29/24331748/lg-ultragear-gx9-bendable-oled-5k2k-monitors-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LG isn’t waiting until CES begins to <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2024/12/lg-unveils-worlds-first-bendable-5k2k-gaming-monitor-winner-of-three-awards-at-ces-2025/">reveal its new collection of gaming monitors</a>. The 2025 lineup is led by the UltraGear OLED Bendable Gaming Monitor, which LG claims is the “world’s first 5K2K-resolution bendable OLED display.” That strikes me as extremely specific, but hey, it’s always worth bragging when you’re first, I suppose. The 45-inch monitor has an expansive resolution of 5120x2160, so you’re getting the same vertical pixel count as a typical 4K screen but a much wider canvas to game on.</p><p>And with a 21:9 aspect ratio, LG believes it provides “a more immersive gaming experience than standard 16:9 displays, while maintaining better content compatibility than 32:9 monitors.” This format also makes the display a great fit for productivity work when you’re not immersed in gameplay.</p><p>The UltraGear OLED Bendable Gaming Monitor (model 45GX990A) can transition from completely&nbsp;flat to a 900R curvature, and the latest version of LG’s Dual-Mode feature “allows users to switch effortlessly between resolution and refresh rate presets, and customize the&nbsp;aspect ratio and picture size.” It’s certified for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, but the press materials don’t specify a maximum refresh rate. I’ve asked for more details there.</p><div><figcaption><em>Both 45-inch monitors have a 5K2K resolution of 5120x2160.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: LG</cite></p></div><p>LG is also releasing a non-bendable model with a permanent 800R curve. Otherwise, it’s the same 45-inch size, same aspect ratio, and same 5K2K resolution. LG’s press release says you can expect “sharp, lifelike images with the stunning colors and exceptional contrast LG OLED products are known for.” Shared specs between both monitors include a 0.03ms (GtG) response time and support for DisplayPort 2.1, HDMI 2.1, and USB-C with 90W power delivery. The 45GX950A uses a RGWB subpixel layout to improve readability of text on the screen and make the aforementioned productivity work easier on your eyes. </p><p>Along with these two monitors, LG is also introducing the curved UltraGear 39GX90SA, a webOS-powered “home entertainment hub” with easy access to streaming services — just like LG’s TVs. It seems like the company has taken some cues from Samsung’s smart monitors here. At 39 inches, this one’s a bit smaller than the other GX9 displays, but it retains the 21:9 aspect ratio and 800R curve. “Equipped with USB Type-C ports, it offers convenient connectivity, and incorporates LG’s ergonomic and space-saving L-shaped stand for a clutter-free desk setup,” LG said in tonight’s press release.</p><p>As per usual with CES news, pricing and a specific release date are still to come later in 2025. But we’ll be getting our first in-person look at the UltraGear GX9 series in Las Vegas, so stay tuned for impressions early next month — along with an avalanche of stunning screens from many other companies, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/disney-wants-more-indiana-jones-titles-after-the-massive-hype-brought-in-by-great-circle/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Disney apparently wants more adaptations of the highly popular Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, as revealed by the Windows Central's Jez Corden in the newest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD58iKzc55c">Xbox Two podcast</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have done enough to impress Disney, so the studio now wants to develop more titles based on the IP. MachineGames, the developer behind the adaption, has done a great job mimicking the original Indiana Jones movies with Great Circle, which has been reflected in the title's popularity over the internet as well. Jez Corden says, "Disney picked up the phone and wants more Indiana Jones," implying that there are more adventures for the gaming incarnation of Indiana on the way.</p>
<p>The main reason Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have seen such a massive success, at least in terms of how the title turned out, is that MachineGames has a lot of experience with first-person view titles, notably the Wolfenstein series. This is why they have nailed the game in transitioning into various scenarios. And with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-bundles-indiana-jones-the-great-circle-with-geforce-rtx-40-gpus-full-path-tracing-dlss-3-5-support/">support for DLSS 3.5 and full path tracing</a>, the visuals are absolutely exceptional with this title.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFindianajonesandthegreatcircle5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Not only this, but the title has excelled at replicating the lore of the original movie character, which has resulted in nothing but positive feedback for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">extensive review</a> of the title categorized it as "the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton," which seems to be the consensus among critics and fans alike.</p>
<p>While information around the future of the Indiana Jones series is uncertain, we can be optimistic about the franchise's development now that Disney is interested in getting a proper gaming franchise going. For now, the developers' main focus will be on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 port</a>, which is scheduled to launch next Spring, and the announced story DLC, The Order of Giants.</p>
<p>By the way, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has just been named the "Game of the Year" at the Gamescom tournament. It received 55% of the votes and dominated other big titles released in 2024, like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>

                <p><strong>S<em>poilers for Final Fantasy VII [1997], Remake, and Rebirth.</em></strong></p><p dir="ltr">Even with far more barriers in the way, the desperation began almost as soon as the original game was on shelves and the first person saw Aerith die in Final Fantasy VII. The singular question haunted AOL chat rooms, usenet, and game magazine mailboxes for years: Can we bring her back?</p><p dir="ltr">Games have such a strange relationship with the idea of death, so it makes sense that players in 1997--starved of narratives with any real permanent stakes beyond how many quarters you can pump in or whether you really wanted to fight all the way back to the place you died--would have a reaction to Aerith being permanently dead. It’s baked right into the narrative in fact, with Cloud, even with all of his emotional damage, grasping the enormity. “Aerith will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry, or get angry....” Cloud wrestles, in the moment she dies in his arms, with grief for the first time. And Sephiroth does not give a shit. Sephiroth is beyond human concerns. He knows what Cloud is, and flies away with his gentle amusement. Cloud is a puppet. To him, emotions for someone ultimately meaningless in the larger context of time and space are no different than a toddler weeping because it accidentally stepped on a dandelion. But this is the internal struggle that would define the next stretch of FF7. Cloud discovers what he is, and has to come to grips with what it actually means to be human, because just copying Zack Fair’s homework will only get him so far.</p><p dir="ltr">As a singular work, Final Fantasy VII’s ensemble of rebels comes to the end with proud, full hearts, accepting what must be done to save Gaia. But it doesn’t take long for fans and Square Enix to find ways to cheat death, from GameShark codes allowing players to keep Aerith in the party after she’s dead, to Square Enix futzing with their own rules to utilize Aerith in Advent Children and Kingdom Hearts. In a medium where death is always an easily solvable problem—hell, in a game series where resurrection is usually one Phoenix Down away—Aerith being dead should be a temporary inconvenience at best. She’s only mostly dead, right?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416847-aerith1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416847" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416847-aerith1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416847"></a><figcaption>Aerith strikes her iconic pose in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416847-aerith1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The greatest gift, and the greatest power of Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, is that there is no such respite to be had in it. From the second the game starts, Aerith’s days are numbered, with the inevitable moment when players would have to grapple with the potential of her martyr’s death acting as an oppressive weight on the entire game. The dread of Shinra, Sephiroth, and the lifestream itself, all of which could put an end to our party’s quest, adds to the pressure, forcing our party and every playable character to contend with the peril in their own way. The only one who never buckles is Aerith.</p><p dir="ltr">Aerith, from the very start of Remake, knows more than anyone about where the path leads for her and her friends. It’s never said outright, but the implication is seeded fairly often that she knows how she dies. It becomes clear how many forces conspire against them, threatening to tear the entire party of heroes asunder. And yet, in that moment, standing outside Midgar, all Aerith can do is look at the possibilities of the green, verdant world stretching in front of her, and be grateful for the company she gets to share it with. There’s something to be said for just how much of Rebirth is sidequests,new mechanics you get to use once and never again, and strange flights of fancy. And yet, unlike most open world games, that friction between the importance of the greater quest and the frivolity of the optional stuff isn’t so much a dissonant note, but the entire point.</p><p dir="ltr">As the game comes to a close, Aerith takes an unconscious Cloud through her memories of the Midgar Slums. Shinra is flying to the Temple of the Ancients, and Aerith wants you to try candy.</p><p dir="ltr">Sephiroth is waiting for his chance to murder everyone. Aerith wants you to pick out jewelry.The multiverse that is Final Fantasy VII is threatening to collapse. Aerith wants nothing more than for Cloud to look at her and hold her hand.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416851-aerith2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416851" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416851-aerith2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416851"></a><figcaption> </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416851-aerith2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-world-is-ending-but-heres-a-side-quest-will-rpgs-ever-solve-their-urgency-problem" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer article not long ago</a> where Robert Purchase asked a reasonable if misguided question: “Why is it that in a role-playing game where the stakes are usually 'the end of the world', the end of the world always has to wait for us to finish our sprawling to-do list first?” A reasonable question approached from the wrong angle. The question, more often than not, is why the end of the world always feels inconsequential? There’s a reason why 0% speedruns of Breath of the Wild where players rocket over to fight Calamity Ganon the second they put a shirt on never feel out of pocket: that’s a game that holds the consequences of saving the world cheap, in order for the player to create that treasured immersion developers love so much. Nintendo’s far from alone on that; this is how most open experiences are meant to operate to give players power.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy VII was never designed in a way where the threat of Sephiroth, Meteor, Shinra et al were meant to fade into the background. Once Sephiroth makes the fateful call, the beautiful overworld music vanishes, replaced by one of the most ominous pieces of music Nobuo Uematsu would ever compose. You literally cannot step outside without remembering what must be done, and part of why it’s effective is because we’ve seen the game willing to take someone precious away from the player to get there-- something irretrievable and irreplaceable. It’s only after the fact that players and Square tried to fill the hole of Aerith’s absence without retconning the whole thing. Rebirth, on the other hand, knows where it’s headed from minute one.Right from the beginning, it’s begging players to look at what they have, the world they inhabit, and the people who make their home here; the humanity that Sephiroth holds so cheap and the friends so dedicated to preserving it all that they’re willing to look the silver-haired, one-winged angel of death in his smug fucking face and tell him that “yes, we’re going to fight you for all this.” And by then, players will have a deep, beautiful basis of experiences in life and love to back that up.</p><p dir="ltr">That brings us to the moment.The moment in which it almost looks like Square might spare us the pain of watching Aerith--now a character so much more genuinely and beautifully written and executed than her 1997 counterpart--die in Cloud’s arms again. But no. Despite some deft swordplay, Aerith is stabbed. The materia falls down the stairs. The theme plays. And again, many will weep. As it turns out, this is, to borrow another multiverse’s parlance, a <a href="https://intothespiderverse.fandom.com/wiki/Canon_Events" rel="nofollow ">canon event</a>. Even given how much Remake and Rebirth stray from the path we all know, some things are inevitable. Aerith dies in the Temple of Ancients every time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416853-aerith3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416853" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416853-aerith3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416853"></a><figcaption> </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416853-aerith3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But something’s different about Rebirth. Through Cloud’s temporary surrender to outright madness and nihilism, we’ve seen just how much of this universe is inevitable. But the magic of it is this: you are encouraged to fight it anyway. Humanity--being a thinking, feeling, emotional being--demands it. And the real difference between Rebirth and the vast majority of experiences is that everything you’ve done prior informs it.</p><p dir="ltr">This seems to be a running motif in Square’s work in the FF series of late, with XV and XVI both playing with the idea that, while ruin is inevitable every tiny interaction creates a vast tapestry of reasons to save the world anyway. Despite being faced with death time and again, Square has asked us to revel in these peoples’ lives, in all their messy glory, because it all actually matters. When death comes--and it comes heavy in all these games--it has a face. Life, on the other hand, has many. And the sacrifice of confronting the end of all things means absolutely nothing without seeing those faces first. In a truly meaningful RPG narrative, that is why the end of the world must be allowed to wait.</p><p dir="ltr">For Final Fantasy VII, we have spent literally real-world decades waiting for the opportunity to stop Aerith from going away, never truly accepting that our time with her is short. Rebirth’s great power is that it gives us more of that. We have all the time in the world to fall in love with the very act of being alive and breathing the way she does, so that when the end comes, there aren’t regrets.</p><p dir="ltr">When Aerith died in 1997, all Cloud could focus on was the loss--the things we can never get back, the things she will never do again.</p><p dir="ltr">When Aerith dies in 2024, Cloud swallows the sorrow, holds her hand, and tells her, "I got this." And he lets her go to fight for the world she loved.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416854-aerith4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416854" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416854-aerith4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416854"></a><figcaption> </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416854-aerith4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When that fight is over, Cloud's perspective undergoes a shift; straddling timelines, able to see the void left by Aerith’s death, but carrying her with him, or at least, a multiverse echo of her. But still. Cloud knows it's not her. He can't suddenly give Aerith back to his world, and he will be uniquely equipped to share what he knows of her to get his friends through it. Our heroes mourn. But it is so much more important that Rebirth shows they are not doing it alone, and that all of them are better for having known her.</p><p>And thus, Rebirth imparts its lesson. One of the hardest but most crucial lessons of the year. We have had to let Aerith go for so long, many of us forgot why it hurt to begin with. But Rebirth lets us remember, and revel in it, and finally accept. We let her go, gladly, having fought, played, and sung with her in ways we never imagined back on PS1. There is an art to accepting the end is coming. The Remake project altogether has been, above all else, an invitation to look out at the horizon and, even knowing it has an end, to revel in what’s ahead regardless.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

Things started out well with the surprise success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, the critically acclaimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, and the slick action duo of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>. But things took a downward turn in the summer thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord’s</a> (failure to) launch. The doomed hero shooter and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">subsequent closing of developer Firewalk Studios</a> was certainly a low point for Sony, even if a delightful little robot did his best to brighten the mood in the fantastic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>. Since then we’ve seen the arrival of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, an even more powerful PlayStation 5 console that comes at an eye-wateringly premium price and has been met with a mixed reception. But with time ticking away, there’s barely time left in 2024 to dwell on PlayStation’s past. It already feels like time to look ahead to 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what does the upcoming year have in store for PlayStation? With almost all of its first-party studios keeping cards close to chests, you may be mistaken for thinking things are looking quiet. But let's delve in deeper to see exactly what games to expect for the PS5 in 2025, as well as make a few hopeful guesses of our own.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PlayStation Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Games We Know Are Coming</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, let’s look at what is scheduled to come from those all-important PlayStation Studios. Sucker Punch’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> is certainly looking like the headline attraction, and it’s coming to the PS5 in 2025. The sequel to 2020’s open-world samurai adventure, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, is set to be a stunner as we’re introduced to both a new hero and Northern Japanese location. Let’s hope for some gameplay trailers early next year or in the summer, ahead of a winter release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgames</a>, the debut game from Haven Studios. It’s a multiplayer heist shooter, and so it will certainly be fascinating to see what lessons PlayStation has learned from the live-service disaster of Concord. First revealed in 2023, we’re yet to see any gameplay, but hopefully that doesn’t mean it won’t hit its target of a 2025 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And… those are the only PlayStation Studios games we currently know are slated for a 2025 release. And with no actual release dates locked in yet, we can barely plot out what to expect in each part of the year. But that isn’t to say there won’t be more big games coming to the PS5 next year, though, and we can certainly theorise at what else we might see from some of Sony’s first-party stable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We now know that Naughty Dog’s next adventure will take us to the stars in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. We don’t expect to be playing this in 2025, though, but we’ll happily eat up any more info Neil Druckmann and the team wants to share about it – especially if that includes some of that laser blade gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> has a lot of weight resting on its shoulders, not only because it will be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family">Bungie’s first full release since it was acquired by Sony</a>, but alongside Fairgames, it will be PlayStation’s first big new live-service shooter to follow in the quickly fading footsteps of Concord. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a> developers have as strong a shooter pedigree as anyone in the business, so it will certainly be interesting to see the result of its work as it aims to revive its long-dormant 90s series as a multiplayer extraction shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could 2025 be the year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> emerges from its oily cocoon? Hideo Kojima was at The Game Awards but didn’t bring a new trailer with him. Unacceptable behaviour, if you ask me. Are we any closer to knowing what it’s all about? Who’s to say, but we certainly want to play it. And the sooner we can, the sooner Kojima can move on to working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Physint</a>, the upcoming stealth-action PlayStation exclusive from the Metal Gear master.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As for third-party exclusives, there’s a fair few to look forward to.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for third-party exclusives, there’s a fair few to look forward to – especially if you’re into big swords. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero">Phantom Blade Zero</a> looks set to be a flashy hack-and-slash action RPG from Chinese studio S-Game. A semi-open world samurai bloodfest with soulslike elements, it certainly doesn’t look to be lacking in style. No release date has been given as yet, but let's hope for next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of blades, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/where-winds-meet">Where Winds Meet</a> is a PS5 console-exclusive RPG set in ancient China. Taking place during the Ten Kingdoms Era, you step into the shoes of a warrior who wields influence over warring dynasties, shaping history with the point of your sword, as well as mystical and magical abilities. Originally set for a 2024 release before being delayed to add even more content to its packed, mammoth open world, it wouldn’t be a shock to see it finally arrive within the next 12 months.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But wait, there are more swords and even bigger blades in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ballad-of-antara">Ballad of Antara</a>, a free-to-play co-op action RPG packed with multiple protagonists and intertwining stories coming to the PS5 in 2025. We’ll get a better look at it soon, with a beta promised to be on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Think we’re done with swords? Think again. This next game even has one in the title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword of the Sea</a>. You don’t use this one to fight with, though; instead, you’ll be plonking your feet on it and riding around at speed, Tony Hawk and Metaphor: ReFantazio style. From Abzû and The Pathless studio Giant Squid, the reveal trailer couldn’t help but remind us of Journey, as a mysterious cloaked character hoverswords around vast desert ruins. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another relatively fresh announcement, having only been revealed at September’s State of Play, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> is the next game from Lost in Random developer Moonhood Studios. An adventure handcrafted from clay, it’s set to be one of the most visually striking games of 2025. Plus, it’s even coming out on PS VR2. At least someone is helping out that long-forgotten little guy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last PS5 console exclusive we’re going to highlight is a game we wrote about exactly this time last year in our 2024 PlayStation look-ahead. Hopefully 2025 will be the year we finally get to clumsily bumble our way through the world of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>. A PS5 console-exclusive, the team up from the developers behind Getting Over It and Ape Out looks equal parts agonising as it does hilarious.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That may be it for exclusives, but there are plenty more multiplatform games coming out in 2025 that are set to make it a bumper year for PlayStation players. Alongside the arrival of I<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">ndiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> onto PS5, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> to name but a few. Oh, and a little game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. Could be good. Who knows.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Hopes and Dreams</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now for the fun part: the section where we get to cross our fingers and conjure up games that don’t exist yet, but maybe will appear before our eyes in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac has had a relatively quiet year – for a studio that puts out new releases with such regularity, that is – but understandable considering it continues to recover from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-hackers-release-stolen-data-leak-wolverine-videos-future-projects-and-more">data breach suffered at the end of 2023</a>. We know that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a> is in the works but don’t yet know exactly when it will be in our hands. And, if rumours are to be believed, a Venom game is scheduled to arrive before it. While it may be unlikely that we’ll be playing either of these superhero stories within the next 12 months, we might get a clearer picture of what is coming next from the Spidey studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same can be said for Santa Monica Studio. What’s next for the God of War developer is a mystery, although we do know Cory Barlog – game director of 2018’s God of War – moved on to helm a new project in 2021 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-new-director-cory-barlog-unannounced-projects">after leaving Eric Williams to fill Ragnarok’s director seat</a>. Could we see what Barlog’s game is in 2025?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for other studios, can we expect yet more delves into the world of Horizon from Guerrilla Games, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">an online multiplayer game reportedly in development</a> at the Amsterdam developers? And it's been a long time since Bend released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> – almost six whole years, in fact – and the studio has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bend-studio-unannounced-project-logo-reveal">hinted that it's making another open-world adventure</a>. Little is known apart from that, but it’s safe to say we’d like to learn more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The truth is, we know very little about what is in the pipeline from many of Sony’s first-party studios, so don’t be surprised if the PS5 is in for another relatively quiet year in 2025. We’d be more than happy to be wrong about that, though, and be pleasantly surprised by a flurry of reveals and releases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, could <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-becomes-majority-shareholder-in-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-no-full-takeover-for-now">Sony’s interest in acquiring the massive Kadokawa company</a> (which, alongside a huge anime portfolio, also owns FromSoftware) finally result in a Bloodborne remaster or sequel? I know we said these are hopes and dreams… but don’t be silly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Hardware and Tech</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of hardware, Sony has been very busy over the past couple of years with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-vr2">PS VR2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-portal">PlayStation Portal</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> all released to varying levels of success. As a result, we expect things to be quieter on the hardware front when it comes to 2025. However, it may be the year that we see the PS5 Pro justify itself further as an expensive upgrade if games like Ghost of Yotei and GTA 6 start to push the base PlayStation 5 to its limit. It will certainly be interesting to see how developers embrace this new tech over the next year or so, and if we start to see genuinely impressive comparisons between the original PS5 and Pro.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But while we expect actual hardware releases to be quiet, we’ve heard whispers that there may be some news to share of fresh PlayStation tech in 2025. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-set-to-take-on-nintendo-with-new-portable-playstation-report">Could we see Sony take another stab at the handheld market?</a> Just stick some internal storage into the Portal. I have no qualifications when it comes to hardware engineering, but how hard can it be, lads? In all seriousness, though, if recent reports are to be believed, then maybe we could actually see a successor to the PSP and PS Vita in the coming year, or at least an announcement of one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s be honest, it’s all guesswork isn’t it? Got your own theories and hopes for what we’ll see from PlayStation in 2025? Let us know in the comments below, as well as what you’re most excited to play.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Witch was always a fan-favorite in the first Path of Exile, and that didn’t change with the launch of its sequel. People still gravitate toward the Witch for several reasons, primarily because she has powerful summons. With the right combination of skills and abilities, you can roam a map as the powerful Witch, clearing mobs of enemies without lifting a finger. But first, it’s best to learn the best summons in Path of Exile 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-choose-these-top-summons-for-witch-in-path-of-exile-2">Choose These Top Summons for Witch in Path of Exile 2</h2>



<p>Playing as a Witch proves more entertaining than you’d initially imagine. I mean, Chaos magic is downright fun to use and often quite powerful, but you’ll spend more time playing catch-up after your minions slay the entire zone ahead of you instead of casting a powerful bolt of magic.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>You have a handful of choices while playing as Witch, namely:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Skeletal Sniper</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Arsonist</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Frost Mage</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zombies</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Warrior</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>These are in order from “best” to “worst” of the ones we recommend you use. Some may favor Skeletal Warriors above Zombies. The latter is a weak, time-limited unit that decays quickly, but you can spawn more quickly, nearly endlessly, to have a constant flow of minions dominating the battlefield. They’re an excellent tool that works similarly to a meat shield between your squishy Witch and the countless hard-hitting enemies across Wraeclast.</p>



<p>Skeletal Sniper is perhaps one of the most effective and useful summons available, as they deal ranged poison damage that bursts into a cloud of noxious fumes designed to deal area-of-effect damage and lock down mobs. For a similar effect, albeit less effective and with fire, Skeletal Arsonists come in second place.</p>



<p>However, keep in mind that Path of Exile 2 is currently in Early Access. Grinding Gear Games is still working on balancing and will likely change the effectiveness of many abilities before and after launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-stalingrad-review-campaign-begins<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Undanuted</em> by Osprey Games, is a series heralded as perfectly blending a deck-building game with wargaming elements. The series of games first started in 2020 with <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, and rather than start with a review of the original game, we're working backwards from the latest game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>. This time we're looking at <em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em>, which introduced a campaign setting to&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> in one of the most challenging military campaigns of the modern era.</p>

<p>Although we've only just started covering&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> on the site, we have previously covered several of Osprey Games' titles, including the brand new <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action 3rd Edition</a></em>, copublished with Warlord games, and also some of their awesome supplements for their miniatures agnostic system,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frostgrave-wildwoods-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-3.jpg?itok=nEq2SZel 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-3.jpg?itok=GvfXQq3N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em>'s map tiles not only get destroyed as the campaign unfolds but they can also be fortified.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Undaunted Stalingrad?</h2>

<p>In games of <em>Undaunted</em>, as was the case in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>, players draw 4 cards from their deck each turn and then use those cards to play actions from the tokens they have on the board, such as moving and attacking. Certain cards also allow you to draw more cards from your supply, or move cards from your deck to your supply, allowing you to tailor your deck as you play. New tokens can also be added to the game board as you draw new units into your deck. Some tokens have multiple cards that can activate them, with the cards having the same unit or squad name, but representing a different individual in that unit or vehicle.</p>

<p>This card system, as well as working for actions, also controls a unique damage system. As a unit takes hits, you must discard a matching card from your hand. If you don't have a matching card in your hand, you discard one from your discard pile, and if there isn't one there too, you discard it from your deck. If you can't find the card at all, the unit is eliminated. This can put real pressure on going first in the turn and focuses you on picking your targets. If a unit you have the card for in your hand is hit, then you discard the card and you might not be able to activate it this turn. It also adds a nice hidden element as you and your opponent try to work out how many cards units have left, and which is the optimum target to hit.</p>

In <em>Stalingrad</em>, both players start with the similar but not for the artwork decks, but over time, as you take losses and your troops gain experience, you will replace them with inferior replacements, upgrade them, gain new units, or maybe just lose them completely from your deck.</p>

<p>The map too changes over time, expanding, but also reacting to missions and the destruction you bring. Each mission directly links from the previous, and the campaign branches and adapts depending on the last, and with 35 possible scenarios in the book, along with each of the 2 factions having their own scenario book with background narrative and scenario rules, every time you play through will be different (unless you complete exactly the same mission with exactly the same results and the same losses somehow).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-2.jpg?itok=ex0hvN70 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-2.jpg?itok=88SX07m6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both the German and Soviet forces in&nbsp;<em>Undaunted Stalingrad </em>start with the same decks stat wise, but develop differetly as the campaign progresses.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does Undaunted Stalingrad Have Different Factions?</h2>

<p><em>Undaunted Stalingrad </em>features the 2 historical forces that were part of the campaign during WWII, the Germans and the Soviets. Both factions start with the same decks, but they have different upgrades and additions as the campaign develops. We're keeping this review spoiler-free, but the differences are very on-theme and in keeping with the forces of the time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-6.jpg?itok=ztqI8vIp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-6.jpg?itok=OdjUGivU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As the&nbsp;<em>Undaunted Stalingrad </em>campaign progresses, the Game State will change depending on the winner of each scenario.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Does The Campaign Work In Undaunted Stalingrad?</h2>

<p>At the end of each scenario, along with removing casualties from your deck, and upgrading troops, the game also tracks the game state with a number. Using a table, you take the current game state number, and depending on who the victor is, change the game state to the new number based on that scenario.</p>

<p>The game state also tells you which background section of the scenario book for your force to read, and then which scenario to play next. The scenario then tells you which cards to unlock, your objectives for that game, and any special rules to play.</p>

<p>The developing map and changing deck really does bring home the pressures of war, and makes you consider your decisions in battle. It's easy to throw troops forward when you know everything resets for the next game, but when you're several games into a campaign, and you know that losing a tank could put you on the back foot for the rest of the campaign, your strategy will change.</p>

<p><em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em> is designed for the long haul and that's where it shines. Both players need to be happy going in that there's going to be a few games to get to the end of the campaign, to get the most out of it, rather than the pick-up and play options in the earlier <em>Undaunted</em> products.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-4.jpg?itok=4spXtCZa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-4.jpg?itok=wgLouXoo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's lots to discover for both factions in&nbsp;<em>Undaunted Stalingrad </em>as the campaign goes on.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Undaunted Stalingrad?</h2>

<p><i>Undaunted Stalingrad&nbsp;</i>is a fantastic if somber experience. Anyone who's read my reviews before will know that theme is huge for me, as it's easy to put a thematic skin on some mechanics in order to gain audience buy-in, but <em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em> really captures what was a horrendous, grueling campaign for both sides. It takes the solid <em>Undaunted</em> mechanics, and mixes them extremely well with the branching legacy campaign, along with capturing the unique feel of both forces, which was also very pleasing to see.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Undaunted Stalingrad?</h2>

<p>If you're looking for a quick pick up and play game, as a new player, or a previous <em>Undaunted</em> player, then <em>Stalingrad</em> is at it's best when played as part of the legacy campaign, and you should try out one of the other <em>Undaunted</em> options (<em>2200 Callisto</em>&nbsp;has a linked campaign, but you can play any scenario you wish). If you're not a fan of the WWII theme, then this leans into it very heavily, and when you're deep in the campaign, it's hard to see past it. If you want an incredibly thematic experience, then <em>Stalingrad</em> is that, but if you want a deck-builder wargame hybrid without the WWII theme, then try <em>2200 Callisto</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/29/game-of-the-year-2024-best-playstation-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>While 2024 has not arguably been one of the biggest years for exclusives, Sony has still had some big hitters come in. Those include remakes and reimaginings of beloved favourites, the dawn of new IPs that could go on to establish themselves as part of the PlayStation Pantheon, and more memorable experiences that will live on in memory whether you’re new to gaming or have been part of the PlayStation journey since the beginning. With that in mind, there could only have been one clear winner for this award.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> is pure, unfiltered joy. What better game to win Best PlayStation than one that celebrates everything PlayStation from its 30 year history? Astro Bot is more than just a celebration though. It is the culmination of a character that found its beginning in the original PSVR era, and then introduced players to all the features of the PS5, and now being cemented as the current PlayStation mascot.</p>
<p>Astro Bot has so many elements to it that make it great. Levels are based on classic franchises, there are plenty of Bot characters to find hidden away, tons of secrets to uncover, and it is getting regular free updates with even more content to play through. It looks stunning, it sounds stunning, and the gameplay of Astro Bot is really smooth too. Astro Bot captures the very core of the message Play Has No Limits.</p>
<h2>Helldivers 2 – Runner-up</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> was one of those gaming phenomena where it feels like literally everyone is playing the exact same thing… or at least trying to, as servers inevitably crumbled during the early days and weeks. Taking Arrowhead’s familiar formula of friendly fire filled co-op action, but adapting it now to a third person shooter, just being able to blast bugs like its 1999’s Starship Troopers was enough to grab everyone’s attention, but that initial drop would lead to another, and then another, and then another.</p>

<p>The initial hook was the humour of the excessive military might you could call upon for backup, while being inherently very, very squishy and prone to being caught in the explosion that you or your friends just called in. Throw in a meta-game of planetary conquest/liberation played against a DM within Arrowhead, and a wild obsession with a planet that quickly became dubbed ‘Space Vietnam’, and Helldivers 2 was pretty much all that anyone was talking about for a month or two following its release. That’s the stuff that GOTY contenders are made of!</p>
<p><em>– Stefan L</em></p>
<h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth – Runner-up</h2>
<p>It’s a little wild to think that a remake of a game that’s more than two decades old could be hemmed in by technical limitations, but with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> leaving the PS4 behind and going all in on the current generation, that seems to have been the case. This middle chapter in the remake trilogy goes all in on having broad open areas that are stuffed with things to do, whether that’s fixing chocobo stops, settling in for a round of Fort Condor, or getting stuck in with some challenge battles to perfect your use of the subtle new tweaks in combat.</p>
<p>Of course, the real draw is still going to be the retelling of the JRPG classic’s story, which is handled masterfully well as it fleshes out the middle third of the tale, further exploring the cast of characters and additional backstory in ways that the original couldn’t. It’s a good thing there’s so much side content to help tide fans over until the series’ conclusion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/29/game-of-the-year-2024-best-xbox-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With Microsoft’s numerous acquisitions in the late 2010s, many expected a year like 2024 to come much sooner. As it is, the wash of good games and blend of first and second party exclusives has arrived seemingly just in time for the tech giant to completely upend its gaming strategy and pivot away from exclusives almost entirely.</p>
<p>It’s a shame in some ways, the old tribalism of console wars still having a certain appeal like sports fandom, but in the fullness of time, it’s probably better that you can play whatever you want, wherever you want.</p>

<p>From its first announcement through to release, there was no small amount of concern for what <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> would be like. MachineGames are best known for the Wolfenstein series where you mow down hundreds of Nazi goons at once, and less for the Uncharted-y style third person romps that were inspired so heavily by those original Indy films. Of course, the end result is pretty much nothing like either of these games.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own path, the largely first person view shifting the pacing of the game’s exploration and puzzles, the relative lack of guns pushing you more towards stealth and quick whip-assisted fisticuffs. It’s a thoroughly enjoyable adventure, and it also feels like Indiana Jones throughout, thanks to a solid rendition of the character by Troy Baker, and some excellently directed cutscenes that capture the madcap nature of the films.</p>

<p>This is a must for Xbox gamers today… and PlayStation gamers won’t have to wait too long to see for themselves.</p>
<h2>STALKER 2 – Runner-up</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2</a> on its own is a remarkable achievement in survival horror. The immersive worlds, tense inventory management, and realistically raw and brutal combat that made this series so iconic are back in full effect – the awkward glitches and bugs that accompanied those original entries in the franchise also see a return as well. There’s a charm in that blend of seriousness and clunkiness, though, and it’s endearing to be scared for your life wading through irradiated swamps only to see a pig ragdoll across the sky or an NPC to promise he’s got the best goods for sale only to offer you moldy bread and a rusted knife.</p>
<p>It’s a beautiful and unforgettable gaming experience, but the unprecedented dedication and perseverance of the Ukranian team behind the game deserve’s just as much recognition and admiration as the game itself.</p>
<p><em>– Miguel M</em></p>
<h2>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Asobo’s rebooted Microsoft Flight Simulator was an absolute marvel in 2020, and it only got better over time. Built around a computer-generated rendition of the whole world, smartly adapted from satellite and flyover imagery, it lacked some of that human touch to start with, which was gradually fed in over time with region-specific overhauls.</p>
<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, then, seeks to build more of a game on top of that framework. There’s a whole career to work your way through, which will introduce you to specific mission types like air search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, mountain rescue, commercial aviation and much, much more. There’s also new aircraft types, with gliders, airships and hot air balloons, and if you want (as it required for a number of photography missions), you can land your plane and go walk around. And again, that’s with MSFS 2024 featuring the entire world…</p>
<p>There’s some bugbears, though, and launch was plagued by server issues, no doubt partly related to the new fully dynamic download process that keeps the initial install as small as possible – the kinds of issues that make you thankful the 2020 game still exists! The future is bright for this one, though, and we’re keen to see what’s next from the team at Asobo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Indie games are thriving like never before. From innovative gameplay to stunning visuals, the indie scene is a treasure trove of creativity, with standout titles across every platform. This year, games like Animal Well, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Nine Sols, and UFO 50 captured our hearts and imaginations. Yet, even among such a stellar lineup, one game stood above the rest — not just as the best indie game, but as one of the year’s defining games overall. Say hello to Balatro, your 2024 indie game of the year.</p>



<p>In a poll on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>, Balatro emerged victorious, earning a commanding 72% of the votes. It outpaced contenders like Palworld, Harold Halibut, Animal Well, and UFO 50. And if you’ve played even a few hands of Balatro, the result should be no surprise.</p>



<h3 id="h-redefining-the-deck">Redefining the Deck</h3>



<p>At its base, Balatro is a poker game, but not as you know it. Developer <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LocalThunk</a> takes the familiar structure of poker and transforms it into something wildly original.</p>



<p>Players start with a traditional 52-card deck, but from there, the rules are upended. Instead of competing against other players, your goal is to hit specific target scores using creative strategies. The addition of Joker modifiers (special abilities that can alter the way cards behave) is a game changer. For example, modifiers might let you form straights by skipping numbers or treat hearts and diamonds as a single suit. These twists create an endless variety of deck-building possibilities, ensuring that no two runs are ever the same.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Balatro - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgrv9giaNO8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-high-stakes-endless-strategy">High Stakes, Endless Strategy</h3>



<p>The beauty of Balatro lies in its balance of simplicity and depth. Players must carefully manage their money and deck-building strategies to progress through the game’s eight antes. The Boss Blinds that present unique challenges to test your planning and adaptability, add an extra layer of complexity. Every decision feels meaningful, and one wrong move can spell the end of a run.</p>



<p>But that’s precisely what makes Balatro so addictive. It’s the perfect “just one more run” game, where every defeat only fuels your desire to improve and try again. Few games manage to capture this balance of challenge and replayability so effectively.</p>



<p>What makes Balatro truly special is how it reimagines a familiar concept and makes it feel entirely fresh.

<p>The Sports genre continues to tick along and produce annual entries. However, new sports IPs are constantly popping up, and legendary series’ are being revived. All of this happened in 2025, so let’s show you our Best Sports Game of 2024 winner and nominees.</p>



<p>Sports games are a genre that will never die. With so many sports and simulated interpretations of them, we’re guaranteed multiple releases each year. Plus, as most sports have annual seasons, it makes sense to see yearly iterations. I’m thinking of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-team-of-the-year-promo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC</a>, NBA 2K, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-25-was-the-best-selling-game-in-us-for-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden</a>, and a myriad of other popular franchises.</p>



<p>2024 featured a lot of these names, and our Best Sports Game of 2024 award winner came top of the league.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-sports-title-of-2024-winner-ea-fc-25">Best Sports Title of 2024 Winner — EA FC 25</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I can only imagine the greatness of this conversation. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>I feel it says a lot about the state of sports titles when EA FC 25 is the recipient of our Best Sports Game of 2024 award. EA’s latest soccer sim sequel isn’t bad by any means—and I’ve spent a couple of hundred hours with it already—but its lack of innovation is symptomatic of a genre that seems to thrive on the concept.</p>



<p>However, when it works, EA FC 25 is a fabulous addition to the long-running series. The 2024 iteration features the new FC IQ tactical system upgrades—which make a world of difference to your gameplay—and I’ve enjoyed the flexibility to mold my team and adapt to my ever-changing squad of players. </p>



<p>Also, Rush is a brand-new 5v5 game mode effectively replacing Volta’s ghost town. These matches are fast-paced, shorter, take place on smaller pitches, and encourage high-scoring games. Absent-minded teammates can detract from the experience, but it’s a great inclusion and something I hope EA builds on.</p>



<p>EA FC 25 features subtle tweaks across the board, and modes such as Pro Clubs have undergone their biggest changes in years. The main selling point for FC 25 is it plays a great game of soccer—the biggest (and best) sport on the planet. Yes, center-backs can somehow catch up to Mbappé&nbsp;with little effort, referees are card-happy, and certain shooting mechanics can be exploited—like every year—but I <em>always </em>want to play another match.</p>



<p>I feel other sports titles aren’t doing enough to make their presence known. For soccer alone, eFootball continues to be a shell of its former Pro Evolution Soccer self, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-ufl-achievements-trophies-list-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UFL</a> is the new kid on the block trying to make a name for itself. I’m hoping a sports game (old or new) brings 2025 to life and challenges the EA FC mantle.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-sports-games-of-2024-nominations">Best Sports Games of 2024 Nominations</h2>



<p>EA FC 25 hasn’t won by a landslide, don’t get this twisted. Other sports titles have more than adequately put their name in the hat. From improved follow-ups to returning legends, let’s check out the main contenders to the crown. </p>



<h3 id="h-wwe-2k24">WWE 2K24</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t go one-on-one with The Undertaker. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>WWE 2K24 feels like a series heading in the right direction. 2K22 was a welcome return after the 2K20 fiasco, and 2K23 was a step-up. Here, I feel WWE 2K24 is once again a gradual improvement over its predecessor, without being groundbreaking. The realism, presentation, and refined nature of the in-ring mechanics are as sumptuous as ever. However, a seriously lackluster Showcase Mode (for 40 Years of Wrestlemania, no less) and technical issues bring WWE 2K24 down, and the developer needs to address the same recurring drawbacks for it to earn a GOTY title match.</p>



<h3 id="h-ea-sports-college-football-25">EA Sports College Football 25</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Prestigious. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>A 2013 legal dispute halted the beloved <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-call-of-duty-release-college-football-25-is-still-the-best-selling-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports College Football</a> franchise quicker than a quarter-back running full-speed into an offensive tackle. It’s taken 11 years, but EA Sports College Football 25 has been a blessing for many who want an alternative to EA’s annual mire which is Madden. This is potentially the start of something beautiful. The College Football aesthetic is nailed down for every team and it features improved gameplay mechanics Madden could do with copying. However, its game modes aren’t the deepest, and it feels like EA was testing the waters with EA Sports College Football 25—a much-improved sequel could throw a flag on the field though.</p>



<h3 id="h-topspin-2k25">TopSpin 2K25</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A swift backhand to the sports genre. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>I had to do a double-take when I realized it’s been 13 years since I owned the last TopSpin game—2011’s TopSpin 4. I’m not sure why Tennis games haven’t been chased very hard over the years—given the popularity of the sport—but I’m glad 2K are now firing on all sports fronts—with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> on the way. I feel I can copy and paste many of the sentiments I did for the nominees. TopSpin offers great gameplay with its winning combination of punchy, racket-slapping shots and authentic tennis matches. But it’s rough around the edges in place: Stadiums and licensed players look great, but animations began to repeat frequently, and it needs a bit more depth in its content. Like EA Sports College Football 25, we’re glad to see it back, and hope it goes one better next time!</p>

			<p>Countless Nintendo Switch 2 rumors have circulated over the past couple of years, but none had nailed down the new console's launch date yet. A few hours ago, the Italian website UAGNA <a href="https://www.uagna.it/videogiochi/esclusiva-ecco-la-data-di-uscita-di-nintendo-switch-2-200465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the rumor that Nintendo Switch 2 accessories (first-party as well as third-party ones) will launch on the market on March 28. As such, they believe this to be the release date for the console, too.</p>
<p>To begin with, we must take this with a big grain of salt. That said, it's not completely out of the realm of possibility. In fact, last month, another rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed</a> to a January reveal and a subsequent late March debut for the console. Just a few days ago, we learned that the date for the announcement could be January 8, 2025.</p>
<p>It would be an accelerated timetable compared to the predecessor. The Switch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-review-gen-hat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on March 3, 2017, but it was first showcased by Nintendo on October 20, 2016. The console was then briefly demonstrated in December at Jimmy Fallon's show, while a proper press event, including the final release date, took place in January. If these rumors are true, Nintendo might be compressing everything into the January unveiling.</p>
<p>The console's specifications have long been shared by leaks and are unlikely to have changed since. Nintendo has once again partnered with NVIDIA, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choosing their Tegra 239 SoC</a>, which is a customized version of the Orin SoC originally announced in 2018. It will be powered by an eight-core CPU with 12x ARM Cortex-A78AE cores and a GPU based on the Ampere architecture featuring 2048 CUDA Cores. Support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction is believed to be included.</p>
<p>However, it seems that the Nintendo Switch 2 will only <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-4k-30-fps-only/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output at 4K resolution and 30 frames per second</a> when docked. If confirmed, this would undoubtedly be disappointing for a new console that debuts in 2025—rival consoles from Sony and Microsoft have supported not only 60 frames per second but now even up to 120 frames per second for years.</p>
<p>So far, analysts are bullish on the new hardware's sales prospects, believing that the new platform <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sell-17-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could sell 80 million units by 2028</a>. Of course, a lot will depend on the games. The long-awaited Metroid Prime 4 could be a cross-platform launch like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the Switch, but the new hardware (despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed backward compatibility</a>) will need some brand new titles to really gain traction.</p>

<p>When was the last time you came in first on Call of Duty: Warzone? You might win a match next year with a few worthwhile Warzone tips and tricks from someone who won a single round way back when the game was first released.</p>



<h2 id="h-open-your-parachute-early"><strong>Open Your Parachute Early</strong></h2>



<p>Most people carefully plan their drops with pinpoint accuracy. They know which building they’ll camp in and the route they’ll take into the zone once it appears. But you know better.</p>



<p><strong>Open your chute early</strong>. When you do, you pull your starting pistol. Did you know you can kill opposing players while they’re still floating down to the ground? Use these precious seconds in the air to down an enemy player, or at the very least, take some of their health away.</p>



<h2 id="h-spend-cash-early-spend-it-often"><strong>Spend Cash Early, Spend It Often</strong></h2>



<p>When you die, you wind up in the Gulgag. You’ll receive a single life in a 1v1 against another opponent there. If you die, you’re done. If you win, you resurrect and parachute down once more.</p>



<p>To avoid losing all of the money you earned up to this point, spend it early and often. You can buy a self-resurrect for $4500, which is invaluable to avoid the Gulag and remain in the match.</p>



<p>While playing in a party, any help you can provide to your team makes you invaluable, so spend the money to revive dead teammates!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-how-to-get-a-cleaver-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-cleaver-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Get a Cleaver in Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-avoid-the-gas"><strong>Avoid the Gas</strong></h2>



<p>Well, duh. This is a non-tip, you’re likely thinking. But wait, the gas in Call of Duty: Warzone is unlike the gas found in PUBG or Fortnite. In this battle royale, the gas is deadly. With the gas rapidly encroaching your position, you cannot hang around, waiting to unleash an ambush.</p>



<p>If you have a gas mask, your character will automatically put it on when inside the gas zone. But this process takes a long time. Use that limited time to find a better position—a gas-free position.</p>



<h2 id="h-grind-the-pre-game"><strong>Grind the Pre-Game</strong></h2>



<p>Many are content to sit around and wait for the actual battle royale to begin. They grab a drink, eat a snack, or check their social media.</p>



<p>During the pre-game, use those precious minutes to train your weapons. You earn XP before the match by getting kills, which unlocks perks, attachments, and skins.</p>

<p>What’s the end game of any role-playing game? It’s fashion, right? Many of us play RPGs and MMORPGs because we feel a deep connection to a character we built from the ground up. As that character progresses in level, becomes stronger, and finds better gear, a part of ourselves flows into said character. And upon reaching the end game, when you’re all-powerful, what then? Well, it’s time to learn how to transmog gear in <strong>Diablo 4</strong>!</p>



<h2 id="h-travel-to-kyovashad"><strong>Travel to Kyovashad</strong></h2>



<p>You can transmog your gear in Diablo 4 by traveling to the central city of Kyovashad. You’ll find a small inn directly to the north of the waypoint. On the top floor, the only room at the top of the landing that players can enter, is a bed and a cabinet. It’s here that you’ll transmog your equipment.</p>



<p>Once you activate the cabinet, you’ll find various options to customize your character better. You can alter your appearance by adding cosmetic items like the wolf pup backpack cosmetic from the beta or transmog your gear based on available cosmetics.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-earn-transmogs-in-diablo-4"><strong>How to Earn Transmogs in Diablo 4</strong></h2>



<p>If your selection of transmogs feels lackluster, it’s because you’ve been spending all your time raking in the gold instead of salvaging items.</p>



<p>By visiting the local blacksmith in any settlement, you can salvage unwanted gear and, occasionally, receive a new transmog. You can tell when you’ll earn a new cosmetic look based on the hammer-like icon over the item.</p>



<p>Of course, you’ll also be able to buy premium cosmetics through the in-game store. Those, however, can be pretty expensive. As we’ve seen since the Early Access launch, the store features quite the pricing scheme. A single outfit collection can cost up to $25!</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can buy the occasional single piece, like a shield cosmetic, for much less.</p>







<h2 id="h-saving-outfits-for-later-use"><strong>Saving Outfits for Later Use</strong></h2>



<p>Perhaps one of the most annoying aspects of a transmog system in RPGs is having to continually update your appearance after acquiring new gear. For some, it’s easier to wait until max level. Others, however—myself included—like to look like an absolute unit throughout the game.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in the transmog section, you’ll find ‘Ensembles.’ You start with a single ensemble slot and pay gold to unlock additional slots.</p>



<p>This feature allows players to quickly transmog an entire gear set to suit their style and appearance desires with one click.</p>
