<p>London's Trafalgar Square will play host to some interactive Nintendo-themed fun this September 21st when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a> arrive as part of the capital's <a href="https://japanmatsuri.com/">Japan Matsuri</a>, an annual celebration of Japanese culture in the UK.</p>
<p>Nintendo is encouraging any and all visitors to Japan Matsuri to bring along their phones and boot up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pikmin_bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a> to take part in a special in-app challenge. Once at Trafalgar Square, a special <em>walking mission</em> will be activated in your game (well, that IS what the game is all about, after all), with the reward of an in-app Gold Seedling that'll net you a (semi-)exclusive Decor Pikmin for all your real-world efforts.</p>
<p>This is the first year that Nintendo has had a Pikmin booth at the event, and it'll also (according to the press release), offer "a variety of special Decor Pikmin seedlings, including a Mario Hat Pikmin and the elusive Fortune Pikmin normally available only near shrines and temples in Japan, which can be collected in app by walking to predefined areas within Trafalgar Square."</p>
<p>As well as the main walking challenge within Pikmin Bloom, the stall itself will also have an AR photobooth, where you get to capture a photo and video with some Pikmin for a digital souvenir. Hooray!</p>
<p>For those taken with the idea, Pikmin Bloom is free to download from both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/pikmin-bloom/id1556357398">Apple App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pikmin&amp;pli=1">Google Play Store</a>, and leading into the London event from 9th-30th September, you can ‘Walk Together with Japan Matsuri’ in a Pikmin Bloom Party Walk in-game.</p>

<p>Oh, and before we go, the most important information! The Pikmin Bloom Special In-App Challenge will take place at the following place and time, so make sure to get to it if you want to take part:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location: London Trafalgar Square, North Terrace</strong></li>
<li><strong>Date: Sunday September 21st, 2025</strong></li>
<li><strong>Time: 10am – 8pm</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Will you be heading to London for Japan Matsuri? Make sure to let us know!</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-reveals-best-selling-playstation-games-of-all-time</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/circana-reveals-best-selling-playstation-games-of-all-time.1292748/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's the original PlayStation's 30th anniversary today (for the US release, at the very least), and US sales analysis firm Circana has compiled a list of the brand's best-selling games since 1995 by way of celebration.</p>

<p>As always, we have the ever-reliable Mat Piscatella to thank for sharing this data on social media platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lyftys4rhk2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, and the list he's compiled is an interesting one, although you probably won't be too surprised by a lot of the names you see.</p>

<p>Obviously, eternal moneyspinner&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</em>tops the chart; it is, after all, a release that spans three PlayStation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-ps5-and-xbox-series-details-revealed" rel="nofollow">generations</a>, and given the massive popularity of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>as a franchise (as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-has-sold-over-195-million-units-red-dead-redemption-2-at-61-million" rel="nofollow">previously-reported sales figures</a> for the game),&nbsp;<em>GTA V</em>'s presence probably won't shock you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-v-playstation-top-selling-games-30th-anniversary.jpg?itok=ndeqnTh8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-v-playstation-top-selling-games-30th-anniversary.jpg?itok=FsekQJV6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Surprise surprise,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</em>is PlayStation's best-selling game of all time.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Piscatella's data, there are no games from the original PlayStation era on the top 20 list, and only three were released on the PlayStation 2. Two of those are&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>titles as well, namely&nbsp;<em>San Andreas&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Vice City</em>, while the third is&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</em>.</p>

<p>All of the others are PlayStation 3 releases or later. In second place, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare" rel="nofollow">the 2019 version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, with third place going to&nbsp;another Rockstar game in the form of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/red-dead-redemption-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></a>.</p>

<p>Places four through six are occupied by&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>releases as well, and blocky sandbox hit&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft" rel="nofollow">Minecraft</a>&nbsp;</em>is in seventh. Rounding out the top ten are&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em>, then the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>San Andreas&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero III</em>.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that all of this is based on dollar sales; the unit sales column looks a little different, but there still aren't any original PlayStation games on it, and even fewer PS2 games appear on the unit sales list.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/red-dead-redemption-ii-playstation-top-selling-games.jpg?itok=ezPXSg0o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/red-dead-redemption-ii-playstation-top-selling-games.jpg?itok=i8S4iXog 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rockstar makes several appearances on Circana's PlayStation best-seller list.</figcaption></figure><p>It also happens to be the Sega Dreamcast's 26th birthday today, and to celebrate, Piscatella has compiled <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lyfu44xius2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a list</a> of that platform's top 20 best-selling games in the US as well.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, when it comes to dollar sales,<i>&nbsp;Sonic Adventure&nbsp;</i>doesn't top the chart (although it does top the unit sales list). That honor goes to&nbsp;<em>NFL 2K</em>, with successor&nbsp;<em>NFL 2K1&nbsp;</em>taking second place (followed by&nbsp;<em>Sonic Adventure</em>, naturally).</p>

<p>The Dreamcast may be dead, but many of the franchises on Piscatella's list, including&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shenmue-iii-enhanced-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shenmue</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo" rel="nofollow">even&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em></a>, are still around today. Both lists are well worth a look if you want to take a trip down memory (card) lane.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How much champagne do you charge to the company credit card when <em>GTA 6</em> mercifully shifts out of your release window? Which celebrity will star in <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>? And what game are <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s devs working on next? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>People are buzzing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/">about <em>Jump Space</em></a>, the sci-fi co-op adventure about blowing up spaceships with friends. It comes to Early Access next week and already has an impressive <a href="https://x.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1965398533546160523">post-launch roadmap</a> of updates lined up. How many more cool ship games will we get before<em> Starfield</em>‘s <a href="https://nitter.poast.org/StarfieldGame/status/1963980745728229522#m">next expansion arrives</a>?</p> <h2>It was a good day in the Sucker Punch offices when <em>GTA 6</em> delayed</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sony-ps5-state-of-play-1851786081"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a> is one of the biggest game releases of the fall, at least now that <em>GTA 6</em> has been delayed to May 2026. Creative director Nate Fox was asked about that moment in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffOTS1CkZVg">new rapid-fire interview with <em>MinnMax </em></a>(via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/that-was-a-great-day-ghost-of-yotei-studio-screative%20director%20Nate%20Fox"><em>VGC</em></a>). “When<em> GTA 6</em> was delayed, did the entire studio pop some champagne?” host Ben Hanson asked. “We’re all still hungover. Multi-month hangover,” Fox responded. “That was a great day.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-release-date-gta-6-collector-edition-1851777437"><em>Yotei</em>‘s October 2 release date</a> was announced before Rockstar revealed its delay, locking in its fate one way or the other. Fortune favors the bold. Now lots of games that were waiting to come out until 2026 to escape <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-aaaaa-silksong-next-gen-pc-devolver-digital-2000623190">the<em> GTA 6</em> gravity</a> well are faced with a new conundrum: get out ahead of it or come out later in the year and risk stumbling into a second <em>GTA 6</em> delay?</p> <h2 data-cy="article-headline"><em>Helldivers</em>&nbsp;studio’s next game will have a <em>Destiny</em>-style social hub</h2> <p>But what is it, exactly? Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani seemed to be speaking off the cuff when he responded to a fan in the game’s Discord who requested a place where <em>Helldivers 2</em> players can hang out in between drops. “It’s on the feature list for the next one,” Jorjani teased. What next one? <em>Helldivers</em> 3? Nope.</p>

 <p>“This was about our next game. Not <em>HD3</em>,” he added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nbmucr/comment/nd46h3l/">on Reddit</a>. Some fans are wondering if it’s a nod to the studio’s isometric fantasy multiplayer series <em>Magicka</em>. The studio has already confirmed that its next project, whatever it ends up being, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/15/helldivers-2-studios-next-game-will-be-free-from-playstation-partnership/">won’t be published by Sony</a>.</p> <h2>Fans think <em>GTA 6</em> parody website names have leaked</h2> <p>The open-world blockbuster is still over six months away, but in the meantime players may have some fresh teases to parse. What seem like in-game website names <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1002286-gta-vi-general-speculation-discussion-vice-city-baby/page/51/#comment-1072587065">appear to have been registered</a> as real internet domains by Take-Two back in May. They include what-up.app, rydeme.app, and wipeoutcornskin.com. I don’t know if we’re ready for <em>GTA 6</em> in the post-internet, algorithmic slop phase of lampooning pop culture.</p>

 <h2>Will Johnny Silverhand return in <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>?</h2> <p>Because Keanu Reeves would be happy to do it if CD Projekt Red wants him back. “Absolutely,” he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">told<em> IGN</em></a> when asked about reprising the role. “I’d love to play Johnny Silverhand again.” Effectively a virtual ghost in the first game, there’s no reason Silverhand would need to come back in a sequel, but also nothing precluding it either. <em>Cyberpunk 2</em> is set to return to Night City but <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-orion-night-new-city-chicago-cdpr-1851781566">also take players to a new location</a> likened to “Chicago gone wrong.”</p> <h2>Satoru Iwata laughed when he heard about trying to sell <em>Animal Crossing</em> in America</h2> <p>Veteran Nintendo localizer Leslie Swan <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west">told <em>Time Extension</em></a> that’s how the former president of the company reacted when she told him they were translating the cozy sim. “He just laughed and said, ‘I don’t know how you’re going to do this.’ And it’s true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan,” she said.</p> <p>Long-time producer Takashi Tezuka was not confident either. “[Tezuka] basically said to me, ‘We’d like to have you localize it’ and I said, ‘Sure.’ But then he said, ‘No, Leslie, I’m not sure you understand, it’s going to be difficult.'” Swan recalled. “And I kept having to assure him that we would make it happen.” Decades later, the franchise is now one of the best selling in the world.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031"><em>Silksong</em> is harder than <em>Hollow Knigh</em>t, but is that a problem?</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-memecoin-crypto-web3-2000624006">Tech is beyond parody: even <em>Black Mirror</em> is getting a meme coin</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-digifarm-hands-on-preview-2000624093"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> might be the best JRPG of the fall</a></p> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Lenovo Clears Out Its 4.8-Star Copilot AI Laptop (40GB RAM, 1TB SSD) at 73% Off, You Could Buy Several for the Price of One]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-clears-out-its-4-8-star-copilot-ai-laptop-40gb-ram-1tb-ssd-at-73-off-you-could-buy-several-for-the-price-of-one-2000624145</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-clears-out-its-4-8-star-copilot-ai-laptop-40gb-ram-1tb-ssd-at-73-off-you-could-buy-several-for-the-price-of-one.1292736/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re out there looking for a solid laptop that can handle basic, everyday tasks, then Lenovo is a manufacturer worth consideration. Maybe you’re a college student in need of something to build out documents and slideshow presentations for your classes. Maybe you’re a small business owner in need of something to, err, build out documents and slideshow presentations for your clients. Web browsing, email drafting, YouTube video watching. You know, computer stuff! Well, take a look at the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/">Right now, Amazon has it on sale for 73% off. It’s listed at $2,999 but after the discount, the price comes to just $800. That’s a savings of $2,200.</a></p>
<p>Okay, but let’s hold our horses for just a moment. A $2,200 discount on a $2,299 laptop? Sounds too good to be true. So yeah, if we take a look at this items price history, we’ll see this listing has only existed on Amazon since the beginning of August. After about two weeks it dropped to the price it’s at now. It briefly went back up when September hit, but now it’s back down to $800.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>When we take a look at the specs on offer here, you can tell this is not a three thousand dollar machine. Lenovo’s own website has various builds of the IdeaPad Slim 3 in this $600 to $800 range. This listing is trying to trick you into thinking you’re saving a lot more than you are. And that’s a shame because these specs at this price point is a pretty good deal in its own right.</p>
<h2>Deep Dive</h2>
<p>What we have here is a 15.3-inch laptop capable of displaying in 1920 by 1200 HD. The anti-glare non-touch display has 300nits of brightness and a refresh rate of 60Hz. With DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 1.4, you can display on two additional monitors (three displays total including the laptop screen).</p>



<p>It’s got a built-in webcam that can record in 720p HD with a shutter so you can maintain privacy when not in use. For added connectivity, you have two USB-A ports and one USB-C port to transfer data or charge your other devices. Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 are also supported.</p>
<p>The real story is its RAM and storage. <strong>It’s working with 40GB of memory and an SSD containing a full 1TB of storage space</strong>. Great for backing up photos and working with large file types like 4K video.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/">All and all, this Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 is a worthwhile laptop. At $2,999? Heck no. But at $800? Not bad.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

We've seen multiple publishers release collector's editions without games in recent years, as it allows players to pick the edition they want for any platform.</p><ul><li>8-inch Echo-4 statue with LED lights</li><li>17-inch polyester map of Kairos</li><li>Vault symbol necklace</li><li>4 double-sided lithograph art prints (8 x 10 inches)</li><li>Shift Code for 5 Golden Keys</li></ul></div>                      </div>   </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4514481-20022975.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4514481" data-ratio="0.60590277777778" data-width="1152" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4514481-20022975.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4514481"></a><figcaption>Borderlands 4 Collector's Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4514481-20022975.jpg"></figure><p>If you're interested in learning about the development of Borderlands 4 and its striking visuals, you may also want to check out the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-borderlands-4-in-this-new-art-book/1100-6531707/" data-ref-id="1100-6531707">The Art of Boderlands 4 art book</a> that launches October 7.

                <p>In 1998, the first Pokemon games made their way to America as Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue. Now, decades after the games were released, a Pokemon fan has discovered that they left Pokemon Blue unopened in their closet for decades, and it may be worth thousands.</p><p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1n60yut/found_my_old_sealed_pok%C3%A9mon_blue_for_gameboy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sausagenpeppers</a> recently shared a photo of their unopened Pokemon Blue (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-fan-discovers-rare-misprint-gameboy-title-in-their-closet-potentially-worth-thousands-of-dollars/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), which still has a K-B Toys price tag on it.</p><p>That would have been an exciting find of its own, but when Sausagenpeppers shared a pic of the other side of the box, it revealed that this is a rare misprint of Pokemon Blue that has Pokemon Red's text on the back of the box.</p><p>Misprints like this one are highly sought after in the Pokemon community, and this game may turn out to be worth thousands of dollars if Sausagenpeppers decides to sell it. Pokemon's most devoted fans have shown a willingness to pay a lot of money even for unofficial merch, like the Charizard-Shaped Cheeto aka <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/charizard-shaped-cheeto-is-up-for-auction-and-already-at-an-astounding-price/1100-6529658/" data-ref-id="1100-6529658">Cheetozard, which sold for $72,000 earlier this year</a>.

<figure><a title="Silksong - Sweat" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aabf7f18f0f77/silksong-sweat.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> was no pushover, but it's safe to say that its sequel is hitting a whole new level of difficulty.</p>
<p>You only need look on social media to see that some folks have been struggling with their journey through Pharloom. A few are even going so far as to say that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> is <a href="https://x.com/CreatorCreepy_/status/1963848634807492623">"way too difficult to be enjoyable"</a> or <a href="https://x.com/n8nja538/status/1964047646298869769">"harder for the sake of being harder"</a>. Team Cherry is well aware of players' struggles, with an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/hollow-knight-silksongs-upcoming-patch-will-nerf-the-difficulty-in-certain-areas">upcoming patch</a> looking to fine-tune the difficulty in key areas.</p>
<p>While we here at Nintendo Life are more or less in agreement that the game is significantly more taxing than its predecessor, we have varying thoughts on how this has affected our overall enjoyment so far (if at all).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rxhuow&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So with that in mind, let's see what Team NL thinks about Silksong's difficulty so far...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187623 @ 1757433831 -->
<h2>"a natural progression" (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<p>I'm perhaps not as far into the game as most of the rest of the gang here, but I do think that, without the difficulty where it's at (and it does feel fairly tough compared to the first one, getting started), Silksong would lose quite a bit of what makes it so special, and so uniquely engrossing.</p>
<p>I wouldn't like to see anything get any easier, especially for long-term fans who are back and wanting to be challenged more than last time. It's a natural progression, really. I can see how it's frustrating and rage-quit-inducing for some, too, but no more so than most other serious contenders in this genre. Indeed, my faves of late, stuff like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a> and whatnot, are easily just as hard as anything I've approached here thus far.</p>
<p>It can be a little annoying even to me at times, mind, with some boss runbacks in particular irritating me as I have to trek a little too far through enemies to get back at it after a death.</p>
<p>That's all part of the fun, though, with these intense, and intensely clever, platformers. What's the point of an uphill battle without a good hill or any proper battles? Something like that, innit. And when death is my fault 99.9% of the time, it's all good.</p>
<h2>"struggle and persistence" (Alex Olney, video producer)</h2>
<p>I mean, it's certainly no secret that the game is hard, it's expected given how tough the previous game was. What I think is most jarring for a lot of players who were familiar with the original is that you're most likely coming from end-game The Knight to basic early-game Hornet, which is a marked difference. A big part of the game's identity is struggle and persistence, and I think it would be a disservice to fans to dilute that.</p>
<p>Having said that, so many enemies dealing two damage in a hit does perhaps feel a bit cruel. But if you're efficient with your traps and all the extra moves at your disposal, you should find that if you could get through Hollow Knight, you can get through Silksong.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong Gameplay 01" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/70ad6c0935519/silksong-gameplay-01.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>"masks of damage" (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<p>I'm deep into Act 2 now, and I may have gotten a <em>little</em> mad at this game a few times. But on the whole? I'm loving the difficulty.</p>
<p>It ramps up much quicker than it did in Hollow Knight, but almost every single boss fight (so far) has felt incredibly well designed and extremely fun to fight that I'm rarely, truly annoyed with any single fight — more just at myself for making a silly mistake.</p>
<p>As Alex said, some enemies (and most bosses) do two masks of damage. But there are also numerous little traps and punishing little tricks that Team Cherry has tucked away — Pharloom is dangerous, and I'm constantly surprised by the horrors and laughs it brings me. I also think the game expects you to <em>know</em> Hollow Knight. Even the platforming is trickier early on.</p>
<p>But the real trick is, if you're struggling, just walk away and explore. It's a Metroidvania, and there are Quests to complete, Tools to discover and buy, and ways to upgrade your health. As the world opens up, your options expand and I've already chopped and changed my progress multiple times because I know something would be easier if I had a different Tool or Art.</p>
<p>So yes, Silksong is tough, and it may bring out my awful stubbornness and frustration, but it's incredibly rewarding.</p>
<h2>"a few expletives" (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<p>My time is often quite limited these days, so I have to admit that if a game is proving particularly taxing for me and I'm having to replay sections over and over, I'll sometimes put it down and do something else for a while. There's something about Silksong, however, that keeps me coming back for more.</p>
<p>It's definitely a lot more challenging than the first game. But it's all about learning patterns and recognising when might be the best opportunity to launch your attack. Once you've nailed that, then you're basically 99% of the way there. There have been a couple of moments where I've let out a few expletives at my inanimate electronic gaming device, mind you.</p>
<p>I expected Silksong to be difficult, and honestly, I'm quite glad it is. After such a long wait, I didn't want to just breeze through the game and forget about it after a single weekend. Team Cherry has crafted something that begs to be savoured, and if that means restarting from a bench every now and then, so be it.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong Gameplay 02" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b27ad33e0d525/silksong-gameplay-02.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>"the right equipment" (Felix Sanchez, video producer)</h2>
<p>Personally I feel the difficulty has been great 18 hours in. I don't know if it's because I've already played Hollow Knight, but I never feel I'm stuck because of a tough fight. Sure, I'm dying quite a lot in some places, but I eventually learn the patterns, and I also think choosing the right equipment has a lot to say.</p>
<p>The design of the bosses and their phases are honestly maybe my favourite in any game. I'm excited to see what the rest of the game has to offer, but as for now, it's absolutely perfect!</p>

			<p>When Rockstar announced that Grand Theft Auto VI would <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">no longer be launching in 2025 and was instead pushed back to 2026</a>, it was a disappointing day for plenty of players, even though we all got a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-2-breaks-all-time-24h-viewership-records-beating-deadpool-vs-wolverine/">nice trailer to pore over in the meantime</a>. A disappointing day for those hoping to play it as soon as possible though, was a day of celebration for developers across the industry planning to release a game in fall 2025, including for Ghost of Yotei developer, Sucker Punch. </p>



<p>In a recent rapid-fire interview with MinnMax, creative director at Sucker Punch, Nate Fox, was asked, "<em>When GTA VI was delayed into 2026, did the entire studio just like pop some champagne?," </em>to which Fox replied, "<em>We're all still hungover. Multi-month hangover. That was a great day," </em>with a sizeable smile on his face as he said it.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Ghost of Yotei might have avoided having to go toe-to-toe with Grand Theft Auto VI when its launch arrives this coming October, any games planning to launch in May 2026 won't be so lucky, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-very-high-conviction-grand-theft-auto-vi-wont-be-delayed-again-rockstar/">Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has a "<em>very, very, high</em>" conviction </a>that the game's release date won't be moved again.</p>



<p>Sucker Punch recently confirmed that Ghost of Yotei had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-already-gone-gold/">"<em>gone gold</em>"</a> ahead of its coming launch, and  PlayStation fans can look forward to its release on October 2, 2025.</p>

<p>In a new video shared a few days ago on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> commented on when support for the new version of the AMD upscaling tech is expected to hit the system, saying that it should come in the first quarter of 2026, together with or shortly after support for RDNA 3 GPUs, which may come as early as in the final months of 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Moore's Law is Dead proved reliable regarding PlayStation leaks in the past few months being the first to reveal the AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, we have to take what was revealed in the video above with a pinch of salt. Lead System Architect Mark Cerny confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr4-ps5-pro-2026-rdna5/">AMD FSR 4 support is indeed coming to PlayStation 5 Pro sometime in 2026</a>, however, so there's a very good chance that it is indeed coming in the first few months of the year as MLiD revealed.</p>



<p>While it is official that AMD FSR 4 is coming to PlayStation 5 Pro next year, very little is known about how the system will handle the upscaler and how games will benefit from some of its features, which include AI-powered super resolution and frame generation. Known AMD insider KeplerL2 revealed back in July that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-can-t-run-amd-fsr-4-ai-model/">the system is not capable of running the same model used on RDNA 4 GPUs</a>, as the console lacks FP8 support, meaning that some work will have to be done for the console to run the full version of the tech. In addition, it seems like existing games will have to be patched, as the current version of PSSR doesn't allow system-level DLL swaps.</p>



<p>Even without AMD FSR 4 and with the sometimes average implementation of the PSSR upscaler, the PlayStation 5 Pro is still a worthy purchase for demanding console games that want to experience PlayStation 5 games at the very best.

			<p>Dead Reset is the latest and 17th FMV game from Wales Interactive, a studio that has done just FMV titles, but it’s a well the studio draws from, more than it does from making more roguelike deckbuilders, survival FPS games, 2.5D auto-attack survival games, and VR titles, to name just a few of the ways the studio bounces around.</p>



<p>Not only is Dead Reset not the studio’s first time making an FMV game, but it’s also not the first time it’s done a horror-flavored FMV game. This is all to say that I have to believe Wales Interactive knows a thing or two about developing and executing on full-motion-video, or FMV, narratives. Or, that they’ve proven 16 times over now, they can make one successful enough to make another.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cole backs up against a desk while hiding from the creature</figcaption></figure>



<p>I haven’t played their other FMV games, but I can believe that what was learned from them is what informs the best parts of Dead Reset. It’s a tightly paced story with strong performances that keep you locked into playing to find out what happens next. Scenes are tense, emotionally charged, and there’s enough atmosphere created through strong lighting and sound choices to carry the parts that aren’t as strong, like the over-the-top gore and messy creature design that hams everything up, or how, even if the actors are doing their best with the writing, the words they're told to say make them sound like a bad caricature.</p>



<p>When I checked out the first chapter of Dead Reset in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-reset-hands-on-preview/">preview</a>, I came away disappointed, though that was mostly due to my own expectations not being met. I was hoping it would be more of a layered horror story, but it seemed more interested in trying to do a fun creature-feature to play through with a bowl of popcorn at your side. I’m all for that experience too, and when I had still only played the first chapter, I was hopeful Dead Reset would get better as it went along.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, now that I’ve seen every chapter multiple times, I feel let down again, knowing that Dead Reset doesn’t have the juice to be entertaining the whole way through.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cole chooses between admitting his déjà vu and not.</figcaption></figure>



<p>What I mean by ‘the whole way through’ is getting to each of the four endings, because otherwise you can mop it up in less than three hours, and feel totally fine with whatever version of the story you got (unless you got the worst one). Play through it just the once, and you’ll probably walk away perfectly whelmed and reasonably entertained. It’s when you ‘reset’ your experience that suddenly, the plot beats I liked the first time around didn’t hit as hard, even with a new context between each character as I tried to make different choices each time. It quickly started to feel more like checking scenes off for the sole purpose of saying you’ve seen them and whatever alternatives they offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some basics about Dead Reset. You play as Cole Mason, a former surgeon who can remember how to perform surgery, but not anything about what happened to him before a security guard named Slade picks him up and tosses him in front of a patient who has a ‘foreign mass’ in her lower abdomen. There are six core characters: Cole, Fearne, Weir, Cooper, Slade, and Magson.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption>Even in its earliest forms, the creature looks like a mess of bad looking prosthetics.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The mass is a creature that eats anything with a pulse and looks like someone made a mop out of intestines. It changes forms, but it unfortunately never really looks scary or even interesting, to be frank. In every form, it looks like a blob of flesh put together from the scrap pile of a prop studio’s prosthetics section. It’s even telling that you so rarely get a solid, long look at the creature, with most of the shots featuring it only showing a half-view, or a dimmed view while the lights only partially illuminate it. Almost like the production team knew it wasn’t worth highlighting.</p>



<figure><figcaption>You'll hear Cooper scream quite a bit depending on how many wrong turns you take.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While the creature isn’t interesting, what’s at least a little more fun to think about is the ability, or curse, depending on how you see it, that Cole bears. He's stuck in a time loop, with his starting point being determined by a power surge connected to a time machine chair that the Magson character has built, and his reset point being any time he dies. With each new power surge, his starting point moves forward in time, which is how you progress through the story.</p>



<p>There’s a menu that tracks how many of its 339 scenes you’ve witnessed, how many times you’ve died across all your playthroughs, how many of the endings you’ve found, and how many decisions you’ve made. There’s another that claims to track your relationships with the other characters, though it never seemed to give me any more information beyond who was still alive among the five characters you meet alongside Cole.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Dead Reset features plenty of scenes enhanced by its lighting and sound design choices.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s also a page that tracks different ‘tasks’ or objectives you can try to complete based on what paths you’ve taken. It’s all very bare bones and is only a little helpful for anyone wanting to do some achievement hunting.</p>



<p>Speaking of the choices you make, you can either have them countdown, or you can set it to 'Streamer Mode,' which pauses the action and lets you take however long you like to decide. Some of the choices, you realize, are meaningless. Plenty of them just pad out the experience so that Cole has the necessary information to move forward. Once you've played through to the end once, it's easy to spot which do and don't matter, another element that adds to the tedium of playing it a second, third, and fourth time to see all the endings.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cole, Fearne, and Slade all get the most screen time.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that there is a meta-layer of fun to be had for veteran horror fans. If you're someone who loves the horror genre, and has seen all of its sides from the most intense to the most laid-back, comedy-focused stories and everything in between, then you can have a good time doing what I did on my first playthrough. Basically, with every choice I ran through all the horror and narrative tropes the genre carries in my head, and decided based on what I've always believed characters in other horrors should have done, instead of making bad, emotional decisions. As if I had a '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HowItShouldHaveEnded">How It Should Have Ended</a>' storyboard running through my head in real-time for Dead Reset. It was fun, and more than a little funny, how often it worked. Randy Meeks would've probably mopped up the whole game without dying unnecessarily once.  </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ultimately, I'm walking away from my time with Dead Reset more disappointed than when I previewed it. At least then I had hope, because I hadn't played the full game. The naked truth of it is that despite good performances from the whole cast, some wonderful lighting and sound design work, well-paced scenes that kept the story moving with strong emotional beats at the wheel, it doesn't hold up on multiple replays. </p>



<p>It's not helped by the fact that when it's not dimly lit with the darkness of a secret research station (and even sometimes when it is), the set looks like it came out of a forgettable Doctor Who episode, while the creature looks like a mish-mash of rejected creature designs that came together the way it did because they ran out of time to do any better. The rest of its gore and prosthetic work subtract from the experience rather than add to it, cutting the intensity too much compared to how straight and serious the rest of the story is played. If there were more jokes made, then maybe it would've made sense. Instead, it just makes you laugh when you're supposed to be scared.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Dead Reset is worth experiencing for its performances, its tense atmosphere built on strong lighting and sound design choices, and well-paced story that makes you want to keep finding out what will happen next, but its entertainment value wanes after you've hit the credits. It's less enticing on replays or 'resets,' and its worst attributes don't help carry the experience beyond a single play through.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There was a time when a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>tie-in video game would have been a given. Netflix would have partnered with a studio to create a probably terrible game based on the K-pop group Huntr/x’s music-powered demon-slaying adventures that kids could rent at their local Blockbuster for the weekend after they saw and became obsessed with the movie. Nowadays, movie studios are much more precious about quality control, so we don’t get waves of tie-in video games haphazardly dropping on the eShop or PlayStation Store. And yeah, it’s probably a good thing we don’t have a </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>video game months after the musical blew up on Netflix, but I wouldn’t be surprised if someone at the streaming company has been considering throwing some money around to get one made. What such a game might look like down the line is anyone’s guess, but fans are already creating mock-ups of a </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>game, and I hope one day a studio gets to make one a reality.</span></p> <p><span>JHN Studios is a YouTube channel that creates 8-bit versions of K-pop songs, and while most of their videos are reimaginings of tunes by real-world groups, they are now working their way through the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>soundtrack. Each of these arrangements is accompanied by retro-style animated videos of a hypothetical </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>rhythm game that recreates the songs’ respective scenes from the movie. I’m obsessed with the excellent sprite work. I want the Rumi as a keychain or pin.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>The actual rhythm gameplay of these mock-ups isn’t that complex, but it does make for a good proof of concept. A rhythm game seems like the obvious choice for a </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>game, and the movie’s incredible tunes have already started worming their way into the mod scene for games like </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thatboygro/video/7529646402599718175"><i><span>Beat Saber</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vifalleniv/video/7543302663614598455"><i><span>Friday Night Funkin</span></i><span>’</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sleepiegoat/video/7528110760031997215"><i><span>Dead as Disco</span></i></a><span>. That being said, I also think the movie would be a natural fit for a retro-style beat-em-up like the projects coming out of Tribute Games, such as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-ex-netflix-tribute-games-anamanaguchi-1851783893"><i><span>Scott Pilgrim EX</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><i><span>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</span></i></a><span>. Give me a three-player co-op brawler that lets me and two friends smack around some demons while JHN Studios’ chip-tune arrangements play in the background.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>While a game is probably still a pie-in-the-sky dream for the moment, it does sound like Netflix fully intends to capitalize on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ success</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-theories-questions-netflix-2000620717"><span>a sequel</span></a><span>. </span></p>

<p>Daly's pro se legal representation in the case was notable for its use of several novel affirmative defenses, including arguments that Nintendo's "alleged copyrights are invalid," that Nintendo "does not have standing to bring suit," and that Nintendo "procured a contract [with Daly] through fraudulent means." For the record, the judgment in this case reasserts that Nintendo "owns valid copyrights in works protected by the TPMs, including Nintendo games and the Nintendo Switch operating system."</p>
<p>In addition to $2 million in damages, Daly is specifically barred from "obtaining, possessing, accessing, or using" any DRM circumvention device or hacked console, with or without the intent to sell it. The judgment also bars Daly from publishing or "linking to" any website with instructions for hacking consoles and from "reverse engineering" any Nintendo consoles or games. Control of Daly's ModdedHardware.com domain name will also be transferred to Nintendo.</p>
<p>Nintendo's latest legal victory comes years after a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/hacker-will-pay-nintendo-4-5-million-in-team-xecuter-plea-bargain/">$4.5 million plea deal with Gary "GaryOPA" Bowser</a>, one of the leaders behind Team Xecuter and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/nintendo-goes-to-court-to-stop-sale-of-new-switch-hacking-tech/">its SX line of Switch hacking devices</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Much of the focus of Battlefield 6 so far has been on the multiplayer element, so fans are eager to learn more about the campaign. EA Motive is developing the campaign, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-campaign-is-inspired-by-this-movie-and-tv-show/1100-6531514/" data-ref-id="1100-6531514">takes inspiration from the war movie Civil War and the Taylor Sheridan drama Lioness.</a></p><p>A Battlefield 6 trailer (above) spotlights the game's campaign, opening with the President of the US speaking to the American people about a "monstrous, unprovoked attack" and how "no country is safe." The trailer shows off a variety of locations around the world, including New York City.</p><p>Campos-Oriola <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-campaign-is-inspired-by-this-movie-and-tv-show/1100-6531514/" data-ref-id="1100-6531514">said</a> a guiding theme for the Battlefield 6 campaign is exploring the concept of "talented but ordinary people put in extraordinary situations."</p><p>"That creates a very interesting dynamic in terms of relationships with other people. These are elements we're looking to capture in the single player," the developer said.</p><p>EA Motive previously developed the 2023 Dead Space remake, and Ducharme said that game is "obviously very different" from Battlefield. However, the Ducharme said the idea was to explore the "curve of tension" of the "highs and the lows to keep players hooked."</p><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. While you can't play Battlefield 6 yet, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-battlefield-2042-patch-offers-battle-pass-tier-skipping-and-more/1100-6534550/" data-ref-id="1100-6534550">earn rewards for it by playing Battlefield 2042 right now</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Panzer Dragoon II Zwei: Remake&nbsp;</em>publisher Forever Entertainment has reassured fans that the game is still very much in development, and that a demo will be playable for attendees at this year's Tokyo Game Show.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ForeverEntert/status/1965340667414184266" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media</a>, the studio revealed that those who visit the Rainy Frog Games booth will be able to check out a demo version of the remake, which, much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/panzer-dragoon-remake-revealed-at-e3-2019-coming-to-switch-this-winter" rel="nofollow">the remake of the first game</a>, will sport "modern visuals and remastered music".</p>

<p>As for which platforms you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon II Zwei: Remake&nbsp;</em>on, Forever <a href="https://x.com/ForeverEntert/status/1965355010331709584" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> the game will be coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. The studio doesn't mention a native Switch 2 version, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-remake-original.jpg?itok=0hcjxnTU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-remake-original.jpg?itok=7JvsQYcb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Forever Entertainment also handled publishing for the original&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon: Remake</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Panzer Dragoon II Zwei: Remake&nbsp;</em>was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-two-panzer-dragoon-games-getting-remakes-starting-next-year" rel="nofollow">all the way back in late 2018</a>, along with a remake of its predecessor. That game was released in March 2020, but its sequel has been largely missing in action until now.</p>

<p>You'll be able to enjoy the remake either with the original controls or a new, updated control scheme, and you can also switch between the game's original soundtrack and its newly-arranged version, which was handled by legendary&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon Saga&nbsp;</em>composer Saori Kobayashi.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon II Zwei: Remake</em>'s re-emergence is bittersweet for me; I'm a massive&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon Saga&nbsp;</em>fan, so you can imagine that this news almost feels like one tantalizing step closer to a potential remake of that game.</p>

<p>A remake it would have to be, too, and a ground-up one at that; director Yukio Futatsugi has claimed that publisher Sega has lost the source code for&nbsp;<em>Saga</em>, thus making a remake based on the original code impossible.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> has received its first "major" free update, a continuation of the MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game's story following the revelations of Act 3. What revelations were these? Honestly, lads, I never made it that far. My character is presently a furry chunk of worm jerky, crammed into a half-built shack after accidentally encasing herself in the furniture, so I couldn't spill the beans even if I knew. But I can reveal there are "gruesome murders" to investigate from this point on, and further opportunities to dig up the misbegotten secrets of Arrakis. Here's a trailer.

Also: fresh looks! "Re-customize your character, discover new contracts, items, character hairstyles and tattoos, and dynamic encounters that breathe more life into the ever-shifting deserts of Dune," comments the press release. That last line about the ever-shifting deserts rings a little hollow in the wake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword Of The Sea</a>'s grainy tsunamis, admittedly, but you can't squash people with ornithopters in Sword Of The Sea, so let's call it even-stevens.
</p>
<p>
The update accompanies the launch of the paid Lost Harvest DLC, which comprises a standalone story. "Dig deep into the lore of Dune and you may recoil at what stares back," explains the press release. By gawd, it sounds Nietzschean down there! 
</p><p>
Abyssal ruminations aside, the DLC includes "the new Dune Man building pieces, new decorations, cosmetic armor sets and weapons, swatches, and the Thumper emote." All that and a new vehicle, the Treadwheel, this being a kind of doubled-up Penny Farthing with phat treads. It's got "unique animations and handling" but does not, the developers assure, confer any real advantages over the sandbike equivalent in the base game. Here's another trailer so you can watch the big wheely goof do its thing.

Dune: Awakening has fallen down the charts a bit since launch in June. In my case, I lost interest quickly once I clocked that I was playing a survival game, with all of the associated grubbing around for materials and a generic holo-template building system that felt like a massive waste of the Dune fiction. Brendy (RPS in peace) pounded his gavel thusly in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-review">Dune: Awakening review</a>: "The world of Dune is well-realised in multiplayer survival game format, offering a harsh planet of unintentional comedy, braindead NPCs, and plenty of grindy crafting."
</p>
<p>
Funcom are letting people play for free across September 11th-15th, which includes access to all the stuff in this week's update. There's a discount running thereafter, to lure in those who've developed an appetite for the sands. I'm not sure I'll be going back, but I'm interested to hear how you spice miners are getting on. There are two more paid DLCs with new areas and stories coming in the game's season pass.

              <p>Too many things in our life need to get plugged in. Our phones, watches, headphones — damn near everything that isn’t attached to us needs to be charged at the end of the day. And now that it’s gotten even more complicated that everything is moving away from USB-A to USB-C. Sure, USB-C is a better standard and can do a lot more, but now I’ve got a bunch of USB-A charging blocks that are worthless to me. It’s time for a singular solution. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/">Anker has its Prime Charger with a clock LCD display one sale for 35% off. Normally, it goes for $170, but for a limited time the price has shot down to just $110.</a> That’s a savings of $60.</p>
<p>Avoid having a ton of clutter and cables running everywhere at your desk or on your nightstand. The Anker Prime Charger has four USB-C ports and two USB-A ports so you can keep all your devices together and nearby when it’s time to charge them. USB-C i universally compatible so use the hub to charge your laptops whether they are Apple or PC, your phone whether its an iPhone, Galaxy, or something else. Charge your earbuds, tablets, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Anker Prime Charger is capable of a maximum output of 250W between its six different ports. Three of the four USB-C ports each support 100W individually. The first one is special, capable of an output of 140W. Over that one, you can charge your stuff super quickly. A 16-inch MacBook Pro can go from zero to 50% in just 25 minutes. It will be fully charge in just over an hour and a half.</p>
<h2>Tailor Your Charging With Smart Power Control</h2>
<p>The dial on the side of the hub can be used to adjust the charging priority for your various devices plugged in. You can choose between port priority mode, dual laptop mode, or low current mode. Or just select AI power mode to have it automatically adjust to what is optimal.</p>



<p>The front of the USB hub is equipped with a large 2.26-inch display which can showcase the time and date. This makes it a lovely addition to your nightstand or your desktop while working. When you devices are plugged into any of the front USB-C ports, the display will visualize its charging status with dynamic animation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/">For a limited time, the Anker Prime Charger for USB-C and USB-A charging has dropped in price by $60.</a> Get it now for just $110 before it goes back up.</p>

                <p>The gaming industry has been a forefront for technology since its early days, pushing the expectations of things like handheld computing, online communication, and of course, graphics. For the last seven years, ray tracing has been one of the bleeding-edge frontiers of graphics. But even as ray tracing-capable GPUs proliferate in consoles, PCs, and even handhelds, many gamers are still skeptical of the technology. So what's going on?</p><p dir="ltr">It's a complex question, and answering it requires considering a number of factors. Those include game development standards that make poor or almost invisible use of ray tracing; the fact that ray tracing is a still-nascent technology; shifts in gaming habits and preferences; and the timing of the introduction of ray-tracing graphics cards with regard to shifts in the economy.</p><p dir="ltr">Ray tracing is one of the oldest technologies in pre-rendered computer graphics, but is still in its infancy in real-time computer graphics. Real-time ray tracing uses simulated light bounces to light and render a game scene. This allows for an accurate rendering of lighting and shadows and detailed reflections that don't require a bunch of work by artists beforehand. Let's take a look at how ray tracing has played out in the gaming industry so far.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Are ray-tracing GPUs common?</h2><p dir="ltr">First, let's talk about where we can find ray tracing GPUs out in the real world. If gamers don't have access to ray-tracing capable hardware, publishers and developers wouldn't be interested in incorporating these features into the games they release.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who owns a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S console has some form of ray tracing available to them, and recent numbers show there are around at least 95 million of those systems in homes around the world (the PlayStation 5 has sold nearly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-reach-80-million-worldwide-in-latest-milestone/1100-6533755/">80 million consoles</a>, and estimates show the PS5 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-shipped-5x-number-of-xbox-series-x-s-consoles-in-past-3-months-analyst-says/1100-6523462/">outselling Xbox consoles</a> anywhere from 2:1 to 5:1). The Switch 2 is also capable of some ray tracing, though in a much more limited capacity than even the Xbox Series S, adding a new, growing install base to the total.</p><p dir="ltr">We also have the many gaming PCs and laptops out there, as well as gaming handhelds. The subset of those that run Steam help to provide some added numbers, thanks to the Steam Hardware Survey, which suggests that about 30% of responding users have graphics cards capable of ray-tracing.</p><p dir="ltr">What that all means is that there are a lot of game consoles and PCs out there that are capable of ray tracing. It's still a demanding technology, and still a fast-evolving one, but no longer qualifies as a niche technology available to a sliver of high-end users.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Are games designed with ray tracing in mind?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">There are many great showcases for real-time ray tracing in games that show how a game can take substantial advantage of the hardware, either designed from the ground up or, in the right cases, added in later. One of the earliest was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/minecraft-is-breathtaking-with-rtx-turned-on/2300-6452689/" data-ref-id="2300-6452689">optional RTX implementation</a> (non-Nvidia cards support ray tracing in Minecraft, but the original implementation was a joint marketing effort between Mojang and Nvidia), which is now carried on mostly by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-minecraft-mods/2900-5234/" data-ref-id="2900-5234">mods</a> like BetterRTX. Minecraft worked well thanks to its simple geometry and dynamic nature. Ray traced lighting completely changes the way Minecraft looks; if you're underground without a light, your surroundings are pitch black, while forests feel like dynamic, lively places.</p><p dir="ltr">When I interviewed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hidden-tech-that-makes-assassins-creed-shadows-feel-more-alive-and-not-require-2tb/1100-6532659/">technical director Nicolas Lopez</a>, he demonstrated how ray tracing is accelerating development and adding meaningful features that gamers can see. For example, Shadows' dynamic lighting helped the team enable four distinct seasons and a variety of weather conditions in the game without having to completely rethink and re-light the world. This gave gamers a significantly more varied game and allowed the developers to direct their effort toward making a more interesting game world.</p><p dir="ltr">Other games make simpler--meaning they're easy to spot, but don't change the way you play the game--but still effective use of the tech. Some examples include the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-spider-man/" data-ref-id="5000-455396">Spider-Man</a> games and Remedy's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/control/" data-ref-id="5000-483417">Control</a>, which both feature many big, flat panes of glass. All you have to do is walk past, smash through, or climb over a sheet of glass to see an accurate reflection appear and disappear; this was impossible without clever tricks before real-time ray tracing became available. Another Remedy game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-547391">Alan Wake 2</a>, uses ray tracing to dynamically bounce light in dark, foliage-dense, flashlight-lit scenes; both the flashlight beam and the foliage the beam reflects off of are in motion, making ray tracing a solution that improves the realism of the scene and reduces developer workload.</p><p dir="ltr">Some games, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, are built to incorporate a certain amount of ray tracing, and ray-tracing hardware is required to play them on PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Many more games, however, make a poor case for the technology. In my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-says-real-time-path-tracing-is-on-the-horizon-but-what-is-it/1100-6502837/">primer on ray and path-tracing technology</a>, I go into more depth about this, so make sure to check that out if you're curious. But the short version is that a huge number of games, especially AAA games, don't have a lot of moving parts. Linear games, like first-person shooter campaigns, are more or less theme-park rides waiting for you to trigger animations and enemy reactions, set in a static world. Open-world games have a higher frequency of dynamic moving objects, but their environments are still mostly static, and even their day-night cycles are free from complications like seasonal changes and weather fluctuations.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a world where ray tracing could add real fun to a multiplayer shooter: using reflectivity and shadow to help you spot or hide from enemies, for example. But as it is, these shooters are a poor fit for ray tracing, as it impacts performance but offers little visible benefit if you aren't pixel peeping. Shadows will be somewhat sharper, somewhat more accurate, and reflective things will show more accurate reflections, but many players will be more interested in the game running smoothly than enjoying those cosmetic differences.</p><p dir="ltr">That means that in many of those games, spotting the effects of ray tracing requires active investigation on the part of the player. It's all but invisible when you're not taking a magnifying glass to every surface. On the other hand, regardless of whether the world is well-suited to ray tracing, its simple presence can be a huge performance hit to a game, just to make something like fences look <em>slightly</em> more "fence-y." If those are the types of games you play, it's no surprise that ray tracing might feel like a poor trade-off. Competitive multiplayer games like Call of Duty, Dota 2, and Fortnite are the most popular PC games around right now, and many players tend to prefer turning the graphics down in favor of a higher framerate. And let's not forget the demographic of gamers who prefer smaller indie releases to bigger, more technically complex ones--for many of those gamers, GPU power, let alone ray-tracing capability, is a factor.</p><p dir="ltr">To wit, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/battlefield-6-says-no-to-ray-tracing-now-and-in-the-near-future-dev-says-decision-made-to-focus-on-making-sure-it-was-performance-for-everyone-else" rel="nofollow ">won't have ray tracing anytime soon</a>, according to Christian Buhl, technical director on the game. Battlefield games have a reputation for poor launches at this point, so anything the team can do to make sure the game is as performant as possible at launch makes sense, and ray tracing in a game like Battlefield is simply an extra right now.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Ray tracing isn't mature just yet (and gamers can tell)</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">As mentioned before, real-time ray tracing is still a relatively nascent technology, having been out of reach until shortcuts and specialized hardware were available to lighten the substantial computational load required. The ray tracing we have in GPUs these days is still pretty computationally expensive, and requires so much visual clean-up (real-time ray tracing is very noisy) that upscaling and upsampling, done by services like Nvidia's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidias-dlss-4-promises-big-performance-gains-for-both-new-and-old-hardware/1100-6528680/" data-ref-id="1100-6528680">DLSS</a> (Deep Learning Super-Sampling) and AMD's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amds-new-radeon-9-9070-series-graphics-cards-launch-soon-support-fsr4-upscaling/1100-6528656/" data-ref-id="1100-6528656">FSR</a> (FidelityFX Super Resolution), are needed to make it look good.</p><p dir="ltr">So there's a lot of room to grow in both increasing the capacity for ray-tracing hardware and optimizing the algorithms that do it. For each game that releases with ray tracing features, we see performance comparisons pop up on places like Reddit and YouTube, and these always make note of the performance hit of enabling ray tracing. For many gamers, that makes it a wait-and-see technology, a curiosity and little else, until it matures.</p><p dir="ltr">Further, the simple fact that it all but requires upscaling and upsampling can make it unappealing to some gamers. It's not hard to find people in the comments section of videos about ray tracing and DLSS arguing that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/xo7dwj/isnt_dlss_just_nvidia_making_their_hardware/" rel="nofollow ">upscaling an image is a cheat</a>, and that an image should be a one-to-one pixel rendering of the original image. This is especially apparent on consoles. Instead of flipping a bunch of little switches to tweak performance, gamers are offered a simple choice: Quality or Performance--a higher-quality, often lower-resolution image, or a clean image with a higher, steadier frame rate. This feature preceded ray tracing but is generally how developers address support on consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">The continued strength of the Nintendo Switch and the growing market of handheld gaming PCs both affect perception, too; handheld fans want games that can run on their handhelds, and thus won't want features that could make the game unplayable. While the Nintendo Switch 2 and some handheld gaming PCs are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-support-dlss-upscaling-and-hardware-ray-tracing-nintendo-confirms/1100-6530613/" data-ref-id="1100-6530613">capable of some ray tracing</a>, it remains to be seen how frequently these features will be used on devices where users are conscious of battery life. With that said, though, some teams are starting to explore the possibilities; Digital Foundry called Star Wars Outlaws a "ray-traced revelation" in a recent video. It could be a strong feature for the system moving forward.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Bad timing</h2><p dir="ltr">We also can't underestimate the effects of economics on the availability and perception of ray tracing. GPU prices have been anything but stable throughout the last seven years. The first spike arrived alongside (though not because of) ray-tracing cards; Nvidia's RTX 2000-series cards were released in the third quarter of 2018, as the crypto boom was just beginning to wane, which spiked GPU prices. Things stabilized between 2019 and 2020, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/graphics-cards-are-all-set-to-become-more-expensive-very-soon/1100-6485940/" data-ref-id="1100-6485940">another period of instability</a> would kick off with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p dir="ltr">A new round of GPUs, increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrency, supply-chain constraints, and increased demand resulting from a pandemic-fueled round of PC upgrading, all contributed to the price spiking a second time in 2020. Now, as we head further into an era marked by President Donald Trump's unpredictable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-price-hikes-announced-for-the-us-every-system-going-up-by-50/1100-6534127/" data-ref-id="1100-6534127">tariff implementation</a>, another price spike is all but inevitable. We'll see GPU prices affected by availability and production cost.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, inflation has generally pushed the cost of everything upward during this period, with high-end cards among those prices increases. That means that staying on the cutting edge of gaming hardware is getting more and more difficult, which puts some of the most appealing features of games out of reach for many gamers.</p><h2 dir="ltr">New GPU feature unlocked</h2><p dir="ltr">Ray tracing (and its constant companion, upscaling solutions like DLSS) is not the first new graphics feature Nvidia specifically has pushed into the marketplace. Back in 2001, Nvidia launched the GeForce 3 GPU--the first card to use <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/01/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shaders</a>. It's too wide a topic to get into here, but shaders are an integral part of real-time graphics rendering and assist the rendering of the overwhelming majority of games in a variety of ways. Nvidia wants to repeat that with ray tracing and upscaling, making them so common that game developers will want to utilize them in as many games as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Ray tracing isn't going away, but it still has a few hurdles to overcome at all levels. First and foremost, game development has to change. Games like Assassin's Creed Shadows are finding novel and useful ways to implement it, and developers are learning to incorporate it into the game design process, but even after seven years, it's still relatively early days.</p><p dir="ltr">Cards capable of handling significant ray tracing also need to proliferate. A lot of PC players have ray tracing-capable hardware, but that is by no means everybody. Nvidia RTX cards may make up about 30% of Steam's survey respondents, but the most common card among those users is the RTX 3060, which is now five years old. That's hindered by the rising costs of PC hardware, especially GPUs, and the resulting slowdown in upgrades that comes with that.</p><p dir="ltr">We're nearing the point where penetration of ray tracing-capable GPUs is starting to hit critical mass, but we're not quite there yet. As game development advances and as people are able to update their hardware, ray tracing will become more feasible as a must-have feature and as one that makes a significant difference to gamers. Until then, gamers will continue to be reticent about ray tracing in video games.</p>

            <p>Japanese racehorse Haru Urara, who inspired a character of the same name in popular gacha game Umamusume: Pretty Derby, has passed away.</p>
<p>Haru Urara was 29 when she passed. In human years, she would have been around 90 years of age. According to Japanese outlet <a href="https://friday.kodansha.co.jp/article/438213">Friday Digital</a>, the cause of Haru Urara's death was colic.</p>

<p>"It is with heavy hearts that we share that Haru Urara passed away," the official X account for Umamusume: Pretty Derby wrote today, calling her a "legendary" racehorse despite her not having a particularly strong track record. In fact, she never won a single race.</p>
<p>"We share our condolences to all the staff involved in Haru Urara's care," the Umamusume: Pretty Derby account said.</p>
<p>Haru Urara was a fan-favourite in Umamusume: Pretty Derby. As our Connor reported earlier this year, Uma Musume: Pretty Derby fans recently came out en masse to send <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/so-why-exactly-are-uma-musume-pretty-derby-players-are-sending-massive-amounts-of-grass-to-a-retired-japanese-race-horse">packages of delicious ryegrass to the real-life inspiration of their favourite horse from the game</a>.</p> <div>

			<p>Hollow Knight Silksong is finally out and available for anyone who wants it across all major console platforms and PC, and after years of working on it to get it ready for release, Team Cherry has officially moved to working on it post-release. Earlier today, the studio <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/">debuted</a> the patch notes for Hollow Knight Silksong's first update, which mainly fix plenty of bugs and progression issues, but also include balancing fixes for players struggling in the early game.</p>



<p>The new update will be out "<em>mid next week</em>" according to Team Cherry, though if you're playing on PC you can access the update right now through the public beta branch on Steam and GOG.</p>



<p>Some of the bug fixes address a few early progression blockers, as well as late game issues that stop players from accessing elements of the game that should be available to them, but the significant additions for players just getting into Hollow Knight Silksong are the balance tweaks to the game's first two bosses.</p>



<p>"<em>Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter</em>," the patch notes read, along with a "<em>reduction in damage from Sandcarvers</em>," a "<em>slight reduction in mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices</em>," a "<em>slight increase in rosary rewards from relics and psalm cylinders</em>," and an <em>"increase in rosary rewards for courier deliveries</em>."</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong has already surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">5 million players</a> since it launched just five days ago at the time of this writing. It's easily one of the biggest indie games of 2025, and a game of the year contender in the eyes of many who've already checked it out.</p>



<p>If you are having a frustrating time with Silksong, but don't exactly want to directly tone down the difficulty, there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-mods-enjoyable-challenge/">mods already available that add a level of fun to the game</a> without breaking its challenge. </p>
