<p>Following an intense knockout stage that has unravelled over two weeks, the grand finalists have been revealed in the League of Legends World Championship 2024. For the trophy, and the $445,000 grand prize, <strong>Bilibili and T1</strong> will face off on November 2, live in London at the O2 Arena.</p>



<p>This could be the ultimate opportunity for Faker to secure his <strong>fifth </strong>world championship title, forever cementing him as one of the greatest esports competitors of all time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-heavy-is-the-crown">Heavy is the Crown</h2>



<p>It has been one hell of a journey to get this far. This year’s League of Legends World Championship event started on September 25, and there’s still just under a week until it’s all wrapped up. When that day comes, either Bilibili Gaming will have claimed its first LoL Worlds trophy, or T1 will have secured its <strong>fifth </strong>championship.</p>



<p>The last barrier for T1 to get this far was Gen.G, and social media managers were quick to promote the contest between T1’s Faker and Gen.G’s Chovy.</p>



<p>In the numbers, Faker and Chovy are putting out similar win-loss records, and their head-to-head figures over the years have ebbed and flowed dramatically. This year, Chovy was proving to be a thorn in Faker’s side, but when it counted most, Faker was able to gut up and push Chovy and his team out of League Worlds.</p>



<p>In 2022, the pair competed side-by-side during the Asian Games.</p>



<p>Now, all that stands between Faker, T1, and a fifth world championship trophy is Bilibili, an organisation that’s yet to secure a T2 finish at Worlds. Not one member of the all-Chinese team has claimed a League Worlds trophy yet, and despite a lacklustre Swiss Stage, Bilibili has recouped some momentum and stormed through the Knockout Stage.</p>



<p>One series is all it’ll take to decide this year’s champion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-ksv-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The KSV is a meta SMG in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> and gives great results in close-range combat. The best thing about this gun is it’s available early in the game. You can get started with it and tweak the loadout from there on.</p>



<p>However, to get the most out of the weapon, here’s the best KSV loadout in BO6 with the right set of attachments, Perks, and Equipment.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-ksv-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-ksv">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-ksv">Best Secondary for KSV</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-ksv-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock KSV in Black Ops 6</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-ksv-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the KSV any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-ksv-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-ksv-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best KSV loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Infiltrator Stock</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Flip Mag</li>
</ul>



<p>Starting with the <strong>Suppressor</strong>, this attachment not only suppresses the firing sounds but also hides you from the mini-map. It unlocks at level 2 which is very easy to do.</p>



<p><strong>Long Barrel</strong> increases the firepower of the SMG by increasing the damage range. It unlocks when the KSV reaches level 3 and helps deal with more damage in medium-range combat. Right after this one, the <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> will unlock at level 6, attach it immediately. This attachment significantly increases the Aim Down Sight speed of the gun and helps you aim faster, enhancing its handling.</p>



<p>The <strong>Infiltrator Stock</strong> unlocks at level 8 and will improve your mobility by enhancing the Aim Walking Movement Speed. Lastly, get the <strong>Flip Mag</strong> after reaching weapon level 17 to improve the reload speed of the KSV.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-ksv">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for KSV</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Tracker</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Cold-Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Tactical Insertion</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Ghost</strong> leaves you undetected by Scout Pulse or UAV and <strong>Tracker</strong> allows you to see enemy footsteps. Use <strong>Cold-Blooded</strong> as the third Perk to remain undetected under thermal optics. These perks will activate Recon – the ability to see enemies through walls briefly.</p>



<p>Use the fourth Perk slot to equip <strong>Gung-Ho</strong>. This will increase Sprinting speeds while reloading or using Equipment. <strong>Semtex</strong> will add more firepower to the loadout while <strong>Stim Shot</strong> will help you heal up quickly. For the Field Upgrade, use the <strong>Tactical Insertion</strong> for custom spawn points in the map.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-ksv">Best Secondary for KSV</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon options for the KSV are Stryder .22 and GS45.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-ksv-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock KSV in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the KSV after reaching player level 7 in Black Ops 6. You don’t need to wait too long for this weapon as only a few multiplayer matches would unlock the weapon and you can start grinding from there on.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-ksv-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the KSV any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, at the time of writing, the KSV is one of the meta weapons in BO6. Although it comes with a high recoil, controlling it is easy and on the positive side, you get a fast TTK and high mobility with it – two crucial aspects for intense multiplayer lobbies.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-ksv-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the KSV in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-jackal-pdw-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackal PDW</a> is easily one of the best alternatives to the KSV. However, if you want to try something different, a weapon that’s slower but hits hard, give the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-tanto-22-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanto .22</a> a try.</p>

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast">Outlast</a> Trials developer Red Barrels has shared an updated roadmap following a <a href="https://redbarrelsgames.com/news/an-important-message-from-the-red-barrels-team/">"cyber incident"</a> that caused a "significant "hit" on production. It confirms a new lobby game, a fresh MK-Challenge, and a new Geister event are all on the way.</p>
<p>The team said it was "working hard" to deliver "fresh content" to keep Murkoff fans happy throughout the holidays, but stopped short of sharing a definitive release date for the second major update to the chaotic cooperative horror. The last one dropped in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-newest-villain-is-a-freakish-big-baby-obsessed-with-his-pacifier">introducing new enemy Franco "II Bambino" Barbi</a>.</p>

<p>To tide us over, Red Barrels says The Outlast Trials Geister event will once again come to the Sinyala facility later this week - expect a "new unexpected twist!" - whilst Season 2's new map, catalogue, MK-Challenges, Rig, enemy NPC, and storylines will follow, along with a new festive event, Winter Kills.</p>

</span></p><p>"Following the recent cyber incident, our team has been focused on developing Season 2, the new features that will come with it, as well as some new aspects of the game coming next year," the team explained.</p>
<p>"We genuinely appreciate our community's patience and understanding during this challenging time. We’re working hard to deliver fresh content for everyone to enjoy throughout the holidays!"</p>
<p>Red Barrels says the security issue it encountered earlier this month has been investigated, and the exploit "contained". It says no players' data has been impacted by the event, but acknowledged that its internal IT systems were compromised and a third-party had accessed "some of its data".</p><p>"The Outlast Trials is excessive and frantically enjoyable - but can occasionally tip over into frustration more than fear," I wrote when I reviewed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-review-a-unique-obscene-spin-on-the-horror-staple">The Outlast Trials</a> back when it was released in early access last year, awarding it three out of five stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dont Nod's studio creative director has hit out at "hateful" comments about Deck Nine's take on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> franchise.</p>
<p>Talking on X/Twitter, Michel Koch said that whilst he hadn't played the game yet and "have no idea where [Deck Nine] are taking the story", "nothing justifies hating on people".</p>

<p>"I didn't play the game yet, and I have no idea where they are taking the story. But what I know is that nothing justifies hating on people for how they wrote their game!</p>
<p>"You can be disappointed, you can want other narratives for those characters you love, or different stories… but ultimately creation is hard and very subjective and if [Double Exposure's] story does not please you, it does not erase what you imagined."</p>
<p>When challenged by someone insisting it should be okay for players to feedback "healthy criticism", Koch agreed that whilst "constructive criticism and civil disagreement is good", he was specifically "talking of violent messages and harassment I've seen".</p>

<p>Wonder Weapons are bonafide difference makers in Black Ops 6 Zombies—and most installments of game mode. Some classic Wonder Weapons return, but there is also some fresh blood added to the mix, making for both a familiar and refreshing Zombies experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has a fun and fresh Campaign, another exhilarating multiplayer marathon to embark on, and the return of Zombies. It’s proper Zombies though: Round-based, Easter Eggs, different maps, and Wonder Weapons.</p>



<p>As usual, Wonder Weapons are quite hard to get in Black Ops 6. But when you get one, the feeling is unmatched, and they’re well worth trying to track down.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-wonder-weapons-are-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How many Wonder Weapons are in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Zombies currently has <strong>four Wonder Weapons</strong>: The Ray Gun, Beamsmasher, Thrustodyne Model 23 AKA Jet Gun, and the Wunderwaffe DG-2.</p>



<p>You might recognize the Ray Gun, Thrustodyne Model 23, and Wunderwaffe, but give a warm, undead welcome to the <strong>Beamsmasher</strong>—a new, mega-powerful weapon of mass destruction.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-wonder-weapon-in-black-ops-6">Every Wonder Weapon in Black Ops 6</h2>



<h3 id="h-ray-gun">Ray Gun</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hello, old friend. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Ray Gun is surely bound for the gaming Hall of Fame as it’s one of the best weapons in history. Its design is iconic, and the engineering is likely complex, but the end result is a satisfying, striking, nuclear bolt of deadly energy. It’s akin to classic alien death rays from B-movies of a bygone era, but it still works in 2024—trying to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-ray-gun-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get a Ray Gun in Black Ops 6 Zombies</a> is as tough as ever though.</p>



<h3 id="h-beamsmasher">Beamsmasher</h3>



<figure><figcaption>No-nonsense death beam. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>As far as I’m aware, the Beamsmasher can only be obtained on the Terminus Zombies map—so bear this in mind when you’re trying to obtain one. Other than this, there’s not much else to say about the Beamsmasher that the above screenshot doesn’t already tell you about the new toy. It fires a single, devastating, zombie-eviscerating beam and is great for concentrating on bringing down Elite Zombies.</p>



<h3 id="h-thrustodyne-model-23-jet-gun">Thrustodyne Model 23 / Jet Gun</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It’s obnoxiously big, and I love it. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I would say “Thrustodyne Model 23” doesn’t quite roll off the tongue like “Jet Gun” does—so I’m going to refer to it as the latter. The Jet Gun gives off an evil cartoon vibe (you can’t tell me those dials aren’t deliberately evil-looking eyes) and it’s making its first appearance since its debut in Black Ops 2. It sucks up Zombies and recycles them into a fine paste—and I feel it delights in doing so. </p>



<h3 id="h-wunderwaffe-dg-2">Wunderwaffe DG-2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A classic returns. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, another legendary Wonder Weapon comes back with a vengeance, and it’s none other than the Wunderwaffe DG-2. Apart from the Ray Gun, the Wunderwaffe DG-2 has featured about as much as any Wonder Weapon down the years, and Black Ops 6 is very accommodating.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-wonder-weapon-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to get Wonder Weapon in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>There are various ways to get Wonder Weapons in Black Ops 6 Zombies: Get lucky with the <strong>Mystery Box</strong>, get them as loot from <strong>Armory Lockers or Safety Deposit Boxes</strong>, use <strong>Legendary Gobblegums</strong> for lucrative rolls, and you can also <strong>craft the Beamsmasher</strong>.</p>



<p>Using 950 Points on the Mystery Box is the easiest way to get a Wonder Weapon—and the odds increase the higher the round count you reach—in Black Ops 6 Zombies. You can also secure Loot Keys from Elite Enemies and open Lockers and Safety Deposit Boxes to see if they contain a Wonder Weapon.</p>



<p>Furthermore, certain Gobblegums can reroll Mystery Box drops—the Wonderbar! Gobblegum guarantees a Wonder Weapon—and the Beamsmasher can be crafted.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4s-creator-explains-what-makes-a-good-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Video game remakes are everywhere these days. We’ve just had a new version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review">Silent Hill 2</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy</a> is in full swing, and a recreation of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview">Metal Gear Solid 3</a> is on the horizon. But few people know remakes quite as well as Shinji Mikami. The co-creator of Resident Evil has watched teams craft highly-successful recreations of his own games, and back in 2001 even helmed the remake of the first project he ever headed up - making him the director of both Resident Evil <em>and </em>Resident Evil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, if there’s anyone who knows what makes a good remake, it’s Shinji Mikami. “I think the comprehensive and fundamental understanding of what it was that made the original work in the first place is probably the most important point of a good remake,” he tells me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Everything from the ground up, basically,” he explains. “There's a few examples of that with certain series that Capcom has put out.” He is, of course, talking about the recent run of Resident Evil remakes, the most recent of which is the almost universally-celebrated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-review">Resident Evil 4</a>. Mikami has played it and offers glowing praise for the team at Capcom. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I thought that it was really well-made,” he says. He’s particularly impressed by how the remake handles the more nuanced details of combat, such as the timing between aiming and shooting, which in the original was finely balanced to ensure mounting pressure and tension. “I thought that they showed a really good understanding of that element,” he tells me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Another thing I thought was really well done was the way they took the half-assed scenario that I just wrote up in two weeks and really built up on that and really fleshed it out,” he adds. “They showed that they really understood the characters and their interactions. They showed a good understanding of the backbone of each character. And they took not just the scenario itself, but even the dialogue, and they improved all that stuff so that was really great.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The comprehensive and fundamental understanding of what made the original work in the first place is probably the most important point of a good remake.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My conversation with Mikami was part of his promotional work for Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered, a spruced-up version of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/21/shadows-of-the-damned-review">cult classic he produced back in 2011</a> (amusingly, Mikami notes that “I personally don't really have any interest in remasters” during the chat, so a passion project to revive Shadows this isn’t). We were also joined by Goichi Suda (AKA Suda51), Shadows of the Damned’s writer and CEO of developer Grasshopper Manufacture. Suda has more interest in remasters than Mikami; alongside this new version of Shadows, Grasshopper has also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-the-first-13-minutes-of-gameplay-4k-60fps">remastered Lollipop Chainsaw this year</a>, and had previously restored No More Heroes and Killer7 for modern platforms. But Suda varies his approach when returning to his old games. Sometimes a remake is needed.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One thing that really stands out about remaking The 25th Ward was, at the time when we did the remake, it was completely unplayable,” Suda explains. “It was originally only available on Japanese flip phones. And, on top of that, it never actually ended. The original version didn't have a proper conclusion or ending to it.” These factors ensured that, instead of a remaster, The 25th Ward was totally remade in 2018 to both suit the PlayStation 4 console and to finally provide players with a conclusion to the story. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For Shadows of the Damned, Mikami and Suda have chosen to remaster rather than remake. Instead of expanding and reinventing aspects of their 2011 game, which sold poorly but garnered a cult following, the duo have stuck closely to the original version. The approach allows modern audiences to experience the game as it was released back on the Xbox 360 and PS3. Nevertheless, there are some new elements to ensure long-term fans are rewarded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I wanted to keep the game as close to the original as possible, but there were definitely things that I wanted to add on and emphasize or accentuate this time around,” says Suda. “For example, there's some new costumes for the main character, there's the new game plus mode. There's a few things that we wanted to use to boost the experience a bit. But yeah, we certainly wanted to keep it as close to the original as possible.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Personally, I'm more interested in remaking Killer7 than I was in remastering Shadows of the Damned.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, as noted earlier, Mikami isn’t all that interested in remasters. That’s not to say he’s not interested in revisiting the past, though. “Personally, I'm more interested in remaking Killer7 than I was in remastering Shadows of the Damned,” he tells me. “If I got to choose, I'd rather do a sequel to Killer7 or something.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in 2005, Killer7 was an incredibly stylish action thriller. Its complex story, following the exploits of an assassin with multiple personalities, was co-written by Mikami and Suda. It’s another project from the duo with a cult following, and one that has largely been lost to time: aside from a 2018 PC remaster, Killer7 was only ever made for the GameCube and PS2, with no modern console re-releases available. As such, the game’s small but loyal following has long cried out for a sequel or remake.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/killer7-1728568546687.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Killer7 had stylish art direction and a unique approach to action game mechanics.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on the original, Suda says “I was constantly really, really conscious of the fact that I was making an action game together with Mikami, the guy who made the Resident Evil series. And with that, [he] revolutionized the way action games are made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Another thing that I was constantly conscious about was the fact that we were trying to make a game to put out to the whole world, not just domestically. All the new ideas that we had, for example, controller inputs and the gameplay and the action itself, we tried to make this stuff as new and original as possible. If we were to do another Killer7 thing, that's something that I'd like to return to. Making something completely new and original and putting a bunch of revolutionary stuff in it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Mikami likes the idea of returning to Killer7, he feels that his vision for the game’s art may clash with modern expectations. "I feel that, at the time, the art that we used for Killer7 matched really well with the specs of the time,” he says. “And if we were to make a new version of it nowadays, people would probably be expecting something a lot more realistic. And that would just feel funky and weird. That's not really what the game was about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If we were going to redo it, if we were going to do something new with it, there would be a whole lot that would have to be changed,” he theories. “Everything from background settings and the art itself, it would have to be pretty much redone from the ground up.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This isn't any kind of promise that we're going to be making a sequel or a remake or anything,” he quickly adds. “It's just two dudes shooting the shit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though it’s just two dudes shooting the shit, the conversation gives us a good insight into what one of the most celebrated directors in gaming thinks makes a good remake. The best are ground-up recreations that study and dissect the components that made the original game work so well, and then use that understanding to expand on the good and enhance any weaknesses. It’s a simple recipe that requires a deep, intricate understanding of the original game in question. Thankfully, Mikami’s work has inspired such dedication, and the result has been the Resident Evil remakes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the remakes yet to come, let’s hope they’re based on original projects that also inspire such close study and appreciation for every little detail, right down to the microseconds between aiming and squeezing the trigger. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/27/24278619/wilmot-works-it-out-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I used to hate jigsaw puzzles. I thought they were frustrating, messy, and took way too long to solve. But my wife showed me how those parts of jigsaw puzzles can actually be fun: there’s something satisfying and meditative about working through those frustrations, sorting through the mess, and putting a picture together, one piece at a time, over the course of a few hours. (Or days.)</p><p>The makers of <em>Wilmot Works It Out</em>, a new puzzle game, understand this, and everything about the game is designed to make solving puzzles fun instead of annoying.</p><p>In the game, you play as Wilmot, an adorable white square with a face who has a puzzle-by-mail subscription. (He’s the same smiley square <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F839870%2FWilmots_Warehouse%2F">from <em>Wilmot’s Warehouse</em></a>, a 2019 puzzle game also made by developers Hollow Ponds and Richard Hogg and published by Finji.) Every time you open a new package delivered by Sam, your mail carrier friend, the pieces appear in a jumble on the floor so you can match them together into a picture to put on the wall.</p><p>When you’ve put up a completed puzzle, Sam typically comes knocking with a brief conversation and a new box of pieces to sift through. After you finish a bunch of puzzles, you’ll complete a “season” and can move on to the next, which amps up the difficulty.</p><div><figcaption><em>It’s fun to sift through the pieces scattered about.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Finji</cite></p></div><p><em>Wilmot Works It Out</em> has a few clever ways to iron out the process of putting pieces together. Unlike every jigsaw puzzle I’ve done in real life, the puzzle pieces in <em>Wilmot</em> are all square. That sounds annoying, but because you don’t have to rotate the pieces to match them, it’s much easier to compare pieces side to side to see if they might fit together. When you slide a piece next to its correct counterpart, the piece you’re holding flashes once, and you’ll hear a soft but satisfying chime. I <em>loved</em> chasing those chimes.&nbsp;</p><p>Those design choices make it much easier to quickly assemble puzzles. But the game’s best trick is that puzzle packages typically contain a few pieces that connect to a puzzle you can’t finish yet. Because of that, you’re constantly trying to figure out which pieces fit a puzzle you can solve now and which pieces are supposed to be set aside for later.</p><div><p>Some puzzles are quite tricky</p></div><p>In the early seasons, I didn’t find this to be too difficult. That changed in the later seasons, though, as the developers have some devilish tricks to make you really work to figure out which pieces belong with which puzzles.</p><p>One season, for example, featured pieces that seemed to assemble into a peacock with big colorful circles on its feathers. Then, I started matching pieces with more colorful circles, but they turned out to be owl eyes. I tried to find a way for the owls and peacock to connect for longer than I care to admit — until I eventually realized that they were <em>two separate pictures</em>.</p><p>Two of my biggest problems with jigsaw puzzles have been how long they take and how messy they are. They can take what should be a fun activity and turn it into a chore. But <em>Wilmot Works It Out</em> fixes both, highlighting what I love about jigsaw puzzles in a delightful video game.</p><p><small>Wilmot Works It Out<em> is out now on PC and Mac.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>This week the Tomb Raider franchise turned 28 years old, first introducing Lara Croft to the world in 1996. Earlier this month, we saw the release of Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft on Netflix, an animated show set after the events of 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Now. Crystal Dynamics has confirmed that the show has been confirmed for a second season.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft | Official 'Danger' Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9JNouqX9P14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A short blurb for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft season two has been released by Crystal Dynamics, giving us a short glimpse of what to expect. “<i>When adventurer Lara Croft discovers a trail of stolen African Orisha masks, she joins forces with her best friend Sam to retrieve the precious artifacts. Lara’s thrilling new adventure takes her around the globe as she delves deeper into the hidden secrets of Orisha history, dodges the machinations of a dangerous and enigmatic billionaire who wants the masks for herself, while discovering these relics contain dark secrets and a power that defies logic. Power that may, in fact, be divine.”</i></p>
<p>The announcement of Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft follows the reveal of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/11/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-announced-for-another-valentines-day-release/">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a>, which is going to be released on February 14th, 2025. This collection will include The Last Revelation, Tomb Raider: Chronicles, and Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness. Aspyr Media is developing this collection and, just like the first collection, players will the choice of both overhauled and classic graphics that can be switched between. There is a more modern control scheme inspired by later games to give camera controls, but the option to play with classic tank controls will also be included.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/21/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review-ps5-xbox-switch-pc/">Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tomb Raider I-III Remastered review, Jim wrote, <em>“Lara’s original trilogy has been lovingly restored with the launch of these remasters, offering a definitive collection that bundles the core games and their expansions. However, dusting off these old relics in the name of nostalgia may come with a nasty surprise. Don’t worry, there are no mummy curses, snake pits, or swinging pendulum axes, though the clunky controls will definitely take some getting used to (again).”</em></p>

					<p>Horror has always been about the atmosphere created by eerie silences and the noises that break those up. Be it from the character, trying to be as quiet as they can to avoid alerting the big bad to where they are, or in some cases, the noises that the big bad makes as you know it's coming towards you. How else would you be able to identify <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XM7oCKC-L8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the scariest horror monster ever</a> without the distinctive sound of it on the tarmac? Though it must be said, A Quiet Place, led by the incomparable Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, also knew how to create that atmosphere. <a href="https://aquietplace.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a> looks to recreate that in game form.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/A-Quiet-Place-The-Road-Ahead-Review-02-Dont-Scream-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Let me start by saying I didn't use one of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead's touted features, microphone detection. Well, I should say that I simply flicked the mic on my headset to off mode because as much as it may add to the game, having to hold your breath or breathe lightly, my cats didn't get that memo. Also, I've seen A Quiet Place: Day One; the cat survived - spoiler alert -&nbsp; so the creatures shouldn't be killing me because my cats decided they wanted to get involved.</p>
<p>If that breaks this review for you, then off you pop because the reality is that the feature isn't something new or anything that adds to the game. If anything, it detracts from it because I don't live in that world. I want to immerse myself, but barricading myself in a sound and cat-proof room isn't reasonable or feasible. For those of you who are left and want to hear about the game, its mechanics, story, and everything else, let's carry on.</p>
<p>We'll carry on with sound. Naturally, the whole world of A Quiet Place revolves around sound, and as Alex, you're going to want to make as little sound as possible, with five different forms of movement - walking and crouching, both fast and slow, and sprinting. For most of the game, you will do the fast crouch because that's the optimal approach; it's quicker and quieter than the slow walk. You only need to go into a slow crouch over particularly noisy ground, such as broken glass or puddles.</p>
<p>This is the game's key selling point, though the mileage you get from it will vary. It does try to play around with it a little. At different points, you will find bags of sand, which you can pour out to create paths of silence. You can also find bricks and bottles to throw and distract the aliens, and towards the end of the game, you can give the alien a headache by triggering a feedback loop on the TV. Another thing that links to noise is using a tool to detect the sound you're making compared to the ambient sound.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/A-Quiet-Place-The-Road-Ahead-Review-03-Spaceship-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I said "towards the end of the game" for the TV thing. This is my first criticism: A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is too short for the mechanics it introduces. I get the feeling that this was meant to be a longer game than it was, with more puzzles about getting around the monster, but something happened. It was initially announced as being developed by Illogika and Ep1t0me, so the move to Stormwind games may explain this feeling, or I could be completely wrong. However, I'm not wrong about how the mechanics feel rushed and underutilised, except for one.</p>
<p>That one is doors. I'm unsure who made all the hinges in America, but they are atrocious, and the whole country needs a refund. The game's setting is only four months after the arrival of the aliens, and while I understand there are power issues, that roads will be littered with wrecked cars, and so on. What I don't understand is how <strong><em>every single</em></strong> door in the game squeaks like a mouse on meth. I get that it's the game mechanic; you have to slowly - and manually - open the door like that of Amnesia: The Dark Descent and avoid making noise, but it takes me out of the game, becoming tedious and having outstayed its welcome after the first twelve-million doors you've gone through</p>
<p>It also annoys me that the level layouts are absurd and just too "designed," for lack of a better word. A good level should feel like it could exist in the world you are in, not that somebody has created set twists and turns that would only impede people, not creatures. Far too often, you are sent to crawl through a vent to find a key and open a door locked from the inside just to open another door. Nothing in the game is an actual "puzzle" in any sense, and when you have to get around one of the monsters, the paths are minimal, as in there are two - towards the monster or take the path around it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/A-Quiet-Place-The-Road-Ahead-Review-04-Asthma-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>One of the most annoying aspects of the sound and level design is that it doesn't make sense when you die. If you hit the game's arbitrary "too much noise" level, a cutscene starts, and you die. It doesn't matter if you're behind five walls, in a small corridor, or a patch of grass in a field; the creature just appears out of the ether. Not once did I feel that the creature was this threat, simply because there was no agency once the noise threshold was met. You couldn't run away, you couldn't hide, you couldn't try to trick it by throwing a bottle; you had already lost because you hit the sound cap.</p>
<p>If there is one positive to bring from this, there is some success in level design in how Stormind games have laid things out. You do have to think about the path you take in the sense that there is glass on the floor, or do you walk over twigs or through a puddle? Can you sneak around the red cans that just happen to be inconveniently placed where you would need to walk in the middle of a forest? This part makes you think.</p>
<p>One thing I haven't mentioned yet is the other key noise-creator: asthma. Alex, the protagonist, has asthma. Also, she's pregnant, but the game ignores this apart from cheap "look, guys, she has a parasite growing in her" pulls. As you exert yourself by carrying extremely light wood planks, climbing up ledges, or going through places the game has deemed dusty, her asthma will start playing up. Once the level reaches its limit, you can either succeed in a quick-time event, or Alex will have an asthma attack, and you'll encounter <em>the cutscene</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead isn't stingy about giving you inhalers or leaving pills around for you to reduce your asthma meter. I found myself on my last inhaler only once or twice, more often than not, at the cap of five. Early on, the other usable items were batteries, which ran out more often if you weren't careful with your torch usage. I can't complain much about that since I imagine I would have used more if I weren't as willing to snail my way through the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/A-Quiet-Place-The-Road-Ahead-Review-05-Sand-Bagging-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To be honest, I didn't like A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. The films range from excellent to decent, but the game doesn't manage to capture that same sense of dread. Due to the convoluted level design, choices like a random rail-shooter section, and the ending, which quite literally becomes "press X to not die," it feels patchwork. The creature is annoying and not threatening because there is no threat from the creature except for a few patrol areas where you can get yourself cornered.</p>
<p>I couldn't also class it as threatening because it wasn't smart. As mentioned, you could get yourself cornered, where the creature would be right in front of you, but it won't know you're there until you make a sound or the somewhat vague hit-box collides with you (after passing through an object or two), and the cutscene starts. Despite knowing the inevitable outcome, those moments were the only time I felt tense in that game. Beyond that, the creature had no real direction; it would flit around randomly, though it still always happened to be following you when you got past it.</p>
<p>Again, it felt too forced, too convoluted. I tend to find a horror game—or any game—works best when it is organic. I want it to rest on me like a blood, vomit, and faeces-soaked shroud, and I want to feel like the game presented could exist in the world before us. Instead, I felt like this was a set of designed levels with precise routes and actions to take at set times, and the way to get through it was to do it all slowly, even when it comes to the easter-eggs and collectibles, like the space ship from the first film, or cassette tapes.</p>
<p>Maybe the hidden message of the game is "patience is a virtue", but I don't need five to six hours of trudging through extremely littered forests and streets telling me that. Maybe you will like A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, but I sadly didn't.</p>

</div>

<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a game with interesting ideas, looking to build on the success of the films, but falls flat with level design and certain mechanics breaking, rather than enhancing, immersion. With clear signs of what could have been really good, a few slips hold the game back.</p>

<div>
		<div>
		<h6>
			<span>Pros</span>
		</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Good use of stealth and noise avoidance throughout the game.
</li><li>Looks good, and has a good use of audio to add to the atmosphere it wants to build.</li>		</ul>
	</div>
			<div>
		<h6>
			<span>Cons</span>
		</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Poor world building and level design breaks immersion.
</li><li>AI that just doesn't seem smart or like the creature it's meant to represent.
</li><li>While sound is meant to be a key threat in the world presented, so is the creature, but the creature never feels like the threat it should be - only a consequence.
</li><li>Poor pacing, which never gives the different mechanics time to breathe.</li>		</ul>

            <p>Ys X: Nordics launched in Japan last year to some critical acclaim, and it has now made its way both west and onto PC. The PC version has a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2731870/announcements/detail/4554919920318276609">bunch of graphical upgrades</a> and keyboard support, but also - unlike predecessor Ys IX: Monstrum Nox which got co-op as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-is-the-perfect-place-for-newcomers-to-take-a-vampiric-leap-into-the-series">a cheeky post-launch bonus on PC</a> - Ys X: Nordics has local co-op from day one.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ys X again stars pretty boy protagonist Adol, but this time is teamed-up with pirate Karja. Yes, that means there's ship-shaped exploration and combat. If you don't have a co-op buddy to play with, you can switch between both characters on the fly or control them together, and build their "Revenge Guage" to do combined attacks.

<p>The Ys series started all the way back in the '80, but it's been gaining in popularity in recent years, particularly on PC. Monstrum Nox was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/japanese-games-dominated-steams-july-top-sellers">a Steam best seller in July 2021</a>, and genre expert Nadia Oxford <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-is-the-perfect-place-for-newcomers-to-take-a-vampiric-leap-into-the-series">thought it was the perfect entrypoint to the series</a>. 
</p><p>I am yet to make my own entrance into the Ys series, and I confess, I've never fought a naval battle I've enjoyed. If I want to slowly circle an enemy I do not understand while taking potshots at it, then I will write news posts about RPG series I've never played, thanks. I do wish I had time to experience its blue skies and grappling hooks, though. Maybe if I ever finish Ni no Kuni. 
</p>
<p>Ys X: Nordics is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731870/Ys_X_Nordics/">available from Steam</a>. It's £55/€60/$60 and there's a demo where your save can carry over to the full game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
