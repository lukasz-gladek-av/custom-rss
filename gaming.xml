			<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII</em></strong> often dominates the spotlight, its 1994 predecessor, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>, remains the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">holy grail</strong>" for many long-term series fans. It pioneered the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">magiteck</strong>" aesthetic and delivered one of gaming’s most chilling antagonists in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kefka Palazzo</strong>. However, if a modern reimagining of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Terra’s</strong> story ever breaks ground, it won't be under the direction of the man who spent the last decade <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">rebuilding Midgar and the world of Gaia </strong></a></p>



<p>In a new interview with <strong><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamerBraves">GamerBraves</a></em></strong>, <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> talked about his love for <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>: <em>"I grew up admiring <strong>Final Fantasy VI</strong> and <strong>VII</strong> as a child, and they were the titles that inspired me to become a game creator. They are undoubtedly at the origin of my creativity,"</em> he said.</p>



<p>This love for <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>, however, didn't translate into bringing elements of the game into the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy.<em> "Because I am working on the <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong> series, I believe the 'origin' for this work should be <strong>Final Fantasy VII</strong>,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> said. <em>"I wanted to bring out the best of the original <strong>FFVII</strong>, so I don't recall taking many elements from <strong>FFVI</strong> for this project."</em></p>



<p>Although the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy director harbors so much love and respect for the sixth entry in the series, he <strong>wouldn't direct</strong> a <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong>. After being involved in the <strong>Remake trilogy</strong> series for <strong>10 years</strong>, and finally seeing the end of it, rather than "spending another enormous amount of time to do another remake project," <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> would rather <strong>support a new young creator</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi's</strong> decision not to direct a potential <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong>, after having worked on the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy for over a decade, is more than understandable. While the development team has been rather creative in terms of gameplay, it was still constrained by the <strong>boundaries of the original game</strong> in some way, boundaries that would likely chafe anyone if they had to be kept in mind during creative work for over <strong>10 years</strong>.</p>



<p>In addition, a <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong> would pose some massive challenges that the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> didn't. Recreating the <strong>entire cast of 14 characters</strong> for the game would be a challenging undertaking, as would expanding a story that often shifts between different characters to deliver an <strong>ensemble narrative</strong>. Still, much like the community, I would love to experience the <strong><em>World of Ruin</em></strong> open-world second half of the game with modern gameplay and visuals, which would be a <strong>monumental task</strong>, much like recreating characters and narrative.</p>



<p>No matter Naoki Hamaguchi's sentiment on a potential Final Fantasy VI Remake, we are unlikely to hear much about it until some time after the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy has concluded. With the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong>close to reaching a state where it can finally be shown</strong></a>, and with the original's 30th anniversary coming up next year, we are likely going to get the first glimpse at the conclusion of the trilogy, which promises to be explosive (and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">f</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/"><strong>illed with air travel on the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Highwind</em> airship</strong></a>).</p>

<p>Season One Reloaded has kicked off in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, bringing a new Fallout collab that includes a stacked Event Pass of rewards, though some are locked behind an additional purchase.</p>



<p>The Fallout collab in Black Ops 7 is widespread, with limited-time game modes, unique challenges, and items available to purchase in the shop, showing that the collab is not just about cosmetic items.</p>



<p>If you’re on the fence about splashing out on the Fallout Event Pass, Insider Gaming has all the details on the price, the rewards available, and a verdict on whether it’s worth grabbing.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">How Much is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to earn. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Upgrade Track for the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is priced at 1,100 CoD Points, which works out at around $10 for the extra content.</strong></p>



<p>Splashing out on the Upgrade Track provides 10 additional rewards alongside the 10 free rewards in the Event Pass, most of which are cosmetics.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">All Rewards in The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<p><strong>The Fallout Event Pass in Black Ops 7 comes with 20 rewards, 10 of which are available for free, with the other half limited to those who purchase the Upgrade Track.</strong></p>



<p>Free rewards in the Event Pass include two Operator Skins, a loading screen, XP Tokens, and a new base weapon, while the Upgrade Track includes a new Operator, alongside an additional Operator Skin, a finishing move, weapon blueprint, Emote, and more.</p>



<p>A full breakdown of the rewards available in the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is shown in the table below.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass-worth-it">Is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass Worth It?</h2>



<p><strong>If you’re a fan of the Fallout TV Series, the Blacks Ops 7 Event Pass is worth the cost as it provides the best content from the major collab.</strong></p>



<p>Unlocking the Upgrade Track is the only way to obtain the Power Armor and The Ghoul Operator Skins, two iconic looks from the famed series, along with other eye-catching additions, including the Torch Blade Weapon Blueprint and Minigun Teardown Finishing Move.</p>



<p>The Free Track, meanwhile, features much smaller collab items, with the two Operator Skins not being characters from the TV series, and the other cosmetic items being much less eye-catching.</p>

            <p>Cygames, the Japanese video game developer responsible for a variety of popular games including Umamusume: Pretty Derby, has announced its intention to create an AI-focused subsidiary company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/news/id-24704/">A blog post</a> on the official website states Cygames AI Studio Inc will be developing "AI-based services and tools". A breakdown of key information at the bottom of the post also indicates it'll be involved in operation support and consulting as part of its AI services.</p>
<p>The post also features a paragraph detailing the background for this company, including the reasoning for why it's been established. The statement, translated into English using built-in Google tools, reads: "Generative AI, which has emerged in recent years, is an important technology with the potential to transform accumulated knowledge into the driving force behind the next wave of creativity.</p>

<p>"At the AI Studio, Cygames will pursue AI technology that creators can use safely and securely, drawing on the experience it has cultivated in game development. From research and development of its own models to providing services and tools for production sites, the company will build a unique creative cycle that goes beyond simply improving efficiency to expand creators' creativity</p>
<p>"Through the establishment of the AI Studio, Cygames will take on the challenge of creating new user experiences to realize its vision of being "a company that creates the best content."</p>
<p>Japanese video game companies such as Cygames appear to be largely embracing generative AI technology. In a poll during last year's Tokyo Game Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of companies that responded stated generative AI was being used in development</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has indicated its desire <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">to replace much of its QA work with generative AI</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately">Sega too has expressed eagerness to use the tech in spite of "strong resistance"</a>.</p>
<p>Cygames' current golden goose in Western markets, Umamusume: Pretty Derby, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">won the best mobile game award at last year's TGAs</a>.</p>

			<p>James Cameron's big blue aliens are back in theatres in Avatar: Fire and Ash and Ubisoft is piggybacking on the film with some new Avatar content of their own. Not a full new game this time around, but rather a major expansion, <a href="avatar:%20Frontiers%20of%20Pandora%20-%20From%20the%20Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes</a>. This DLC offers a new campaign that introduces the violent Mangkwan tribe from Cameron's latest movie, although it isn't entirely standalone, as you still need to own the base Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora game to play it. The expansion arrived shortly after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-2-update-adds-third-person-ng-dlss-4-mfg-rr-fsr4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major Frontiers of Pandora update</a>, which added a number of much-requested features, including a third-person mode.</p>



<p>Has Ubisoft delivered an enticing new reason to open up this Pandora's Box again? Or is this DLC not worth getting fired up about? Scroll on for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full-scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora47.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was quite a remarkable game in a lot of ways (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read my full review here</a>) offering eye-popping visuals and an impressively huge and varied world, but its combat was its unfortunate Achilles’ heel. Your Na'vi character was a frustratingly flimsy 9-foot-tall glass cannon, particularly early on in the game, and being sneaky wasn't really an alternative either as the game didn't offer the player much of a stealth tool kit and punished you severely for any minor screwup. I still enjoyed the game overall at launch, but there was no denying it had some big glowing red (or, uh, blue) weak spots.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora48.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Well, a hearty kudos to Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment, as they’ve done quite a good job of identifying and fixing a lot of the issues Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora launched with. Some of these fixes, including toning down enemy AI and adding the third-person mode, have been incorporated into Frontiers of Pandora as a whole through patches, while others, including an array of combat upgrades, are exclusive to the From the Ashes expansion.</p>



<p>From the Ashes casts players as the "Dog Tag Warrior" So'lek, the badass Na'vi who rescues your character at the beginning of Frontiers of Pandora's campaign. The narrative of From the Ashes jumps forward in time a bit, with the RDA and Mangkwan teaming to torch large portions of the Kinglor Forest. Of course, it’s up to So'lek to bring them down.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora52-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>While From the Ashes’ plot is relatively straightforward, So'lek is definitely a more compelling and proactive hero than what we got in the core game and the Mangkwan make for memorable villains. In a fun twist, you also get to team up with your protagonist from the first game, Tamtey (aka "The Sarentu"), who shows more personality here than in their own campaign. From the Ashes delivers a good handful of memorable moments without all the padding (the confusing and laborious character progression of the core game has been significantly streamlined).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora50.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes was specifically designed to be played in third-person, and for the most part, the change of viewpoint works out well. Surprisingly, one aspect you'd <em>think</em> would greatly benefit from a third-person mode, platforming, hasn’t improved all that much. Jumping is still rather unresponsive and imprecise. That said, third-person mode makes it a lot easier and more intuitive to assess your surroundings, making it the clear choice for combat and stealth scenarios.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora49.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Sneaking up on baddies is a lot less maddening now, due to the new perspective, improved enemy marking, and added instant stealth finishers. But if you want to mix it up with the RDA head on, that's now also a viable strategy, as So'lek eats RDA troops for breakfast. You're not nearly as frail as in the base game, new slow-motion aiming lets you make killer shots in a pinch, and Warrior Senses, a super mode you can activate once you fill a meter by dealing or taking enough damage, lets you go ham on entire waves of enemies. Ah, but the RDA have new tricks too. Upgraded armored enemy types and pesky robot dogs will require you to make smart use of So'lek's powerful abilities. New boss fights, including showdowns with rival Mangkwan, offer fresh challenges that stand apart from the usual RDA troops in exo suits schtick.</p>

<p>From the Ashes doesn't offer much in the way of entirely new locales, instead opting to reshape the Kinglor Forest map from the core game, adding plenty of fire and ash to previously lush locales. A lot of From the Ashes' main missions revolve around reimaging key landmarks from the core game in fun and interesting ways, with, for instance, the once-safe Hometree being taken over by a large RDA base and the serene Rookery becoming a fiery gauntlet of challenging platforming and pitched combat.</p>



<p>While a lot has been improved, I don’t want to go overboard with the praise, as this still isn’t a perfect game. As mentioned, platforming remains stiff, and I wouldn't consider From the Ashes a truly top-tier shooter or stealth experience. But make no mistake, it <em>is</em> better than it was, and Massive have done an admirable job of refreshing their world and justifying this expansion’s $25 price tag – the core campaign is a solid 10 hours long, and those looking for 100 percent completion could spend twice that long.</p>

<p>While Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes is still a bit rough around the edges in some respects, you have to give developer Massive Entertainment credit for at least trying to fix almost every complaint fans had about the original game, sometimes quite successfully. Combat in particular is much improved, making embodying a 9-foot-tall alien warrior into the empowering experience it always should have been. If you enjoyed the original Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, you'll probably love From the Ashes, but even those left cold by the core game may find this DLC sparks something in them.</p>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is available on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5. If you already own the core game, you can pick up the expansion for $25, while those just coming on board now can get the original game and DLC packaged together for only $40.</p>

            <p>Former Xbox exclusive role-playing game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> is coming to PlayStation 5, and it'll be released on the game's first anniversary: 17th February 2026 (note: the original PC and Xbox Series S/X release happened on 18th February 2025 but it's only a day's difference).</p>
<p>The benefit of a year-long wait for Avowed on PS5 means there's been a year's worth of game improvements. Among them are expanded/reworked abilities for the Ranger and Fighter skill trees, a New Game Plus mode, a Photo Mode, and the option of playing as a species other than human. You'll be able to play as the big, scaly Amauan, the small furry Orlan, and the broad-shouldered Dwarves. I wish I'd had this choice when I played.</p>

These improvements will all be available on other existing platforms, of course, but as they say: you can only make a first impression once.</p><p>Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Avowed made a very good impression on me</a>. It has a slightly dated feel to it, but look past that and there's an adventure here with playful mechanics and a delightfully earnest approach to fantasy - one packed with colour and wide-eyed wonder.</p>

            <p>Following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">parliamentary debate</a> of the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>'s petition to the UK government last year, a group of Green Party members have announced plans to propose an amendment to the party's policy which would "compel" its MPs to support the campaign.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In case you need a refresher, the Stop Killing Games campaign is pushing for action from governments and lawmakers against publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when servers are switched off</a>. The campaigners argue that publishers should be required to put in place an end of life plan for titles whoe servers are shut down, ensuring players aren't locked out of always-online titles immediately at that point, instead being able to keep playing in some form - generally offline or via fan-maintained online servers. The other side of the coin argues that this entails a not unsubstantial cost and burden to put on studios or publishers.</p>
<p>There weren't any Green Party MPs present at the Stop Killing Games petition's parliamentary debate, something that arguably isn't too surprising given the left-wing party only has four MPs at current - for context, the ruling Labour Party currently have 404 and their main opposition the Conservatives have 119. Now, party member Morton Atkins, chairperson and coordinator of the party's branch for Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire has announced plans to propose an amendment to the party's policy which would push the Greens towards being vocal advocates for what Stop Killing Games propose.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I’m campaigning to change this. In collaboration with a dozen plus <a href="https://twitter.com/GreensOrganise?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GreensOrganise</a> and Green Party of England and Wales members we’ve created an amendment to Green Party policy which would compel Green MPs to support the Stop Killing Games Campaign.</p>— Mo 🏳️‍🌈💚🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💜🇵🇸🇸🇩🇨🇩 (@Mo_Atkins_Green) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mo_Atkins_Green/status/2008944073218854960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>"In collaboration with a dozen plus Greens Organise and Green Party of England and Wales members, we’ve created an amendment to Green Party policy which would compel Green MPs to support the Stop Killing Games Campaign," Atkins announced in a thread on the Tweeter. Revealing that he signed the Stop Killing Games petition which parliament debated, he added the following:</p>
<blockquote>The Green Party of England and Wales aims to be the party for a sustainable society and the party for gamers. If this passes it will help reduce destruction of digital art which has considerable environmental impacts during its creation, keeping that art alive through community volunteers and engagement with them via 'end of life plans' for all games, preserving our online third spaces which are crucial for tackling isolation and loneliness especially among our youth and the neurodivergent community who live parts of their social lives in these spaces.</blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting that the group of party members Atkins cites as supporting the proposed amendment thus far is a relatively small one and doesn't appear to include any of the party's four MPs at this point. I've reached out to the Green Party to ask whether any of those MPs plan to support the proposed amendment or wish to express views on it. Atkins suggested that the amendment will be put to a vote at <a href="https://springconf2026.greenparty.org.uk/login?backUrl=%2F">the party's 2026 Spring Conference</a>.</p>

            <p>The self-explanatory <a href="https://gabemcarvalho.itch.io/dont-stare">Don’t Stare</a> is both a gamejam creation I enjoy for itself and also, an idea I’d love to be incorporated into any number of first-person RPGs. Here is how the latter possibility might work: you are bandying insults with the Demon King ahead of the final battle. You’ve got some solid bantz going, but there’s a note of awkwardness, for the Demon King has very large, protruding ears, and you can’t stop looking at them.</p>
<p>Such biteable tubercles! Such luscious lobes! The more you stare, the more agitated the Demon King becomes, till at last, he flees in tears before you’ve exchanged a single blow. And that, young Chosen One, is how we first defeated evil many decades ago. I understand the Demon King has had some plastic surgery since.</p><!--more-->
<p>There could actually be a Demon King in Don’t Stare, for all I know. It’s a speed-dating sim with 67 fantastical characters. Your own character doesn’t want to be here – they’ve been signed up for the event by an interfering friend. As such, your goal isn’t to romance anybody but to scare them all away by moving your eye cursor over parts of their anatomy they’re sensitive about.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s as obvious as a literal hole in somebody’s head. Sometimes it takes a bit more calculation. You’ve only got 20 seconds before the bouncer throws you out, mind, so peel those peepers.</p>
<p>NPCs in videogames seldom object to being stared at - an expression of the player’s power that could always do with more analysis, versus the more obvious intrusive agency afforded by, say, guns and traversal abilities. Think about how you keep your eyes to yourself while walking down a city street, and compare how you swing the camera about without a care while playing Assassin’s Creed. </p><p>Some exceptions to the rule: in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, there are creatures that respond (very unpleasantly) to being looked at. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, Norman Reedus will sock you one if you look at his crotch while visiting the "Private Room" (compare and contrast "press L1 to gawp at cleavage" in MGS3).</p>
<p>I guess you could argue that Amnesia games also constrain your gaze, because looking at awful stuff will drive your character nuts. And perhaps you could make connections with a game like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3595450/Object_Impermanence/">Object Impermanence</a>, in which parts of the world are only present when you're looking at them. Any other weird eye mechanics to discuss?</p>

<p>Quantic Dream has just announced that Detroit: Become Human has surpassed 15 million units sold in 2026. </p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human was released back in 2018 and quickly gained popularity in the community thanks to its cinematic storytelling and decision-based gameplay. We were recently informed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/detroit-become-human-sold-one-million-copies-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 1 million copies in two weeks</a>, thanks to a massive Steam discount that was instrumental in reaching a new milestone. </p>







<h2 id="h-detroit-become-human-reaches-massive-sales-milestone-in-2026">Detroit: Become Human Reaches Massive Sales Milestone in 2026</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466707/detroit-become-human-sales-top-15-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a>, a <a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2026/01/08/detroit-become-human-surpasses-15-million-units-sold-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from Quantic Dream reveals that Detroit: Become Human has sold 15 million units worldwide across PlayStation 4 and PC. The report shows that the game has been steadily hitting new milestones since 2020, with 5 million units in that year, reaching 11 million units in the next 5 years. 2025 was an excellent year for the game, as it sold 4 million more units, bringing total sales to 15 million by January 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-about-detroit-become-human">About Detroit: Become Human</h2>



<p>Detroit: Become Human takes place in 2038, where technology has advanced so much that human-like androids can be found worldwide. Players get to play as three of these androids, each of which has different moral dilemmas and obstacles to overcome. The game places a significant focus on player decisions, where your choices not only shape your characters’ journey but also impact the entire city of Detroit. The game features “thousands of choices and dozens of possible endings,” so no playthrough is exactly the same, as the most minute decisions can have a significant impact on how the story plays out. </p>

<p>Capcom has released a new teaser trailer for Alex, the latest addition in the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>There's no raw gameplay here, but if you ever wanted to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fight">Final Fight</a>'s Andore (Hugo) get beaten to a pulp, this trailer has you covered. Alex fully turns heel for this one, becoming 'The Man With No Allies' as he taunts his opponent and rebukes the crowd.</p>
<p>From this short teaser, we're not overly keen on Alex's look, but it's at least much, <em>much</em> better than his appearance in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v">Street Fighter V</a>. Jesus, that was <a href="https://game.capcom.com/cfn/sfv/as/common/character/bustup/l/alx.png?h=eb260947df38fcec30440acb79613441">rough</a>.</p>
<p>As for when fans will finally get to play as Alex, there's no firm release date, but the trailer ends to confirm that he'll be available in 'Early Spring'. So we're potentially looking at a release in March, perhaps.</p>
<p>Alex will join Sagat and C. Viper in the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass, with Ingrid making her mainline series debut at some point in the future.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">our review</a> for Street Fighter 6 on Switch 2, we said it's "crisp, clean, and as slick as we could have ever hoped", awarding it a score of 9/10. It also featured as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">one of our personal Game of the Year choices</a> for 2025, so do check that out if you have a moment.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders developers have revealed that they are implementing significant changes and new detection systems to tackle the ongoing cheating problem in the game. </p>



<p>In recent days, ARC Raiders has been accused of rampant cheating, with a popular streamer stating that the “egregious amount of cheating genuinely might be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worse than peak Call of Duty</a>.” The developers have now acknowledged the issue and outlined their plan to resolve it. </p>

Embark Studios first acknowledged the discussion around cheating in ARC Raiders and informed players that they are taking this issue “very seriously” and are acting on the players’ feedback. </p>



<p>The dev team will be “implementing significant changes” to ARC Raiders rulesets and will deploy “new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters” in the coming few weeks. The process will include updating their anti-cheat system to improve detection and enforcement of bans. </p>



<p>Additionally, the developers will implement “client-side” fixes that will target the ARC Raiders ‘out-of-map glitch, which has become a massive pain in the title. Furthermore, the developers will also be adding changes that will help streamers, including tools that will “help mitigate stream sniping”. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developer Sandfall underestimated just how much players would engage with the game's various sidequests and optional content, and as a result of this extra grinding would find the final boss fight a tad underwhelming.</p>
<p>As we all know by now, Clair Obscur became quite a sensation following its release last year. The first game from Sandfall, many weren't sure exactly what to expect on its debut, but before long many were deeply invested in its world and characters. In fact, players were so invested in Clair Obscur, they completed a lot of optional side content and dungeons, leveling up their characters in the process. </p>
<p>This meant, though, that by the time it came to the final showdown (don't worry, I won't spoil it here), a lot of players were actually a lot stronger than Sandfall anticipated, and so the fight itself was a little <em>too</em> easy.</p>

<p>"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now," Clair Obscur's lead game designer Michel Nohra said in a recent interview with Edge magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-underestimated-how-many-players-would-do-all-the-side-content-regrets-disappointing-people-that-wanted-a-challenging-end-boss/">Games Radar</a>).</p><p>Nohra added: "Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content. And that's something I underestimated, which made people that wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>"I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."</p>
<p>Clair Obscur's lead programmer Tom Guillermin believes a lot of this was due to Sandfall's "humility", as no one at the studio really expected the game to become quite such a success.</p>
<p>"We weren't sure if our game was going to be that good," Guillermin said. "And if it's not, people may just want to see the story, and go directly to the end of the story. So it was a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon."</p>
<p>Closing, Guillermin said of course the team was "happy about that", however Sandfall just "didn't see it coming".</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p><p>Last month, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have - perhaps slightly ironically now - proven tricky for some</a>.</p>
<p>For more, I recently spoke with actor Maxence Cazorla - who performed the physical side of things for Clair Obscur's Gustave, Renoir and Verso, and voiced Esquie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-characters-a-life-changing-experience-and-the-mysterious-project-w-for-maxence-cazorla-expedition-33-is-more-than-just-a-game-of-the-year-contender">about his work on Expedition 33, and what the game has meant to him personally</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> made a surprise appearance at the <strong>New Game+ Showcase</strong> yesterday, with <strong>Obsidian</strong> delivering two announcements, the biggest of which is undoubtedly that Avowed is launching on <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> soon.</p>



<p>The action roleplaying game is about to celebrate its first anniversary. It launched for PC and Xbox Series S|X on February 18, 2026, and on <strong>February 17</strong>, the game will be available on Sony's PS5 console, following the established pattern set by Microsoft with its newfound multiplatform policy. Pre-orders are now live on the PlayStation Store, offering two options: a <strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6312-PPSA26136_00-0827146390058176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$49.99 Standard Edition</a></strong> and a <strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6312-PPSA26136_00-0074184226734561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$59.99 Premium Edition</a></strong>. If you're not quite sure about pulling the trigger on the Premium Edition, which adds a Digital Artbook and Soundtrack, 2 Player Armors, and 8 Companion Skins, there's a <strong>$10 Premium Upgrade</strong> that can be used to jump from the Standard Edition to the Premium one later. </p>



<p>By the way, there's also a pre-order bonus for all those who purchase Avowed in advance: the so-called <strong>Emperor's Feast</strong>, five royal dishes that restore health, mana, and temporarily boost attributes to give players an early edge. Here's the list of the bonus food:</p>



<ul>
<li>1 Darkest Rauataian Chocolate Cookie</li>



<li>1 Candied Nuts</li>



<li>1 Wild Mushroom Stew</li>



<li>1 Roasted Chicken</li>



<li>1 Paradisan Trout Pie</li>
</ul>



<p>The game is also tagged as being <strong>PS5 Pro Enhanced</strong> on the PlayStation Store. There are no details yet on the specifics, but it's safe to say it will look and perform best on the PS5 Pro, since it's currently the most powerful console on the market. </p>



<p>I loved playing Avowed, as you know if you've read <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my launch review</a></strong>, so I'd definitely recommend PS5 users to look forward to it. Here's a quote from my article:</p>



<p><em>Avowed marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds. The game retains the studio's signature excellent writing and narrative while improving the combat (especially the challenge level) and providing a lot of great content to go through.</em></p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, Avowed is also receiving a free Anniversary update, which will be released on all platforms. This major patch will introduce the following new features:</p>



<p><strong>New Playable Races:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Amowin</li>



<li>Oralins</li>



<li>Dwarves</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Weapon Archetypes:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Quarter-staff</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Ability Tree Expansions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New abilities added to the Ranger and Fighter tres (to bring them on par with the Wizard tree)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Accessibility Features:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Arachnophobia mode</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Character Customization:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New facial feature presets and new outfits</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Photo Mode:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Community-requested feature adapted from&nbsp;Grounded</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Quality of Life:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Gear and progression improvements, bug and crash fixes</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>New Game Plus Mode:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Carry over all abilities and endgame gear (with enchantments intact) into new playthrough at level 1</li>



<li>Randomized enemy modifiers (increased elemental resistance on some enemies, stun-lock immunity on others)</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond the Avowed news, Obsidian also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8GuSLiE1IM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that <strong>Grounded 2</strong> (currently in early access) is about to get the <strong>Winter Update</strong>, which will add the Community Garden, a new biome attached to the existing picnic area and divided into three sub-biomes: vegetable garden, greenhouse, and pumpkin patch. New creatures like the Crickets (bus-sized with unique attack patterns) and two earwig variants (ranged/melee pairing) will introduce more tactical complexity, but there's also a new mountable creature, the Ladybug buggy, and some insects returning from the previous game, wasps and black ants. </p>



<p>The interview did not reveal a release date for the update, but the game's X account <a href="https://x.com/GroundedTheGame/status/2009400217712644142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that fans will want to watch the Casually Grounded 2 livestream next week for that.</p>

<p>There'll also be some new content in the Switch 2 Edition, including an exclusive arcade-style mode where you'll face off against waves of zombies using Juliet's Chainsaw Blaster and a turret. Joy-Con 2 mouse support will also offer a "fresh and distinct control experience".</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-9-943/</link>
            <guid>1401313</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of another week, but before the weekend can land successfully, you need to complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Let’s keep that streak running and make 2026 your most profitable year in the puzzle challenge space! Below, I’ve outlined today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions, so you can get things wrapped up quickly.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-9">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 9)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #943:</p>



<ul>
<li>3 BALL</li>



<li>8 BALL</li>



<li>6 MAFIA</li>



<li>COUTH</li>



<li>CARDINAL</li>



<li>DEEP END</li>



<li>CHAINZ</li>



<li>FORTH</li>



<li>HEART EMOJI</li>



<li>LIMB</li>



<li>DIRECTION</li>



<li>LEST</li>



<li>SOLO CUP</li>



<li>THIN ICE</li>



<li>NON BLONDES</li>



<li>OAST</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Slang or casual terms for where you live.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Think about how something might sound.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>THands you might make at a card table.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Add “animal” after each</em> <em>word</em>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 9:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-9-943">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 9 (#943)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– 3 BALL, CARDINAL, HEART EMOJI, SOLO CUP</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – 8 BALL, DEEP END, LIMB, THIN ICE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – 6 MAFIA, CHAINZ, DIRECTION, NON BLONDES</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COUTH, FORTH, LEST, OAST</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>The first Fortnite update of 2026 has arrived, bringing new content and changes to the game, resulting in the customary downtime, and this guide has all the details of when to expect servers to return.</p>



<p>After a packed schedule of Winterfest content, Fortnite still has plenty to offer during Chapter 6 Season 1, which won’t come to an end until early March, and the January 9 update has plenty to offer.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Fortnite downtime duration and what’s coming in the January 9 update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up">When Will Fortnite Servers be Back up?</h2>

<p><strong>Fortnite’s servers will be down for several hours for the January 9 update, and there’s no confirmed time for their return. However, previous downtime indicates how long the game will be unavailable.</strong></p>



<p>Server downtime in mid-season updates typically lasts for three to four hours, though the wait can be longer if any issues are discovered.</p>



<p>This means that servers should be back up after the January 9 update somewhere between 5 AM ET and 8 AM ET, so keep an eye on social media around these times to check if the servers are back online.</p>



<p>Once the servers are back online, make sure to have a look at the latest content on Insider Gaming for guides on all the major additions and tips to help you.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fortnite-january-9-update">What’s in the Fortnite January 9 Update?</h2>



<p><strong>The biggest additions in the January 9 update in Fortnite are the launch of a major South Park collab, introducing new cosmetics in the Item Shop and in-game content.</strong></p>



<p>A free Mini Pass will be available during the South Park collab, along with a makeover to the Wonkeeland POI, which is transformed into Cartmanland, and the addition of the Stick of Truth Mythic item.</p>



<p>The January 9 update will also bring a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-south-park-collab-will-include-limited-time-five-player-playlist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new five-player limited-time game mode</a>, while removing Winterfest content from the game, and there will also be updates to other game modes, including Blitz and Reload.</p>



<p>Full patch notes and content reveals should be shared by Epic Games on the official Fortnite blog during the downtime.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Code Violet Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/code-violet-review</link>
            <guid>1401298</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Let me level with you folks right up top: Code Violet is a bad game. No judgement (some judgement) if you saw tasteful (and sometimes not) screenshots and trailers featuring its beautiful brunette protagonist mixing it up with dinosaurs and felt compelled to pick this up just to ogle. But if you want anything else from Code Violet, like a compelling story with interesting characters or an engrossing crucible of tense and savvy action horror to conquer, then you’ve come to the wrong raptor-infested space station. The best it can give you is terrible third-person shooting, boring level design, and technical blunders that make stalking through this futuristic bloodbath feel prehistoric.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Code Violet’s story is unapologetically tropey science fiction, mixing far future space colonization, genetic modification, and more to make this final girl survival story as impenetrable as possible. Bits and pieces of the tale are interesting, though that’s mostly limited to side stories and lore found in the journal entries of victims scattered among the wreckage. But almost everything you play through and watch in cutscene form is derivative, awkwardly animated and acted, and forgettable. Avoiding spoilers, even when things get truly bonkers towards the end (in a similar fashion to developer TeamKill Media’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/quantum-error-review"><u>Quantum Error</u></a> from 2023), all the new and drastic revelations that should be monumental to the story at hand instead feel rushed and full of twists and turns that are either undercooked or entirely too convoluted. The very few other characters you meet are barely more than one-note exposition dispensers who you’ll watch your hero, Violet, worry and cry over and never really understand why.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Violet herself is a hollow shell with no motivations outside of doing what others tell her to do, as well as being incredulous and weepy when weird and sometimes difficult events arise. She’s meant to fill a sort of Jill Valentine or Lara Croft archetype of tough gals that can think their way through most challenges, and shoot their way through the rest. But while those two video game legends have agency and capability developed through their laundry lists of heroic feats, snappy dialogue, and sometimes dense inner monologues, Violet’s own thoughts about the happenings around her seem absent from most interactions. She only feels particularly good at anything when I’m in the driver’s seat, tip toeing down hallways and filling dinosaurs full of lead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is doubly damning. Outside of being a missed opportunity to introduce a good new character into the greater video game lexicon, it also makes Code Violet’s leering, pervy camera work and extensive dress up options feel like it's crossing the line from fun into creepy. There are tons of characters in games who successfully make being sexy or flirty a major part of their schtick, and the best ones are those that come across as completely in control of their own image while they do so. So its an unfortunate irony that in a post-<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>/<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade</a> world, one where people have never been more ready to accept hunky himbos and skimpy seductresses, Code Violet found one of the few ways to do it wrong.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A few parts look good at a distance, but textures can get muddied up close.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I played on a regular PlayStation 5 rather than a Pro, and at mid-to-far distances, a few parts of Code Violet really do look good. That’s especially true in the more creatively designed areas, like when you’re outside looking up as islands float in the purplish void of the sky. When you get up close, however, textures can get muddied and metallic surfaces reflect light in gaudy ways that seem off putting for the grunge and grime that sometimes smears them. And most of the heavy metal halls you’ll skulk down are uninspired sci-fi staples that don’t feel any different than any other game that asks players to escape from a locked down hellhole of a science facility. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/08/06/doom-3-review">Doom 3</a> pulled this aesthetic off far more effectively over 20 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s occasional flair, some statues that would look more at home in a medieval castle than a space base, for instance. There’s no real explanation for them, though you can make inferences based on some late-game happenings, but at the moment they come off largely as “it’s here just because.” One curious thing I did always stop to look at were the soda machines and various oil paintings that stick out like a sore thumb in this setting. Not because I found them to be particularly riveting (some were admittedly cool-looking), but mostly because I couldn’t stop trying to determine if they were AI generated or not – I’m no expert, so the jury is still out on that, but they certainly give off that vibe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those cool outdoor skyscapes hang over the rote and bland grasslands you’ll have to trudge through to get from one building to another almost mockingly. The limited time you spend in these zones is transitory. They basically serve as long hallways with bundles of tall grass to crouch behind when enemies are on patrol. You don’t even get a map to use, and you won’t need one as it will be very obvious where you need to go next, with very little opportunity to diverge from this critical path. Maybe these sections were meant to serve as some reprieve from the dark, claustrophobic halls of the various facilities on this planet, but other than having a brighter color palette, they feel exactly the same to navigate through.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back indoors, rooms that might have something to investigate or shoot are separated by long hallways with nothing to spice up the transition from one action zone to another. This almost never changes across the handful of maps you’ll explore, creating a predictable, slogging pace between rooms. Part of what makes games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-remake-review">Dead Space</a> so tense is that any and every room feels like one you could be maimed in. In Code Violet, you can be reasonably sure that most of its rooms exist just to be walked through by you and nothing else. Scoping out extra upgrade materials to strengthen your weapons or finding hidden keys or combinations to open certain lockers are the only good reasons to stray off the path, and even then I learned to go without these things pretty early on because the effort often wasn't worth the prize – they usually meant enduring the crumbling fossil of Code Violet’s combat system for longer than necessary.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The camera can render some indoor encounters a completely unintelligible mess until it's refocused.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Violet herself is agile and swift in line with most third person games of this ilk, and even has a Resident Evil-style back stepping dodge, which you will use a lot to create space between yourself and incoming dinosaurs. In a straight up skirmish with these scaly foes, a well-timed dash back can really befuddle the raptors, shattering their simple gameplan of running at you, taking a big swing, pausing, and doing it again. There’s limited space before you hit a wall or a door that might have automatically closed behind you, though, so you can only backdash so much before making yourself a much easier snack to catch. The camera will collide with these barriers far sooner than Violet will, rendering any encounter that doesn’t take place in the dead center of the room a completely unintelligible mess for as long as it takes you to get the camera refocused. Indoors, this was a frequent headache, and lingered like a second, scarier jump scare waiting to pounce after a raptor bursts out of the wall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The variety of these jurassic jerks is a let down, with large or small velociraptors and poison-spitting dilophosauruses making up the bulk of the non-boss foes. Each type has its own behaviors, but they are shallow and predictable. Big raptors just run and swipe at you until either you or it are dead. Small raptors are usually in packs and make a conga line toward you, taking a swipe before running away, only to immediately turn around and do it all over again. The spitters just stand in one place and shoot, opting to close the distance only when you do so first. You’ll encounter some gator-like creatures in the last third of the approximately six hour campaign, but they barely bother to deal with you so long as you don’t enter their waters, making them extremely easy targets. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Jarrett Green's Sci-Fi Horror Ho-down</h3><p>A very good list of some very good sci-fi horror games</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Any challenge I got from these mouthy menaces came from how erratic and stupid they could be, often getting caught in the environment while attempting to reach me or disengaging once I simply walked the other direction. Their bullet spongy, stun resistant nature also means that they can just run up and take a bite out of you before they die, not quite becoming a danger, but definitely becoming an annoyance since any hit from them could potentially cause you to bleed, which can kill you if you don’t treat it in time. This is all true for the remarkably few boss fights as well – you may be facing a scaly man-dino hybrid now, but almost nothing about the strategy of walking backwards, dodging on time, and then countering with a face full of lead has to change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, all these lazy lizards have a sort of supernatural omniscience. Even when you make your best attempts to sneak into or around a room, there's a great chance that they already know where you are and are on their way to kill you. On top of that, so many encounters involve you opening a door to see dinosaurs staring directly at you or are scripted events where they have the drop on you, so there aren’t many attempts to stay quiet to begin with. Unless you’re using the GlassVeil function of Violet’s suit, which can render you sometimes comically invisible for a short period, stealth is a large waste of time in most areas. I say comically because you can use it mid-fight with a dinosaur, and there’s a good chance they will simply give up any attempt to find you and return to milling around aimlessly when you do. Hilariously, this strategy even works on bosses, who will completely stop and wait for you to reveal yourself, usually with gunfire, and then make a half-assed attempt to follow up until you reappear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real enemy are the myriad bugs that can’t wait to bite and peck at your progress. Sometimes the sound mix will run off the rails or a very important skybox, one that might hold valuable information about a puzzle, simply won’t load. Weapons sometimes display the wrong ammo counts, or just disappear from your inventory all together – which I guess is a fair trade for the fact that every item I used directly out of my storage box didn’t actually expend it in the review build we were provided, meaning I could always heal to full at any safe room I made it to. (TeamKill Media tells us it’s already aware and working on fixes for some of these bugs, such as the infinite storage item issue, but didn't say when those might arrive.) </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Code Violet is not the Dino Crisis successor you may have hoped for. It doesn't even clear the bar of being a successful clone of the various other third-person shooters it cribs most of its ideas from. Its dated map layouts and visual style let its predecessors down. The only weight I felt from its convoluted story and flat, empty characters were on my eyelids. Its anemic host of enemies are dull, and far more scary are the amount of bugs that were in this review build that, though a priority on developer TeamKill Media’s list of fixes, hit Code Violet’s balance and pacing like a life-ending comet from outer space.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/code-violet-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The middle of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-battle-pass-season-20-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-7337/" data-ref-id="2900-7337">Overwatch 2 Season 20</a> has arrived, and the midcycle is bringing the chaos with new modes, new loot, and new in-game collectibles. One of the most notable new additions is Showdown Shuffle, which runs January 13-26. This mode is going to change which character you're controlling, often at random intervals.</p><p>Showdown Shuffle locks players into a role, but not a particular hero. Instead, hero swaps can occur when players reach certain milestones for kills or assists, or even when players are eliminated. According to Blizzard, this was done to encourage players to experiment with new characters and adapt on the fly. Showdown Shuffle will be a 5v5 battle available in Control, Hybrid, Escort, Push, and Flashpoint. Match modifiers will also change throughout the battle for more unpredictable outcomes.</p><p>Starting today through January 11, Assault will return during a Quick Play Hacked event that brings back classic Overwatch maps Temple of Anubis, Hanamura, and Volskaya Industries. It's a fitting start the year, considering that 2026 will mark the 10th anniversary of Overwatch.</p><p>Later in the month, from January 22 to 25, Junkrat's Loot Hunt will let player spend a weekend chasing rewards and earning loot boxes at their own pace. There won't be any progress resets during this event and every match counts on the way to potentially earning as many as nine loot boxes before the end of the weekend.</p><p>Doomfist is getting a new Mythic Magma Titan Doomfist Hero Skin, which Blizzard describes as channeling "blazing energy through a sleek streetwear style." There are four upgrade tiers for the skin that can add new gauntlets, colors, and even customized effects for Doomfist's sounds and abilities.</p><p>Widowmaker, Lúcio, and Reinhardt are also getting Cosmic Owl Skins that are timed for release alongside live esports moments in Season 20. Two new collections are also coming to the shop. From today through January 19, the Borealis Collection will give Mercy, Wuyang, Lifeweaver, Sojourn, and Echo a chilly makeover composed of "celestial forms shaped by frost, starlight, and Arctic power." That collection will be followed by the Heist Collection from January 13 to 26. These outfits give Roadhog, Reaper, and Ash "gritty underworld looks" without a whiff of Christmas or winter themes.</p><p>Season 20 will reintroduce Drives from January 30 to February 4, which will give players a chance to earn exclusive rewards while pushing their progression further. Blizzard is promising that wins and losses will be forgiving in the early stages of Drive. But the higher players climb, the battles will be considerably higher as they work to increase their Drive score across Core Competitive and Stadium.</p><p>Before that happens, however, there's going to be a competitive reset. Until then, players need to finish strong to secure their rewards while earning titles, Galactic skins, and Competitive Points.</p>
