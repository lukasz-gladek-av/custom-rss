		<p>New studio Intima Leaf, founded by developers Aymen Menjli and Mehdi Baccouche, has announced its first game called Riven Crown. It has been described as a mix of a Soulslike and a fighting game, with Intima Leaf giving the game the description of a Souls Fighter. Before we get into that you can check out the announcement trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Riven Crown Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vuBDe3LzIL8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Now, back to the phrase “Souls Fighter”. The main element of Riven Crown’s gameplay is that of a soulslike title, an action RPG with tough enemies to face. However, where Riven Crown differs is with its combat and combo system. Each weapon in Riven Crown has its own library of combos to learn and master, and putting those combos together to build up a meter to enter a Super State. In this state, combat becomes fast paces and the dodge roll is replaced with a swift dodge. The super combos will require to master both input sequences and timings to pull off each weapon’s combos. Along with attacks, players will also have to master both the standing and crouching block systems. Mistime a block and enemies will have an opening to strike.</p>
<div id="8PYG5hiaXy1NfZ7bgFuvm-content-0" tabindex="0" role="article" data-tabster="{&quot;groupper&quot;:{&quot;tabbability&quot;:2},&quot;focusable&quot;:{}}" data-content="ai-message" aria-labelledby="8PYG5hiaXy1NfZ7bgFuvm-author} 8PYG5hiaXy1NfZ7bgFuvm-content-0">
<p>Riven Crown tells the tale of a fallen hero who awakens in a mysterious new dimension, where four ancient civilizations stand, but they have been tainted by corruption. Kings and Queens ruled these civilisations but have succumbed to darkness, becoming demons known as the Deep Samum. Those who lived in these civilisations have become victims of the corruption and have turned into hell beasts that will attack the player.&nbsp; A separate faction of humans has also emerged in this chaos and it is governed by a Council of Elders. This council use dark magic to create the Bark Aggregation, an element that grants humans superpowers.</p>

</div>
<p>Riven Crown is said to last between 25 to 35 hours, with plenty to explore across the corrupted civilisations and plenty of fights to get into. The experience of Riven Crown will not just be limited to the game either. Intima Leaf has stated it will be running a cipher minigame with weekly challenges being presented, and real life prizes being put up for grabs. If you go to the <a href="https://rivencrown.com/">official Riven Crown website</a>, you can sign up to the newsletter and be notified of when the beta will be going live.</p>

What blurry, barely comprehensible mess was I getting myself into by loading this game on Valve’s handheld device? What horrors of technology was I about to behold by exploring how <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>performed as a portable experience?</p><p>With my expectations set so low you could trip over them, I was overjoyed to see that <strong>Ubisoft put in work to get <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>running pretty darn well on the Steam Deck.</strong> Don’t get me wrong, <strong>you’ll feel the device struggle to keep up with the game at times</strong>, which we’ll get to below. But as far as the moment to moment gameplay goes? Naoe and Yasuke actually resemble the way they look on their home console counterparts. <strong>You’ll hold fast at around 30 FPS even in intense combat sequences</strong>. You’ll still admire the vast open world from tall viewpoints and see trees blow in the wind. It is, against all odds, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on the Steam Deck, and it performs remarkably well for a AAA game in 2025..</p><p>For a more detailed breakdown, read on to see if you should play <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> primarily or secondarily on the Steam Deck. Note that these impressions are based on an 512 gb LCD Steam Deck, so performance on a newer OLED Steam Deck may be slightly better.</p><h2 id="h2144"><a id=""></a>You (mostly) don’t need to toggle any settings for Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Steam Deck</h2><figure id="" data-id="c408d114251b8b5eb37160a9dbaab001" data-recommend-id="image://c408d114251b8b5eb37160a9dbaab001" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Naoe crouches in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Naoe crouches in the snow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on an LCD Steam Deck.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c408d114251b8b5eb37160a9dbaab001" data-recommend-id="image://c408d114251b8b5eb37160a9dbaab001" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Naoe crouches in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>’ success on the Steam Deck can be attributed to how Ubisoft preloaded the graphical settings on the device. In many cases, games on the Steam Deck load up with most graphical toggles set to low, and the Deck will handle that as best as it can. This can result in unreadable text and indecipherable visuals, as most PC and console games aren’t designed with a smaller 1200 by 800 resolution in mind. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, on the other hand, has most of its settings fine-tuned for the device; you can’t even fiddle with most of them yourself. It’s similar to how you typically don’t have to worry about toggling ambient occlusion or shadow detail when you play a game on your PS5.. </p><p>Truthfully, you probably can’t change these settings because the game (and your Steam Deck) would explode if you tried cranking everything too high. But it’s clear that what’s behind the scenes is solid. </p><figure id="" data-id="2884ec10a14bdfe80650c928a7f1fbd8" data-recommend-id="image://2884ec10a14bdfe80650c928a7f1fbd8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An NPC speaks to a character off-screen during a cinematic sequence." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An NPC speaks to a character off-screen during a cinematic sequence." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on an LCD Steam Deck.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2884ec10a14bdfe80650c928a7f1fbd8" data-recommend-id="image://2884ec10a14bdfe80650c928a7f1fbd8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An NPC speaks to a character off-screen during a cinematic sequence." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are a handful of settings that you <em>can </em>edit, but given the game’s optimization I didn’t feel compelled to change them. I initially thought the reduced <strong>field of view</strong> would bother me, but in practice it fits the Steam Deck’s screen well. In fact, if you want a small bump in performance, you can tune this even lower without severely compromising your play experience. Similarly, <em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </strong></em><strong>actually supports the Steam Deck’s 16:10 screen</strong>, but you can lower this to the standard 16:9 for a little frame-rate boost as well. I’d personally advise against this, though. Games don’t often fill the Steam Deck screen, so I say you should enjoy it whenever you can—especially if you have an OLED model.</p><figure id="" data-id="9c47b1a7dc0d67b73a545d840e2616b1" data-recommend-id="image://9c47b1a7dc0d67b73a545d840e2616b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yasuke runs forward through the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yasuke runs forward through the snow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on an LCD Steam Deck.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c47b1a7dc0d67b73a545d840e2616b1" data-recommend-id="image://9c47b1a7dc0d67b73a545d840e2616b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yasuke runs forward through the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Frame Generation is one setting you may want to consider changing. </strong>With this feature enabled, you can get upwards of 20 extra frames per second on the Steam Deck, even if they’re “fake frames.” This can make the game look a bit fuzzy, and you might notice weird artifacts during cutscenes, but the extra smoothness is undeniable and might be worth putting up with. That said, this does make the frame rate jump around, whereas you generally play at a consistent 30 FPS with Frame Generation off. There’s no right answer for how to set this, so test both yourself and see which option feels better.</p><h2 id="h2145"><a id=""></a>How does Assassin’s Creed Shadows run on Steam Deck?</h2><p>Despite my high praise so far, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>does make noticeable performance concessions on the Steam Deck. You’ll notice this the second you open the game, as the animation leading into the main Animus menu can chug to the point of making you wait longer to start the game. You may also find yourself needing to log back into Ubisoft Connect if you switch devices frequently, but that’s not exactly a Steam Deck issue.</p><figure id="" data-id="2f61a360799b44c04ff7e9680a526396" data-recommend-id="image://2f61a360799b44c04ff7e9680a526396" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yasuke fights hostile forces in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yasuke fights hostile forces in the snow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on an LCD Steam Deck.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f61a360799b44c04ff7e9680a526396" data-recommend-id="image://2f61a360799b44c04ff7e9680a526396" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yasuke fights hostile forces in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For better or for worse, <strong>cutscenes seem to be where <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>struggles most on the Steam Deck</strong>. Scenes can dip down to 20 frames-per-second, which even the most frame-insensitive person should notice. The visuals themself are usually fine, fortunately, and the game doesn’t desync from the audio or anything like that. It’s just not quite “console-quality,” at times. </p><p>Fortunately, <strong>in instances where you’re actually <em>playing </em>the game, things move <em>way </em>smoother</strong>. As mentioned above, you’ll rarely if ever experience frame dips below 30 FPS. It doesn’t matter if you’re in climactic story battles as Yasuke or sneaking around busy castles as Naoe, it all holds up well. With Frame Generation on, I typically pushed up to around 40 FPS, with occasional dips back to 30 FPS and spikes up to 50 FPS. Getting headshots with my Kunai or reading enemy telegraphs in packed crowds could get dicey, but that’s to be expected when playing on a small screen. Otherwise, I rarely felt impeded in my ability to play the game.</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> manages to retain its visual identity well on the Steam Deck. Even with the settings turned down, buildings and character models look crisp, and you can still appreciate how you’ve <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-hideout-customization-unlock-1851772163&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-hideout-customization-unlock-1851772163">customized your hideout</a></span> and main characters. I did find the dynamic resolution made enemies in congested towers a bit too blurry, but those were the only moments where I thought the game looked bad. For the most part, I’d say <strong>the performance here feels similar to how <em>The Witcher 3</em> feels on Switch: compromised, but ultimately impressive given the hardware.</strong></p><h2 id="h2146"><a id=""></a>Should you play Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Steam Deck?</h2><figure id="" data-id="17a9a78823607635d3b1f2eff6427e49" data-recommend-id="image://17a9a78823607635d3b1f2eff6427e49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Naoe looks out at a snowy landscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Naoe looks out at a snowy landscape." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on an LCD Steam Deck.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17a9a78823607635d3b1f2eff6427e49" data-recommend-id="image://17a9a78823607635d3b1f2eff6427e49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Naoe looks out at a snowy landscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Obviously, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>was meant to be played on a modern console or a capable PC. Those platforms are where you’ll appreciate the visual flourishes Ubisoft Quebec put into the game. And while it looks good on the Steam Deck, you’ll be keenly aware that this world should look more alive than it does. Given how the game already pushes the Steam Deck to its limit, there isn’t any headroom to make the game pop if you dock your device and play on a TV either.</p><p>Still, despite all the compromises, if you’re wondering if you could play <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>primarily on your Steam Deck, I’d say “go for it.” I’ve found myself gladly reaching for my Steam Deck to do some sneaking around in the comfort of my bed, as <strong>the visual sacrifices feel like an even trade for the convenience of portability</strong>. The UI and text looks great on the device, story and side quests alike were enjoyable, and the open world structure is conducive to pick-up-and-play gameplay. Additionally, cloud saves via Ubisoft Connect should transfer between all devices, so the Steam Deck is a great companion device for your PC or even your PS5 if you feel like double dipping.</p><p><br>I thought <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Steam Deck couldn’t be done. Heck, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-always-online-steam-deck-ubi-connect-1851767074&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-always-online-steam-deck-ubi-connect-1851767074">even Ubisoft thought it couldn’t be done</a></span>.

The trio is on the magazine’s cover this month, talking about the series-changing events of season two. In last night’s episode, Abby tortures and kills Joel for killing her father <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tlou-last-of-us-recap-s1e9-finale-joel-ellie-giraffe-1850217781&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tlou-last-of-us-recap-s1e9-finale-joel-ellie-giraffe-1850217781">in season one</a></span>, which sends Ellie on her own revenge tour to Seattle that will unfold over the course of season two. There’s a lot of on-screen anger between these three characters, but you wouldn’t know it from how close the crew seems in this interview.</p><p>Pascal jokes that knowing Joel’s death was inevitable was a big part of why he took on the role in the first place. His previous big HBO role as Oberyn Martell in <em>Game of Thrones </em>also reached a violent end, so it’s become a recurring theme for the actor. Dever was the one wielding the golf club that brought about Joel’s end, but she says that it was a “heartbreaking” scene to take part in after watching Pascal and Ramsey’s characters in season one. Pascal says that she shouldn’t feel bad because he killed her dad “like ‘that’” and snaps his fingers. It’s all love here in <em>The Last of Us</em> land.</p><p>Dever talks a little bit about whether she was worried about any controversy following this moment. Abby killing Joel was incredibly controversial in the game, and the worst people you know took their outrage so far as to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">threaten Abby actor Laura Bailey’s family over it</a></span>. She says it was on her mind, but she wanted to do right by the character, even if it meant that she’d have to murder the shit out of Pascal.</p><p>“It is hard not to think about [the fan reaction],” Dever says. “I sort of went into this wanting to do my best, and I was thinking about the fans, but I think also there’s something about just really, seriously living in the moment. It’s obviously so heartbreaking. It’s so terrible. It’s gonna be so hard to take. [It’s] so sad, for me, because I love him so much.”</p><p>Pascal then hugs her and says the cast is “in love.” D’aw.</p><p><em>The Last of Us </em>season two has five episodes left and airs on Sundays at 9 p.m. Eastern on Max.

		<p>How about that episode of <em>The Last of Us </em>last night, huh? It's been interesting watching the show alongside my wife, who has no attachment to the video game story. (She was crushed, obviously, and had to sit in silence for a few minutes afterwards.) Instead, I get to experience this like how it must've been for <em>Game of Thrones</em> readers. It's also curious because at this point in the video game, I was so fucking invested in what happened next. I still have fond memories of that semi-open area in Seattle. Then, the rest of the game happens.</p><p>-pk, who is covering the show, if you're curious, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decoding-tv/id1163344992?ref=remapradio.com">at <em>Decoding TV</em></a></p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Sports!</em> – We're recording this later than we wanted due to a scheduling snafu on my side, so this might slip into publishing on Tuesday. But the NBA playoffs are here, even if most of the games have felt like upsetting blowouts, so it felt like a good time to revisit the wide world of sports.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Hopshot</em> – Look, I've put this off long enough. I need to see more of this game, I want to beat this game, and Cado is going to join my journey.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> – More of what we're playing, watching, reading—you know the deal.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Wheel of GeForce Now</em> – We've gone to some weird places with the wheel lately, and I cannot wait to see where it dumps us off next.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – It might be another week before Janet and I have a chance to  dig into <em>Lost Records</em>, sorry! But hopefully I'll start it this week.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Civilization VII</em> – Why not lean into the warming temperatures by joining Rob and Cado as they continue trying to control the world?</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – Perhaps something less serious this week.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-next-battlefield-spotlights-the-destruction-in-store-for-its-gameplay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Destruction has been a hallmark of Battlefield over the years, and for the next Battlefield game, DICE looks to be amping up the rubble-producing chaos even more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer recently dropped a <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1913249264488296827" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1k27bt3/community_update_battlefield_labs_destruction/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battlefield Labs Community Update</a>, to spotlight what's in store for the next entry in the Battlefield series. In the pre-alpha footage, we can see some of the destruction designed by DICE, as an explosive takes down the side of a building, opening up a new pathway through the structure.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re back with another Battlefield Labs Community Update focused on destruction! Check out an early pre-alpha example of destruction that showcases the ability to destroy a wall to quickly traverse through the building. Read the full article now! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield</a> <a href="https://t.co/bgDcPgZRbg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bgDcPgZRbg</a></p>— Battlefield (@Battlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1913249264488296827?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Destruction can lead to creative solutions for players, and in the Community Update, DICE said it is working to add more gameplay depth by letting players reshape the environment around them. Whether you bring down a wall to launch an ambush or open a new path towards a critical point, sometimes getting those pesky buildings out of your way can help.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're designing destruction around easily identifiable visual and audio language that lets you understand what can be destroyed, altered, or transformed through gameplay," DICE said. "We aim to make destruction an integral part of your Battlefield experience to create an intuitive, fun, and rewarding environment where you feel empowered to shape the world around you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Different impacts will affect structures like walls; while explosions obviously work, bullets will also chip away, so players can shoot through them. Audio VFX cues will let players know that their efforts are working.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The aftermath of all this destruction also leaves tangible effects on the battlefield. Rubble created by destroying a piece of a building, for example, will remain on the field, and could be used as cover. The next Battlefield certainly seems to have destruction on the mind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next Battlefield game, colloquially "Battlefield 6," is slowly taking shape. Not too much has been officially confirmed, though there have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-fans-are-digging-the-leaks-and-ea-hasnt-taken-them-down-yet">some gameplay leaks that have received positive responses</a> from Battlefield fans. It's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">heading to a modern setting</a> for the series and it's expected to arrive sometime in Electronic Arts' fiscal year 2026, or between April 2025 and March 2026. Of course, things could change if <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-boss-willing-to-move-battlefield-release-date-to-account-for-nuanced-year-relative-to-competition-cough-gta-6-cough">certain massive, industry dominating competitors lock in a date</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-puts-criterions-need-for-speed-team-on-battlefield-confirms-no-more-content-coming-to-nfs-unbound">a lot of effort behind this next entry</a>, this new Battlefield seems to be pulling out all the stops.

          <p>New episodes of season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em>&nbsp;are premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't)&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two/">will be talking about them here every Monday morning</a>. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviously&nbsp;<strong>heavy spoilers</strong>&nbsp;contained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I'd like to personally welcome Andrew and everyone else who didn't play <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/the-last-of-us-part-2-isnt-a-fully-satisfying-return-to-the-apocalypse/">the summer of 2020</a>, when the gaming world was rocked by the most shocking video game character permadeath <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/i-tried-to-jump-back-into-jrpgs-with-ffvii-rebirth-and-that-was-a-big-mistake/">this side of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>.</p>
<p>Before we get into how they changed Joel's pivotal death scene for the TV show, and why I think it doesn't work quite as well here, I'd love to hear more about what was going through your head both as it was happening and after.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: This should, if nothing else, reinforce my bona fides as someone who has not the faintest idea what is coming.</p>
<p>My <em>main</em> reaction is "Boy, Kyle just let me say a whole bunch of things <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/hbos-the-last-of-us-is-back-for-season-2-and-so-are-we/">last week</a> even though clearly he knew this was what was going to happen!" I thought we were watching the opening to a second season of a TV show in the first episode, the establishment of a new status quo that we would then explore over the course of the next few episodes. But we were, instead, playing the tutorial level of a second video game, right before everything blows up.</p>
<p>I was pretty astonished by what the show did to Joel. Not just because I didn't see it coming! But because it leaves the show without one of the two nuanced and well-developed characters we spent all of last season building up. I don't, uh, love it, as a storytelling decision.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I will say it was hard not even alluding to what was coming last week, but it was also kind of fun just letting you have your last "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2z6xw7/why_do_people_here_say_oh_sweet_summer_child_when/">Sweet Summer Child</a>" moments in the sun. I also felt that Joel's sudden absence hurt the remainder of the game, though based on the storytelling beats we've seen and/or missed so far, I wouldn't be shocked if we have some flashbacks...</p>
<p>Back in 2020, I actually had the shocking moment spoiled by some pretty major leaks that I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/be-warned-massive-the-last-of-us-part-2-spoilers-have-been-leaked/">ended up covering as a journalist</a> weeks before I was able to review the game myself.</p>
<p>Aside from that, though, the show kind of dampens the impact of "The Moment" by making Abby's motivations crystal clear for 1.5 episodes leading up to it. In the game, you actually play as a mostly blank-slate Abby for a few brief scenes before being rescued by Joel. After that, the shocking turnaround plays out as a quick gut punch during a cutscene that has a lot less Abby-monologuing than the show did.</p>
<p>The game doesn't fill in the details about the "why" of it all for the audience until much later, which makes the whole thing that much more impactful. But maybe the showrunners figured that since the game already exists, it would be hard to keep the audience off balance like that for weeks when they could just look up what was going on...</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: The monologuing was off-putting, honestly, and gets to the heart of what I'm concerned about. I'll refrain from speculating a ton about a game whose plot it would take me about 30 seconds to look up and read, but I'm not particularly excited to watch Ellie chase down this generically angst-ridden fresh-faced former Firefly? Does the show now need to be carried by a bunch of the Jackson Hole characters we just met? None of these possibilities are as interesting to me as watching Joel and an adult Ellie deal with their issues.</p>
<figure>
    <div id="caption-2090368"><p>
              Ellie will probably be just fine after all this, right?

<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah, I don't think it's spoiling much to say that Joel and Ellie's relationship carried the first game, and now it's obvious that Ellie's hunt for revenge is going to attempt to carry the second. It's a rough shift that I don't think did the second game any favors, personally.</p>
<p>The game goes to a lot of trouble to literally put you in Abby's shoes and eventually tries to try to make her own revenge saga feel a little more earned. Here, I feel like the show is being a bit more blunt about selling you her backstory at the front end and attempting to "justify" her brutal turn toward Joel somewhat in advance.</p>
<p>I wondered if you found yourself sympathizing at all with her character at this point.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Obviously what Joel did to the Fireflies is awful, maybe unforgiveable. Beyond the lie to Ellie, there's a strong possibility that he deprived humanity of a cure for the disease causing the very-much-ongoing apocalypse.</p>
<p>But, like, no! I don't sympathize with Abby! Not only is she driven solely by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I73sP93-0xA">this bland Inigo Montoya thing</a>, but she sadistically tortures someone who just saved her stupid life, brutalizing Joel so much that it drives her also-supposedly-revenge-driven Firefly friends to tears. If I'm supposed to sympathize with her, the show did pretty much everything possible to make sure I don't.</p>
<p>On paper, what Joel did is probably way worse, but we've also been primed by a whole season of TV (and by the charm of Pedro Pascal) to try and understand why he did what he did. None of this is really happening with Abby.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah, "supposed to sympathize with her" is a bit too strong, perhaps, especially at this point in the narrative. But I do think the show is trying to make her actions at least feel partially justified or understandable? It will be interesting to see how the show handles turning her into a more fleshed out character, because at this point, her revenge quest feels a bit mustache-twirling to me.</p>
<p>Backing up a bit, this episode also featured a huge set-piece zombie horde battle that ruins the brief calm we enjoyed in Jackson Hole. The scene played out so much like a video game mission that I had to go back and make sure I hadn't forgotten about some major Jackson Hole firefight in the game. But no, this is a pure creation of the show.</p>
<p>I think the whole thing worked pretty well both as a reminder of the precarity of the vestiges of human civilization and an excuse for some flashy special effects. I also thought for a second that they were actually going to kill off Tommy so the show had its own totally unexpected death, even for people who had played the game. That couple of minutes with the flamethrower was actually tense for me!</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Maybe Abby will become more fleshed-out, and maybe she won't. But she's started by making the exact same mistake as Joel: leaving witnesses.</p>
<p>I did enjoy the zombie battle a lot. The liquid churn of the snow as a million guys burst out from under it: creepy! Good on the show and HBO for figuring out a way to do a snowy zombie horde fight without making it feel too reminiscent of <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>
<p>I will, again, refrain from speculating overmuch about where the Jackson Hole storyline goes since I'm not even sure at this point how much time will be spent on the aftermath and rebuilding (if there is rebuilding rather than further societal collapse). I did find myself wondering during the flamethrower scene whether roasted mushroom guy smelled appetizing or whether people in this world can even bring themselves to enjoy mushrooms on a pizza or in an omelette.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I bet eating a normal mushroom in <em>The Last of Us</em> universe is akin to eating a hallucinogenic mushroom in the real world. A little bit of a dangerous taboo for iconoclastic rulebreakers to show they're open-minded.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: We've established that I have no idea what is going to happen next, but we do have dangling threads here to deal with next week. How do the residents of Jackson Hole deal with the fungus in their pipes? How many people try to talk Ellie out of her revenge tour before she goes off and does it anyway? How are the Smart Zombies we met last week going to come back and cause problems? How many more Abby flashbacks will I need to sit through?</p>
<p>But above all, I'm really curious to know what the show is going to do to keep game-players like yourself on your toes.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Last season we got <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/hbos-the-last-of-us-tries-a-little-tenderness-in-a-surprising-episode-3/">the surprising "Nick Offerman's life of love among the zombies" story</a> as the third episode, and I wouldn't mind a similar out of nowhere left turn to wash out Joel's death this time around. I'm not saying that <em>has</em> to take the form of what would be a stunning, unexpected, and completely illogical return of Offerman's Bill character. But if that is what the show decides to do, I would not complain.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 8 launches April 29 and, in addition to overhauling the game's endgame boss system, will also completely rework its battle pass to give players more control over which rewards interest them the most.</p><p dir="ltr">The new battle pass system is called The Reliquary, and it breaks down rewards that would typically be in the battle pass into a number of different categories. The core seasonal Reliquary will actually be free, and at least for Season 8, will include a new Town Portal cosmetic, a weapon cosmetic, mount cosmetics, and some of the game's premium currency, Platinum. Meanwhile, separate Reliquaries for cosmetic armor, weapons, and "beasts" (aka pets and mounts) will also be available to unlock with Platinum.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4478344-diablo4season8infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478344" data-ratio="0.56210191082803" data-width="1884" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4478344-diablo4season8infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478344"></a><figcaption>A look at what all is new in Diablo 4 Season 8.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4478344-diablo4season8infographic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each reward in each Reliquary can be unlocked in any order using a new currency called Favor Tokens that are earned from slaying monsters and completing quests. Claiming all of the rewards from a particular Reliquary will then grant a bonus reward that doesn't require a Favor Token to unlock. Players will be able to hold 99 Favor Tokens at one time, with items costing anywhere from two Favor Token to 10.</p><p dir="ltr">Individually, each Reliquary is cheaper than Diablo 4's previous battle passes, and Blizzard will offer a premium battle pass bundle that will include all of a season's Reliquaries for 1,000 Platinum, the same price as previous battle passes.</p><p dir="ltr">In a group interview attended by GameSpot, Diablo 4 associate director of game design Colin Finer shared more insight into what prompted the battle pass change.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we were thinking about the battle pass, we had gotten a lot of feedback that it just wasn't in the spirit of Diablo," Finer said. "There was just a bunch of stuff that you didn't actually care about. You're grinding through a bunch of things and you didn't really have any agency. That didn't feel Diablo. Diablo's all about that agency, playing it your way. That's why we have bosses that allow you to target Uniques. We felt like the battle pass wasn't servicing that.</p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of the changes to the battle pass and introducing the Reliquary system is really about putting players in the driver's seat in order to target the rewards they are looking for. We think this is a lot more Diablo, it's a lot more control on the player's end. We think it's a pretty big improvement."</p><p dir="ltr">Players may remember that Diablo 4's previous battle passes actually granted players free seasonal power in the form of Smoldering Ashes that could be used to improve Season Blessings, buffs that granted more XP or other perks for the duration of the season. While the old battle pass system is no more, Smoldering Ashes and Season Blessing will now be incorporated as part of the game's Seasonal Journey system and work exactly as before.</p><p dir="ltr">There will also be special Event Reliquaries that will be available for shorter amounts of time than a typical season. That piece of info goes hand-in-hand with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-crossing-over-with-dark-fantasy-manga-series-berserk-for-its-first-ip-collab/1100-6530944/" data-ref-id="1100-6530944">Diablo 4's upcoming IP crossover with the dark fantasy manga, Berserk</a>, set to begin on May 6 and which will no doubt take advantage of the new system.</p>

It not only brings new bosses into the endgame, including the return of the fan-favorite Belial from Diablo 3, but also makes changes to existing bosses to make them more challenging. It overhauls how to access (and gain loot from) endgame bosses, as well as a few other flourishes to make the whole endgame boss loop more interesting, and rewarding, than before. The icing on top is that defeating each boss will let players harness some of their most-iconic abilities in the form of new seasonal powers that can be incorporated into builds for game-changing combinations.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot chatted with Diablo 4 lead season designer Deric Nuñez and associate director of game design Colin Finer ahead of Season 8 to get more insight about the upcoming changes, learning why Blizzard wanted to prioritize boss ladder changes (now referred to by Blizzard as the Lair Boss system) ahead of other endgame updates coming later in the year. We also discussed how the team looked to address negative social experiences while grouping up for boss runs with Season 8's changes, and how the team used Belial's return as a way to inject more personality into the entire endgame system.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Boss Ladder Reborn</h2><p dir="ltr">When it came time to decide what endgame feature to focus on improving first, Nuñez said the team looked at what changes would have the "most immediate impact." The boss ladder was an obvious choice, and the team knew that just adding Belial as a new boss wouldn't cut it. The whole system needed to change.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a very heavily trafficked and highly engaged-with endgame feature," Nuñez said. "All of our endgame features are top priorities but we have to start stack ranking in some regards, so we saw a really cool opportunity…to put the Lair Boss system front and center, from just a prioritization and player-impact perspective."</p><p dir="ltr">In Season 8, much of what players know about fighting the game's endgame bosses is gone. No longer do players need multiple types of summoning materials per boss. Instead, players can challenge the bosses at any time, without having to pay an upfront material cost only to then find it too challenging. Each boss will item chest that can be looted after their defeat, but only if a player has a boss-specific Lair Key to open it. Loot pools have been adjusted to offer a wider-range of Unique items as rewards while still keeping the ability to target farm specific Uniques from specific bosses intact. On higher Torment difficulties, bosses will reward even more loot than before. And Belial, one of the biggest and most memorable boss fights in the franchise's history, now permeates every aspect of the system by not only serving as Diablo 4's new greatest challenge but by also having a chance to appear and wreak havoc while fighting other bosses as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479007-diablo4season8belial.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479007" data-ratio="0.56241699867198" data-width="3012" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479007-diablo4season8belial.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479007"></a><figcaption>Belial has a chance to appear after defeating endgame bosses, with bonus loot to boot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479007-diablo4season8belial.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As players may remember, Belial, the Lord of Lies, came in two distinct forms in Diablo 3. He at first appeared in a smaller, less-intimidating form, before transforming into a massive, kaiju-sized demon unlike anything else in Diablo. Both of Belial's forms will be present in Diablo 4 come Season 8. When players take him on in his own lair, he will be just as oversized as players remember in what Blizzard calls his "supreme" form. But when he appears randomly after defeating another boss, players will encounter him in his lesser form. Defeating him will reward even more loot, adding a cherry on top and another injection of dopamine into Diablo 4's endgame loop.</p><p dir="ltr">"His coolness, nostalgia, and versatility in who he is as one of the great evils was a really fun opportunity that inspired more beyond the initial call to action of 'upgrade the Lair Boss system,'" Nuñez said.</p><p dir="ltr">Finer said just about everybody who makes it to Diablo 4's Torment difficulty will be able to eventually overcome Belial Supreme, as intimidating as he may be. It will be on the game's highest difficulty, Torment 4, where Belial truly becomes a challenge but will offer even better rewards to compensate. Belial will be special in Diablo 4 in that players get to choose which endgame boss loot table they want to pull from as a reward after defeating him, with Belial sporting a much-higher drop chance for coveted Uniques alongside guaranteed Ancestral item rolls, the most powerful items in the game. Considering how Blizzard is ramping up the difficulty in Diablo 4 Season 8 in part by reducing the drop rate of Legendary and Ancestral items, defeating Belial will be a key way to deck out characters in the best gear possible.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger</h2><p dir="ltr">It's not just Belial that will prove a challenge. Diablo 4 Season 8 will also introduce two bosses from the game's Vessel of Hatred expansion campaign, Urivar and the Harbinger of Hatred, into the endgame boss rotation. Players may think they know these encounters already, but Nuñez made clear that adding a boss from the campaign into the endgame isn't a "cut and paste" job. In addition to visual changes, the boss fights themselves are in many ways superpowered versions of their story campaign counterparts, with new mechanics inspired by what came before.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's taking inspiration from the main boss, but really amplifying it to the highest creativity of the encounter designer's passion of where they want to take it," Nuñez said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479006-diablo4season8harbingerofhatred.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479006" data-ratio="0.5625980545968" data-width="3187" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479006-diablo4season8harbingerofhatred.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479006"></a><figcaption>The Harbinger of Hatred boss fight from Vessel of Hatred has been revamped as a Lair Boss.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479006-diablo4season8harbingerofhatred.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The goals of the new Lair Boss system are numerous, Blizzard said. Not only does Blizzard want players to fight a wider variety of more challenging bosses thanks to the loot table changes, but it also wants each boss kill to be more rewarding. Blizzard is keen on having players be able to challenge bosses without having to put up precious materials, but is wanting players to fight bosses and gain access to their rewards less frequently. Making it so players aren't required to put up materials just to fight the boss also freed Blizzard to make them more difficult, so that players will actually have to engage with each boss' mechanics rather than waiting to confront them when they know they are strong enough to one-shot them.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Lair Boss system and its new key mechanic is also there to help reduce bad social experiences players have had with the game's old boss-summoning system by requiring all players have their own key in order to access their personal loot.</p><p dir="ltr">"We noticed the boss summoning flow wasn't conducive to social play that wasn't negative," Finer said about the old boss-summoning system. "We saw a lot of people complaining about leeching. If you hopped into a game, you might have that person, maybe it's Belial on the other side of the screen, saying, 'Yeah, I'm totally going to put up materials to chain boss fight,' but then they don't and they drop out and it's like, 'I can't believe you've done this.'"</p><p dir="ltr">However, Blizzard still wants to encourage players to group up by offering bonus items based on the number of players in a party when fighting bosses, without making grouping feel mandatory. Finer said all the changes are the "culmination of about a year of feedback" about the boss-summoning system, and that reducing the inventory clutter from so many boss-summoning materials makes the entire Lair Boss system far more streamlined.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479008-diablo4season8infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479008" data-ratio="0.56210191082803" data-width="1884" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479008-diablo4season8infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479008"></a><figcaption>A look at all the changes and features coming as part of Diablo 4 Season 8.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479008-diablo4season8infographic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All together, Season 8's Lair Boss system makes for significant changes to Diablo 4's endgame that on paper sound like they will continue to push the game further in the right direction. Whether Season 8 will have as much of an impact as previous game-altering updates like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/">Loot Reborn</a> remains to be seen, but it's clear Blizzard knows that simply adding a boss or a new seasonal feature doesn't quite move the needle.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we were looking at how we wanted to necessarily go about expanding this feature, we didn't think that adding a new boss to it was enough necessarily," Nuñez said. "We wanted to inject new novel mechanics during the day-to-day of how players actually engage with it."</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 8 goes live on April 29. In addition to the new bosses, seasonal boss powers, and the Lair Boss system, Season 8 will also completely <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/">rework Diablo 4's battle pass into a new system called The Reliquary</a> where players will have more agency over picking their rewards. Blizzard has also revealed the game's first external IP crossover will be with none other than the legendary dark fantasy manga by the late Kentaro Miura, Berserk. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-crossing-over-with-dark-fantasy-manga-series-berserk-for-its-first-ip-collab/1100-6530944/">Diablo 4 Berserk crossover</a>, which is also coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-immortal/">Diablo Immortal</a>, will begin on May 6.</p>

			<p>The first thing you notice about Compulsion Games' latest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a>, might be its striking visuals, but its strongest aspect is its excellent storytelling.</p>
<p>That includes the writing and performances in the cutscenes and the notes you can discover that add more context to the story. That's why, beyond just doing it for the achievement, it is worth your time to try and find all of the 103 notes there are to find across the 14 chapters of South of Midnight's story.</p>
<p>This guide will show you where to find the 4 notes hiding in Chapter 8.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 8</h2>
<p>After having to look out for 15 notes in Chapter 7, you'll be happy to know that Chapter 8 is a much easier time with only 4 notes to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Their Eyes Were Watching -&nbsp;</strong>You'll be able to find this note right at the beginning of the level, immediately after using a wind tunnel for the first time. When you land, it'll be waiting on a tree stump to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta-346-Weird Happenings -</strong> After using a wind tunnel for the second time in the level, head left when you land to find a Floof knot and this note lying on the ground.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta-346- Red Yarn</strong> - After finding the previous note, you'll have to clear some branches away to wall-run over a gap. When you reach the other side, on the right side of the path, you'll find some sunflowers with a tree stump next to them, where you'll find this note waiting for you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta 346 - Search Called Off</strong> - You'll find this note just after the first combat encounter of the level. Use the grapple hook to cross the gap after completing the encounter, and before heading into the cave blocked by wood and red yarn, this note will be on the ground on the right side of the path.</p>
<p>And that's where to find all the notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 8. If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, you'll have found 57 notes by now. Only 46 more to find.</p>

After years worth of rumors, Bethesda has finally acknowledged that the<em> Oblivion</em> remaster is real. <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023">In a post on social media</a>, Bethesda revealed a simple image featuring the roman number IV — alluding to the fact that <em>Oblivion</em> is the fourth in the<em> Elder Scrolls</em> series — and the date and time of April 22nd at 8AM PT. Of course this all means that tomorrow morning, Bethesda will reveal more about the remaster including, hopefully, a release date.</p><p>Rumors have been circulating about an <em>Oblivion</em> remaster since 2023. The first hints were revealed in documents related to the Federal Trade Commissions case against Microsoft where an <em>Oblivion</em> remaster was mentioned alongside several other planned games including what became <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. Then, last week, images from the alleged remaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648877/oblivion-remaster-images-leaked-microsoft">leaked on a developer’s website</a> before being swiftly taken down which all but confirmed the game’s existence.</p><p>Unless you count<em> Elder Scrolls Online</em> which released its eighth expansion just last year, there hasn’t been a new mainline entry in the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> series since <em>Skyri</em>m in 2011. (Unless you also count <em>Skyrim</em>’s many, <em>many</em> ports for each new console generation since its launch.) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447808/elder-scrolls-6-announcement-reveal-bethesda-e3-2018"><em>Elder Scrolls VI</em> was announced in 2018</a> but since then, no word on its development. An <em>Oblivion</em> remaster then is perfectly timed to tide fans over while they wait for Todd Howard and the development gang to give them something, <em>anything</em>, on the new game.</p><p>You can watch the <em>Oblivion</em> remaster livestream tomorrow April 22nd at 8AM PT/ 11 AM ET on Bethesda’s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Ed_E2crglcw?si=F_1LNlvlUwyBF_XS">YouTube</a> channel.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/good-morning-to-all-my-blue-prince-non-sickos.1169514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-beginner<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The–sorry–<em>discourse</em> around <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Blue Prince</em></a> has been weird as hell. Everyone who got access to it before its launch came out of the gate raving about it. This set up a lot of expectations for its wider release; from the conversations I’ve seen, some people feel pressured to like it, or like they don’t “get” the game if they don’t. Others seem to feel they have to defend why they aren’t psyched on it, while people who love it are quick to offer advice for those who don’t. I’ve been doing my best to play the game over the last few weeks, but I’m struggling to figure out how to approach it in a sensible way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When the headline for this blog popped into my head after playing <em>Blue Prince</em> all Sunday morning when I meant to go outside instead, I realized I’d written a not-dissimilar blog about <a href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-steam-meta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Balatro</em></a> early in its popularity. That was another game that 1. noted sicko Chris Person <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-nerve-of-balatro-for-being-this-good" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loved</a>, and 2. has a depth that gobbled up players’ time in a manner similar to <em>Blue Prince. </em>Both games appear straightforward on their surface but hide a ton of discoverable strategies and secrets. This is a good thing: It rules that we’ve been getting such a wealth of <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unique</a> indie games these days.</p><p>I <em>think</em> I’m liking <em>Blue Prince</em>? I’ll admit that I’m less than 20 in-game days into it, in part because I kept watching YouTube guides and then starting new saves. I don’t think I’ve had any kind of big “ah-ha” moment over its puzzles yet. I’ve definitely realized something I thought was just set-dressing was actually a clue, and I’ve already been smugly sure I understood what a puzzle wanted only to find more information that let me know I was totally wrong. I haven’t had a moment that makes me want to sink all my free time&nbsp; into it yet, but that doesn’t mean I’m not enjoying it. I’m the happiest in the game when I draft a room I haven’t seen before because exploration is one of my favorite things in games, and I like the promise that there’s lots of new things to see that I have no inkling of yet.</p><p>But the qualities that make the game so compelling for players diving into its endless depths also make it hard to get into. I have this constant vague stress that I’m <em>missing</em> something because I’ve been told there’s so much to miss, or the feeling I have too many chores because I vaguely know there’s so much to do; at the same time, I can’t just check off these tasks during a run given the game’s interconnectedness and RNG. The exhortation to “take notes” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pokachee.bsky.social/post/3lmuam4o6fk2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">baffles</a> me: what are the notes supposed to <em>look</em> like, what am I supposed to be taking notes <em>on</em> if I don’t even know what could be a clue yet? Lately I’ve taken to organizing my notes by day, just to give them some kind of structure. It’s possible this advice doesn’t gel with me because, as a games journalist, I’m almost always taking notes when I play a game anyway, so “take notes” for <em>Blue Prince</em> isn’t as helpful advice as, say, being told I’ll need a notebook to do math for <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>.</p><p>When I try to bring these feelings up to <em>Blue Prince </em>devotees, they struggle to offer meaningful advice. I’m not always sure what I’m supposed to be <em>doing </em>in the game in a metaphysical sense, and anyone who can nudge me in that direction has tens to over one hundred hours in the game but doesn’t want to spoil anything in a game where everything seems to be a spoiler. Sometimes it feels like the nature of press and players getting early code has a little bit accidentally ruined the game for those of us just starting: you have <em>Blue Prince </em>experts and <em>Blue Prince </em>noobs, and we’re shouting to each other across the unspeakable chasm that is the nature of the game. It feels like people who <em>love</em> the game are in love with a game I haven’t started playing yet, and they can’t do much to guide me toward that game without unintentionally ruining the process that made them fall in love with it.&nbsp;</p><p>In general I try to avoid slating myself into the category of “normal” people when it comes to video games, since I play them for work and am surrounded by other people who do the same. But in the case of <em>Blue Prince</em> I’ve realized that maybe I need to not talk to my professional peers about it and instead turn to you, our readers, and my real-life friends who are playing the game alongside me. We are playing the game that many other people played weeks or months ago, and they played that game without the lure, but also the pressure, of the passion for the game’s secrets to navigate alongside its shifting house.</p><p>How are you drowning out the noise and just… playing the game? What are you literally <em>doing</em> in a run; what do your notes look like? How are you setting goals? Are you <em>liking</em> the game–do you feel like you’re making meaningful progress, or are you, like me, constantly a little bit stressed that you’re doing it wrong? (In fairness, I feel this way about everything in my life.) How do you decide how long to play for, or when to end your play session for the night? Do you have any tips that aren’t spoilers, but also aren’t the same “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blue+prince+tips+beginner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NO SPOILERS</a>!” videos that tread the same ground about strategic dead ends and notebooks? Did it take you as long to realize the pun of the game’s name as it took me?</p><p>It’s cool to have an indie game that’s stoked so much passion, and I think it’s a real testament to the game’s design that it’s created such a uniquely-shaped conversation. When I’m frustrated in my runs, I do draw inspiration from the possibility that the next room I draft might be the one where I cross the threshold from <em>Blue Prince</em> curious to <em>Blue Prince</em> fanatic. I will surely get there long after everyone else has moved on to the next thing, but maybe all of us non-sickos can get there together.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/otk-asmongold-mizkif-twitch-youtube-sponsors-controversy-report"><h3>How OTK Lost Its Way</h3></a><p>OTK was meant to be an org for and by some of the world's biggest streamers, but thanks to egos, whims, and controversies, it's proven to be anything but a sure bet

		<p>Bethesda will reveal the long-rumoured The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake tomorrow, the renovated classic expected to launch for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and available with ‘day one’ tiers of Xbox Game Pass as well. It’s anticipated that this will be a ‘shadow drop’ launch, with the reveal coming alongside the game’s release.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake will be revealed on Tuesday 22nd April at 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm BST, and you can watch it here on YouTube:</p>
<p><iframe title="All will be revealed...." width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ed_E2crglcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion has been reported and rumoured to be in the works for close to half a decade, first appearing in unredacted court filings, with further reports in the last few years, and then the slam dunk leak last week coming from the website of developer Virtuos.</p>
<p>A batch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/15/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-screenshots-leak-from-developer-website/">Oblivion remake images</a> were found in the backend of the Virtuos website, as enterprising Reddit users started to poke around. They include screenshots of the game, comparison shots between this version of the game and the 2006 original, and more. Having been hosted on the Virtuos servers in a publicly accessible fashion, they were hastily copied across to other hosts before Virtuos could pull their site offline.</p>

<p>Getting our first look at the game, what was immediately clear was the huge jump up in graphical detail on show in the 2025 version of Oblivion, with less of the hazy bloom effect from the early Xbox 360 days, in favour of a late afternoon glow and tons more grass.</p>
<p>Originally founded in Shanghai and now headquartered in Singapore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuos">Virtuos</a> is a huge company with thousands of employees and teams dotted around the world. The company has often provided co-development support on major projects, such as art for the Horizon series and co-dev for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, as well as a variety of ports and remaster projects big and small. Oblivion could be their most notable work yet, and with the game so close to being in our hands, it will be fascinating to see how it has come together and how closely it sticks to or diverges from the original.</p>
<p>Not long to go…</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remaster-finally-officially-revealed-probably-launching-tomorrow.1169502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bethesda has finally officially revealed the long-mooted&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster, and more information about the game is coming tomorrow, although it's not clear whether the much-discussed shadowdrop will be happening.</p>

<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Bethesda X account, the studio simply says "tomorrow, 11am EST", pointing to links to the official Bethesda and Twitch channels. The post is accompanied by an image that includes an "IV" logo and the outline of an armored face.</p>

<p>It's pretty clear the post refers to the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster;&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>is, after all, the fourth&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls&nbsp;</em>game, and the "IV" in the image looks the same as the one included as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">a set of leaked images</a> depicting scenes and artwork from the remaster last week.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed-original.jpg?itok=YSKkSodM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed-original.jpg?itok=O7mf0oLa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>is officially getting a remaster.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've somehow missed out on all of this, Bethesda's upcoming <i>Oblivion&nbsp;</i>remaster-slash-remake is probably one of the gaming industry's worst-kept secrets right now.</p>

<p>Rumors of the remaster have been swirling for some time, and the existence of the project was essentially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed" rel="nofollow">confirmed back in January</a>, when reports pointed to a mistakenly-uploaded website that included information about the game, as well as screenshots.</p>

<p>Following that, new images appeared on the website of developer Virtuos, which is widely believed to be the studio handling the project. Those images included pretty conclusive proof that the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster is happening, including the aforementioned artwork that matches Bethesda's latest announcement.</p>

<p>Further leaks appeared earlier today when the file size of the remaster was supposedly <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/04/21/oblivion-remastered-file-size-on-steam-datamined/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">datamined</a>, with reports suggesting the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster will come in at a hefty 120GB. Better clear up some space on that SSD.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed-combat.jpg?itok=3WrDcjB8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed-combat.jpg?itok=DTKbLakt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>120GB will get you a remaster that doesn't look like this.</figcaption></figure><p>Several leakers have suggested that the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster will be shadowdropping (i.e. launching essentially without warning) tomorrow, but the trailer to which Bethesda points is simply titled "All will be revealed...", so we might just be in for an announcement tomorrow.</p>

<p>Either way, it looks like Bethesda's&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster is definitely happening. Stay tuned for more.</p>

This means that an item’s specific price will vary to reflect a user’s local region so that it’s equivalent around the world.</p><p>Right now, in-experience prices are the same globally (the platform is currently available in 180 countries). But if a developer turns on regional pricing for an in-game item like a <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/game-passes">pass</a> (typically things with a one-time fee like access to a special area in a game or a permanent power-up), Roblox will automatically adjust the price in Robux, Roblox’s in-game currency, as needed.</p><p>Regional pricing will also become an option for avatar items “later this year,” according to <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/04/roblox-launches-regional-pricing-for-in-experience-items">a Roblox blog post</a>.</p><p>In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Enrico D’Angelo, Roblox’s VP of economy, says that the main reason the company waited this long to implement regional pricing was because there was a “real risk” about arbitrage.</p><p>“The moment you have the same item being sold for different prices, and, in some cases, dramatically different prices, you can imagine how crafty some people can get,” he says.

                <p>Amid a flurry of leaks and rumors, Bethesda has now announced that it will make some kind of announcement on April 22 pertaining to "IV." Combined with an image of a character with a shielded face, many are taking this to be a reference to the heavily rumored The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster. This seems like a pretty safe bet, especially considering images and details about an apparent Oblivion remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-info-and-screens-leak-apparently-releasing-next-week/1100-6530870/" data-ref-id="1100-6530870">recently leaked on developer Virtuos' website.</a></p><p>Whatever it is, we'll find out on April 22 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET.</p><p>A remake of Oblivion has been rumored for years, dating back to when it was first mentioned in the court documents that came out of the FTC vs. Microsoft case. It was initially rumored that an Oblivion remaster could have a shadowdrop on April 21, but that's apparently not going to happen.</p><p>In addition to launching on PC, Oblivion was an Xbox exclusive on console when it debuted in 2006, before coming to PS3 in 2007. The open-world RPG is fondly remembered for its story and gameplay--and infamously for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-horse-armor-now-available/1100-6147013/" data-ref-id="1100-6147013">horse armor</a>, which was a prominent early example of DLC. Bethesda boss Todd Howard later reflected on the horse armor, saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-on-elder-scrolls-horse-armor-people-wi/1100-6467386/" data-ref-id="1100-6467386">"people will buy anything."</a></p><p>Bethesda followed up Oblivion with the enormously popular The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in 2011. Bethesda is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, but there is no word yet on when it might be released.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Finally, after weeks of <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-april-release/">leaks</a> and even official <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">screenshots appearing online</a>, Bethesda has not only officially acknowledged The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remake but also announced that we'll get a full reveal and showcase of the game tomorrow, <strong>April 22, 2025</strong>, at <strong>8 am PT / 11 am ET / 4 pm BT.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>A short <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023">post</a> from the studio's official X account tells us when we'll learn more about the long-awaited remake and where to check it out, with the 'where' being either the Bethesda <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Ed_E2crglcw">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda">Twitch</a> channels.</p>
<p>The title of the video on Bethesda's YouTube channel says "<em>All will be revealed...,</em>" hopefully implying that we'll not only learn about what has gone into the remake, the new features available, and the release date.</p>
<p><iframe title="All will be revealed...." width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ed_E2crglcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The release date could very well be tomorrow, shortly after the reveal. Rumors about the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remake already had their sights set on today, or at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/">sometime</a> in the back half of April, for the game's release.</p>
<p>In hindsight, we know that those rumors claiming an April 21 release had their wires crossed with today's announcement that the reveal would be tomorrow. But now we can expect to play Oblivion on at least Xbox consoles and PCs before the week is out. It's still up in the air whether it'll be available on PS5 right away or if Xbox players will enjoy a short period of exclusivity for the remake before it comes to PS5.</p>

In fact, it seems <a href="https://valm.qq.com/act/a20250312preregister/?e_code=547223">pre-registration for a playtest of <em>Valorant Mobile</em></a> is already open to Chinese players, <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/04/valorant-mobile-pre-registration-is-now-open-in-china">spotted <em>Esports Insider</em></a>. </p></div><p>Riot Games first said it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22458279/valorant-mobile-spinoff-riot-games">creating a mobile version of <em>Valorant</em> in 2021</a>, and the previously PC-only game launched on Xbox Series X / S and PS5 consoles <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211812/valorant-console-launch-xbox-series-s-x-ps5-download">last August</a>. Chinese studio LightSpeed is handling development, but there’s no indication of when <em>Valorant Mobile </em>will get a release in other countries as the post only says it’s “starting in China and taking it from there.” According to <em>Esports Insider</em>, the company has already done some playtesting in the country, and those who register for the new test can earn exclusive player cards via in-game missions. The outlet links to two unlisted videos, including a trailer for the game.</p><p>The announcement follows a trend of big-name shooters like <em>Call of Duty</em> getting mobile releases that stretches back a few years. LightSpeed also developed mobile versions of <em>PUBG </em>and <em>Apex Legends</em>, the latter of which shut down in 2023.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
