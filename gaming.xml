			<p>The brand-new aerobatic open-world survival RPG is available to try out for those who are at Gamescom. However, if you aren't, don't fret. Fera: The Sundered Tribes just got an official early access date. This title is made by Massive Damage, the studio that made games like Halcyon 6 and Star Renegades. Their highly anticipated title, Fera: The Sundered Tribes, now officially has an Early Access date.</p>
<p>This title was first announced last year during IGN's post-show for <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-company-to-return-to-gamescom-2023-company-registrations-up-10-compared-to-last-year/">Gamescom's Opening Night Live</a>. Fera: The Sundered Tribes will be available in Early Access for PC on Steam as of September 17, 2024.</p>
<p>The game has a high social media following, with plenty of people expressing their excitement for the gameplay. Players will soar through the skies, searching for behemoth beasts in vibrant, lush landscapes. The game includes elements of hunting and harvesting, aerial combat, and the capability to participate in co-op gameplay. In addition to these, people can also build their village and work to lead their own tribe.</p>
<p>Combining these elements results in a stunning post-apocalyptic fantasy world as players grapple and soar through stunning vistas to fight colossal creatures to protect and provide for your growing colony and the inhabitants.</p>
<p>"While it's daunting for us as an indie studio to take on a game genre inhabited by behemoth studios with massive budgets, we're thrilled to see our Tiktok videos going viral and flooded by players excited by the concept of 'monster hunting with wingsuits' and eager to get their hands on Fera," says Ken Soto, CEO and co-founder of Massive Damage, Inc.</p>
<p>With the Early Access of Fera: The Sundered Tribes, there is a huge open world for players to explore, with up to four players able to join the game.&nbsp; There are over ten monster species for you to hunt in-game and four distinct weapon classes to give you the opportunity for variety and playing how you want.</p>
<p>This game was featured at the Summer Games Fest Play Days and was designated as one of the GDC "Best in Play" winners. For those who want to purchase the Early Access of Fera: The Sundered Tribes, you can purchase it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2469200/Fera_The_Sundered_Tribes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam for $29.99</a>, with the game being fully released sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>When it is fully released, the game will be available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, with more platforms to follow after the release.</p>

The QuadCast 2 and QuadCast 2 S now include a streamlined multifunction control dial and welcome upgrades to their recording quality.</p><p>The <a href="https://hyperx.com/products/hyperx-quadcast-s-usb-microphone?variant=41031692058781">original versions</a> of the HyperX QuadCast mics delivered a lot of functionality at a sub-$200 price point, including multiple pickup patterns and programmable LED lighting. But recording quality maxed out at 16-bit/48kHz. The new QuadCast 2 boosts recording quality up to 24-bit/96 kHz, while the QuadCast 2 S goes even higher, maxing out at 32-bit/192kHz.</p><p>The new versions are still priced under $200, although each has received a price bump. The QuadCast 2 is now $149.99 instead of $139.99, while the QuadCast 2 S is $199.99, up from $159.99.</p><div><figcaption><em>The QuadCast 2 is still limited to just red LEDs that turn off when the mic is muted.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: HyperX</cite></p></div><p>Both mics now feature USB-C ports (the original QuadCast was microUSB), and while the previous versions featured separate knobs for changing pickup patterns and adjusting gain, the QuadCast 2 and QuadCast 2 S have a single multifunction dial on the front that handles “gain adjustment, volume control, mic monitoring, and polar pattern selection.”</p><p>HyperX has also redesigned the shock mounts on the new models, making the microphones easier to remove without having to unscrew or disassemble anything.</p><p>The new mics carry over the LED lighting of their predecessors. The QuadCast 2 is still limited to red LEDs that turn off when the mic is muted, while the QuadCast 2 S features 100 multicolor addressable LEDs that can be controlled using HyperX’s Ngenuity desktop software to match a gaming room’s aesthetic.</p><p>The QuadCast S is due to become available today, but the more capable QuadCast S 2 is expected to be released sometime in November.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Placing points in these will be vital to your success in the game, as they provide very helpful boons. And while the order in which you level them should ultimately be dependent on your playstyle, we’ve compiled a list of skills we think most players will want to invest in early, if you’re looking to get the most out of the early hours of the game.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h123231"><a id=""></a><strong>Robust Constitution</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Survival</strong></p><p>Robust Constitution increases your maximum health by a moderate amount for every point you invest in it. We’d recommend pumping at least three of your early Spark Points into this skill. Some of the early fights can be challenging as you’re getting to grips with the game’s mechanics, and having that extra health can make a huge difference to your survivability when you miss a dodge.</p><h2 id="h123232"><a id=""></a><strong>Swift Engage</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Martial Arts</strong></p><p>Swift Engage is an incredible skill to invest in right away, because it increases the engaging distance of your light attack, which is most often the manner in which you’ll begin attacking a foe. Without this skill, your light attack will essentially keep you locked in place, requiring you to manually move to an enemy to make contact. With two Spark Points invested, however, you’ll be able to automatically close pretty significant gaps between you and the enemy by just tapping your light attack button.</p><figure id="" data-id="fed19bbc09c17e975d426228a6eb2d69" data-recommend-id="image://fed19bbc09c17e975d426228a6eb2d69" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fighting a beastie in Black Myth Wukong." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fighting a beastie in Black Myth Wukong." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fed19bbc09c17e975d426228a6eb2d69" data-recommend-id="image://fed19bbc09c17e975d426228a6eb2d69" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fighting a beastie in Black Myth Wukong." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h123233"><a id=""></a><strong>Simian Agility</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Stamina</strong></p><p>Each point in Simian Agility reduces the stamina cost of dodging by a bit, letting you more efficiently move around a battlefield. During the early part of the game, you’ll still be learning how much stamina you need to perform certain actions, so having a bit more to work with is never a bad thing. More importantly, though, investment in this skill opens up some extremely helpful additional skills in the Stamina tree.</p><h2 id="h123234"><a id=""></a><strong>Deft Evasion</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Stamina</strong></p><p>After purchasing Simian Agility, you’ll have access to Deft Evasion. This is one of the best skills you can pick up early on, as it will increase the distance of your initial dodge. This makes a massive difference when enemies (bosses, especially) have large, sweeping attacks that require you to give a wide berth.</p><h2 id="h123235"><a id=""></a><strong>Composure</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Stamina</strong></p><p>If you’ve purchased Simian Agility and Deft Evasion, you’re half of the way to Composure. You’ll just need to invest one point each in Endurance and Everlasting Vigor to access it.</p><p>We’d recommend you go that route, as this skill will allow you to keep a combo going even after you dodge. Since combos are a vital part of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s combat, this will vastly improve your efficiency when facing off against foes. Simply dodge out of the way of your enemy’s attack, then immediately continue wailing away with the combo you started.</p><p>With these skills purchased, you’ll be ready to begin spending points in your Stances trees and beyond to really hone in on your personal playstyle. We’re wishing you the best of luck out there!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Starbreeze <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-appoints-mats-juhl-as-new-interim-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appointed Mats Juhl</a> as its new interim CEO in May 2024. Today, Juhl issued new comments about the D&amp;D game currently titled Project Baxter. </p>



<p>Juhl said that Project Baxter is now in full production, and that it is “growing as planned” and “continues at full speed.” </p>



<p>They also confirmed plans to consider new partnerships on the game. Juhl stated that although Starbreeze will publish the game “our ambition is to enter into partnerships where this is beneficial for the game and Starbreeze.” </p>



<p>Juhl clarified these partnerships could reinforce “marketing, physical distribution or other purposes that increase both the quality and potential of the project, whilst balancing the risk for Starbreeze.”</p>

<p>The new report also elaborated on the timing for potential partnerships. Juhl says “Project Baxter will enter a phase in the fall where we will be more proactive in searching for and holding discussions with suitable partners.” </p>



<p>In today’s quarterly report, Juhl also reiterated Project Baxter’s 2026 release window. Starbreeze confirmed that when it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-developer-is-making-a-dungeons-and-dragons-live-service-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced</a> the title in December 2023. </p>



<p>According to the official site, Project Baxter is an Unreal Engine game featuring “co-operative multiplayer, lifetime commitment through a Games as a Service-model, [and] community engagement.”</p>

                <p dir="ltr">From 1999 to 2015, Backyard Sports was a beloved kid-friendly sports game franchise with colorful graphics, easy gameplay, and one of the most dominant athletes in video game history in Pablo Sanchez. Today, Playground Productions has announced that Backyard Sports is coming back, and it's doing so as more than just video games.</p><p dir="ltr">Backyard Sports will be returning "across multiple verticals, including video games, merchandise, film, television and more" according to a press release. The first of these projects will launch "in the coming months," but nothing specific--including whether or not it's a video game or what platforms it will arrive on--was announced.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EleREfyN428" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EleREfyN428" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A brief teaser trailer was released alongside the announcement, which shows multiple kids in the signature Backyard Sports art style preparing for a baseball game. We see a treehouse with league standings and tournament brackets, the playground itself, and then as the pitcher takes the mound, Pablo Sanchez steps up to bat.</p><p dir="ltr">Playground Productions was founded in 2022 by Lindsay Barrett, a former second-grade teacher with "over a decade of experience in the Chicago public school system." The <a href="https://www.playground-productions.com/" rel="nofollow ">company's website</a> says that by "leveraging the best technology, talent, and character IP, Playground creates content that celebrates the spirit of play, meets children where they are developmentally, and allows kids to be kids."</p><p dir="ltr">Backyard Sports debuted on PC as Backyard Baseball in October 1997, with Backyard Soccer and Backyard Football following it in September 1998 and October 1999 respectively. The most-recent Backyard Sports games before this announcement were on mobile devices, as both Backyard Sports: Baseball 2015 and Backyard Sports: Basketball 2015 launched simultaneously in February 2015. A Backyard Sports movie was also announced in 2016, but the project never moved forward.</p>

Ever since Chow Yun Fat slid down that banister in Hard Boiled, game developers have tried over and over again to capture that particular mix of style and action—but in a medium that has all kinds of shooting genres (top-down, first-person, third-person, etc), it's a surprisingly tricky mechanic to get right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why? Well you only need look at the "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/shockwave-game-updates">Akimbo</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" system in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to find out. According to an email chat with a few developers from Respawn, implementing it required "monumental" technical work, a more grinding task than the "art" of developing Season 22's new map "E-District."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While developers like lead level designer Steve Young and map designer Garret Metcalfe got to experiment with building novel locales designed around the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/apex-legends-next-season-brings-mid-match-character-leveling">new character leveling system</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, lead systems BR designer Eric Canavese and his colleagues had to crawl back over 5 years of content and code to bring basic pistols like the P2020 and Mozambique into a dual-wielding era.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Apex Legends"><span>Apex Legends</span>' akimbo system opens up new design possibilities</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Canavese, Respawn originally conceived of Akimbo weapons as being unique guns that players could pick up. That way all the animations, design, and code requirements could go through the process of being designed as any other new weapon.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/the-secret-to-apex-legends-gorgeous-first-person-animation-mouth-cameras" target="_self">The secret to Apex Legends' gorgeous first-person animation? Mouth cameras</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While "evaluating" that idea, Canavese said the team saw a window to build out an entire dual-wielding system—one that could jolt life into lower-tier weapons and make them attractive options throughout the whole game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But even with a more open-ended system aimed at capturing that John Woo action fantasy, Respawn's solution highlights the constraints first-person developers find themselves in. Grabbing another gun increases the firing speed of the given weapon, enables automatic fire, and tightens the hipfire to a more narrow zone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Already you can see one missing piece of the fantasy: the player's weapons are locked in one direction, axing the possibility of pointing the weapons in different targets. This limited system also doesn't let players dual-wield different weapons like they can in the Halo and Wolfenstein series. Those aren't terrible tradeoffs—but then you encounter the hardcore development challenges the team ran into.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a five-year-old game, and though some core functions (like supply bins) have been updated over time, there's legacy code and design direction from five years ago that still has to be accounted for. Respawn's high-quality first-person animations are deeply embedded in weapon and character design, and holding a gun in each hand begins to rack up animation headaches.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, adrenaline-fueled speedster Octane has custom animations that let players see him using his "stims" in many different states of motion. Players already push his animations to the limit when they activate his speed boost while reloading a weapon, taking actions that in theory would require a third hand to complete. If Octane was going to get in on the dual-wielding party, he'd need special animations that would juggle his stims and guns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All those animations grow more complicated on zip lines, where players ostensibly coast along with one hand—but need both hands to fire their guns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then came the balancing. Just giving players two pistols with equal statlines wasn't quite enough. Canavese said they had to be "completely reevaluated" in their base form to ensure when you doubled up on them, it felt like a big power spike (but not </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>too</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> big).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Going all-in on this overhaul had major payoff—it made two weapons that were "largely irrelevant" before season 22 into powerful options.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's something to be said about having weapons in a multiplayer game that never find their niche—but get their moment in the sun when a team has resources to build new systems dedicated to them. It doesn't just make that weapon more fun now—it affirms the decision to make it in the first place. Sometimes in a live service game, you need five years or so to make some good ideas stick.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/19/jackbox-naughty-packs-adult-only-party-drops-on-12th-september/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Jackbox Games has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/jackbox-naughty-pack">Jackbox Naughty Pack</a>, their first adults-only collection of minigames, will launch across all major platforms on 12th September 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Jackbox Naughty Pack | Official Trailer (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTAYOPKYDuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Depending on your friends group, you might be confused that this is the first naughty pack, when you can pretty much make all of the games in the series a bit filthy, just from your own answers and creative endeavours, but Jackbox Games is leaning into that aspect with a trio of games.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fakin’ It All Night Long (Social Deduction): A returning sequel to Fakin’ It, this game will assign one Faker per round and it is up to the group to determine which player is lying when asked questions such as “Put a finger up for every public restroom you’ve used today”. This game introduces a brand-new “remote play” mode so that everyone can join even if they’re not in the same room. 3 – 8 players.</li>
<li>Dirty Drawful (Drawing, Guessing): Another returning sequel, this game challenges players to draw a picture based off of the dirty prompt they receive on their phones. Their mission is to convince everyone else that their prompt best fits the drawing, or if they’re the artist, to best match the correct prompt. 3 – 8 players.</li>
<li>Let Me Finish (Debate): This new presentation game examines life’s serious questions like, “Where is this mailbox’s butt?” or “How does this avocado get aroused?” Everyone gets a chance to speak their mind, but will others pick up what you’re putting down? 3 – 8 players.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jackbox Naughty Pack will be priced at $21.69 / €21.69, which isn’t that far off from a regular pack, which typically includes five games. That could be a disappointment for people, though as long as these are three absolute bangers, that wouldn’t be too bad.</p>

<p>The tenth entry in the long-running party game series arrived last year with Jason saying, “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/the-jackbox-party-pack-10-review/">Jackbox Party Pack 10</a> is one of the stronger entries in the Jackbox pantheon, and I’m a big fan of it as a whole. Each game has its own pacing, and while I do think everyone will find their favourites as always, the mix feels very good this time around, and even the trivia game is fun. This is a great party pack that’ll be a good addition to any game night. Apart from Dodo Re Mi – I hope those digital birds stay eaten.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/counter-strike-2-may-have-just-banned-your-keyboards-best-feature.957753/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-snap-tap-automation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced that it's banning the ability to perform multiple actions from a single input in&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, and anyone who's picked up Razer's Huntsman V3 Pro keyboard might be getting pretty upset right now.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/6500469346429600836" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Steam yesterday</a>, Valve said that while some forms of&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>scripting have "gained acceptance" due to allowing "plays that wouldn't otherwise be possible", "some hardware features" have recently begun to blur "the line between manual input and automation".</p>
<p>As a result, the developer says it's no longer allowing any kind of automation in&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, whether that's hardware-based or script-based. Valve says automation "circumvent[s]" the "core skills" that players must demonstrate when playing&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-automation-ban-crouching.jpg?itok=vQuUmeAf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-automation-ban-crouching.jpg?itok=3VgVQaWg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>won't let you automate your actions anymore.</figcaption></figure><p>In its post, Valve makes specific reference to the jump-throw move, which allows players to bind both jumping and throwing to a single key in order to perform both actions in quick succession.</p>
<p>Other uses, however, include counter-strafing, an action by which players move and then quickly stop moving by tapping the opposite direction key, making their shots more accurate. As you can imagine, these actions are pretty hard to perform without automation.</p>
<p>This decision will be of particular interest to Razer Huntsman V3 Pro owners thanks to <a href="https://press.razer.com/product-news/introducing-snap-tap-mode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the keyboard's Snap Tap mode</a>, which "allows for instantaneous directional changes without lifting the initial key" you've pressed.</p>
<p>The feature has been endorsed by pro&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>players like XertioN and BeYN, but it sounds like Valve's new update may have completely invalidated what appears to be a pretty major selling point for Razer's new hardware.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/razer-huntsman-v3-pro-snap-tap-counter-strike-2.jpg?itok=FnoM_-XQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/razer-huntsman-v3-pro-snap-tap-counter-strike-2.jpg?itok=Z4YCONHl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Razer's Huntsman V3 Pro keyboards come with the Snap Tap feature built in.</figcaption></figure><p>Razer's Snap Tap feature has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1ew5xh6/snap_tap_usage_at_cologne/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proven pretty popular</a> at pro&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike&nbsp;</em>tournaments, and until Valve's latest announcement, it was perfectly fine to use said feature in pro play, although that's presumably no longer the case.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Razer for comment on this story and will update as soon as we hear anything back.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/20/xbox-game-pass-august-2024-wave-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog post</a> today, Xbox announced the second wave of titles coming to Game Pass this August, including Atlas Fallen and more. It also confirms the first game joining in September 2024.</p>



<p>The following titles are coming to Xbox Game Pass in August 2024 and the first week of September:</p>



<ul>
<li>Atlas Fallen – August 22</li>



<li>Core Keeper – August 27</li>



<li>Star Trucker – September 3</li>
</ul>



<p>This confirms <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atlas-fallen-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors from last month</a> that Atlas Fallen would join Xbox’s Game Pass, shortly following its major Reign of Sand update. Reign of Sand launched just a couple of weeks ago, adding new enemies, quests, New Game+, and more.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The new blog also teases the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 early access Open Beta starting August 30. As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-beta-dates-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously reported</a> in July 2024, the anticipated early access will run through September 4. </p>



<p>Fans can begin downloading the beta on August 28, 2024. The full open beta will run from September 6 to September 9, 2024.</p>



<p>Today’s blog also confirmed some new titles will expand the Game Pass Core tier on August 21, 2024. Those include Cities: Skylines, Control: Ultimate Edition, and SnowRunner.</p>



<p>Cities: Skylines 2 had a rough launch, with Paradox even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paradox-apologizes-again-after-even-more-cities-skylines-2-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apologizing for issues</a> early on in April 2024. Although the devs consistently worked on updates, and most recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-economy-rework-coming-june-24-devs-address-console-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reworked the economy</a> with another major update, fans still enjoy its predecessor.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-over-600-games-apps-support-rtx.957708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Gamescom 2024, NVIDIA announced the next wave of PC games featuring DLSS and RTX technologies, highlighted by BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard and Obsidian's Avowed.</p>
<p>Both fantasy RPGs will support NVIDIA DLSS 3 (Super Resolution and Frame Generation), NVIDIA Reflex, and ray tracing, though we don't know exactly which graphics effects will be enhanced. The most common ones are reflections, shadows, ambient occlusion, and global illumination.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is powered by DICE's Frostbite engine, which has supported NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing in various Battlefield games. BioWare has recently shared the official PC requirements, which are pretty low, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-quite-low-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Needless to say, playing at 4K and 60+ FPS with ray tracing enabled will likely require a far beefier rig than what's listed in the recommended requirements. The developers will likely share more information soon since Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now about two months and a half away from launching.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | RTX Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1k0lUq1pVY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It might take a while longer for Avowed since Obsidian has recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> the game to February 18, 2025, officially in an attempt to avoid the cramped Fall game release schedule (but Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 just <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did</a> the same and placed itself just one week before Avowed).</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed | NVIDIA DLSS 3 &amp; Ray Tracing Premiere" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWeYmim3IFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 3, DLAA, and Reflex will also be available in the soon-to-be-released Final Fantasy XVI PC port. These are just the three most famous games announced today by NVIDIA. Here's the remaining seventeen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arena Breakout: Infinite (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Black Slate (DLSS 3, Reflex, Ray Tracing)</li>
<li>Concord</li>
<li>Empire of Ants (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Eternal Strands (DLSS 3, Reflex, Ray Tracing)</li>
<li>Funko Fusion (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Fragpunk (DLSS 3, Reflex, Ray Tracing)</li>
<li>GreedFall II: The Dying World (NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution)</li>
<li>Killing Floor III (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Kingmakers (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Once Human (DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Retrieval (RTXDI)</li>
<li>Spine (DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Test Drive Unlimited (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Unawake (DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Wuthering Waves (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, NVIDIA said there are now over 600 PC games and apps that support RTX technologies. On a separate note, GeForce NOW already supports the newly <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-comes-to-pc-september-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Final Fantasy XVI demo. Moreover, a feature called Xbox Automatic Sign-On is coming this Thursday, allowing seamless access to PC Game Pass across all compatible GeForce NOW devices. A new GFN Ultimate data center is about to launch in Poland, too, expanding the service's reach in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Last but not least, today NVIDIA released a new Game Ready driver optimized for Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Star Wars: Outlaws, Concord, and Final Fantasy XVI. As usual, you can download it via the official <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> or via apps like GeForce Experience and the new NVIDIA app.</p>
<p>PC gamers interested in Star Wars: Outlaws can potentially take advantage of the newly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-40-star-wars-outlaws-bundle-free-available-rtx-40-desktop-gpus-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>RTX 40 Series Bundle, which will provide them with a game code as long as they buy an RTX 40 Series GPU or desktop/laptop from participating retailers.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-7800-retro-console-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atari-7800-retro-console-faithfully-recreates-a-classic-this-winter.957705/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-7800-retro-console-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atari and Plaion have announced the Atari 7800+, a faithful recreation of the classic 1986 Atari 7800. It's set to launch around the world this winter and will be compatible with original 7800 cartridges as well.</p>
<p>Per a press release, the 7800+ is a "scaled-down, compact edition" of the original 7800, so it won't take up quite as much room in your setup. It's also got HDMI compatibility, so you can hook it up to modern displays with no problem.</p>
<p>The console will be compatible with both original 7800 cartridges and original 2600 carts, echoing the backwards compatibility of the original 7800. Just like its predecessor, it also won't be able to run 5200 cartridges, so you're out of luck if you've got a large 5200 library for some reason.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atari-7800-bentley-bears-crystal-quest.jpg?itok=aY1ImFlJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atari-7800-bentley-bears-crystal-quest.jpg?itok=2WK2hZ5K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A brand new game has been created specially for the Atari 7800+.</figcaption></figure><p>Atari and Plaion say they guarantee "near-perfect compatibility with original and third-party Atari games", though, so your 2600 and 7800 libraries should be safe on the new 7800+.</p>
<p>Each 7800+ will come pre-packaged with a wireless CX78+ controller, which recreates the two-button setup of the original 7800's peripheral. You'll also get a copy of&nbsp;<em>Bentley Bear's Crystal Quest</em>, a brand new sequel to the Atari classic&nbsp;<em>Crystal Castles</em>.</p>
<p>A number of other new games, some of them based on IPs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-buys-up-12-classic-arcade-franchises-including-berzerk-and-more">acquired by Atari last year</a>, will also be available for the system, and the lineup will include "Atari releases for popular homebrew games", along with three "multi-game 2600+ cartridges" (which will, as a reminder, be compatible with the 7800+).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atari-7800-announcement-cx78-controller.jpg?itok=VpluuTD2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atari-7800-announcement-cx78-controller.jpg?itok=eCZHn20z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each Atari 7800+ will come with a CX78+ controller.</figcaption></figure><p>The Atari 7800+ will set you back $129.99, while an extra CX78+ controller will cost you $34.99. If you want to buy a CX40+ wireless joystick for glorious single-button gaming, you'll have to hand over a further $34.99.</p>
<p>Atari and Plaion are set to launch the Atari 7800+ sometime this winter. Stay tuned for more news on a specific release date, and while you wait, you can <a href="https://atari.com/products/atari-7800" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-order the console here</a> if you like.</p>

Players can also choose between running games in widescreen mode or 4:3 aspect ratio to preserve the feeling of playing on retro hardware.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Atari 7800 Plus comes bundled with the new CX78 Plus Wireless Gamepad (pictured).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atari</cite></p></div><p>There are two new wireless controllers launching alongside the Atari 7800 Plus. The CX78 Plus Wireless Gamepad — a recreation of the console’s original two-button controller — comes bundled with the Atari 7800 Plus but can also be purchased separately for $34.99. The gamepad also wirelessly connects to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841336/atari-2600-plus-compatible-with-7800-cartridges">the Atari 2600 Plus recreation</a> released last year and can be connected to a PC via a USB-C adapter. There’s also the $34.99 CX40 Plus Wireless Joystick, which is sold separately and carries the same support.</p><div><figcaption><em>Like the CX78 gamepad, the CX40 Plus Wireless Joystick can also be used on PC or the Atari 2600 Plus mini-console.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atari</cite></p></div><p>Atari touts that the Atari 7800 Plus has “near-perfect compatibility” with original and third-party Atari games. Only one game is being shipped with the console itself — a specially designed cartridge for the <em>Crystal Castles</em> sequel, <em>Bentley Bear’s Crystal Quest </em>— but 10 additional titles will be available to purchase separately for $29.99. You can <a href="https://atari.com/products/atari-7800">preorder the 7800 Plus right here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Starting on August 22nd, the new account linking feature will mean you only need to sign-in and link an Xbox profile once so that it’s stored for all future GeForce Now sessions.</p><p>“This new feature joins Xbox game library sync on GeForce Now, which allows members to sync their supported Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft Store games to their cloud streaming library,” explains Nvidia.</p><p>Nvidia first started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841163/microsoft-xbox-pc-game-pass-nvidia-geforce-now">rolling out access to PC Game Pass</a> and Microsoft Store titles on GeForce Now last year, before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23963718/nvidia-geforce-now-pc-game-pass-xbox-account-sync">adding account syncing</a> to bring games from Microsoft’s store to the GeForce Now library. Those features provided access, but without automatic sign-in, you had to manually authenticate each time you used the GeForce Now service. Now, it’s simply set it and forget it.</p><p>Nvidia’s improvements for Xbox games on GeForce Now come just weeks after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200819/microsoft-nvidia-geforce-now-integration-xbox-store-pages">Microsoft integrated GeForce Now</a> into its Xbox game pages on the web.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-vital-tips-materials-death-1851625319<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a lengthy and challenging game filled with over 80 bosses and tons of enemy types to tackle, promising that you’ll need to put your skills to the test if you want to see it through to one of its multiple endings. The opening hours of the game give you a lot to learn and think about, and getting to grips with how the game’s various mechanics work can take a little getting used to. As such, we’ve compiled a list of early game tips here that we hope will aid you in the opening hours of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h119656"><a id=""></a><strong>There’s no penalty for respecs, so try new things</strong></h2><p>There is no penalty for respeccing your skills in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, so you should experiment with different builds and stances to see what best fits your gameplay style. When you want to respec, simply head over to any shrine and select “Reignite the Sparks” under the “Self-Advance” tab.</p><p>We highly recommend early investment in the skills that grant you extra health, stamina, and staff range, but feel free to skip these if you’re feeling confident!</p><h2 id="h119657"><a id=""></a><strong>Pick up all of the materials you see</strong></h2><p>As you wander around the game’s open, explorable areas, you’ll see plenty of flowers and herbs scattered about. Pick all of these up! Even though you may not have a use for them in the first couple of hours, you’ll eventually be able to make helpful medicines to aid you in battle, and you’ll be happy you’ve been collecting materials for them.</p><figure id="" data-id="563a78d2a918b009e0d7ffff3cbc0068" data-recommend-id="image://563a78d2a918b009e0d7ffff3cbc0068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1093" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yum, a delicious-looking and definitely not deadly giant toadstool." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yum, a delicious-looking and definitely not deadly giant toadstool." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="563a78d2a918b009e0d7ffff3cbc0068" data-recommend-id="image://563a78d2a918b009e0d7ffff3cbc0068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1093" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yum, a delicious-looking and definitely not deadly giant toadstool." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h119658"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t fret—dying doesn’t have any major consequences</strong></h2><p>Unlike traditional soulslike games, dying in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> doesn’t have any significant consequences besides sending you back to the closest shrine with all enemies respawned. This means you won’t have to worry about the common soulslike mechanic of dropping your experience on death. Instead, you’ll maintain all of your earned Will and be ready to give things another go.</p><h2 id="h119659"><a id=""></a><strong>You can always fight the Wandering Wight later</strong></h2><p>The Wandering Wight is a boss found romping around the right side of the forest. If you’re patient and practice enough, you can maybe take him down when you first meet him. More likely, though, you’ll want to come back a little later when you’ve upgraded your staff and gear (maybe around the time you reach the Black Wind Cave). You’ll find defeating him much easier by then.</p><h2 id="h119660"><a id=""></a><strong>Prepare yourself before facing Lingxuzi</strong></h2><p>Lingxuzi won’t be an overwhelmingly challenging boss for soulslike veterans, but he still hits like a truck and can make quick work of you if you haven’t fully wrapped your head around the game’s unique combat mechanics.</p><figure id="" data-id="9354fa42654ca7417aafbe84cd5eb9ad" data-recommend-id="image://9354fa42654ca7417aafbe84cd5eb9ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1102" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The crafting armor options menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The crafting armor options menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9354fa42654ca7417aafbe84cd5eb9ad" data-recommend-id="image://9354fa42654ca7417aafbe84cd5eb9ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1102" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The crafting armor options menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With this in mind, aim to hit around level 9 or 10 before taking on Lingxuzi. When you have enough Sparks obtained, purchase at least the first three health upgrades in the Survival skill tree. Additionally, make sure to craft the Pilgrim’s Armor at a shrine for some added defense. With that extra health and defense, you’ll be in a much better position to tank a few hits while fighting Lingxuzi, so go give him hell.<br></p><p>If you need to collect some extra Will to purchase some skills or crafting materials, you can grind in the “Outside the Forest” area as needed.</p><h2 id="h119661"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t miss a massive health boost after defeating Lingxuzi</strong></h2><p>After defeating Lingxuzi, you’ll be free to proceed into a temple in front of you. While you may be tempted to waltz through and head down to the nearby shrine to rest, make sure you stop inside the temple first.</p><p>On the left side of the inner temple is a Celestial Medicine you can pick up that will provide you with a significant health increase, further improving your survivability for the dangers ahead.</p><h2 id="h119662"><a id=""></a><strong>Also don’t miss a massive mana boost in Black Wind Cave</strong></h2><p>After defeating a certain boss, you’ll enter an area called Black Wind Cave. As you work through the first part of this location, you’ll have a path to the left that leads out to a wooden deck with a meditation point. Right by the meditation point is another Celestial Medicine, and this one will vastly increase your mana reserves, allowing you to use your spells more often.</p><figure id="" data-id="4600ed31ab5dcbb2ee9aea0aab47818c" data-recommend-id="image://4600ed31ab5dcbb2ee9aea0aab47818c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1120" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Crafting some celestial medicine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Crafting some celestial medicine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4600ed31ab5dcbb2ee9aea0aab47818c" data-recommend-id="image://4600ed31ab5dcbb2ee9aea0aab47818c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1120" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Crafting some celestial medicine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h119663"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t overlook Spirit Skills</strong></h2><p>You’ll meet an NPC fairly early on that will upgrade your gourd to allow you to absorb the spirits of some bosses. Doing so will grant you their Spirit Skill, which lets you briefly transform into them in battle and perform an action when you’ve built up enough Qi. These can dish out some major damage, especially to bosses. But more importantly, they grant passive bonuses when equipped—such as the Wandering Wight’s increased defense.</p><p>You can even upgrade each of these Spirits at a shrine by selecting “Cultivate Spirits” under the “Self-Advance” tab. However, note that you’ll sometimes need special items found in your adventure to proceed with an upgrade tier.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The release of NHL 25 is less than two months away and the first details of the game have been leaked ahead of the official reveal. And EA is to blame for the NHL 25 leaks.</p>



<p>The publisher had a reveal and trailer set for Thursday, August 22 at 11am. However, when EA Sports uploaded it to the game’s official account, they left it unlisted allowing it to be seen and grabbed by whomever. It wasn’t until it began making the rounds that it was finally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9EDHgsy8w8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">made private</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thanks to the early look at the NHL 25 reveal trailer, a few details have been confirmed about the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-nhl-25-leaks">What’s In The NHL 25 Leaks?</h2>



<p>First, NHL 25 will feature the Hughes brothers — Luke, Jack, and Quinn — on the covers of this year’s game. It’ll mark the first time that a set of brothers will appear on the cover of a major sports video game.</p>



<p>The game will  also see the return of James Cybulski as play-by-play as well as feature the official jerseys for Utah Hockey Club right at launch.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>On to gameplay, NHL 25 features new game mechanics that run on “ICE-Q Intelligence”. The game also features revamped vision controls that EA Sports is calling “next-gen vision control” and the skating has been updated to include over 250 new animations. </p>



<p>There is also new foundational AI and reactive player actions that will allow the game to better mimic what players see in real life. How that works, though, won’t be noticeable until players can get their hands on the game themselves</p>



<p>Neither a release date nor official platforms were  confirmed in the leaks. What was confirmed, however, is that EA Sports is doing with NHL 25 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what it did with EA FC 25</a>. If you pay $100 for the Deluxe Edition of the game, you get to play it at release. Those who pay the $70 standard will get access to the game a week later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/bridging-history-and-gameplay-lessons-from-historiographical-video-game-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Intersection of Academia and Media"><span>The Intersection of Academia and Media</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My professional path took a significant turn when I began engaging with the media and later with the world of virtual reality and interactive video games. Upon arriving in London in 2009, I was frequently called upon to answer press and media inquiries about Japanese history. These engagements, ranging from news reports to documentaries, broadened my horizons and provided an opportunity to share my knowledge with a wider audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the earliest and most memorable of these engagements was as a historical advisor to a major studio film production centered on early modern Japan. This project marked the beginning of my foray into the world of film and screen media. The job was to help maintain the historical accuracy of a fiction-fantasy film set in early modern Japan.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lessons from the Film Industry"><span>Lessons from the Film Industry</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite a promising start, the project soon encountered significant challenges, particularly due to cultural miscommunications between the Japanese cast and the Anglo-American production team. Over and again, I tried to emphasize the significance of the Akō Vendetta story, as retold in the classic drama of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABshingura">Chūshingura (忠臣蔵, The Treasury of Loyal Retainers)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which has had a profound cultural and historical impact in Japan since it was first performed in 1748. The Chūshingura embodies themes of loyalty, honor, and sacrifice that have become deeply embedded in contemporary&nbsp; Japanese culture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The script of the film I was advising had been originally written by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossein_Amini">Hossein Amini</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in consultation with historian </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Turnbull_(historian)">Stephen Turnbull</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Theirs was an impressive work. However, as pre-production progressed into production, the director cut and restructured the script, resulting in a movie that failed to capture the depth and richness of the historical events upon which it was based. This experience underscored a critical lesson: the importance of balancing historicity with artistic license and commercial viability.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="History as Digital Interactive Storytelling"><span>History as Digital Interactive Storytelling</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The potential of video games to engage players with history first struck me in the 1980s when I encountered titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobunaga's_Ambition">Nobunaga’s Ambition (信長の野望, Nobunaga no Yabō)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. These early strategy games allowed players to immerse themselves in the political and military machinations of historical periods. Over the decades, the genre evolved significantly, with advances in technology enabling more complex narratives and immersive gameplay experiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, while commercial games often succeed as narrative devices, they frequently prioritize gameplay over historical accuracy. This approach, driven by the commercial pressures of the gaming industry, can lead to a superficial engagement with historical material.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqysmS4lxwQ" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ghost of Tsushima"><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Historian </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/history/faculty/ac73447">Adam Clulow's</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> analysis of Ghost of Tsushima offers important insights for game designers striving to balance historical authenticity with engaging gameplay. Clulow highlights the game’s depiction of the Mongol invasions of Japan in the late 13th century as a prime example of how video games can captivate players while also oversimplifying complex historical events. The game presents a narrative that is visually stunning and immersive, yet it often sacrifices historical precision to enhance the player’s experience. This trade-off, while understandable from a commercial perspective, poses significant challenges for educators and historians who aim to use such games as educational tools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ghost of Tsushima is praised for its beautiful recreation of Tsushima Island and its detailed portrayal of samurai culture, but Clulow points out that the game’s narrative choices sometimes create a misleading picture of history. The game frames the Mongol invasion in stark, binary terms—good versus evil, invaders versus defenders—without adequately conveying the nuanced political, cultural, and social dynamics at play during this period. For instance, the game’s portrayal of the samurai as noble warriors defending Japan from barbaric invaders simplifies the complexities of samurai roles and motivations, as well as the internal conflicts within Japanese society at the time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For game designers, Clulow underscores the importance of critically engaging with the historical sources that inform their narratives. Many historical video games, Ghost of Tsushima included, rely heavily on popular histories or outdated interpretations, which can perpetuate inaccuracies or reinforce simplistic views of the past. Clulow advocates for a more nuanced approach, where game designers collaborate closely with historians to ensure that their games reflect the latest scholarly research and offer players a more accurate and sophisticated understanding of history.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite these challenges, Ghost of Tsushima also demonstrates the potential of video games to introduce players to historical settings and events in a way that is both engaging and informative. Clulow suggests that game designers can learn from the game’s success by incorporating more complex and layered narratives that challenge players to think critically about the past. This might involve presenting multiple perspectives on historical events, exploring the motivations of different characters, and highlighting the uncertainties and ambiguities that are inherent in any historical narrative. By doing so, games can not only entertain but also educate, encouraging players to explore history in a deeper and more meaningful way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ghost of Tsushima serves as both a model and a cautionary tale for game designers. While it excels in creating an immersive and visually striking historical environment, it also illustrates the dangers of oversimplification and the need for a more critical and informed approach to historical representation in games. Clulow’s work emphasizes that with careful attention to historiography, video games can offer rich and nuanced portrayals of the past that engage and educate players, rather than merely entertain.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Key Takeaways for Game Design:"><span>Key Takeaways for Game Design:</span></h2><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Understand the Historical Context: When working with historical narratives, it’s crucial to grasp the cultural and historical significance of the events and stories being portrayed.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Balance Accuracy with Entertainment: While it’s essential to stay true to the historical narrative, consider how to make it engaging and accessible for a broader audience.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Collaboration is Key: Work closely with historians and cultural experts to ensure that the final product respects the source material while appealing to your target audience.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4NxBmS1nl38" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The HashimaXR Project"><span>The HashimaXR Project</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My first foray into historiographical video game design was with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://thehashimaxrproject.org/">HashimaXR Project</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

We had to continuously test and refine our designs, not just for historical accuracy but also for player engagement. The iterative process was crucial in ensuring that the final product was both educational and enjoyable. This project was a prime example of how digital tools can enhance our understanding of history, offering new ways to explore and interact with the past.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The HashimaXR Project demonstrated the potential of game engines like Unreal as tools for public history. By making the history of Hashima Island accessible to a global audience through an interactive virtual environment, we were able to engage people who might not otherwise have been interested in this aspect of Japanese history. This project has inspired me to continue exploring the possibilities of digital humanities and historiographical video game design as powerful means of education and public engagement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most rewarding aspects of the HashimaXR Project was witnessing how effectively it engaged a diverse and global audience. The ability to reach people from different cultural backgrounds, who might never visit Hashima Island in person, highlighted the immense power of digital tools in public history.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-tops-the-steam-charts-in-just-a-handful-of-hours.957642/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Soulslike action RPG&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has only been out for a handful of hours, but it's already soared past every other game on Steam to snag the platform's highest-ever 24-hour player count peak.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam's own charts</a>,&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has already reached a 24-hour peak of 1,903,342 players, which is, of course, also its all-time peak. That's a handy victory over&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, which is now in second place with a measly 1,368,431.</p>
<p>Developer GameScience's game still has a ways to go if it wants to claim the all-time player peak crown, though. That accolade is currently held by Krafton's&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, which has&nbsp;an impressive all-time player peak count of&nbsp; 3,257,248.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-steam-charts-flask.jpg?itok=DmnAvqbe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-steam-charts-flask.jpg?itok=fiNQKjTB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is already proving phenomenally popular.</figcaption></figure><p>It goes without saying that this makes&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>the most successful single-player game of all time on Steam, at least by the metric of highest 24-hour player count.</p>
<p>Other games with a single-player slant, like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>&nbsp;</em>(953,426 all-time peak) and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>&nbsp;</em>(1,054,388 all-time peak), can't hold a candle to&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s numbers, and since the game has only been out for a few hours, its total is only likely to climb as time goes on.</p>
<p>So, where is all of this interest coming from? Well, according <a href="https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to GameDiscoverCo's Simon Carless</a>,&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s player base is predominantly Chinese, with 88.1% of the game's Steam players hailing from China. The next-highest total is the US with 3%, followed by Hong Kong with 1.6%.</p>
<p>Given the fact that&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>is based on a classical Chinese novel, that split makes a certain degree of sense, but it's also still pretty early in the day for a lot of Americans, so many from the US won't have had the chance to play the game yet.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, it's a single-player action RPG developed by Chinese studio GameScience, and it's the company's first game.</p>
<p>Based loosely on the Chinese novel&nbsp;<em>Journey to the West</em>, the game sees a young monkey warrior journeying across a mythical land to recover six artifacts left behind by legendary monkey king Sun Wukong after a fateful battle with the Celestial Court.</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The game is also set to arrive on Xbox Series X|S at some point in the future.

Wilson's 99 makes her the highest-rated WNBA player in NBA 2K history, and on par with the greats in the mens' league--NBA 2K only rarely hands out 99 ratings and often launches without a single player rated 99, as happened <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nba-2k24-player-ratings-the-12-best-players-revealed/2900-4831/" data-ref-id="2900-4831">last year</a>.</p><p>The WNBA's top five rookies have also been announced with some impressive OVRs.

<p>Although the mod - which upgraded Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer mode - was announced over a year ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-mod-h2m-shuts-down-after-cease-and-desist-demand">the cease and desist arrived the day before the mod was scheduled to be released</a> last week, forcing the project to "shut down [...] immediately and permanently".</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, unhappy Modern Warfare 2 fans jumped onto the Steam page to express <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055689836/recommended/1962660/">their dismay</a>.</p>
<p>In the brief video embedded above, Watchful Wolf talked about the fallout following the decision to cancel the mod, as well as "share the reasoning" they believe Activision had for blocking it.</p>
<p>"Essentially, because of the popularity H2M was gaining - and how close it is to Black Ops 6 releasing and kinda the marketing and the beta and stuff for that - they did not want H2M interfering with possible sales of Black Ops 6," Watchful Wolf said, stressing that this was just how they interpreted the cease and desist letter rather than the formal legal position of Activision.</p>
<p>"So, with that said, for people who suggested 'you should have just made it on BO3' or something like that because they allow mod support… well, I don't think any project, no matter where it was, [would have been permitted] if it garnered such popularity so close to a new game releasing.</p>
<p>"They would have shut it down anyways, I think."</p>
<p>Watchful Wolf says they have now "quit modding Call of Duty", but "would be down" to make zombie maps or little mods here and there on BO3.</p>
<p>Wolf also quietly slipped in confirmation that the mod team was now "going to make our own game", too.</p>
