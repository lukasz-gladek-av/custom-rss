            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve officially entered the week of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday</a>. Pretty much every retailer under the sun has already unleashed a whole bunch of deals, so there’s no reason to wait to do your holiday shopping. If you or someone on your list is into Sonic the Hedgehog video games, you’re in luck: a bunch of them are on sale across the Switch, Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox. Here’s a rundown of every Sonic game that’s already on sale for Black Friday 2025.</p><p id="all-the-sonic-black-friday-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="All the Sonic Black Friday deals">Sonic Games - Black Friday Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no shortage of Sonic game deals for Black Friday. Here’s the full list.</p><p id="sonic-racing-crossworlds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</h2></p><div catalogid="c03dea71-f833-49ee-b6ce-536ef4f193be" id="231690"><div id="231690" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (Switch, PS5, XSX)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The newest game on the list is Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (Amazon), a kart racer with enough speed and new ideas that many think is actually better than Mario Kart World. In her <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">review</a>, Jada Griffin wrote, “Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds fires on all cylinders with a fantastic roster of 24 of my favorite hedgehogs, foxes, echidnas, and more. The lineup of 24 main tracks and 15 Crossworld tracks is the best designed selection we've ever gotten in any Sonic racing game, and there is a generationally great soundtrack to accompany them. The racing itself feels fast, fantastic, and intuitive, with lots of options to tweak your stats to your preferred playstyle.”</p></div><p id="sonic-superstars"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sonic Superstars">Sonic Superstars</h2></p><div catalogid="c03dea71-f833-49ee-b6ce-536ef4f193be" id="231685"><div id="231685" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Superstars (Switch, PS5, XSX)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If price is your main consideration, you can’t beat Sonic Superstars, a throwback side-scrolling platformer you can pick up for <em>less than $10</em> at <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5Xexj?object_uuid=6c202e83-fe55-40f3-a997-cfcf194f667b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>. That’s a killer deal on a game about which the very same Jada Griffin, in her <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-superstars-review">review</a>, said, “Most Sonic games put the pedal to the metal, having you travel at blindingly fast speeds while avoiding hazards on your way to the goal. Unlike its predecessors, however, Sonic Superstars trades that traditional breakneck pace for new abilities, more exploration, multiple mini-games, and slightly more challenging bosses. Most of that stylistic shift works well for the majority of Superstars’ roughly 15-hour multi-campaign story.”</p></div><p id="sonic-x-shadow-generations"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sonic X Shadow Generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</h2></p><div catalogid="c03dea71-f833-49ee-b6ce-536ef4f193be" id="231686"><div id="231686" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic X Shadow Generations (Switch 2, Switch, PS5, XSX)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to those, you can pick up the excellent 2024 game Sonic X Shadow Generations for the new all-time low price of $24.99 at <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6kZg?object_uuid=6c202e83-fe55-40f3-a997-cfcf194f667b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>. That’s for all consoles, including Switch 2. This game is comprised of two parts. One is a remake of the 2011 game Sonic Generations, and the other is a brand-new Shadow-centered addition. It adds up to a killer package we gave 9/10 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sonic is far from the only game series getting Black Friday discounts.

<p>For some reason</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="6f08c2bca2658"><a title="Nintendo 2DS XL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6f08c2bca2658/nintendo-2ds-xl.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/netinfo/en_US/index.html">weekly maintenance schedule</a> has been released, and weirdly, the only console getting any love this week is the Nintendo 3DS.</p>
<p>Reported on by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-maintenance-schedule-november-23-2025/">Nintendo Everything</a>, the Nintendo 3DS's available network services will be down between <strong>3pm PST to 4:30pm PST today, 24th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, that might sound a little confusing given that online servers for the 3DS and Wii U <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/its-over-nintendo-shuts-down-online-servers-for-3ds-and-wii-u">shut down over a year ago</a>. But many people still play their 3DS's, and you can redownload games off of the eShop on the system.</p><div><figure data-videoid="rsFcYrj6oHY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytrsFcYrj6oHY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f132khpqni&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>So any maintenance that takes place today is likely just to iron out a few kinks Nintendo discovered. For when this takes place in your timezone, here's a handy list (expect it to run about 1hr 30mins)</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 3pm PST / 4pm MST / 5pm CST / 6pm EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 11pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 12am (Tue) CET / 1am (Tue) EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 8am (Tue) JST / 7am (Tue) AWST / 10am (Tue) AEDT</li></ul>

<figure data-uuid="d933541ab6046"><a title="Nintendo 3DS Maintenance" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d933541ab6046/nintendo-3ds-maintenance.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/netinfo/en_US/index.html">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Will that stop people worrying? Probably not, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3dspiracy/comments/1p55v9v/3ds_maintenance_tomorrow_should_we_worry/">evidenced on Reddit</a>. Nintendo isn't going to just pull the plug without saying anything. Plus, the Big N performed maintenance on Nintendo Network ID as recently as October. The company is always doing <em>something</em> with older software.</p>
<p>Essentially, this is business as usual. You probably just won't be able to download 3DS games for a couple of hours.</p>

            <p>
TimeSplitters is one of those weird series that I look back on quite fondly despite never having owned a single one of the games as a wistful youth. I think I've got one kicking around somewhere these days, but back then the only way I would play it was at a friend's house, us messing about, not doing a very good job at co-op in the main story, me failing to beat my friend in multiplayer because I was crap at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooting</a> games. And now, here we are, with a fanmade rework that's been 13 years in the making finally released, offering unto me a chance to relish in some nostalgia, but New.
</p>
<p>
If you've not heard about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters-rewind">TimeSplitters: Rewind</a> before, it's a fan project that's sort of a remake, sort of a best of compilation of the various games' maps, modes, challenges, and story bits. As the website puts it, it's "not a traditional remake in that there aren't 3 separate executables, it is one game that, as closely as possible, captures the spirit of the 3 games in one. So, unlike a traditional HD collection or remake, it is its own title."

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzWSrgQ3eMI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
Admittedly I do think the project has that look about it that many remakes do, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crash-bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> remakes for example, where in an effort to look modern, they lose a bit of atmosphere. At the same time, I like how crunchy the gameplay looks. Punchy shooting, punchy punches, a lot of goofiness about it that you'd expect from such a series. Plus it does deserve some commendation for actually existing as a thing you can just have for free. And the team did apologise for the wait too on the game's website; "Sorry it's taken us so long. We've only been making the largest free content video game ever."
</p><p>
It should be noted that this is just an early access release, so don't expect it to be feature complete just yet. There's a bunch of maps and arcade modes, a whole load of weapons and challenges, and you can play the entirety of the first game in co-op as it stands. It looks real neat honestly! And if you're interested, you can <a href="https://www.timesplittersrewind.com/">head to its website</a> to download the early access release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s that time of the year again, right before Thanksgiving, when stores and online retailers treat Black Friday as a weeks-long event and not a single day of the year. Strange, but hey, it leads to a lot of great deals, so I’m not complaining.</p> <p>Sony is getting in on the early action with a massive digital PSN store Black Friday sale consisting of a mix of first and third-party PlayStation 5 games, ranging from newer releases, like this year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852"><em>Death Stranding 2,</em></a> to older hits like <em>The Last of Us </em>and <em>Spider-Man.</em> <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/99d2af65-6386-4f11-a1f9-94d1e9c84063/1">This big Black Friday PSN sale goes from now until December 1.</a> So buy some games for yourselves and enjoy them. You deserve it. 2025 was a mess.</p>

 <p>I’ve also highlighted some great deals on non-exclusive PS5 games. <em>Battlefield 6</em> currently has its hooks in me so deep that I might have to uninstall it to actually play other stuff. <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> is great, but not a huge open-world zombie game that is easily worth $48. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is probably my favorite game in the franchise since <em>Origins</em>, and at under $50, it’s a steal. For folks looking for some creepy scares over holiday break, <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>and <em>Silent Hill f</em> might just be what you’re looking for, and both are fantastic. And if you have a spouse or sibling who is free this Thanksgiving, <em>Split Fiction</em> might just be the perfect co-op adventure to complete while munching on leftovers.</p> <p>Anyway, here are some of the best exclusives we spotted in the sale. Plus, below that list is <em>another</em> list of other great games that are cheaper than normal until next month.</p> <h2>PlayStation 5 Console Exclusives</h2> <ul> <li><em>Death Stranding 2 –</em> $50 ($70)</li> <li><em>Astro Bot</em> – $40 ($60)</li> <li><em>Baby Steps</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> – $30 ($70)</li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> – $30 ($70)</li> <li><em>The Last of Us Part I&nbsp;</em>– $30 ($70)</li> <li><em>The Last of Us Complete&nbsp;</em>– $70 ($100)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em>– $35 ($70)</li> <li><em>Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition&nbsp;</em>– $40 ($60)</li> </ul> <hr> <h2>Other Great Games On Sale</h2> <ul> <li><em>Battlefield 6</em> – $60 ($70)</li> <li><em>Clair Obscura – Expedition 33</em> – $40 ($50)</li> <li><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> – $48 ($60)</li> <li><em>Stellar Blade</em> – $40 ($70)</li> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> – $42 ($70)</li> <li><em>Forza Horizon 5</em> – $39 ($60)</li> <li><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> – $26 ($40)</li> <li><em>Ready or Not</em> – $40 ($50)</li> <li><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> – $42 ($70)</li> <li><em>Silent Hill f</em> – $49 ($70)</li> <li><em>Silent Hill 2</em> – $35 ($70)</li> <li><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> – $49 ($70)</li> <li><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Split Fiction</em> – $40 ($50)</li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> – $35 ($50)</li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> – $20 ($40)</li> <li><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> – $10 ($50)</li> <li><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Ed.</em> – $43 ($71)</li> <li><em>Star Wars Jedi Survivor</em> – $11 ($70)</li> <li><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2</em> – $35 ($70)</li> <li><em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> – $21 ($70)</li> <li><em>Hell Is Us</em> – $42 ($60)</li> <li><em>Resident Evil Remake Trilogy</em> (2,3,4) – $41 ($90)</li> </ul>

              <p>At its best, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-phyre-patience-2000643607"><i>Bloodlines 2</i> can be a good time</a>, especially when you just focus on the compelling story and writing. It can even be a fun vampire power fantasy from time to time. It has its charm in places, sure, but it almost never earns its name or identity as the sequel to the 2004 cult-hit <i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</i>. Turns out, its developer agrees: It never should’ve been named <i>Bloodlines 2</i>.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-phyre-patience-2000643607"><i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</i> Was So Close To Being Something Special</a></p> <p>Dan Pinchbeck, co-founder of The Chinese Room and writer of <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s story, recently spoke about the early days of taking over <i>Bloodlines 2</i> with Cat Burton on <i>The Goth Boss Podcast</i> (<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/interview-chinese-room-paradox">h/t <i>PCGamesN</i></a>), saying that while he was eager to create a game set in <i>Vampire: The Masquerade</i>, he didn’t just want to drag previous developer Hardsuit Lab’s work across the finish line. And he most certainly didn’t want to call it <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. He told Burton:</p>

 <blockquote><p>We would sit there and go and have these planning sessions on ‘how do we get [Paradox] to not call it <i>Bloodlines 2</i>?’ That feels like the most important thing that we can do here, is come at this and say ‘this isn’t <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, you can’t make it <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. There’s not enough time and there’s not enough money.’</p></blockquote> <p>Pinchbeck would leave The Chinese Room in 2023, shortly after the team took on the <i>Bloodlines 2</i> project.</p>  <h2>Would a name change have made that much of a difference?</h2> <p>“No one would be happy,” Pinchbeck said about trying to deliver a more direct sequel, something truer to the original <i>Bloodlines</i>’ RPG spirit. “We sort of approached it from [the] point of view of ‘what <i>can</i> we do with the time and the money that’s available?’” he said, “we can’t make <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, we can’t make <i>Skyrim</i>, but we can make <i>Dishonored</i>.”</p>

 <p>It’s hard not to play <i>Bloodlines 2</i> and feel the <i>Dishonored </i>inspiration. Though you do explore an open world, it’s tiny; and while scripted dialogue scenes in the final product are often excellent, <i>Bloodlines 2</i> hardly has the kinds of character interactions and sidequests that made the original notable. That leaves behind a first-person game where you wield supernatural powers, often steathily, against your opponents. Sound familiar?</p>

 <p>I’m not sure if a different name would’ve made for a significantly better reception for <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. In fact, it might not’ve been talked about nearly as much if it wasn’t called <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. Games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-swansong-impressions-rpg-tabletop-bl-1848939458"><i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong</i></a> and <i>Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Heart of the Forest</i> are far better games set in the World of Darkness, the broader mythos of <i>VtM</i> which it shares with other games like <i>Werewolf</i>. Though at least those games weren’t burdened with the expectation that led up to <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s eventual release.</p> <p>Much like <i>Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood</i>, a differently-named <i>Bloodlines 2</i> would’ve otherwise been just a mediocre action game that at best appeals to a niche audience of TTRPG fanatics. That’s presently what it is anyway, regardless of the name it bears.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-update-1-100-patch-notes%E2%80%94new-game-plus-cosmetics-bug-fixes.1363303/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The newest update for Ghost of Yotei, Version 1.100, as well as patch notes, are available now. With it, New Game Plus has been added, alongside new cosmetics and various bug fixes.</p>







<p>Released in October, Ghost of Yotei serves as a spiritual sequel to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima. Following mercenary Atsu, she travels across Edo to exact revenge on those who killed her family. The PlayStation 5 exclusive is one of 2025’s best-reviewed titles alongside Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. While it isn’t nominated for Game of the Year at The Game Awards, it did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snag some huge nominations</a> like Best Music and Best Performance. Earlier this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-new-game-plus-date-revealed-adds-new-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sucker Punch teased Patch 1.100</a>, which would add many new elements. Now, we have a detailed look thanks to the patch notes.</p>



<p>The 1.100 update for Ghost of Yotei isn’t too long, patch notes-wise. However, it finally adds a highly requested mode: New Game Plus. Now, if you completed the game and want more, you can return to the beginning of the story with all your previously unlocked upgrades. Furthermore, new outfits, Photo Mode additions, and fixes to gameplay and UI/UX have been included.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser may have included an advanced AI as a plot in his new novel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A Better Paradise: Volume One - An Aftermath</a>, but he's not as impressed with the current state of the technology. During a recent appearance, Houser didn't completely downplay AI, but he noted that the technology isn't everything some of its proponents have made it out to be.</p><p>While making a guest appearance on Channel 4's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaJ8EIebQ8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunday Brunch</a>, Houser acknowledged that his upcoming video game based on A Better Paradise may have some AI. But he also warned that the technology behind AI can't live up to its biggest promises yet.</p><p>"We are dabbling in using AI, but the truth is a lot of it's not as useful as some of the companies would have you believe yet," said Houser. "It's not going to solve all of the problems, you know. We have a whole field of areas we need technology for and AI is great at some of the tasks and can't do the other tasks yet."</p><p>Houser was subsequently asked about the future of gaming now that AI technology is part of it, and he suggested it will land somewhere between art and commerce. </p><p>"[Gaming] can either go somewhere really interesting or somewhere that gets overly focused on making money," said Houser. "I think there's always that danger with any commercial art form that they get distracted by money. But I think there's still a big ceiling creatively to make these kind of living narrative experiences, and I think that was what we were always trying to do."</p><p>When asked if he thought the pursuit of money or creativity would win in the end, Houser clarified that both will win.</p><p>"I think there will be two parts," said Houser. "I've already seen that in spaces in the games industry where they both kind of win."</p><p>Earlier this month, Ubisoft was called out for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-promises-to-replace-ai-art-found-in-anno-117-pax-romana/1100-6536293/" data-ref-id="1100-6536293">including AI-created art</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anno-117-pax-romana/" data-ref-id="5000-632093">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve only spent a few nights in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> multiplayer mode, and while I’m not usually a competitive player, I had a pretty fun time during those early days post-launch, before everyone had figured out what the meta was going to be. It’s chaotic, makes the most out of the game’s real-time battle system, and hitting several enemies with one giant Surf tsunami is always satisfying. Even using my non-optimized team of favorites was a blast. But it was only like this for a few nights. Now, you can’t boot up the game without folks running the same three Pokémon and essentially turning competitive battles into a game of rock-paper-scissors.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s not uncommon for a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>meta to form that prioritizes a handful of monsters, but </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s multiplayer format has incentivized players to find what are essentially three of the strongest, most versatile Pokémon in the game’s roster and swap between them ad nauseam. This time, Metagross, Xerneas, and Garchomp have become the go-to team.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s multiplayer mode pits four players against each other, each with a team of three monsters, competing to rack up the most knock-outs in a limited time. These three Pokémon are not only powerful on their own, but they also have some of the most robust defensive capabilities in the game. Their Steel/Psychic, Fairy, and Dragon/Ground typings make them resistant to several incoming elements, and they each have versatile movesets. Basically, these three Pokémon cover most situations between them, and they are also excellent counters to one another. Metagross’ steel attacks can take down Xerneas, whose fairy-type moves are effective against Garchomp, who can knock Metagross over with a well-positioned Earthquake.</span></p>

 <p><span>These three Pokémon are so dominant in competitive play now that everyone else is just trying to get a few good hits in before some variation of this team pops up on the battlefield. When I started writing this up, I hopped into one match to see what teams I would come across, and while I didn’t face this exact composition, all three of my opponents had at least two of them on their team. I’m not the only person who’s noticed this, either.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646989" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646989"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646989">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“I know Metas are inevitable, but </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> online battles went from actually quite fun at release to the most monotonous and miserable thing ever over such a short time,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oqppm0/i_know_metas_are_inevitable_but_legends_za_online/"><span>Reddit user TheFierceDiety writes</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>“Adding in the legendaries this early in ranked was a crazy move,” D00MPhd wrote in response. “Xerneas being playable in ranked homogenized the format in the worst way. If they waited until there were more legendary options to choose from, like in older games, we would still see a degree of diversity among team building.”</span></p>

 <p><span>This kind of homogeneous teambuilding is the reason official </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>competitive play has tiers that sort different monsters into different groups. Right now, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has no such designation that lets you battle against teams of comparable power. If the game implements something like that, players who want to use different teams might have somewhere to play without having to deal with the impenetrable wall that is Metagross, Xerneas, and Garchomp.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe things will change when the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> launches on December 10 and adds several new monsters to the roster, but for the moment, this is what players are dealing with when they hop onto ranked battles. It’s made worse by the fact that you </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><span>have to play ranked battles to unlock certain Mega Stones</span></a><span>, so even people who don’t want to deal with these teams have to in order to get every Mega Evolution. It’s bad enough that there’s a growing cheater problem infecting the mode; now we have to deal with the same few monsters every battle. At least Game Freak made it easier to get high enough rank for those rewards by essentially making it impossible to lose rank. Now you can just go get beaten up for a few rounds and still get what you want. You’ll be fine.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-boycott-2000646987</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-dev-fired-over-charlie-kirk-joke-speaks-out-%E2%80%98at-no-point-did-anyone-ask-me-to-apologize%E2%80%99.1363282/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Hundreds of people were fired for what they said about Charlie Kirk in the wake of <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-assassination-bandai-namco-ai-model-gunpla-2000626472">his assassination</a> earlier this year. Ex-Sucker Punch artist Drew Harrison <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478">was one of them</a>. In her first interview since her joke about the murder prompted an online harassment campaign targeting the<em> Ghost Of Yotei</em> studio, she says Sony never asked her to remove the offending post or apologize for it before deciding to fire her.</p> <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-fired/">Speaking to <em>Aftermath</em></a>, the 10-year veteran of the PlayStation first-party team outlined what she experienced on the inside the studio and the campaign online to get her tossed out of it. “I just thought, ‘I’m their entertainment for the day,’” Harrison said. “I assumed it was going to go how it always has: Nobody cares about what they say because they literally only harass for the fun of it.”</p>

 <p>“I hope the shooter’s name is Mario so that Luigi knows his bro got his back,” she posted on Bluesky the day Kirk was shot. Online reactionaries like Mark “Grummz” Kern and others looking to exact revenge for anyone appearing to make light of the assassination began directing their followers to boycott<em> Yotei</em> and demand Harrison’s termination.</p>

 <p><em>Aftermath</em> reports that Sucker Punch became bombarded with so many anonymous calls that some employees were even instructed to unplug their desk phones. “I made the worst people on the internet mad,” Harrison wrote in the office chat the next day. “As an apology, there are banana muffins in the kitchen.”</p>

 <p>But later that day, a member of Sucker Punch’s leadership reportedly published the following message in the company’s chat:</p> <blockquote><p>Due to a social media post by one of our team members, many corners of our studio and Sony organization are having to manage a developing situation. We may have to pause a trailer release…there will be some significant amount of work created now to ensure we keep the spotlight on the fantastic game we’ve all created. Please be mindful of how you represent yourself online…</p></blockquote> <p>Harrison told <em>Aftermath</em> she was contacted later that day for an unscheduled call with a Sony HR rep (not a studio manager) who told her she was being immediately fired for allegedly “inciting violence” with her social media joke.</p>

 <p>“Full disclosure, the joke was not in the best taste,” Harrison said. “But at no point did anyone ask me to delete it. At no point did anyone ask me to apologize—and for the record, I would have. I would have worked with PR to write an apology. It feels like nobody investigated the harassment me and my coworkers were receiving.”</p>

 <p>Sony has never directly commented on the reason for the firing. “I think we’re aligned as a studio that celebrating or making light of someone’s murder is a deal-breaker for us, and we condemn that, kind of in no uncertain terms,” studio co-founder Brian Fleming later <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sucker-punch-brian-fleming-interview-playstation-ghost-of-yotei">told <em>Game File</em></a>. “That’s sort of our studio, and that’s kind of where we are.”</p> <p>Harrison said no one from Sucker Punch’s leadership, including Fleming, reached out to her before Sony fired her. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, meanwhile, has gone on to sell millions of copies despite the boycott targeting Harrison and reactionary attacks against lead actor Erika Ishii (whose performance <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">was nominated for a TGA</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Finding a good gift for the gamer in your life when you’re working with a tight budget can feel tougher than it probably should. After all, prices keep going up and money feels tighter for many. But not every present needs to cost you a fortune. That’s why Insider Gaming has put together a list of genuinely fun, useful gifts that still feel thoughtful and worth unwrapping. The best part, these gaming gifts are all on the cheap side at less than $25. </p>



<p>Whether you’re shopping for a friend, a family member, or just treating yourself, these picks prove you don’t need to overspend to give something great. When it comes to gifting, sometimes the smaller items end up being the ones people appreciate the most. A clever phone stand, a handy charging dock, or even a retro-themed game or controller can upgrade someone’s setup without hitting your wallet hard. And for those who love gaming culture as much as playing the games, books, card games, and novelty items can be just as meaningful as any big-ticket tech.</p>



<p>Below, you’ll find a mix gifts that stay under that $25 ceiling, making it easier to stick to a budget while still giving something they’ll actually use. Let’s take a look at the best cheap gaming gifts for 2025.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-gaming-gifts-under-25">Best Gaming Gifts Under $25</h2>



<p><strong>1985 Games Mystery Dice</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to get a new set of dice for your Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaigns or other table-top nights? This mystery dice set takes the decision of what dice to use out of your hand and gives you a random set of seven. This adds a little extra excitement before your next game night. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>FYOUNG Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 Controller Charging Dock</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Charging wireless controllers can be frustrating, especially if you forget to plug them in after use. For those with the Nintendo Switch, you can only charge the ones on your console usually, leaving your extras without the juice. This charging dock keeps up to four Joy-Cons charged and works with both Switch 1 <em>and </em>Switch 2 controllers.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>AZURAOKEY Carrying Case</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X are expensive pieces of equipment. So, why not protect the investment with a carrying cat that also comes with compartments for your chargers, memory cards, and other small accessories?</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>SOUNDANCE Laptop Stand</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Not much you can say about a laptop stand. It opens up room on your desk while bringing the display up higher for your eyes. The stand supports laptops ranging from 12-17.3 inches.</p>











<hr>



<p><strong>Press Reset by Jason Schrier</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>From Jason Schreier himself:</p>



<p><strong>“The business of videogames is both a prestige industry and an opaque one. Based on dozens of first-hand interviews that cover the development of landmark games—Bioshock Infinite, Epic Mickey, Dead Space, and more—on to the shocking closures of the studios that made them,&nbsp;Press Reset&nbsp;tells the stories of how real people are affected by game studio shutdowns, and how they recover, move on, or escape the industry entirely.”</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>8Bitdo M30 Bluetooth Controller</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want a cheap way to play classic Sega Games, or any game for that matter? This M30 Bluetooth Controller is designed to mimic the classic six-button Sega Genesis controller. It works on your Nintendo Switch or Switch 2, Windows PCs, and even mobile devices.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>8BitDo Wireless USB Adapter 2</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to guarantee you can hook up any Bluetooth controller to any device? This wireless USB adapter allows you connect your controllers to your Switch 2, Switch, PC, Steam Deck, and more. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>8Bitdo Bluetooth Retro Receiver&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If the person you’re buying for still likes to play on their PlayStation (PS1) or PlayStation 2 (PS2), why not give them the gift of wireless control. The 8Bitdo Bluetooth Retro Receiver allows you to use your Xbox, PS4, PS5, Wii U Pro and Switch Pro controllers wirelessly with the PS1 or PS2. Imagine just sitting on your couch that’s more than 10 feet from your TV?</p>











<hr>



<p><strong>UNO: The Legend of Zelda Card Game&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>UNO? Great game. The Legend of Zelda? Great franchise. So, why not combine them with a special version of UNO that features the artwork of The Legend of Zelda. There’s even a special Triforce Card that forces the next player to draw an addition three cards. Get it? Triforce? Three Cards? </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>JSAUX Docking Station</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Ally X, Steam Deck, Legion Go, and other handheld gaming PCs are all great devices, but sometimes you don’t want to play on the small screen. This docking station—which is actively in use by Senior Editor Mike Straw—allows you to not only hook your handheld to a larger display with HDMI 2.1, but also connect two USB-A devices, an ethernet cable, and a 100W USB-C charging port for your handheld to stay powered during use.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Banjo-Kazooie Mobile Phone &amp; Controller Holder</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>An 8.5″ figure made from PVC, this Banjo-Kazooie holder is the perfect place to set your phone, controller, or other small devices when not in use. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>The Oregon Trail Card Game</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have a millennial you’re shopping for, why not give them the gift of dysentery and let them relive their youth. Supporting 2-6 players with 8-bit art, The Oregon Trail Card Game has you try to stay alive from Independence, Missouri to the Willamette Valley. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Reveals New Special Edition Crocs]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-special-edition-crocs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-reveals-new-special-edition-crocs.1363273/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Your shoes are now an Xbox. A new collaboration between Xbox and footwear brand Crocs has been announced, and it’s one for the 2000s kids. </p>







<p>With the 20th anniversary of the Xbox 360, Microsoft has been a bit quiet in terms of celebration. Over the weekend, many outlets, like Insider Gaming, did lists on the console, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/favorite-xbox-360-games-ever/">the staff’s favorite titles</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-selling-xbox-360-games-all-time/">best-selling</a>. However, it seems the company has had one foot in the door the whole time. Luckily, that foot looks rather stylish with the new designs in its collaboration with Crocs.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-crocs-available-november-25th-cost-80">Xbox Crocs Available November 25th, Cost $80</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced today, Crocs and Xbox are collaborating on a <a href="https://houseofheat.co/crocs/xbox-crocs-classic-clog-211439-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">special edition pair of Crocs shoes</a>. The pair will don the Xbox logo and made to look like an Xbox controller, complete with buttons and joysticks. So, basically, your feet can look like controllers. Who doesn’t want that? The collaboration is starting sales on November 25th and will cost $80. If the controller Crocs are too expensive, you can get limited-edition Xbox Jibbitz, which include designs from Fallout, Halo, and League of Legends, to name a few. Those cost around $20 and also launch on November 25th. You can find the link for purchasing <a href="https://www.crocs.com/p/xbox-classic-clog/211439.html?cgid=standard-exclusion-list&amp;cid=001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<p>In the world of collaborations, it’s not a surprise to see Xbox going outside of the box. A while ago, Xbox made an Xbox Series X Mini Fridge, as the console looked like one. While not connected much, the statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/david-jaffe-god-of-war-creator-xbox-grave-joke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘This is an Xbox’</a> does feel apt for this. The company’s desire to be just about everywhere is certainly working, with exclusives like Halo going to PlayStation and future titles going multiplatform. Soon, you won’t be able to outrun an Xbox; you’ll just wear them on your feet.</p>







<p>What do you think of the Xbox Crocs? Going to get a pair? Just buying the Jibbitz? Any other out-there collaborations Microsoft should do? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

The BlackCell DLC bundles are some of the more expensive Call of Duty offerings, coming in at around $30.

Now re-christened as Wild Blue Skies, the upcoming retro throwback has over four minutes of new gameplay footage.</p><p>Wild Blue Skies was first revealed in March, and this homage to Star Fox has some authentic expertise behind it; Giles Goddard, a former Nintendo programmer who worked on the original Star Fox, leads the development team at the Kyoto-based Chuhai Labs. &nbsp;The gameplay trailer, revealed by <em>IGN</em>, shows off an unedited dogfighting sequence through the ancient ruins of a stormy planet.&nbsp;</p><p>Wild Blue Skies centers on ace pilot Bowie Stray and his team taking on the forces of the evil Grimclaw. The flight combat, along with the comms chatter of your dorky anthromorphic animal comrades, certainly captures the spirit of Nintendo’s oft-neglected rail shooter.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/25wVPzOTSLU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/25wVPzOTSLU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Wild Blue Skies is currently confirmed for PC only, but it does not have a release window.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/24/star-fox-inspired-wild-blue-skies-formerly-wild-blue-gets-extended-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-console-linus-skillup-valve-2000646965</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-machine-won%E2%80%99t-be-subsidized-to-price-it-like-a-500-gaming-console.1363252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve hasn’t officially announced the price of its upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">Steam Machine consoles</a>. Maybe even CEO Gabe Newell doesn’t know how much the company will eventually decide to charge. But that hasn’t stopped a drip-feed of quote and speculation from pointing toward the higher end of the pricing spectrum. The company recently confirmed it won’t be subsidizing the devices, seemingly squashing any chance of it being less than the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">price of a PlayStation 5 Pro</a>.</p> <p>That was the sense we got from comments Valve made back when the Steam Machines <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">were first revealed</a>. Despite an emphasis on “affordability,” the company was also quick to confirm that the consoles would be “very competitive with a PC you could build yourself from parts” but also closer to the “entry level of the PC space” than what some fans might be expecting.</p>

 <p>Last week on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dnKy4UEdiyo?si=vFixe-qpVjph_B0v">LinusTechTips YouTube channel</a>, Linus Gabriel Sebastian confirmed that he asked Valve directly if the smaller storage Steam Machine would be in line with a current $500 console. “Nobody said anything, but the energy of the room wasn’t great,” he said.</p>

 <p>The scales have now tipped even further away from that price point in an interview Valve did <a href="https://youtu.be/yvu66Y2VLq8?si=SskFh89ieBarjGmu">with gaming channel Skill Up</a>. YouTuber Ralph Panebianco asked point-blank if the company would use proceeds from Steam to make the hardware cheaper than it costs to manufacture. “No,” software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais said. “It’s more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market. Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance.”</p>

 <p>It’s not been uncommon in the past for console makers to underprice hardware in order to grow their install base and make more money off of selling more games and servers on the backend. As the biggest PC gaming store around, Valve has billions of profits it could through at gaining market share in a potential console war. It sounds like that’s not what the company has planned, however.</p>

 <p>No subsidies is basically the final nail in the coffin for any hope that the Steam Machine will be priced to compete directly with a Switch 2, PS5, or pre-tariff Xbox Series X. Some fans are still hoping the 512GB model might come in between $600 and $700, which would put it around the current price of the 1TB Steam Deck OLED.</p> <p>Even that seems overly optimistic, especially with <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">recent reports</a> that the AI arms race is about to push PC component prices <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">even higher</a>. Next-gen consoles, which all rely on the same chip makers, will be facing similar pressures. We’ll see how it all shakes out when Valve reveals the Steam Machine price early next year. Who knows. Maybe the PS6 and next Xbox won’t be anywhere close to $500, either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty fans are getting an early treat in Black Ops 7 Multiplayer with Season 1, as eight new modes are coming to the game—six of which will remain permanently available.</p>



<p>Season 1 in Black Ops 7, kicking off on December 4, brings a host of new additions to the title, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-is-getting-six-new-multiplayer-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">variety of maps</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombies-gets-new-maps-enemies-more-in-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new maps for Zombies</a>, and players in Multiplayer will be spoiled for choice on the game modes to enjoy.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-gets-6-new-modes-2-ltms">Black Ops 7 Gets 6 New Modes, 2 LTMs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Break your bones. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>As revealed in the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-zombies-season-01#Modes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty blog</a>, Black Ops 7 will see the addition of eight new Multiplayer modes, two of which are limited-time only and will form a part of the CODMAS event.</p>



<p>The permanent game modes being added include Prop Hunt, Gun Game, One in the Chamber, and Sticks and Stones, along with a new mode, Takeover, where players fight over three neutral territories and earn points for each zone they control. Once all three zones are captured, a short cooldown takes place before they move to new locations—effectively making it a mix of Domination and Headquarters.</p>



<p>During the season, two limited-time modes are coming as part of CODMAS festivities. Holiday Havoc is a “festive moshpit combiting your favourite modes with holiday cheer,” where players can earn bonuses like Quick Regen, Spring Speed, and Movement Speed for eliminating enemies.</p>



<p>Snowfight is the other LTM featuring in-season, which, as the name suggests, sees players throw snowballs at each other to eliminate them, with no respawns. </p>



<p>Season 1 in Multiplayer also brings additional loadout content in the form of the Deadeye Drone, available as a Weekly Challenge Reward during the season for completing weekly objectives.</p>

There's plenty of Reimagined content to read here, but I also took this opportunity to ask Horii about the secret sauce behind Dragon Quest.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Horii, it's two things: warmth and ease of access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The key concept that I really try to prioritize, or keep important to me, for Dragon Quest is that, you know, older computer games didn't really have a sense of warmth," Horii says on the games he played preceding his work creating Dragon Quest. "But [warmth] was something that I really wanted to bring for the Dragon Quest titles. That, and accessibility for the players."&nbsp;</p><p>Horii tells me that when developing Dragon Quest, he specifically wanted to launch it on the Nintendo Famicom, recognizing its ease of access for players compared to home computers, which still carried a hefty price tag comparatively.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think [warmth and accessibility] are pretty important in terms of what makes Dragon Quest, Dragon Quest," he continues. "But one thing that I also have in mind, one potential reason why it's been beloved for so long, for almost 40 years, is that the Dragon Quest series also serves as a sort of communication tool for players. A lot of people might have memories of playing the Dragon Quest games with friends; they might have a memory of playing the game with their older brother [...] who they might ask to play the game on their behalf so that they can grind and skip the [leveling process challenges].</p><p>"So I think that for a lot of people, Dragon Quest games just have a special place in their heart, and that's why it's been so successful for so long."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seated beside Horii during this interview was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/05/who-is-takeshi-ichikawa-the-producer-of-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Reimagined producer Takeshi Ichikawa</a>. In my time playing it so far, Reimagined retains the warmth of the original island-hopping Dragon Quest VII adventure, and the new visual aesthetic lends itself well to those feelings. That's one of the bigger takeaways from my preview: it's cozy, warm, and invites adventure. I asked Ichikawa the same question I posed to Horii, curious about his takeaway.</p><p>"I think all the RPG elements the series has to offer are the biggest strength of the Dragon Quest series, and I like to call it part of the Horii-esque elements," he says. "All the humor, the jokes in the narrative, the dialogue, and the expressions and the portrayals; It's just so adorable at times, and when you look at the story, it's an epic story but also somehow feels relevant to you at the time."&nbsp;</p><p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet to access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.</p><hr><p><em>What do you think the secret sauce of Dragon Quest is?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-game-developers-have-a-new-sales-pitch-being-%E2%80%98ai-free%E2%80%99.1363213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Earlier this month, Junghun Lee — CEO of Nexon, the parent company behind current live-service shooter du jour <em>Arc Raiders</em> — <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">made waves in the game development community with a straightforward statement</a>. “It’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI,” he explained. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-nexon-ai-in-game-development-strange-scaffold/">Indie developers were quick to loudly and vociferously call bullshit</a>. “It’s just not true,” Alex Kanaris-Sotiriou, cofounder of <em>Röki </em>and<em> Mythwrecked </em>developer <a href="https://www.polygon-treehouse.com/">Polygon Treehouse</a>, tells<em> The Verge</em>.</p></div><p>As similar reactions poured in over social media, many developers shared that avoiding generative AI was not only a matter of personal pride, but also a matter of professional marketing — one that developers are leveraging to let their players know their games were made by humans.</p><p>For Kanaris-Sotiriou, the question of adopting the use of gen AI to make games was an easy one to answer. “The foundations that it’s built upon, the idea of using other people’s work without permission to generate artwork [...] are unfair,” he says.</p><p>Lee’s comments are just the latest in a string of <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/playstation-boss-ai-used-all-aspects-game-development/">notable gaming CEOs</a> declaring that <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-boss-argues-arc-raiders-ai-use-actually-makes-gaming-better-and-that-people-jump-to-extreme-takes-about-the-tech-surely-theres-a-middle-ground-here/">gen AI is the future of the medium</a>. But Kanaris-Sotiriou, along with many of his game development peers, wanted to push back against this assertion. So earlier this year they collaborated on a solution — a simple image file of <a href="https://www.polygon-treehouse.com/no-gen-ai-seal">a golden cog-shaped seal</a> that declares, “This developer assures that no gen AI was used in this indie game.”</p><div><p>They made the image (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kanaratron.bsky.social/post/3li7u4xsjrc2l">which Kanaris-Sotiriou tweaked</a> to ensure it didn’t too closely resemble <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Official_Nintendo_Seal">a more famous seal of approval</a>) freely available for any studio to use in their marketing materials, websites, or game pages. While Kanaris-Sotiriou doesn’t have hard numbers on its use, the seal shows up on the store pages for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1226670%2FRosewater%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Rosewater</em></a>, <em>Astral Ascent</em>, <em>Quarterstaff</em>, and more. In the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kanaratron.bsky.social/post/3li7t5wpc7s2l">Bluesky thread announcing the seal’s creation</a>, multiple indie developers shared that they put it on their Itch.io pages and on Steam, where it serves as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24032678/valve-steam-generative-ai-rules-disclosure-pre-generated-live-illegal-content-copyright">antithesis to the platform’s gen AI disclosure rules.</a></p></div><p>Other developers are adopting their own bespoke solutions that act both as an informative statement against gen AI and a philosophical one.</p><p><em>“</em>Absolutely everything in Unbeatable was created by human beings without any generative assistance<em>,” </em>reads a graphic <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dcellgames.com/post/3m5g2ktw6rc22">posted by D-Cell Games</a> on Bluesky about its upcoming game <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2240620%2FUNBEATABLE%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Unbeatable</em></a>. The image was created specifically in response to Lee’s comments.<em> “</em>Every frame drawn, every word written, every model sculpted, every line of code typed, every song sung with a real voice, every guitar played with a real hand, every moment flawed and messy because we are, also<em>.”</em></p><p>Where other developers have taken a simple declarative approach against gen AI, the passion in D-Cell’s statement is apparent and it reads almost like a challenge to those who use the tools. “Ignoring all of the ethical, moral, and legal concerns of using generative AI, it’s a huge waste of effort,” says Jeffrey Chiao, studio producer at D-Cell Games, in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. “We can produce results that meet our quality standards without its assistance.”</p><div><p>Gen AI enthusiasts see the technology as a way to unlock hidden creative potential, and to many it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/694531/runway-ai-video-games-generate">a tool to speed up the time-consuming and costly processes</a> inherent to video game production. Some of the biggest companies are taking advantage of that; EA has announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805777/ea-stability-ai-transformative-game-development-tools">a partnership with Stability AI</a>, for instance, while Microsoft is using AI <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">to generate gameplay</a>.</p></div><div><p>Ubisoft in particular has had a lot to say about gen AI, with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-delayed-results">CEO Yves Guillemot calling it</a> “as big [of] a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D” in a recent earnings call. Players can converse with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/19/24105748/nvidia-neo-npc-prototypes-gdc-2024">Ubisoft’s gen AI-powered Neo NPCs</a> while the company’s Ghostwriter tool <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/7Cm07zbBGy4Xml6WgYi25d/the-convergence-of-ai-and-creativity-introducing-ghostwriter">generates short snippets of dialogue called barks</a>. <em>Subnautica 2</em> and <em>PUBG</em> publisher Krafton <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/krafton-launches-voluntary-resignation-program-weeks-after-declaring-its-ai-first-company-future/">suggested its employees voluntarily resign</a> if they can’t abide by the company’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805509/krafton-pubg-ai-first-developer-agentic-gpu-cluster">“AI-first” reorganization</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
               <p><span>This past summer, kids turned to </span><i><span>Roblox</span></i><span> to protest the aggressive, violent escalation of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. Now, activists are using both </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V </span></i><span>roleplay to educate gamers on how to handle an IRL ICE raid.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As reported by both </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-defense-training-on-fortnite-new-save-collective/"><i><span>404 Media</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/activists-are-using-fortnite-to-fight-back-against-ice/"><i><span>WIRED</span></i></a><span>, a global gamer group called New Save Collective has been organizing special events in video games that mimic real-world ICE raids to help raise awareness and educate players about their rights. On November 20, the collective organized a </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span> event, which took place in the </span><i><span>GTA Online</span></i><span> RP servers and featured masked ICE agents stopping players and demanding they show identification.</span></p>

 <p><span>On November 21, New Save Collective held a related event in the currently</span><i><span> Simpsons</span></i><span>-themed </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>, specifically in the “Delulu” mode, the only one that features proximity chat. It allowed players to meet each other in-game before practicing what to do if ICE approaches them in a real-life scenario. The role-playing event featured agents played by the Collective (which has recently partnered with other immigration advocacy groups like Immigrants Belong and Define American) attempting to detain and/or question “vulnerable” civilians, their chosen term for people most often targeted by ICE raids.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In clips shared with </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span>, the agents reportedly urged other players, who were not the target of their search, to leave. “This does not concern you,” one said. A person responded with, “We’re allowed to record,” while the group of “civilians” closed in on the two agents, who were standing on top of a golf cart. The agents decide to “abandon the vehicle” and leave, during which a player yells, “Yeah, I threw a pizza at you!”</span></p>

 <p><span>Obviously, this is nothing like how an ICE raid goes in the real world, but that’s the point—to allow gamers a chance to role-play what could be a very scary situation with relatively low stakes. An organizer told </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span> that the goal of the space was less training for a potential ICE raid and more “to organize a community and build trust.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Both ICE and the White House have repeatedly co-opted gaming to both promote their anti-immigrant propaganda and serve as potential recruitment spaces. The most recent example happened last month when </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/29/why-trumps-white-house-is-using-video-game-memes-to-recruit-for-ice"><span>official government Twitter accounts shared AI-generated images</span></a><span> of Trump as </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>’s Master Chief and calls to “stop the Flood.” It’s heartening to see New Save Collective try and steal back some digital space from the alt-right. The “culture change organization” dedicated to humanizing immigrants,&nbsp; Define American, told </span><i><span>Wired </span></i><span>that, “Gaming wasn’t kind of a random genre that we chose. We’ve been tracking anti-immigrant myths and disinformation digitally for years.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>New Save Collective will hold more events throughout the rest of 2025, and told </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span> the response thus far has been “overwhelmingly positive,” except for the people claiming to be ICE agents who have tried to join the Discord server.</span></p>

<p>Season 1 is on the horizon in Black Ops 7, and the first season in the latest Call of Duty title is bringing a host of new content across all game modes, including Zombies.</p>



<p>Zombies in Black Ops 7 launched with two maps, the larger, story-based Ashes of the Damned map, with a smaller segment of the map, Vandorn Farm, used for the Survival mode, and the tally of maps is set to more than double in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>—along with the addition of new enemies and the return of content from other Black Ops titles.</p>







<h2 id="h-zombies-receives-new-map-amp-two-survival-maps-in-black-ops-7-season-1">Zombies Receives New Map &amp; Two Survival Maps in Black Ops 7 Season 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New map. Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>



<p>As revealed in the latest blog post ahead of Season 1, which kicks off on December 4, Astra Malorum is the next story map in Zombies where players explore “an evil presence festering in the Dark Aether.”</p>



<p>The map features a new enemy, the O.S.C.A.R Elite Robot, a new Wonder Weapon, the LGM-1, and new traps, alongside the story quest and easter eggs to uncover.</p>



<p>For players grinding through Camo challenges and wanting a change of scenery from Vandorm Farm, Season 1 provides exactly that with Exit 115, another location from the larger Ashes of the Damned map, available in Survival from launch, with the Zorya Observatory following in mid-season.</p>



<p>Alongside the new maps, a slew of new and returning Ammo Mods will become available, including Light Mind and Shatter Blast, Field Upgrades, including Tesla Storm and Frost Blast, and the return of the fan-favorite Perk Mule Kick—all of which have their own Research to complete.</p>



<p>Zombies will also support the addition of seven new weapons, with some available at the start and others arriving mid-season, 11 new Weapon Attachments, while Directed Mode for the Ashes of the Damned story quest will also be available, guiding players through the necessary steps for completion.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Attack on Titan crossover is live with title update 1.1.6; however, the quest is only available for a limited time, until December 22, 2025. </p>



<p>The details about Assassin’s Creed Shadows have been less lately, with AC Mirage taking up the news in recent days. We recently learned the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-hits-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossed 10 million players</a> thanks to the arrival of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-dlc-patch-notes-new-free-content-gameplay-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valley of Memory DLC</a>. Now, we are receiving new content for AC Shadows as well, with popular manga and anime series Attack on Titan making its way into the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-attack-on-titan-crossover-will-add-new-skins-for-yasuke-and-naoe">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows’ Attack on Titan Crossover Will Add New Skins for Yasuke and Naoe</h2>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows Attack on Titan crossover goes live on November 25 and will run until December 22. During this time, players can take part in a limited-time quest where they face a mysterious, power-hungry faction that has infiltrated feudal Japan and kidnapped a Titan Shifter. There’s a lone survivor with a dark secret who fails to rescue the Shifter and then recruits Naoe and Yasuke to help them out. </p>



<p>To unlock the AOT quest in AC Shadows, players will have to first unlock Yasuke as a playable character and then head to the Yamashiro region, North of Hanazo Tower. While playing the quest, players will unlock new banners and a statue for their hideout and will acquire a crystal katana for Naoe once completed. </p>



<p>Along with the quest, AC Shadows will also receive the Attack on Titan Dual Pack, which is inspired by the series’ universe. This pack includes new outfits, weapons, trinkets, and a new mount. Some of what we saw in the trailer showed Naoe wearing Mikasa Ackerman’s iconic costume, and Yasuke wearing a titan-themed armour. </p>

<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-third-story-drop-a-puzzlement">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Third Story Drop: A Puzzlement</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows title update 1.1.6 introduces the game’s third story drop, along with the Attack on Titan crossover. The new quest is called “A Puzzlement”, and it has been described as fun and humorous. It will feature Yasuke and Naoe engaging with two old acquaintances who are having a loud argument about a mysterious door in South Wakasa, and they have tasked the duo with figuring out how to open it. </p>



<p>The quest will have Yasuke and Naoe learning each other’s skills as well. Naoe will learn to perform her own spectacular version of Yasuke’s war-kick ability. Yasuke will learn to stealthily dispatch enemies non-lethally. Players will also finally be able to settle the debate as to who would win in a straight-up duel between our two protagonists. </p>
