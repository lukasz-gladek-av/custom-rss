			<p>Last year’s entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>WWE 2K series</strong></a> left some, <strong>including me</strong>, wanting. After several years of steady piecemeal improvement, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>WWE 2K25 went all-in on The Island</strong></a>, a new cosmetic-festooned online hub similar to NBA 2K's The City, with most other aspects of the game falling by the wayside. Was this just a one-year misstep, or the beginning of a new direction? <span>Last week, <strong>I traveled to WWE Headquarters</strong> in Stamford, Connecticut, to go hands-on with&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" target="_blank"><strong>WWE 2K26</strong></a>&nbsp;and <strong>was surprised to find I could test pretty much the entire game</strong> (in years past, journalists were typically given a curated list of modes and matches to try).</span> This would seem to reflect the fact that developer Visual Concepts have really spread their effort out this year, offering updates for most aspects of the game rather than focusing on a single big ticket new item like The Island (although The Island does return this year).</p>



<p>So, has WWE 2K26 benefitted from this renewed focus on the fundamentals, or is the series destined to fall further down the card?&nbsp;While <strong>I need to play more before I can render any final verdict</strong>, you can roll on with my pre-show impressions.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k268.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>While WWE 2K26 plays more or less the same as the series has for years now, <strong>some notable between-the-ropes tweaks and additions have been made</strong>. I've long been critical of WWE 2K's stamina and reversal system, arguing there simply aren't enough ways to change the course of a match and that reversals are overused and frustrating. If you're not feeling the often-finnicky timing on reversals, your opponent can seemingly beat you down with impunity. Alternatively, sometimes it feels like higher-level AI or skilled human opponents are able to reverse literally everything you throw at them.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k2613.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>With WWE 2K26, <strong>Visual Concepts have taken at least a half-step to address this</strong>. Now if you go for too many reversals in a row (around three or four) you'll become "winded" and won't be able to reverse anything for a few seconds. This means those infuriating stretches where an opponent won't let you land <em>anything </em>will eventually come to an end, and, in theory, will force folks to play with a bit more strategy. Is it really worth it to reverse every kick and punch? Or do you save your stamina for the bigger moves?</p>



<p>Honestly, I wouldn't mind if the “winded” mechanic was even stricter. While there were a few less reversals during my recent playtime, they were still pretty heavily in play. Visual Concepts also hasn't done anything to fix the random-feeling timing of reversals. I think Visual Concepts understand that a more strategic approach to reversals is required, but ultimately, a more complete rework of the system is required. Perhaps something that takes the momentum of the <em>attacker</em> into account as well (and brings back blocks while you're at it).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2K2614.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Other in-ring tweaks include <strong>new start-of-match actions -- &nbsp;you can now offer a handshake, rush in for a hockey-fight-style brawl, etc. -- and additional weapons, like thumb tacks and a shopping cart you can take an opponent for an involuntary ride in</strong>. These features don't really change core gameplay all that much, but are in keeping with Visual Concepts’ focus on simulating the look and feel of the real WWE TV product. They're fun little touches that should be appreciated by folks who primarily play these games to roleplay as a WWE Superstar.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k2610.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Four new match types have been added</strong> -- I Quit, Dumpster, Three Stages of Hell, and the much-requested Inferno match -- <strong>all of which feel like worthwhile additions</strong>, to varying degrees. I Quit isn't a simple submission match – while you can make someone quit with a submission, you can also beat them down and then ask for a verbal “I Quit.” If your opponent slaps you in a submission or asks for an I Quit, a minigame pops up where you have to time button presses as your cursor passes through several green zones on a circular meter. These green zones shrink depending on how much damage you've absorbed to various body parts, so it is quite possible to get an I Quit by simply beating your opponent to a pulp. I quite liked this system and wouldn't mind if something similar were used for submissions across all match types.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k269.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The Inferno match is simple enough, as you beat on your opponent with big moves until the flame meter is maxed out, then try to light them ablaze by throwing them into the flames. Mechanically, the match works, and there are some fun secret ways to win (flaming tables or fireballs will do the job), but the presentation is a bit iffy. The flame effects are obviously just a flat texture, and you never actually get to see your opponent get lit up, just an animation of them being sprayed with a fire extinguisher (perhaps this is a ratings issue).</p>



<p>The Dumpster match is another of your basic "throw your opponent into something and close the door/lid" matches, albeit one that's good for some juvenile boasting. Meanwhile, <strong>Three Stages of Hell allows you to pick any three matches you want to play back-to-back, allowing you to make it whatever kind of experience you want</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k2615.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Visually, <strong>WWE 2K26 looks largely the same as last year’s title</strong>, despite the franchise finally dropping last-gen consoles. Most of the game's 400+ playable characters (that number includes alternate versions of characters and even completely fictional wrestlers from The Island) look mostly the same as last year, albeit with some tweaks for stars who have changed their looks and another level of polish on the lighting and some effects. Interestingly, in an interview with WWE 2K26's devs, one way they say they’ve taken advantage of their newfound freedom from last-gen restrictions is <strong>the return of body morphing in create-a-wrestler, which should result in more accurate (and out-there) custom creations</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k2611.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>As usual, <strong>2K Showcase is this year’s most heavily promoted mode</strong>, with CM Punk being the focus this go ‘round. The Showcase features the usual recreations of real-world matches, but also some intriguing "What if?" and fantasy matches imagining what might have happened if Punk hadn't taken a decade-long, er… "sabbatical" from WWE. It's a clever hook, but the Showcase matches suffer from the same problem they always have -- a very exacting list of objectives that can be frustrating to pull off just the way the game wants you to. Interestingly, this year, <strong>there is also the option to take on a gauntlet of regular matches to unlock all Showcase content, which feels like an admission that this mode will never be for everyone</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2K2612.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>That isn't necessarily the end of the world, as <strong>there are a lot of other modes on offer here</strong>. For instance, I'm happy to report that <strong>the MyRise career mode seems to be back on more solid ground this time</strong>. Last year's MyRise felt like it had been badly neglected, with only one story regardless of whether you played as a male or female Superstar and characterizations that felt completely divorced from actual WWE programming. This year, we get separate stories for both the men and women and a narrative that feels more grounded in real WWE programming, with players taking on the role of "The Archetype," a main-event Superstar returning on the Raw after WrestleMania to much fanfare. No tiresome "rags to riches" story here, you're right there in the mix with top wrestlers who feel like they're properly aligned and acting like themselves.</p>



<p>I wasn't able to delve into the game’s other modes as deeply, but they all seem to offer their own new bullet points. The Island now has a faction system and new options for teaming with others, MyGM has added intergender matches, multi-person matches, and 50-week seasons, the Universe sandbox mode now includes the WWE Draft, and more. <strong>Pretty much everywhere you look, something fresh has been added, which is actually a pretty impressive accomplishment considering Visual Concepts only gets around 9 months to develop each new entry in the series</strong> (these guys should be competing for the WWE Speed title).</p>

<h2 id="h-current-thoughts-on-wwe-2k26"><strong>Current Thoughts on WWE 2K26</strong></h2>



<p><strong>WWE 2K26 isn't a full-on reinvention</strong>. I'm not sure we're ever going to see that, but <strong>developer Visual Concepts has hit the gym, put in the work, and come back with small to mid-size gains pretty much across the board</strong>. I still have to play more to see how well it all holds together, and some nagging irritations still remain, but it's nice to see a veteran franchise player like WWE 2K still working on its fundamentals.</p>

You can check out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k26-interview-gamelay-changes-cutting-last-gen-the-island/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with WWE 2K producers Lynell Jinks and Bryan Williams here</a>. WWE 2K26 hits PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Switch 2 <strong>on March 13</strong>, unless you buy <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k26-announced-march-cm-punk-150-dollar-edition-battle-passes-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the game’s three special editions</a>, in which case, you’ll be able to play a week early on March 6.</p>

			<p><strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a></em></strong> made its debut on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series</strong> consoles in January, and the Switch 2 port in particular has been praised as a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/">solid port</a></strong> that accounts for the system's technical limitations compared to the&nbsp;PlayStation 5&nbsp;and&nbsp;Xbox Series X,&nbsp;delivering the best possible experience.</p>



<p>With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-june/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em></strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em></strong>, however, achieving a high-quality port is definitely going to be more challenging, but the development team is set to deliver a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">30 FPS</strong> on the weaker platforms, such as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Switch 2</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series S</strong>, according to the trilogy's director <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Naoki Hamaguchi</strong>.</p>



<p>Speaking with <strong><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/we-ask-final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-naoki-hamaguchi-about-the-switch-2-versions-hair-problem-why-does-it-happen-and-can-it-be-avoided/">Automaton</a></strong>, <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> was asked about the performance target for the second and third entry in the series, confirming that every effort is being made on this front.</p>



<p><em>"We’re consistently aiming for 30fps wherever possible,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi</strong> said. <em>"For FFVII Rebirth and the third installment of the trilogy, our engineers are working hard on tuning to ensure stable performance at that level. I hope players will look forward to it."</em></p>



<p>Considering how some <strong>visual compromises</strong> had to be made to make <strong>Performance Mode</strong> in <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></strong> on <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> run at <strong>stable 60 FPS</strong>, it will be very interesting to see how the <strong>Switch 2</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> will handle future games to ensure this <strong>30 FPS target</strong> is met, and what sort of compromises will be made to deliver the best possible experience for a massive game like <strong><em>Rebirth</em></strong> and the even bigger game <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em></strong> is set to be.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there's still no indication of exactly h<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">ow big the third and final part of the trilogy will be</strong>, as it hasn't been officially announced yet.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-rob-robot-trailer-2000669425"><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </em></a>arrives in theaters in April. We know <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-yoshi-birdo-baby-2000662854">Yoshi, Bowser Jr., and Rosalina</a> will be joining the sequel alongside the main returning characters, Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and Peach. But according to a new leak courtesy of a theater chain’s website, another new face is set to show up in the animated sequel.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-description-appears-to-spoil-a-major-unannounced-character">As spotted by <em>IGN</em></a>, United Kingdom-based fancy movie theater chain Everyman recently posted a new text description for the upcoming blockbuster that just straight up lists Wario. The totally new, not-yet-announced-to-be-in-this-movie villain who is seemingly going to be a part of <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> hasn’t shown up in any of Nintendo’s past marketing beats or trailers. <a href="https://www.everymancinema.com/film-listing/327878-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/#coming-soon:~:text=After%20defeating%20Bowser%20and%20saving%20Brooklyn%2C%20Mario%20faces%20Wario%20and%20Bowser%20Jr.%27s%20evil%20alliance.%20Now%2C%20alongside%20his%20friends%20and%20Yoshi%2C%20he%20must%20stop%20their%20plans%20for%20world%20domination.">Here’s the description</a>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“After defeating Bowser and saving Brooklyn, Mario faces <strong>Wario</strong> and Bowser Jr.’s evil alliance. Now, alongside his friends and Yoshi, he must stop their plans for world domination.”</p></blockquote> <p>Well, that sure sounds like Wario is going to be in this movie! Of course, calling this a spoiler is probably inaccurate as it’s likely to be revealed in Nintendo and Universal’s own pre-release marketing rollout via a new teaser or something before the movie’s April 1 debut. But at least for now, Wario’s inclusion in the <em>Mario</em> movie sequel has yet to be announced. We do know that Chris Pratt, who voices Mario, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/chris-pratt-supposedly-hints-at-a-couple-more-character-surprises-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">has hinted that there are more unannounced characters left to be revealed</a>. So he’s likely referencing Wario, assuming this leaked description is accurate. And if it is, it sounds like Wario will play a big role in the film alongside Bowser Jr.</p> <p>Now, what I’m really excited about is that if Wario is in this movie, that means I can raise the chance of <a href="https://kotaku.com/waluigi-debuted-20-years-ago-today-and-i-respect-him-a-1844460557">Nintendo’s horrible affront to nature, Waluigi,</a> showing up in this flick from 1 percent to a solid 10 percent. Maybe more! How exciting.</p>

              <p>After <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-goodbye-email-memo-xbox-microsoft-2000672084">the shock resignation of Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond from Xbox last week</a>, the gaming world is attempting to piece together exactly <a href="https://kotaku.com/thats-it-im-calling-it-xbox-is-dead-time-of-death-february-20-2000672114">what will happen next to Microsoft’s gaming brand</a>, especially under the auspices of new leader Asha Sharma. Why has someone with a background in AI and not gaming been put at the helm? And wait, she said <em>what</em> about birthrates and AI?</p> <p>Big tech’s obsession with birthrate figures is something that should certainly make you feel uncomfortable, given it’s usually about half a step removed from <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/why-are-elon-musk-and-marc-andreesen-obsessed-with-birth-rates/">matters far more sinister</a>. Which is why it’s so disappointing to hear Asha Sharma, in an interview on a podcast from five months ago, saying that the thing she thinks about the most—other than GPUs—is whether her son “will have classmates in the future.” (Thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samred.com/post/3mfdstcvges2c">Sam Machkovech</a>.) This is because, she says, “fertility rates are declining, the average birthrate in the ’90s when we were growing up was, like, 3, and now it’s 2.3, and in 2050 it’s estimated to be below replacement.” This is strange on its own, and also completely wrong, but her next words make it far weirder. “I think that AI can have such a big effect on it, and already is.”</p>

 <p>Sharma goes on to give examples of this, like how she’s heard about a hospital in London that’s using AI to improve the fertility success rate of IVF, the “amazing story” of how ChatGPT 5 is “helping in healthcare,” and how Stanford was a big customer of hers, using AI for “tumor reviews.”</p>  <p>Of course, the reason for the declining birthrate in the U.S. is multifactorial, but almost certainly primarily about income. In the affluent ’90s, people felt confident about being able to afford two or three children, but in the 2020s that’s a far more costly prospect. If people in big tech were genuinely concerned about the number of children being born, their attention would be wholly focused on <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2026/is-the-us-birth-rate-declining">making American lives more affordable, providing better benefits and support, and increasing wages</a>. And not, say, on replacing workers with ineffectual AI while driving industries that rely on paying low incomes.</p>

 <p>Sharma’s numbers are <em>way</em> off, as it happens. The fertility rate wavered between 1.9 and 2.0 in the 1990s, and hasn’t been close to her claimed 3 since the mid-60s. It dipped as low as 1.6 after steady decline following the financial crash of 2008, but in recent years has begun to recover: it was back up to 1.8 in 2025. So in fact a difference of 0.1 since Sharma’s heyday of baby births.</p>

 <p>But to put everyone’s minds at rest regarding those empty classrooms: As it turns out, we don’t just distribute however many children are around into the current number of classrooms. That would be a weird system. So even if birthrates were to suddenly halve, we’d just have…fewer schools. Am I really explaining this to the head of Xbox?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Resident Evil 7: Biohazard Gold Edition (Switch 2) - A Survival Horror Masterclass, Free From Cloud Prison]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition</link>
            <guid>1443724</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Just in case you need yet another reminder of how old you’re getting, Capcom first revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> all the way back in June 2016 – almost a <em>decade</em> ago. Following its release in 2017 and a rather unsavoury <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_7_biohazard_cloud">cloud port</a> on the Switch in 2021, Nintendo fans can finally experience Capcom’s soft reboot on Switch 2 natively - and it’s <em>excellent</em>.</p>
<p>RE7 brings the series back to its survival horror roots, albeit with a shift over to the first-person perspective. The result is an experience that, in my opinion, has aged like fine wine. Resident Evil has never felt quite so immersive, with stunning visuals powered by the Reach to the Moon (RE) Engine and gameplay that pays homage to the 1996 original whilst adding in a few new mechanics of its own.</p>
<p>So what we’ve got here is the quintessential survival horror experience. As you explore the dilapidated Baker Estate — RE7’s primary location — you’ll need to conserve your ammo, avoid direct confrontations where possible, and consistently manage your limited inventory. Dedicated save rooms offer up much-needed respite from the near-constant sense of dread and danger, and these feel more valuable than ever given just how ruthless and persistent the Baker Family can be.</p>
<p>Jack Baker, in particular, who I think I can safely call the primary antagonist of the game (even if he <em>technically</em> isn’t) shows up multiple times and stalks you in a manner not too dissimilar from Nemesis all the way back in <strong>RE3</strong>. Coming face to face with him is stressful enough on a standard playthrough, but if you crank up the difficulty to ‘Madhouse’, he can be downright terrifying. This mode also makes saves finite, linking the number of times you can record your progress to how many cassette tapes you’re carrying.</p>
<p>With the Gold Edition on Switch 2, you also get immediate access to all available DLC, including ‘Banned Footage Vol. 1 &amp; 2’, ‘Not A Hero’, and more. My favourite of these is a small vignette called ‘Daughters’ contained within the Banned Footage collection. It tells the story of how the Baker Family descended into madness, and it’s equal parts tragic and disturbing. That said, I think all the DLC is worth trying out, and collectively it expands on the experience really well.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, the visuals remain largely consistent with the game’s initial release on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/resident_evil_7_biohazard">PS4</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/resident_evil_7">Xbox One</a>. You’re not going to get any fancy ray-tracing here, but it’s nevertheless a gorgeous-looking game, whether you’re playing docked or handheld. Similarly, load times are kept pleasingly brisk and there were no noticeable drops in frame rate throughout, making this a wonderful way to experience one of the series’ best entries.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you refused to play Capcom’s ‘Cloud Version’ of RE7 on Switch 1, then your patience has finally been rewarded. In time, I suspect this entry will be looked upon with as much reverence as the original, and I urge you to add it to your library.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sometimes you get a note through the door, nestled among the bills and flyers for local takeaways. Oi, it says, some priest's been murdered, and we need you to track down the folks on a list of Nazis he smuggled out of Germany after the war. Ok, you reply, it's the 1970s and I've got nothing better to do.</p>
<p>That's the setup for Owlskip Games' The Ratline, the Steam Next Fest demo of which has just put my beleaguered Monday brain to the test.</p>

<p>While plenty of detective games ratchet up the murder to get you hunting for motives and bloodied knives - Obsidian Moon's one <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/detectives-detect-detectively-in-the-demo-of-moody-noir-sleuth-sim-obsidian-moon">I played relatively recently</a> - The Ratline's got its sights set firmly on having you unpick the identities of its resettled baddies. Each case sees the names of some ex-Nazis flung up on the investigation board. It's your job to make enquiries and look through the clues to correctly work out the  pseudonym they're currently going by, where they're located, and what they look like.</p><p>Are they doing dentistry in Canada? Are they running a cafe in London? Are they the bloke with the dodgy hairline in the wedding photo? All of these questions and more flood your mind as you play a game which feels to me like it'll appeal to the analytical minds of folks who loved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-of-the-obra-dinn">Return of the Obra Dinn</a>. I'm not just saying that because Lucas Pope's quoted in the Steam description either, though his inclusion there has helped me deduce that the makers of these sorts of puzzle games must all have some sort of secret society where they gather to play Cluedo.</p>
<p>Despite the fact it lets you fling open a window to let in the sound of the gentle rain which never ceases and has the sort of smooth jazzy background tunes which are mandatory in all detective games, The Ratline doesn't lean full on into the over-the-top drama of noir crime solving. Instead, it's more grounded in tone, which I think fits the subject material well.</p>
<p>From a practical perspective, the process of sorting through notes and photos has a relaxing satisfaction to it. Though, it'd be nice to be able to stick more than eight pieces of evidence to your investigation board at once in longer cases, so you don't have to worry that the few you've left in your inventory might turn out to be key details you miss spotting connections in because they're out of sight. On a more positive note, The Ratline has one of the smoother phone interfaces I've seen, with the option to pull up a nicely chunky keypad once you've looked up the number you need via a rolodex.</p>
<p>Overall, The Ratline's a good time in the 40 minute or so demo snippet I've played, and I'm keen to play more when the full thing arrives on March 17th. You can find said demo and wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3756940/The_Ratline/">Steam</a>, if you're so inclined. You can also read how the Nazi-uncovering detective flick's designer Tim Sheinman would go about getting away with the murder of Humpty Dumpty in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/detective-game-makers-tells-us-how-they-would-murder-humpty-dumpty">this feature Julian concocted</a> around Steam's Detective Fest last month. My money's on an ambush with a frying pan in the kitchen. Or maybe that's too obvious...</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> - best known for this work on the Nier and Drakengard series - will be writing a new Evangelion series. This series was announced as part of the 30th Evangelion anniversary celebration over the weekend.</p>
<p>This revelation was spotted on <a href="https://www.evangelion.jp/news/260223-1/">the official Evangelion website</a>, in which a small credits page for the upcoming series was posted. In addition to Taro, the show will be directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki and Toru Yatabe, while the music will be composed by longtime Bandai Namco composer Keiichi Okabe.</p>
<p>What this series will be about is currently a mystery, but it comes in the wake of Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time which among other things acted as a firm conclusion to protagonist Shinji Ikari's story. So whether he'll return, or we'll see a drastically different spin on Evangelion, is the big question.</p>
<p>As for Taro's inclusion, his own work is no stranger to Evangelion inspiration and influence. Only a year ago, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-taro-yoko-hyung-tae-kim?utm_source=twitter">he credited Neon Genesis Evangelion as one of the main inspirations for Nier Automata</a>, a game that exploded in popularity following its 2017 release. Nier Automata has also had some big news recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-future-developments-teased-as-it-passes-10m-worldwide-sales">with new developments in the series teased following a recent 10m sales milestone stream</a>.</p><p>So is it a good thing that we're getting more Evangelion? Well, if you like the series then obviously more entries in a series you love is great news. You could, however, argue that Shinji's finale in the latest movie where he steps away from the world of Evangelion was also quite a heavy-handed message to the audience too, urging them to move on from Eva. To have that message, then a new series, may conflict with what was a meaningful conclusion. Here's hoping they don't bring Shinji back, basically.</p>
<p>But let us know what you think? What would you like to see from a new Eva series? Do you even want one?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When you look at the state of the video game industry today, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/">long-running studios with veteran talent</a> and brand-new teams (even ones built with veteran devs) get laid off entirely <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-three-fields-entertainment-staff-at-risk-layoffs/">after their first project flops</a>, it's easy to say that each new game hitting the market has <strong>a lot </strong>riding on it. In that general economic sense, <strong>ZA/UM's</strong> upcoming espionage CRPG, <strong>Zero Parades: For Dead Spies,</strong> has a lot riding on it. But it also carries a heavier burden than other new titles.</p>



<p>Few games have to deal with trying to best a predecessor that is as well-regarded as <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disco-elysium-the-final-cut-a-tapestry-of-beautiful-mistakes/">Disco Elysium</a></strong>, and fewer still have to do it while carrying the weight of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZEAs6M1wts">well-documented</a> controversy that has yet to be fully resolved, if that'll ever happen. And Zero Parades isn't just trying to distract you from controversy; it's trying to be so good that you forget that the controversy in question drove out the original core writing team behind Disco. It has to be so good that it convinces you the studio's art collective foundation is still alive and well, and that it hasn't been squashed by executive greed. </p>



<p>It has to be so good that Disco faithfuls still feel like they're playing a game from ZA/UM, the team that brought them Disco Elysium, even if so many key members of that team are no longer there and didn't actually work on it.</p>



<p>If it isn't good enough to accomplish those things for the majority of people who give it a shot, particularly for Disco Elysium fans, then the cloud hanging over the studio will only grow larger and darker, making it even more difficult to step out of Disco's shadow.</p>



<p>Excited as I was based on what I saw in my hands-off preview of Zero Parades: For Dead Spies back in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/zero-upgrades-preview-za-um-crpg-disco-elysium/">September 2025</a></strong>, during which I got to hear from writer <strong>Jim Ashilevi </strong>and producer <strong>Jess Crawford</strong>, I walked away from that asking myself if it could be that good, and now that I've spent some significant time with it in its <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863680/ZERO_PARADES_For_Dead_Spies/">Steam Next Fest</a> </strong>demo, I feel like it has that chance.</p>

<p>One thing I want to get out of the way: I have not played Disco Elysium. I know, it's one of the most revered games of the last decade, and it's a pretty significant blind spot in my gaming history as someone who will tell you that they like narrative-driven games. But everyone has those kinds of blind spots, and I don't think coming to a series/franchise/style of game with a fresh perspective is any less valuable than coming to it with experience. There will be a lot of critics who are constantly comparing this to Disco Elysium, so I have no doubt you'll be able to find that perspective if you want it.</p>



<p>But that's not my angle, so now that we're all on the same page, I want to start out by saying there's a lot about Zero Parades that is very striking when you first load into the demo. Its opening moments feel like they are trying to put you immediately off balance as you enter the world of Zero Parades. It reminded me of how the opening of The Shining sets the tone by starting the audience in the air, in the middle of a lake, with the score immediately going to work to raise the tension and your anxiety, like there's some kind of impending doom. A fitting opening considering that one of the key takeaways I got from my preview of Zero Parades last September was the notion that players should <strong>"<em>embrace failure</em>."</strong></p>

<p>After you've chosen a couple of key traits that your version of the player character, Hershel Wilk, will start with, you're greeted by a quote from <strong>Jenny Holzer,</strong> "<em>The beginning of the war will be a secret</em>," followed by a deep, partially muffled voice that practically roars out the words, "<em>I once knew a spy</em>," while the screen looks like you're trying to play a VHS tape that still barely works. </p>



<p>From that opening conversation, you start your journey in a small apartment, and as you investigate your surroundings, you start to learn more about your player character and the game's setting. Hershel is a spy for Superbloc, one of the three superpowers in this world made up of a union of communist nations, and this is not her first time in Portofiro. She was here years ago, working with a group of contacts who grew to be her friends, friends she chose to <strong>abandon</strong> when things went south.</p>



<p>The Opera, the Superbloc's espionage firm, put her 'in the freezer,' which is another way of saying they chained her to a desk job for five years after making such a mess with her last job. Now, she's back, and you quickly learn (or don't, depending on the dialogue choices you make), that she's there because one of her former contacts reached out, asking for her specifically.</p>

<p>It's at this point that the story of Zero Parades: For Dead Spies begins, with Hershel standing in a cramped apartment space, with her 'double,' the Operant (the Opera's word for spy), she was supposed to meet barely alive in an armchair, unable to move or do much of anything. Known to you as Psuedopod, he was meant to give you your assignment brief, and you were supposed to move forward from there. Now, you have to figure out what he had been investigating before you got there, and try to find out who got to Psuedopod before whatever mission you're meant to be on could even get going.</p>



<p>I don't want to dig too much into narrative spoiler territory here - the demo is <strong>out today with the launch of Steam Next Fest</strong> if you want to play it yourself, and if I go through every story detail, not only will this be an incredibly long preview, but it'll take away from your experience of actually playing it. What I will say is that even without playing Disco, I can understand why the team at ZA/UM was praised for their storytelling.</p>



<p>Every element - the environmental design, the art, the writing - just made me want to keep digging, to know more. I've spent almost half a dozen hours in this demo, and even after playing through it more than once, I still want to spend more time with it, just to be in this world for a little longer.</p>

<p>The narrative was, perhaps unsurprisingly, the strongest element of Zero Parades so far, based on my time with it. It has me so interested that I'm almost starting to get over my least favourite aspect of the game, which, unfortunately, has to do with Hershel, specifically her voice. I'm not ripping into the voice actor's performance here, I'm ripping into the director's choices. I don't know why ZA/UM chose to have Hershel sound like she has <strong>permanent vocal fry</strong>, but it was incredibly grating on my ears when I first heard it.</p>



<p>She doesn't carry it for every line - if one of the traits you upgrade is 'Records,' which increases Hershel's ability to recall historical facts, plenty of those lines will sound perfectly fine. But so much of her inner dialogue of thoughts is read with a tone that sounds like it's trying too hard to be dark and gritty. It was genuinely a pain to listen to at first, and I was thankful that by my second playthrough of the demo, I could skip through lines I had heard before just to hear less of it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, none of the other voices you'll hear in the demo are nearly as bad. They're not bad at all, frankly, and it makes it even more curious as to why the actors behind those voices were directed so well, while Hershel's actor was seemingly told to sound like she is almost incapable of speaking with her full voice. And when I say I'm 'starting to get over' how bad she is to listen to, it's because I'm growing to tolerate it for the sake of experiencing everything else.</p>

<p>What I'm not tolerating are its more interactive bits, i.e. the dice rolls and one of Zero Parades' new mechanics, <strong>Dramatic Encounters</strong>. When I first heard about them in the presentation I attended for my September preview, I was extremely skeptical. They didn't exactly sound enticing, and frankly, they seemed like they might be an attempt at adding a deeper gameplay layer for people who may need some convincing to play such a dialogue-heavy game in the first place. What I found was that they are a really clever solution to adding tense espionage-driven gameplay.</p>



<p>Some of my favourite moments in the dense spy stories I love (the kind that Ashilevi and Crawford told me inspired Zero Parades) are those moments where the scene might not devolve into an action-heavy moment, but the pressure in the room gets to its absolute peak just before it's about to blow. So far, that's what playing these Dramatic Encounters felt like, and I'm very happy to have been wrong about them.</p>



<p>I also appreciate the de-skilling mechanic that occurs whenever you max out on one of three core feelings: Fatigue, Anxiety, and Delirium. Any of these getting raised beyond a halfway point indicated in the bottom left gives you that permanent status condition, and maxing out forces you to lose a skill point. It wasn't always obvious which dialogue choices would lead to my anxiety or something else going up, so I can see how you might get annoyed by that. I read it more as another layer of long-term game strategy, as I'll likely have to go back and forth, and probably discover which skills I need/want to keep raised along the way and which I don't mind losing a point in.</p>

<p>Coming back to the espionage, it also feels like a way of translating the human realities or perceived realities of espionage work. So many spy stories want you to believe that their heroes could always handle the pressure, no matter how tense things got. Maybe that was true for Hershel once, but it's not true after what sounds like the greatest failure of her career. She's more vulnerable now and can't handle being out in the field and investigating like she could before. It feels more honest that she would struggle, regroup, and build her strength back, just as the player does whenever they put a skill point back somewhere it was lost.</p>

<p>I made it clear that I won't be able to tell you if this is feeling better or worse than Disco Elysium. What I can tell you, as someone with no capacity for comparison and thought on what the 'old' ZA/UM might've done with this game, is that this is a game I absolutely did not know I needed that is now one of my most anticipated titles this year.</p>



<p>It's right up my alley with its espionage angle, and while I'm honestly still a little bit concerned that I'll never hear a better side to Hershel as long as the game goes on, this game has more than enough going for it for me to eventually get over it. If the story, art, characters, Dramatic Encounters, investigative gameplay, and Conditioning can come together to and bottle the feeling of these cloak-and-dagger activities mixed with high stakes political and ideological drama and themes like they've done in this demo across a whole game, this is absolutely a Game of the Year contender for 2026, assuming it's out this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the time of this writing, we are days away from the global release of <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, the ninth mainline entry in <strong>Capcom's</strong> long-running, beloved horror series. It's an exciting time for fans of the series and horror fans, but it's also a tense time to be online, because there are plenty of <strong>spoilers online</strong> to be found. While Capcom has already <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2024835538251923590">issued a plea to fans</a> asking them not to share these spoilers, industry icon and director of <strong>Resident Evil 2</strong>, <strong>Hideki Kamiya</strong>, has a different take on these spoilers getting out there.</p>



<p>In its statement, Capcom says, "<em>Please don't post or share pre-release leaks and spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem,</em>" adding that its legal team will continue to take down every pre-release post it can in order to preserve people's day one experience with the game. It concludes with the obvious point that "<em>It's not long now until the game is out, so we look forward to seeing all your reactions after release!</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Kamiya was not nearly as kind with his reaction to the leaks. He responded to Capcom's statement on his own <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/2025040184614728119">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, and told those sharing leaks and spoilers ahead of release (via machine translation) that they "<em><strong>deserve to die a thousand deaths</strong></em>," and cursed them to "<em><strong>never play games again</strong></em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I remember back with Bio2 [Resident Evil 2] the late-game plot twist got totally scooped by some photo weekly mag, right</em>," Kamiya begins. "<em>For your own selfish satisfaction, you're <strong>trampling</strong> all over the feelings of users who were looking forward to it, and the feelings of the creators who poured their all into making it—a detestable act that <strong>destroys everyone's happiness and deserves a thousand deaths</strong>. May you be <strong>cursed to never play games again</strong>.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">確かバイオ2の時も終盤の展開を写真週刊誌にスッパ抜かれたよなー…<br>テメエ個人の利己的な満足のために、楽しみにしてるユーザーの気持ちも、力を尽くして制作したクリエイターの気持ちも踏み躙る、全ての人の幸せを破壊する唾棄すべき行為で、万死に値するだろ…二度とゲームを遊べない呪いにかかれ… <a href="https://t.co/iKueo8axFC">https://t.co/iKueo8axFC</a></p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/2025040184614728119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>With big games like this, it's more often a miracle if they don't get leaked early, but once physical copies are sent to retail stores, these kinds of leak cycles almost always happen. As much as Kamiya despises the practice, there will always be those who can't wait a few extra days.</p>



<p>Requiem is expected to be one of Capcom's <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-shares-soar-great-sales-forecast-resident-evil-requiem/">biggest games for the year</a>, and could even be one of the biggest games in the Resident Evil series if it is able to surpass its most recent predecessor in the eyes of players. There's a lot <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-resident-evil-showcase-capcom/">we've been hearing about the game</a> that makes it sound more interesting and exciting than other titles in the series, and long-time fans are very keen to learn about the next chapter in <a href="https://wccftech.com/leon-hot-uncle-resident-evil-requiem-capcom-female-staff/">Leon Kennedy's story</a>, as he's arguably the most iconic character from the franchise.</p>



<p>If you're excited for Requiem but won't be searching these spoilers out, you can check out the short film that Capcom released to set the tone for the game, titled<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/evil-has-always-had-a-name-capcoms-new-short-film-sets-the-mood-for-resident-evil-requiem/"> 'Evil Has Always Had a Name.'</a></strong> A title that, in light of Kamiya's statement, makes you think the name Hideki Kamiya would give to 'evil' might be 'leakers.' </p>

            <p>Thanks to various life difficulties, I’ve spent this month in a state of immense spiritual turbulence, oscillating between euphoria and despair. As such, I’m in either the worst or the perfect frame of mind to digest news that Yoko Taro, director and scenario writer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-automata">NieR: Automata</a>, is writing a new series of Neon Genesis Evangelion.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2026/2/23/new-neon-genesis-evangelion-anime-series-in-production?srsltid=AfmBOoodHSUS0nCbgYxViT3XtpATfsQriqxo3f5u9bNbJDDCWghPWeyn">Crunchyroll</a>, the show in question has just been announced at Evangelion’s 30th anniversary festivities. It’s a collaboration between Studio Khara and CloverWorks. Kazuya Tsurumaki, director of the Rebuild films and Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX, is leading the project alongside Toko Yatabe, assistant director on Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time. Taro isn’t the only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> alumnus involved - NieR composer Keiichi Okabe is providing the music. </p>
<p>Truly, the Nier Automata guy doing an Evangelion show is a match made in… some kind of metaphysical realm. Do I really have to draw my breath in pain to explain why? I’ve just referenced Hamlet in that last sentence, which should give you a hint as to the psychic pressures involved. If you know, you know. If you don’t, please google it and skim past the <del>Absolute Terror</del> AI summary to read one of the thousands of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nier-automatas-secret-church-mystery-chaos-community-and-an-amazing-mod">wondering</a>, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2002-06-11">tortured</a> things written about either Nier or Evangelion.</p>
<p>Apart from anything else, I haven’t caught up on all the Evangelion released after the original 90s TV show. I’ve only gotten as far as the nightmare fuel that is Asuka vs the Mass Production Evas in The End of Evangelion. People who’ve watched the latest stuff: is it… more cheerful these days?</p>
<p>If you’ve come to this videogame website to read about videogames, not anime shows, rest assured that Taro is still pitching ‘em – they just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nier-creator-yoko-taro-would-like-you-to-know-he-has-been-working-on-games-they-just-keep-getting-cancelled">keep getting cancelled</a>.</p>

              <p><span>It’s officially Pokémon week. On Friday, the monster-taming series will celebrate its 30th anniversary </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968"><span>with a livestream discussing new projects</span></a><span> and likely revealing the next games. As part of the marketing campaign, The Pokémon Company has been leaning into the idea that every Pokémon is someone’s favorite, and as such, it’s releasing commemorative 30th anniversary logos for every single one of these little guys.</span></p> <p><span>Fan site and database </span><a href="https://serebii.net/pokemon30/#artwork"><i><span>Serebii</span></i></a> <span>has archived every piece, which includes at least one for every Pokémon, though several have multiple depicting things like alternate forms and regional variants. I’m a little bummed they didn’t do any for Mega Evolutions, but I can’t complain too much when every monster is represented here. There’s over 1000 images here, so if you want to find your favorites, it’s probably easiest to do a ctrl+f or command+f and search their names. I found my team on my phone this morning and that was a pain in the ass. But look at my boy:</span></p>

Price rises for memory and storage will touch many parts of the games industry, including hardware, software, and development costs.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hardware margins will be squeezed">Hardware margins will be squeezed</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia's Memory and Storage research teams estimate that PC DRAM and SSD prices for mainstream configurations saw, on average, increases of nearly 100% and 40%, respectively, in 2025.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This trend is flowing into contract pricing and has only continued in the first quarter of 2026, where DRAM prices are expected to rise by a further 60% and NAND memory 70%.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Memory and storage are key components in dedicated games hardware such as games consoles. In 2Q25, Omdia estimated that the combined memory in a base PS5 accounted for at least 20% of the overall bill of materials of the console.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-tencent-shutters-timi-montreal" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Tencent quietly shutters Timi Montreal</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once manufacturers run through their inventories, new devices will be built with memory supplies that will have been negotiated at a higher contract price. In the console market, this will apply across the board:&nbsp;GDDR6 for PS5, additional DDR5 for PS5 Pro, and LPDDR5 for Switch 2.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The margins on console hardware remain thin – Sony Interactive Entertainment reported in February 2026 that steep discounting on PlayStation 5 hardware during the holiday season in 4Q25 led to "increases in losses from hardware."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Console manufacturers are best placed to offset hardware inflation">Console manufacturers are best placed to offset hardware inflation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, console manufacturers also sell software, services, and peripherals, giving them many levers they can pull to mitigate squeezed hardware margins. Figure 1 highlights how content and services are the bulk of consumer spend on games console platforms.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, one likely event in 2026 is Nintendo adjusting the pricing of Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions upward. Omdia estimates average ASP growth between the end of 2021 and 2025 for all Nintendo Switch Online tiers was just 8%, compared with 40% for PlayStation Plus and 72% for Xbox Game Pass.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Broadly speaking, we will see a reattribution of pricing of upcoming first-party content, subscription services, and peripherals. The launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GTA 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> during holiday 2026 could also help sustain demand in the event that 2025's discounting on PlayStation 5 hardware cannot be repeated.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There also already exists a sizable combined active installed base of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, which have just entered their seventh calendar year on the market. It is the publishing opportunity on Nintendo platforms that will be the most exposed as the vast majority of major new and upcoming first-and third-party software has transitioned to Switch 2, a platform in its infancy.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embark-studios-ceo-patrick-soderlund-named-executive-chairman-of-nexon" target="_self" data-discover="true">Embark Studios CEO Patrick Soderlund named executive chairman of Nexon</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Entry-level hardware in the console market will be a casualty. Historically, the last-generation system could provide an affordable entry point into a games catalog for a platform holder.

PC gamers may delay a full upgrade and PC desktop builders may delay component upgrades. Handheld gaming PCs, an emerging product category, may continue to only address an enthusiast audience. For gaming laptops, PC vendors are expected to focus on driving sales of high-end models to maximize revenue as supply is constrained.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fortunately, this is likely to pose little challenge for most developers given pre-existing work optimizing games for power-constrained devices such as Switch 2, Steam Deck, and Xbox Series S.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is also a growing installed base of gaming-capable laptops that remain unaddressed by many games publishers. The capabilities of built-in processor graphics have improved significantly in recent years, providing performance that exceeds Steam Deck and, at the high end, exceeds Xbox Series S. Data from Omdia's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PC Horizon Service</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reveals over 90 million gaming-capable laptops were sold in 2025. Publishers should consider addressing the subset of laptop owners that also plays games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sales volumes and value of PC games content is not expected to be disrupted – there already exists a huge and healthy audience of installed devices well-positioned to buy PC games content. Omdia estimates that in 2025, Steam alone had 321 million yearly active users.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The attach rates of Switch 2 software may be affected">The attach rates of Switch 2 software may be affected</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the 1980s, chip shortages placed upward pressure on the manufacturing cost of Famicom cartridges and facilitated the creation of the Famicom Disc System, which used a cheaper proprietary floppy-disc format.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This situation is repeating itself with Switch 2 physical media, as the standard game cards are becoming prohibitively expensive to accommodate publishers' pricing strategies. Like its predecessor, Switch 2 remains a physical-first platform. When including bundled software, Omdia estimates 57% of Switch 2 games sold in 2025 were at retail.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The expectation in 2026 is that publishers shipping software in high volumes will continue to opt for the dataless Game-Key Card to protect margins and hit lower price points at retail—both at, and following, the launch of a title. The exception is niche titles that reach a highly engaged audience of collectors – this audience is less sensitive to price, so publishers should explore the possibility of charging a higher price to publish a game fully on the game card.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game-Key Cards do present one issue for the publishing opportunity on Switch 2.

            <title><![CDATA[The PS5 Is Still Outselling The Switch 2]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-switch-2-sales-price-jan-2026-2000672749</link>
            <guid>1443628</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Let’s get this out of the way up front: the PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 are both selling really well right now. But one of those consoles is five years old and the other has only been out for nine months after years of waiting. So why is <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-sales-switch-2-earnings-ghost-yotei-memory-shortage-2000665998">Sony’s machine continuing</a> to outsell Nintendo’s latest portable device in the U.S.?</p> <p>Circana Senior Director <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcbfovqnc2r">Mat Piscatella reports</a> that PS5 still led January 2026 in hardware sales in the U.S. despite people buying fewer PS5s than they did a year ago. Switch 2 was in second place, followed by Xbox Series X/S and PC gaming handhelds. Overall, hardware spending jumped 16 percent compared to January 2025, even as last-gen hardware declined. PS5 was down 17 percent year-over-year and Xbox Series X/S was down 27 percent. Unsurprisingly, the original Switch fell off a cliff with a 79 percent drop.</p>

 <p>Is this indicative of the ongoing strength of the PS5 platform, or does it mean unusual softness in Switch 2 launch year sales? Recent earnings reports showed that Nintendo lost the holiday period worldwide to Sony as well. Despite Switch 2 surpassing Switch 1 sales on a time-aligned basis, it was beaten by five-year-old hardware. Maybe some of that was the big Black Friday price cuts that made a PS5 cheaper than a Switch 2. Maybe it was people gearing up for the launch of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> this year.</p> <p>And maybe part of it had to do with the Switch 2 missing a big exclusive to get people off the fence. Neither a 3D <em>Mario</em> nor a new<em> Zelda</em> have been announced yet and 2025’s big seller, Pokémon<em> Legends: Z-A</em>, was available on the existing Switch. Things might only get tougher if and when Nintendo is <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">forced to increase the price</a> of the Switch 2 due to the ongoing RAM shortage, something new reporting and many analysts suggest is a forgone conclusion for 2026.</p>

 <p>Then again, President Trump’s tariffs <a href="https://kotaku.com/supreme-court-strikes-down-trump-tariffs-that-hiked-prices-on-switch-xbox-and-ps5-2000671987">were just struck down as unconstitutional</a>. I’m not sure how the government is planning on refunding consumers or companies for those import taxes, but maybe it will give Nintendo the wiggle room it needs to hold the Switch 2’s current $450 price for a bit longer.</p>

The </span><i><span>Rebuild</span></i><span> films confirm the existence of multiple timelines, so this could be a retelling of the original </span><i><span>Evangelion</span></i><span> story but in one of these alternate universes. It may also take place after one of the series’ multiple endings across the original show, the </span><i><span>End of Evangelion</span></i><span> film, and the </span><i><span>Rebuilds</span></i><span>. I’m skeptical, but Taro’s involvement is enough to at least make me curious.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">発表されました。がんばります……！ <a href="https://t.co/exqNLJV9Pt">https://t.co/exqNLJV9Pt</a></p> <p>— yokotaro (@yokotaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/2025882968355651791?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Taro will be writing the script, but the new series will be directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki and Toru Yatabe, who have both worked on the series before.

 <p><span>The announcement was the culmination of the Evangelion:30+; 30th Anniversary of </span><i><span>Evangelion </span></i><span>festival in Japan, which also included a 13-minute short starring Asuka, which has reignited the spark of a decades-long shipping war by showing a vision of her married to main character Shinji and having a kid.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-pokemon-coming-to-fortnite/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a big week for Pokémon fans with the 30th anniversary celebrations taking place this week, and fresh rumors have emerged concerning a huge collab with Fortnite.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> is the undisputed behemoth in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battle-royale/" id="127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale</a> scene, while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> is the strongest franchise among the creature-collecting games. For many, that may seem like a natural fit for a collab.</p>



<p>If you want to know what the source of the Fortnite x Pokémon rumors is, and whether a crossover is on the cards, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-pokemon-coming-to-fortnite">Is Pokémon Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not likely. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no official news regarding a collab between Fortnite and Pokémon. While it’s not been ruled out either, it seems unlikely to occur.</strong></p>



<p>While Epic Games are the masters of collabs, bringing the likes of South Park, Star Wars, and major anime titles into the game, working with Nintendo provides different challenges. So far, Epic Games and Nintendo haven’t managed to come to an agreement.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-things-we-want-to-see-announced-on-pokemon-day-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Things We Want to See Announced on Pokémon Day</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Fortnite previously wanted to bring Samus from the Metroid franchise into the game, but Nintendo wanted significant restrictions. It’s been widely reported they only wanted Samus to be playable on Nintendo consoles, even if you already owned the skin.</p>



<p>Additionally, Pokémon is a family-friendly franchise, and while it’s no denying the likes of Pikachu and Eevee would make amazing Sidekicks, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are unlikely to want their valuable IP running around in a world filled with guns.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-did-the-fortnite-x-pokemon-rumours-start">Where Did The Fortnite x Pokémon Rumours Start?</h2>



<p><strong>The desire from fans to bring Pokémon</strong> <strong>into the world of football is not new, but the rumors have been ramped up following a recent viral social media post.</strong></p>



<p>On Instagram, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DVE04N_gT9X/?img_index=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forthnite</a>, a page with over 2.7m followers, shared a fan-made trailer made by feraalsy that showcased what a collab between the two major franchises could look like.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green Nintendo Switch Release Date</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The trailer was done expertly, showcasing the likes of Ash Ketchum, Pikachu, and Charizard in their full might, and went viral on social media. At the time of writing, the post has over 15.5k likes.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, as we’ve mentioned, the collab is likely to be a pipe dream, and if Nintendo were to partner with Fortnite, there are other franchises, including Zelda and Super Mario, more likely to feature first.</p>

"I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That latter sentence is particularly exciting, as it teases that publisher Take-Two is keen to see the film debut around the same time as a new BioShock game (or two). Exactly what is meant by "incarnations" remains to be seen, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When pressed for timescales, Lee cautiously said: "It's steadily on the path, but you know how it goes. It's... so many things could get in the way, but I know that the intent is to hopefully get in production next year."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">BioShock: The Collection Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Netflix announced plans for a BioShock adaptation back in 2022, though the project has stalled due to budget cuts impacting the scope of the movie and its script. Prior to that, Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski was working on his own adaptation, though that ultimately came to nothing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-movie-is-definitely-based-on-the-first-game-as-script-work-continues-following-netflix-budget-cut"><u>producer Roy Lee confirmed the project is still in active development</u></a>, with director Francis Lawrence on board to direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a tricky adaptation, so there's lots of things to figure out and to get right," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-director-says-were-in-a-pretty-good-place-with-netflixs-tricky-movie-adaption"><u>Lawrence told IGN at the time</u></a>. "There's regime changes at Netflix, and so things stall out and get re-energized and stall out and get re-energized, and I think we're in a pretty good place, honestly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock-next"><u>BioShock 4</u></a>? After <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-studio-cloud-chamber-undergoes-layoffs-appoints-rod-fergusson-new-bioshock-head"><u>layoffs and a further delay to the project's release</u></a>, former Gears of War head and Diablo franchise lead Rod Fergusson will now oversee Cloud Chamber and the project itself, which has been in development for the last decade. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
