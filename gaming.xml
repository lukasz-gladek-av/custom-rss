<p>Following Sega bringing the first two Yakuza Kiwami titles to Nintendo platforms, it's now announced the third title, <strong>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</strong> for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>During the RGG Summit 2025 livestream, it was announced it's arriving on <strong>12th February 2026</strong> and pre-orders are now available. As mentioned, this title originally made its debut on the PS3 in 2009. Here's some more PR about it:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Skate Early Access Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-early-access-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skate-early-access-review.1306176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA’s <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/faq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Skate FAQ</u></a> is very clear about what 2025’s new early access iteration represents for the series as a whole. “This isn’t a sequel, remake, or a remaster,” states the brief explanation. “It’s the evolution of the Skate franchise.” The first part I wholeheartedly agree with. This is not Skate 4, and it certainly isn’t a remake of the originals by any stretch of the imagination. The second part is not entirely untrue either: It <em>is </em>an evolution, of sorts. That is, it’s certainly changed. A lot. Unfortunately, this means this new version of Skate bears little semblance to the late-2000s originals I love – and I’m currently finding it impossible to warm to its sanitised, homogenised, and monetised reinvention. Yes, Skate has evolved dramatically, but it’s done so to blend into its free-to-play, service game-dominated surroundings – like moths in the sooty cities of the British Industrial Revolution. I don’t think I’ve ever compared a game to an insect before, but perhaps it makes sense when I find it this repellant. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before I get too deep into why it’s offputting, there are a couple of true strengths that I can identify in Skate’s early access launch – the first of which are the sound effects. When it comes to capturing the nuanced array of skateboarding sounds – the hiss of spinning wheels, the friction of plywood on varied surfaces, and the clink of metal on metal – the team has done a terrific job. Ignoring the music and dialogue (which I’ll discuss later), Skate absolutely nails its sounds. This stuff is the symphony of skateboarding and, when you’re in a real flow, there’s an almost meditative rhythm to it. The pops and pings, the scrapes and squeaks – these sounds are just soothing, and I don’t know how else to explain it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It must also be established that the feel of Skate, when you’re on a board at least, is still supreme. I adore the wild, arcade wackiness of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater – and I respect the punishing, twin-stick precision required by the likes of skate sims like Session – but Skate’s controls are my jam. Just about everything I crave is wrapped up in its approachable yet deceptively deep system. Tricks on the right stick, turning on the left, grabs on the triggers, and grinds on… how good you are at lining them up. There’s a lot of depth to unlock once you get the hang of it. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The feel of Skate, when you’re on a board at least, is still supreme.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, the new Skate doesn’t <em>quite </em>look and feel identical to the older games. Turning appears a little stiffer, and probably lacks a bit of the more pronounced and organic lean from the early Skate games. The grind assist is also considerably too sticky by default, and there’s definitely jankiness present in the transition skating; I’m experimenting with the pump settings but haven’t quite cracked a consistent solution to always getting the momentum I want and not getting randomly bogged down. Skitching is absent, and there are other missing tricks. Overall, however, it’s entirely familiar enough to be instantly intuitive to me as a returning player. At a minimum, Skate has done a fine job of reconstructing that buttery, legacy street skating feel from the original games. That’s an important thing to bring back if you’re going to use the classic name.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, that’s all it brought back.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Streaming the Cube</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Making Skate an exclusively online experience was an immediate and utter mistake. During my first session on the day of its early access launch I was unceremoniously disconnected during a random challenge and kicked out of the map, back to the main menu. The error message here was comically emblematic of my thoughts on the overall situation. Something went wrong? Yes, something certainly went wrong with Skate. But it went wrong long before I started playing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I am, of course, aware that server problems and queues are typical of day one of a new online game (although I’m still waiting in queues the week after launch). The community has come to accept this compromise as the opposite side of the free-to-play coin. For me, this is uncharted territory. The last time I waited in an online queue I was buying concert tickets, but at least I got seats to Metallica out of it. Skate is giving me no such joy. It does not benefit from being an online-only live service. It has new priorities, like selling $25 clothing ensembles. To pass the downtime I played a bit of the existing Skate trilogy (all of which are parked on my Xbox courtesy of backwards compatibility and will work just fine offline today, tomorrow, and in 10 years time).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a deeply unfortunate twist, playing the new Skate is regularly just as annoying as <em>not </em>being able to play it. From the get-go it’s evident every shred of the personality of the originals has been ruthlessly and shamelessly cut away in favour of infantilised garbage. Every part of Skate has been corporatised and Disney-fied, from art style to attitude.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every part of Skate has been corporatised and Disney-fied, from art style to attitude.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember the authentic human characters that accompanied your skater as you progressed through the story modes of the old games, who would blurt in sympathy as you tumbled down the dam for the tenth time, breaking every bone in your body? Well, forget anything like that. Your “filmer” in the new Skate is… an AI app, called Vee, who just may be the single worst video game character I’ve ever encountered. Vee’s dialogue is beyond nauseating, and is delivered in a faux-robotic fashion that makes it doubly awful. It’s essentially a simulation of AI slop – like having a friend that only speaks to you like they’re reading the captions on a Tik-Tok video. The low-fi and realistic filmer approach of the old Skate games is greatly missed. In 2025, this could have been emulated easily by just giving us an in-game friend with a phone. Instead, we have an ill-conceived chatbot who regards my successful tricks as, “Algorithmic!”, refuses to stop “edu-skating” me on the fact “footy” means “video footage,” and mines 35-year-old LL Cool J songs for quips even my mum would wince at. “Your female parent said knock those objectives out?” Good grief.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Holy Cow Oh My God</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly the “human” cast is no better. They’re saddled with an inauthentic, overwritten script stuffed with cringeworthy sentences no person would ever say aloud, and lines I’m not even sure the voice actors quite understood before reading. Skate’s fascination with the term “skater eyes” (which is inexplicably capitalised in the captions like some kind of proper noun) is simply baffling. It’s referenced with such heavy regularity that it sounds like the name of an in-game function you can personally toggle on and off to highlight particular parts of the environment like Batman’s Detective Vision (like certain things that <em>are </em>automatically covered in a yellow mask during some challenges) but it isn’t. It’s just a hackneyed slang phrase Skate has invented and overuses far beyond the point of parody. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who <em>says </em>the word “BEEP” instead of cursing, even mildly? Everything that's even a fraction edgy or mature has been masked under layers of corporate coddling, like those soft, squishy curves that stop toddlers from splitting their heads on the corner of the kitchen bench. You can, I guess, mute the dialogue – but that doesn’t make it immune from criticism. Besides, the dialogue is also just one part of a cavalcade of complaints I have about the current state of Skate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why was it so important, for instance, to concoct an in-universe explanation for the fact that nobody in Skate’s new city of San Vansterdam can suffer any injuries? Making skaters invincible thanks to the medical miracle of “ImpervaTEK” doesn’t make Skate <em>better</em>; it just feels like it’s here because some suit was worried about the optics of children playing a game where people tossing themselves off buildings might have to be depicted as being seriously hurt. As a result, Skate’s traditional post-wipeout x-rays and bone-snapping sound effects are totally gone (as are bloody scrapes, grime, and wear on skaters and their boards). </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/vlcsnap-2025-09-23-15h14m21s304-1758605064301.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2009's Skate 2 is proof if you want to make a skate omelette you need to break a few legs.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My sons began playing the original Skate games from about the moment each was old enough to hold a controller. I vividly remember them cackling uncontrollably at how many bones they could break as their characters tumbled and fell, their skeletons squelching and shattering. Skate 2025 seems totally toothless in comparison. It treats its audience like babies.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>10 Things I Skate About You</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Skate’s art style doesn’t do it any favours, either. The stylised approach may be crisp and colourful, but it’s also vanilla and boring. The doe-eyed, Sims-style character models do absolutely nothing for me, and this cartoony u-turn is a truly unwelcome departure from the realistic approach the series previously took. I don’t like their plastic beards, or their chunky pants, and I certainly don’t like being surrounded by them at all times – particularly when other players have a habit of visibly stuttering, lagging, and even floating as they move by. It’s also a complete eyesore having everyone constantly clipping into each other, all plonked in front of the same shop counter – or teleporting and gathering atop the same ramp. I don’t know where I start and everyone else begins. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a real sterility to the city that the simplified visual style can’t shake. Plain walls, impossibly clean surfaces – San Vansterdam just isn’t a place that feels legitimate or lived-in. It feels fake because it looks fake. There’s not enough granular detail or texture. Hell, sometimes there’s no texture at all, like when the roads appear to glitch and turn into a featureless, uniformly black surface. That happens a lot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">San Vansterdam isn’t all that interesting to skate around, either. The map is a largely flat downtown area, broken up into four quadrants that aren’t particularly distinct from each other. You can skate across it in about two minutes. There’s no zany hill descent, or dam drop, or wild spillway – nothing I’m drawn to gravitate towards like I am in Skate 2’s San Vanelona. There was a sense of reward in finding a neat place to skate in the original games, because the maps primarily felt like cities – not skateparks. The DNA of San Vansterdam is that everything is skatepark-adjacent. Top of a building? Skatepark. Inside a church? Skatepark. At this point, designing the city to be an unrestrained skate utopia just feels like too much – like it’s a big, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater level instead of a city you can skate in. It’s weird when the original Skate games were entirely antithetical to that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of pro skaters, don’t expect to see any of those old faces in the new Skate. This obviously means no cleverly edited live-action intro montage packed with recognisable skaters in silly situations. Starting with a memorable short film may have become a tradition for the original trilogy, but that idea appears to have been firmly kickflipped to curb. More disappointingly, however, it also means no pro challenges – no real-life skaters to meet and speak to as you progress through what constitutes the campaign at the moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could pros come to the game later in this fashion? As a live service… maybe, I guess. But I’m very pessimistic they’d add the same level of personality they injected into the original Skate games. Those had brief cutscenes with back and forth between the pros and your sarcastic filmer. Is John Rattray going to have a conversation with a disembodied app on a floating video camera? I doubt it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it stands right now, the campaign feels weak: part lengthy tutorial, part service game treadmill, where miscellaneous skating tasks are rationed out every 24 hours. Some of these are satisfying enough, and they do reward a certain degree of mastery of Skate’s classic controls. There <em>are </em>stints of Skate where I’m absorbed to some degree, sure, but there’s surprisingly little to it right now – particularly considering how immediately the daily challenges have begun to repeat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of solo content, there are no competitions, no death races, no games of S.K.A.T.E. No magazine cover shoots, or sponsorship challenges. The campaign missions, or “tours”, here are really just a series of lessons. It’s clumsily paced, too, since the only way to unlock new tours is to complete an extensive amount of goals from the miscellaneous trick challenges that are refreshed on a daily basis. That is, many hours after completing a daily objective that required me to do multiple manuals, I found myself sleepwalking through a separate tutorial mission about <em>how </em>to manual. And this after Skate confirmed with me I’d played Skate 3 before I even set foot on a board. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skate sure does love its collection missions, though. In these you must skate a certain line while hitting a predetermined amount of floating wheel bearings, or perhaps skate through some basketball-sized bird poo. Either way, it’s mobile game-inspired fluff. I’m not a bored toddler in a restaurant being handed an iPad while his parents peruse the dessert menu, so this is just not my scene. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The whole progression loop is simply geared around collecting enough in-game currency to open loot boxes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That only became more evident when I realised the whole progression loop is simply geared around collecting enough in-game currency to open loot boxes. Want to rank up? You need to return to the store to trigger that. Hey, while you’re at the store, why not open some boxes of crap with all your in-game credits? I didn’t bother opening any for the first few days because I wasn’t interested, but I eventually realised the boxes also contain additional reputation points that are important for leveling up your neighbourhood rank and unlocking new fast travel spots – so you basically have to open them. This means sitting through the unskippable “Congratulations!” animation for each individual one – that I assume has been meticulously modelled for maximum poker machine potency – every single time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which boxes? These ones, just past all the premium items you need to hand over real money for instead. Wait, why are there bundles of items priced at 1600 Skate-bucks when Skate-bucks are available in increments of 500 and 1050? Oops. Guess you’ll have to buy more than you need. It’s insidious and I hate it. I hate it in other games and I hate it in this one. I am not young and immune to the caveats of free-to-play gaming. It makes it feel like a service and a store first, and a game second. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hell, maybe that’s true. After all, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s what my female parent used to say.</p><div id="rank-these-skateboarding-video-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these skateboarding video games</h3><h3>Rank these skateboarding video games</h3></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-early-access-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>LilliLandia Games, which is a Tencent Studio, has announced a new fantasy simulation game called Animula Nook. It is being billed as a lilliput game and for those who are not sure what that means, lilliput comes from Jonathan Swift’s Guilliver’s Travels. Lilliput is the island where the six inch tall Lilliputlians live, and that should give you a clue of what to expect in Animula Nook.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvaGN-R2ntc">YouTube</a></p>


<p>In Animula Nook, what is normal sized to us tower above the characters that live in this world. House plants are towering trees and forgotten little things like buttons can be major resources. This is essentially The Borrowers the videogame. The key features have been detailed by LilliLandia Games, and you can read the list below.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Discover a tiny yet immense world:&nbsp;Venture into vibrant landscapes hidden in plain sight. Explore lush, resource-packed houseplant forests, delve into the mysterious depths of a forgotten well, and navigate other awe-inspiring (and sometimes perilous) corners of your home. Every expedition is an adventure, whether you are unearthing rare materials or meeting a new friend.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Collect beyond the ordinary:&nbsp;In this tiny world, sunlight, raindrops, gentle breezes—even forgotten scents—become precious materials waiting to be discovered. Coins, buttons, and other small wonders are scattered throughout the land—each one not just a resource, but a lost treasure waiting for a new purpose.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Build with everyday objects:&nbsp;Milk cartons become charming houses, teacups turn into bustling cafés, and spice jars transform into tiny, glowing shops. Use the objects around you to build, decorate, and customize a miniature haven with unique furniture and personal touches. Start on your desk, then expand your creations across windowsills, cabinets, or even inside a vibrant, living vivarium.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Befriend the world’s tiny folk:&nbsp;This miniature world is full of life. Meet a delightful cast of residents, from tiny humanoids to whimsical beings you’ve never seen before. Exchange gifts, create memories, and watch as your bonds deepen over time. As you grow closer, their stories will unfold in more personal and surprising ways. With enough care, you might even convince them to move in- just be sure to build them a space they’ll love.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Define yourself in every detail:&nbsp;Customize your character, express yourself creatively, and make the world truly yours. With an endless assortment of outfits, accessories, furniture, and tools, everything you create is a reflection of you.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Convenient creative tools:&nbsp;Bring your ideas to life with intuitive tools that make creativity effortless. Sketch blueprints for builds, dismantle objects into modular components, and see your imagination come to life with ease.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Animula Nook has been confirmed for PC, PS5, Switch 2, and Mac.</p>

            <p>
Despite many others disagreeing with this stance, I am of the opinion that it's completely fine that we'll likely never get a "classic" 3D Zelda game again. By that I mean, the whole <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a>/ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> format is definitely the direction Nintendo will continue to go in, they've just been too popular. However, I understand the desire for such an experience all the same, and I think Demi and the Fractured Dream might be able to scratch that itch.
</p>
<p>
Announced during today's Annapurna Direct, Demi has you playing as, uh, Demi! A "voidsent" born into a world with a cursed fate he's trying to avoid. It's the debut title from Yarn Owl, and honestly, it really does kind of look like they went "hey wanna make a '90s era Zelda game?" That's not a knock against it to be clear, as it's also a nicely stylish and swish looking game.

<p>
I often find that games inspired by the 3D Zeldas can look and feel a bit too flat, or uninspired. Demi the game has a real strong vibe going for it, with Demi the character appealing to my own sensibilities quite a lot. I very much vibe with his deer boy vibe, his sword with a handle made from what looks like a tree branch is cool as heck, and yeah, I even like that he literally just has Link's pointy, droopy hat but in blue. Combat looks nice and smooth too, though that's something I'd have to try out for myself at some point to comment on it properly.
</p>
<p>
As of right now it doesn't have a release date, but you can probably already guess that it's coming to PC given that I covered it here.

<p>2K Games and Gearbox Software confirmed this <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102">on social media today</a>, mentioning how the team does not take this decision lightly. The aim is to deliver the "best possible experience", so this version needs more development time.</p>
<p>While a new launch date for Switch 2 hasn't been revealed just yet, the aim is to line it up with the addition of cross saves, which are currently in the works. In accordance with Nintendo's policy, digital pre-orders have also been cancelled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greetings, Vault Hunters - We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to also better align this release with the addition of cross saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important. We will update you all on the new release timing once we’ve fully adjusted our plans.</p>
<p>In accordance with Nintendo’s policy, all digital pre-orders to date will be cancelled. Customers can initiate that process themselves now, or it will happen automatically starting on Friday, Sept. 26. For questions about the Nintendo eShop, contact <a href="https://t.co/p0U8UeGs49" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://bit.ly/4niZo7h</a>. For physical pre-orders, please reach out to the corresponding retailer.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate the feedback, support and patience of our fans and community. It’s truly what keeps us going.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borderlands 4 was originally released for PC, Xbox X|S and PlayStation 5 earlier this month on 12th September 2025. Our colleagues at Push Square thought the shift to an open world was the "right move", but couldn't ignore the console version's "problematic performance".</p>
<p>Before this latest development update, the Nintendo Switch 2 version was originally scheduled for 3rd October 2025.</p>

			<p>When Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1947702377185763768">took to X (formerly Twitter)</a> to announce that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 would be launching on <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">October 3, 2025</a>, before delivering the news, he started to act as if he was about to deliver bad news, that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game wasn't going to make it out before the end of 2025. He then happily and excitedly announced that it would be arriving on October 3.</p>



<p>Well, so much for that. This evening, Gearbox took to the <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102">official Borderlands X (formerly Twitter) account</a> to announce that the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 has been delayed. It will no longer be released on October 3. In fact, we don't know when it will be released, because Gearbox didn't provide a new release date or release window, and we'll just have to wait for an update when Gearbox has "<em>fully adjusted</em>" its plans.</p>



<p>On top of that, in line with Nintendo's eShop policy, all digital pre-orders of the game are being cancelled, so you'll have to pre-order it again whenever a new date is announced. You can go ahead and cancel your pre-order yourself, or it will happen automatically this Friday, September 26, 2025. If you have a physical pre-order, you'll have to deal with the retailer you got it from to figure out your next steps there.</p>



<p>"<em>Greetings, Vault Hunters,</em>" the studio began in its statement. "<em>We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that.

<p>It's unfortunate news for Borderlands fans who were hoping to play Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 in a little more than a week from the time of this writing, if it had kept its original release date, but it's not exactly surprising considering the myriad of technical issues the game has faced on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>Hopefully, it makes it out before the end of this year, which would make Pitchford's joke from his video in July still applicable. Though between all the fixes Gearbox is trying to implement on the versions of the game that's already out in players' hands, it can't help but feel unlikely that the Switch 2 version will be pushed to the back of the priority line, and we won't see it arrive until 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bounty-star-preview-westworld.1306032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Annapurna Interactive and DINOGOD’s upcoming action-adventure <em>Bounty Star</em> is well on its way to release, with an October 23 launch date right around the corner. We had a chance to play a quick demo, introducing us to a world of 3D action, mech combat, customization, farming, and base building.</p>

<p>Right away, the demo slot us into the role of a broken, but powerful ex-soldier named Clem. She’s a war veteran who just happens to be a talented fighter and an expert mech pilot. As she attempts to shed the guilt of her past, she works to become a force for good in an area known as the Red Expanse – a post-post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest.</p>

<p>That backdrop opens from the jump, and we’re treated to a quiet opening in a place Clem calls home. It’s framed as a “day in the life,” and it’s easy to see why. Following a quick call, Clem can explore and check off tasks from a list located at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>These tasks range from simple, daily life activities such as eating a meal, grabbing mail, and collecting water, to accepting bounties, which make up the core of the combat-based missions away from home.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250922171050_1.jpg?itok=giUBV7fD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250922171050_1.jpg?itok=qfaw1GEh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Within those tasks, Clem can do things like individual cooking, where she’ll need specific ingredients to make dishes listed in a recipe book. There are other books she can find and read as well, which expand her knowledge of the game.</p>

<p>At her home, Clem can also prepare fuel, equip and paint her mech, and craft melee weapons and ammunition. There’s really a lot to do, just enjoying the life simulation aspect of Bounty Star. You could probably spend hours tinkering around and even working on your skills by taking part in some target practice.</p>

<p>Further customization comes into play with Clem’s mech, or the Desert Raptor MKII. This is important because it lets you mess around with different weapons like a knife or hammer, or different guns, and you can test them out for yourself out on the actual missions.</p>

<p>These missions, or bounties, are initiated by accepting them from the map in Clem’s home. There are two available for this demo, “The Full Moon Gang”, and “Bad Business”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first bounty takes place up north in a place called Coyote Wash, where a large gang has taken up residence. The goal? Take them out, because they’re all too dangerous.</p>

So it’s not all just sweeping up enemies – it seems there are different types of missions, all of which have hefty pay-outs.</p>

<p>Engaging with each bounty is relatively simple, and Clem is pretty much dropped into the fray right away. The Desert Raptor takes a bit to get used to, but it’s a powerful tool against the different types of opponents. Ranged weaponry is useful against flying enemies, while melee strikes can take out those on the ground. Clem can engage a target lock-on, too, just to be safe.</p>

<p>It can feel overwhelming at first, and if Clem fails (that is, the Raptor is too damaged), she’ll be asked to restart or you can just head back to base. A lot of it seems to come down to using the Desert Raptor’s tools and recognizing the most effective way to dispatch different enemy types. There’s also some practice dummies around for weapons testing, which was a nice little detail.</p>

<p>While the<em> Bounty Star</em> demo doesn’t go on too long outside of the life sim and bounty activities, it’s pretty clear there’s going to be a lot to do here. There’s a whole map we haven’t explored, or can explore at this point, but that’s what the full game is hopefully for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, <em>Bounty Star</em> seems like a unique twist on the daily life genre, so we’ll just have to see how Clem’s full story fits into all of that when it releases next month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Annapurna Interactive is readying a new round of games to shore up their publishing slate heading into this year. During a special presentation at Tokyo Game Show, the publisher revealed three new titles spanning a variety of different genres.</p>

<p>First up from developer Marumittu Games comes a puzzle-adventure game called <em>D-topia</em>. In <em>D-topia</em>, players assume the role of a maintenance worker known as a Facilitator who works at the <em>D-topia</em> residential facility. Their job is to address the people’s concerns, solve puzzles, and uncover secrets in this oddly perfect society managed by AI.</p>

<p><em>D-topia</em> has a large focus on exploration and nuanced choices that delve deep into the human heart of this perfect world as the story progresses. It’s due for launch on PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>




<p>Annapurna’s next reveal is a musical narrative adventure called <em>People of Note </em>in development by Iridium Studios. The hook here is that it’s a turn-based RPG and a full-on musical rolled into one. <em>People of Note</em> promises a heartfelt story, choreographed cinematic musical sequences, and a battle system based on an interactive sequence of musical expressions and abilities.</p>

<p><em>People of Note</em> will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>




<p>Last but not least, we’ve got <em>Demi and the Fractured Dream,</em>&nbsp;an action-adventure game created by Yarn Owl. As the title suggests, players take on the role of Demi, a voidsent born in the world of Somus who seeks to escape his cursed fate.</p>

<p>As he’s guided by a mysterious voice and aided by an acolyte named Mergo, Demi will journey across diverse yet treacherous lands to fulfill his destiny. <em>Demi and the Fractured Dream</em> is a love letter to classic hack-and-slash action-adventure games, complete with environmental puzzles and platforming. It’s due out in 2026 for PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>It’s been a while since we saw a new entry in the Splinter Cell series, but fans can look forward to the return of Sam Fisher when he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-anime-needed-to-rip-the-spine-out-of-the-source-material-showrunner-says/1100-6534838/" data-ref-id="1100-6534838">sneaks onto Netflix</a> with a fresh animated series on October 14. Liev Schreiber (Ray Donovan, Logan) will voice the Third Echelon operative for its eight-episode run, and if you’re excited about the upcoming series, but have already played through the stealth-action video game series, consider checking out the classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=0425201686,0425204227,0425212785,0425218244,0425231046,0425231445,1405914394,B0DZD85MQD,B0DZHQV5XM&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom Clancy Splinter Cell novels</a> that both the video games and the new Netflix animated series are based on. Better yet, many of the books are discounted at Amazon, making now the ideal time to dive into the espionage thriller series.</p><p>Like many other books, video games, or TV series bearing the late author's name, Tom Clancy never actually wrote any of the Splinter Cell books. Instead, they’re written by David Michaels, Peter Telep, and other popular authors who follow a similar format to Clancy's earlier works.</p><p>If you’re just getting started, it makes sense to start with the first book, aptly titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clancys-Splinter-Cell-David-Michaels/dp/0425201686?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</a>, which is on sale for just $8.94 (was $10). The book introduces Third Echelon, Fisher, and the many people on his team who help him survive out in the field. Fans of the Splinter Cell video games will recognize the tense military espionage action and Sam Fisher’s morbid sense of humor. From there, the Splinter Cell book series includes eight more novels, for a total of nine (so far). The direct follow-up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Operation-Barracuda-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425204227?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Operation Barracuda</a>, while book three, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Checkmate-Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425212785?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Checkmate</a>, and book four, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fallout-Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425218244?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Fallout</a>, introduce new storylines.</p><p>While the first few books are largely original stories that only lightly touch on the video games, several of the later novels tie into or outright retell the events of several games in the series--including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conviction-Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425231046?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Conviction</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Endgame-Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425231445?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Endgame</a>, which serve as the basis for the game also titled Splinter Cell: Conviction. Then <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell-Blacklist/dp/1405914394?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Blacklist Aftermath</a> details events that take place after the last game, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, making it a great choice for fans who've been waiting for Ubisoft to resurrect the dormant series.

            <p>Publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> has revealed three new games in its latest digital showcase, all of which are playable at this week's Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>Annapurna is known for publishing well-loved games like Outer Wilds, Stray, the most recent To a T, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cocoon-is-eurogamers-game-of-2023">Eurogamer's 2023 Game of the Year Cocoon</a>. There are always high expectations, then, as to what it's supporting next.</p>
<p>The first of these three games is D-topia, a puzzle-adventure game from Marumittu Games that features a minimalist sci-fi aesthetic as a young boy seeks to question how to find happiness if life is a utopia?</p>
<p>Expect choice-based gameplay and a very cute grumpy cat. It's set for release next year across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 1 and 2, and PC (Steam, Epic).</p>

<p>Next up is People of Note, described as "a full fledged musical, condensed into a video game" - specifically, a turn-based RPG. The trailer shows a young female star in a singing contest, a colourful futuristic world, and musical battles against strange creatures.</p><p>Of course, any music game like this lives and breathes by its songs - thankfully, this sounds like it could have some Kpop Demon Hunters-esque bangers. It's coming from Iridium Studios and will be out next year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Epic).</p>

<p>Lastly, there's the Zelda-like adventure Demi and the Fractured Dream from developer Yarn Owl. A "tribute to classic action-adventure games", it features hack and slash combat with puzzle solving and platforming, plus ethereal visuals.</p>
<p>Once again, it's due out next year across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 1 and 2, and PC (Steam, Epic).</p>

<p>"Annapurna Interactive is making its debut at this year's Tokyo Game Show and we couldn't imagine a better way to participate in this iconic event than by showcasing three great new titles from amazing indie studios," said Leanne Loombe, head of games at Annapurna Interactive.</p><p>"From the wonderful puzzle adventure D-topia, to the catchy, innovative turn-based musical RPG People of Note, and a beautiful love letter to the classic action-adventure genre with Demi and the Fractured Dream, these games embody our vision of supporting world-class developers who are pushing the boundaries of artist story telling."</p>
<p>Last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">majority of Annapurna's staff quit in a mass exodus</a> following a dispute with the company's owner.</p>
<p>Today's showcase was the second since then, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-showcase-everything-announced">February's showcase</a> featuring a number of games now available.</p>
