Popular mobile card game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has warned players it will take action against anyone with a rude, inoffensive or inapproproate username.
</p>
<p>
After all, Pikachu and friends appeal to players of all ages, and the app is definitely not a place for username gags on Pokéballs.

            <p>The next project from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> developer Round8 Studios will be a sci-fi survival horror, in a marked change from the souslike genre.</p>
<p>As reported by Korean news site <a href="https://www.ebn.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1644423">EBN</a>, the game will utilise Unreal Engine 5 and is targeting a release on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The same report also confirms DLC for Lies of P is slated for the first quarter of 2025.</p>

<p>A statement from publisher Neowiz said it's too early to disclose progress of the project and that it is one of multiple PC and console games in development - presumably alongside the confirmed sequel to Lies of P.</p>
<p>Still, a swing to survival horror for its next standalone project is quite a change and proves the wide-reaching ambitions of the developer to become a leader in the South Korean games industry.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-as-game-director-teases-dlc">sequel to Lies of P was confirmed last year</a> by director Ji Won Choi. "Our highest priority is developing the DLC and working on our sequel," he said at the time.</p>
<p>While it's unknown where the story will lead in a sequel, hints at the end of Lies of P have certainly had fans speculating on what fairytale could be next for the soulslike treatment, following the game's Pinocchio inspiration.</p>
<p>As for the Lies of P DLC, its existence was revealed shortly after the game's release, though so far only concept art of a ship has been shown. "I can promise you one thing," said Choi with the reveal. "What I just showed you scratches merely the tip of an iceberg."</p>
<p>Following its launch last October, Lies of P sold a million copies in less than a month and, by March of this year had surpassed seven million players (including through subscription services).</p>
<p>It's proven a big success for the developer and is now frequently considered one of the best soulslike games not created by From Software.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-developer-details-playstation-5-pro-enhancements">Lies of P is also receiving a PS5 Pro patch</a> to boost performance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 continues its solid sales performance. The game developed by Saber Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?q=space+marine+2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units within a day of its debut (considering pre-orders, of course) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned out</a> to be the second best-selling game launch of the year in Europe. Less than three months later, the studio <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/119-november-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Space Marine 2 broke the milestone of five million copies sold, which proves that the game was well-received among the notoriously picky Warhammer 40K fans.</p>
<p>Saber also took the opportunity to reveal to the community that Patch 5.0 would be released in the first half of December, which means in the next couple of weeks. The update will add a new PvE co-op Operation called Obelisk, in which players must rotate a replica of the Obelisk to disrupt the flow of energy protecting the Aurora device. This Operation takes place in parallel to the final events of the campaign.</p>
<p>To reach the console control of the obelisk, players must venture through a dark tomb. It will be even more challenging due to a new addition to the Chaos roster: the Tzaangor Enlightened, a new Majoris enemy. They will now appear in every PvE Operation featuring Chaos.</p>

<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 is also getting a big customization improvement with the next update. Color lenses have finally been added, allowing players to customize between fifteen colors. Moreover, the patch will also bring the Dark Angels Chapter Pack, adding the unique armor set Dark Angels Champion as well as three themed weapons and one themed shield (for the Bulwark class).</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, Patch 5.0 will introduce support for NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution Frame Generation, bumping frame rates across the board on PC.</p>

<p>Saber also told fans to look forward to Titus's story continuing in Amazon's Secret Level Prime Video series, which will feature a dedicated Space Marine 2 episode. To celebrate the event, they will activate special Twitch Drops between December 10 and 31.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/palworld-december-update-new-island/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A major update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/palworld">Palworld</a> is coming in December, with the addition of a huge new island to the game. Pocketpair has also revealed a crossover collaboration with Terraria for their monster catching survival game that will arrive in 2025.</p>
<p>There’s few details to go on at this point, but the new island will be about six times the size of Sakurajima, which was added in the last major update in June. This new locale will bring “Powerful tower bosses and many vicious new species of Pals lurk here.”</p>


<p>They also promise, “A large amount of new content will also be added.”</p>

		
		

<p>Palworld launched into early access on PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox</a> at the start of this year – the console exclusivity going hand in hand with being day one on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> – before spreading its cute monster-y wings onto <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation</a> in September. The game really took the world by storm, with the “meme game” concept of being Pokémon with guns grabbing people’s attention, but then also appealing to core gamers by leaning into other popular genres like survival and base building.</p>
<p>That success, however, has brought a lot of scrutiny. Back in September,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/nintendo-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-maker/">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced a lawsuit against the indie developer</a>, seemingly for infringing a recently acquired patent for capturing and summoning monsters in battle. <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16">Pocketpair promised to fight this lawsuit</a>, and it feels like Nintendo’s case could be a little bit shaky and tenuous… though we don’t really know how Japanese courts will view the case.</p>

<p>We’ll just have to wait and see, but even with the spectre of legal trouble in the background, it’s good to see that Pocketpair is forging ahead with big updates such as this.</p>
<p>We expect to see more news in due course, with The Game Awards a likely avenue for some kind of reveal or announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/what-we-played-death-stranding-30-birds-towers-of-aghasba/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s been one of those weeks where I ignored the games I’ve been playing for a while (sorry Metaphor: ReFantazio) and started something completely different, setting out for a walk with Sam in Death Stranding. I have to say that the opening must be amongst the most cinematic game experiences I think I’ve ever had, and I absolutely love the world and the weirdness. I’m on a massive sci-fi kick at the moment too – you should all be watching Silo Season 2 on Apple TV+ – so it’s just the perfect game to match up with that.</p>

<p>In a surprise to no-one <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2 as his one chill out game, but <strong>Aran</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/27/30-birds-review/">30 Birds for review</a> and it is apparently very good! He’s also started Loco Motive for review. Finally, he’s revisiting an old favourite and started replaying The Witcher 3.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played plenty more Phasmophobia, The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners 2, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/29/synapse-review-psvr2/">Synapse</a>, which is another VR game with telekinetic powers and guns, saying, “It’s great! (And on PS+ Premium game catalogue).”</p>


<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/25/towers-of-aghasba-early-access-review/">Towers of Aghasba</a> which offers some intriguing twists on the survival sandbox genre. He told us, “There’s still a lot of resource gathering, crafting, and base building, but also some cool features like nurturing emergent ecosystems and a more narrative-driven focus. It’s still in early access and I’m hoping the introduction of multiplayer will help dial up the fun factor.</p>
<p>“I’ve also been playing Assassin’s Creed Mirage which I really struggled with at first due to the rather basic combat and filler missions. Although I enjoy Basim as a protagonist, there’s only so many times Ubisoft can repeat the same assassin origin story – that said, roaming the streets of Baghdad and moving away from the RPG-ness of more recent AC games has provided a fun romp that also eschews any effort to pursue AC’s present-day storyline.”</p>
<p><strong>Tef</strong> has been getting real “Remember when Freddos were 10p?” Vibes from the Steam sale, saying. “20% off doesn’t feel like 20% off when the end result is still £40.” So he’s not actually bought anything new, but has got some bits of back catalogue in his basket. His gaming this week has been fits and starts of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, as he still hasn’t quite figured out which of the many Warhammer 40,000 games is the new one that everyone loved back in September. That and some GT7 on PS5 Pro with its shiny new ray traced reflections.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also perused the Steam sales, picking up UFO50 as an early Christmas present but just some super cheap horror stuff alongside that. Giving his new Switch a workout, Ade has been playing Bayonetta 3 and absolutely loving it. He says, “It’s a totally bonkers but totally brilliant game. It’s reminded me how much I love Platinum Games – with Vanquish being my absolute favourite – I’ve got a hankering to give Astral Chain a play next!” You’re in for a treat if you do!</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

Here's a rundown of the biggest highlights:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Xbox console exterior is well represented with details like a removable hard drive, ventilation holes in the rear, text in the right places, and lighting effects.

There's a tray to pop in the supplied Xbox game disc (we'll get to this later), the motherboard, various heatsinks and doodads all connected by wires, and even a fancy little Cortana chip.

<p>NDemic Creations, the developer behind the remarkably popular world-ending title, Plague Inc., has released After Inc. This mobile game follows directly on from the 2012 apocalypse-inducing epic, inviting players to build a settlement and reshape society.</p>



<p>It’s a complete flip from the first game, in which your chief goal was to rid the world of humans by creating a disease so powerful that it couldn’t be stopped. Anyone who played it knows how open-ended it was, and they also know that living in Iceland or Madagascar was usually the best way to avoid catching the nasty diseases concocted by players.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-can-rebuild">We Can Rebuild</h2>



<p>After Inc. is available now on iOS and Android, and it comes twelve years after the release of the first game. That’s about right in the post-apocalyptic stakes – things have to blow over before you can start rebuilding, right?</p>



<p>Per a post advertising the launch of the game, Ndemic wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After Inc. (is) a unique blend of strategic simulation, survival city builder and ‘mini 4X’. The Necroa Virus has ravaged humanity – build a settlement and shape your post-apocalyptic society.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s coming to Steam in 2025, which follows in the footsteps of Plague Inc., which launched first as a mobile exclusive game before being ported to PC. It’s available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337140/After_Inc_Revival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlist now on the platform</a>.</p>



<p>At first blush, After Inc. is much more immersive and involved than Plague Inc. Players are introduced to a more detailed, granular world, and while they’re still able to influence things across a wider area, After Inc. is more focused on rebuilding the world on a localised scale than it is tearing it down on a global one.</p>



<p>To that end, After Inc. is set primarily in the United Kingdom, which is where Ndemic Creations is based.</p>



<p>In After Inc., players are invited to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Explore ruins</li>



<li>Farm resources</li>



<li>Build and expand settlements</li>



<li>Make tough decisions</li>



<li>Extermine zombie infestations</li>



<li>Follow an intense campaign</li>
</ul>



<p>It has been a long time coming, and while most fans of Plague Inc. didn’t expect it to service, it’s a welcome addition to 2024’s gaming lineup.</p>

            <p>I greatly enjoyed tooting with my mouse in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a> on a flat monitor, but in retrospect it's the perfect candidate for conversion to virtual reality. It's small in scope, for one, but also VR would let you see through the eyes of the tooter and slide your trombone note up and down by holding the motion controllers up to your face.
</p>
<p>So it is in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ-unflattened">Trombone Champ: Unflattened</a>, a VR spin-off that's out now.

<p>Made by Flat2VR Studios, a company that specialises in, as their name suggests, bringing games from flat screens to VR, Unflattened seems like more than a straight re-formatting. The menus are all new, the notes whizz towards you <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beat-saber">Beat Saber</a>-style, there are cosmetic unlocks for the trombone, and you can unlock and trade cards of famous musicians from throughout history.
</p>
<p>The fundamental tooting remains the same, mind you. Trombone Champ: Unflattened is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3151670/Trombone_Champ_Unflattened/">available from Steam</a> and will work with more VR headsets than just the Meta Quest featured in the trailer above. It costs £12.79/€14.79/$15.
</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that Unflattened will retain the best thing about the original: the community that surrounds it. Trombone Champ players have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-trombone-champ-championships-are-a-wellspring-of-community-creativity-whether-or-not-you-bone-the-trom">organised championship competitions</a>, made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-final-fantasy-7-trombone-champ-mod-is-pitch-perfect">custom tracks</a>, and turned those custom tracks into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-is-best-experienced-via-videos-by-its-creative-modders">excellent YouTube videos</a> to enjoy whether or not you play the game yourself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's almost the end of November, which means it is technically but not spiritually still autumn. It is spiritually winter, the season of wearing gloves and using my phone's flashlight to look for my dog's poos in the long grass. Yet it's not the Steam winter sale that started yesterday, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">Steam autumn sale</a>. 
</p>
<p>Discounts are definitely never a bad thing, but Steam sales used to feel like big events on the PC gaming calendar. They don't anymore, to me. Friends, are Steam sales still exciting to you?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I think I'm right in saying that Steam sales are, at the very least, not <em>as</em> exciting as they once were, if only because we've grown used to them. It no longer seems like a miraculous surprise to have so many games deeply discounted all at once. Doubly and triply so once you factor in all the other digital storefronts, all of which also have their own big seasonal sales.

<p>Maybe it's also just become harder to find the truly spectacular deals because there's now so many of them. Sure, it's great that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> is £1.59, but it's forever slashed to cheap, so it's hard to get pumped about it. Instead it just feels like it's obscuring the handful of games where its discount is actually news. 
</p><p>It feels like a bigger deal that Hitman: World Of Assassination is a mere £2.49, a full 90% off for some of the best stealth gaming ever made. 25% off a game as new as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is significant, although it's still £45. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragons-dogma-2">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> at £30 feels like a good entry point for players uncertain about a slightly off-kilter fantasy RPG.
</p>
<p>Maybe we just all permanently have more games than we can ever play now. Between bundles and freebies, who needs spend money, discounted or otherwise, just to throw another game on the backlog?
</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm simply out of touch. There are definitely going to be some people saving their pennies and waiting for each new Steam sale to arrive, and more power to you. I'm not pooh-poohing Steam sales, so please put away your phone flashlights. I am genuinely curious how the RPS commenter is split, however: do you share my malaise, or are you currently posting Gaben memes in the group chat? </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024’s launch server issues have been resolved, Asobo Studio has stated, with server capacity now increased to meet demand and reliability at over 99.999%. Patches are due next week on 2nd and 9th December aiming to make further client-side improvements and fixes.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-november-27-update/">update to the community</a> follows on from launch woes that saw players shoved into unending queues and the servers unable to cope with demand. <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-update-1-1-9-0-available-now/">Hotfix 1</a> was released last Friday on 22nd November to address key snags that people were facing, though there is one outstanding issue with outdated marketplace content from MSFS 2020 clashing with the new install of MSFS 2024 on PC.</p>


<p>As noted last week, “outdated packages in your Community Folder may have an unexpected impact on the title’s performance and behavior.” The advice was basically to remove that content.</p>
<p>Along these lines, most MSFS 2020 content has now been ported across to MSFS 2024, though with community reports and analytics showing that some 3rd party add-ons are still problematic, Asobo is currently blocking all MSFS 2020 non-aircraft content from use with MSFS 2024.</p>
<p>The patch on 9th December will add a feature for users to disable and enable content themselves, and a safe boot option that can deactivate all 3rd party content at once if you’re struggling to launch the game.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://flightsimulator.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16882910197148-Known-issues-for-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-2024">an FAQ for outstanding issues</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the circles you fly in, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has maybe flown under the radar – heh – compared to its predecessor. The 2020 game was a marvel of conception and execution, able to approximate the entire world for players to fly in, and then with Asobo releasing a long-running stream of content updates to add more human-created touches of reality. MSFS 2024 sounds like it would be more iterative – and purchased content does carry forward – but has made some major changes to allow you to land and hop out of your aircraft, to bring a more meaningful career mode to the game with new mission types, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/pearl-jam-sydney-2024-tour<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>We do not celebrate Thanksgiving here in Australia. But today I thought I'd write a little something about being thankful anyway.</em></p><p>I saw Pearl Jam on the weekend and I think it kinda changed my life? Or at least the way I remember my life.</p><p>I am a man comfortably in my mid-40s, and over that time have been to countless live shows. That's not a boast, I'm just old, stuff like this racks up as you go. I once saw Japanese hardcore legends<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67g_1EWMaos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Numb</a> play in front of 20 people in a sweaty basement.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMyHSB-TU9U&amp;t=1132s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I was on a boat for an Electric Wizard set that was incredibly called the Boat Of Doom</a>. Me and three buddies<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTKYj_8k7gw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> once went and saw desert rock legends Ten East at a pub in Annandale</a> and we were the only four people there. I lined up early to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_3uH4r4siM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> get Latyrx tickets</a> when they played in Canberra and ended up being the only person lining up early to get tickets.</p><p>The thing all those shows had in common, along with nearly every other show I've ever been to regardless of genre, is that they were current shows. Like, when I saw them, the bands or artists playing were relevant, in their prime, doing their best work in the moment. That's why they were touring, and that's why I was seeing them!</p><p>I can count the number of throwback shows--older bands playing the hits for their older fans--I've seen on one hand. I saw Faith No More 20 years after they broke up, and it was fun, I guess! I saw The Police play in 2008, which was also fun! I even saw<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mkidP2OUCk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Icehouse, my favourite band from when I was like six</a> (in 1986) in 2019 (when I was 39) and they ruled. For the most part though, I tend to pass on these kinds of tours, because seeing 60 year-old guys hobbling around trying to play the hits from when they were 26 more often than not ends up being a bit sad.</p><p>So when Pearl Jam announced they were touring Australia for the first time in over a decade, I wasn't feeling it. I'd once been a big fan, sure, but that band hadn't been relevant to me in decades, and tickets were selling in the region of $250 each. We're in the middle of a cost of living crisis! My wife kept bugging me about it though, saying stuff like "it'll be fun" and "you used to love Pearl Jam", so eventually I said fuck it, whatever, let's go. We hadn't been to a show together in years, it'll be a nice weekend away.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Pearl Jam 1995-03-14 Canberra, Australia" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZgLpRXrWAHM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Some surprisingly high-quality surviving footage of Pearl Jam's lone Canberra show, in 1995</figcaption></figure></div><p>You need to know that beyond going to <em>this </em>show, there was some personal closure to be had here. When I was a kid,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLpRXrWAHM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Peal Jam played a single show in my home town of Canberra</a>, right when I was very much a huge Pearl Jam fan. <em>Ten </em>was the first CD I ever bought,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llOpE85bmW0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and I will champion their MTV Unplugged set until the day I die</a>. I wanted to go <em>so bad</em>, but being a kid at the time, and with fairly conservative parents, I hadn't been allowed to. This was a bummer, but wasn't a <em>huge deal</em> either, because I sagely figured that being only 15 at the time I'd have plenty of time to go see them later as I got older. Nope!</p><p>They toured Australia again in 1998, but I was living in the UK at the time, and as I found myself growing out of my teenage years and my tastes began to broaden once I got to university (and using the internet), I started getting into music that was newer, heavier, more political, or faster. As an insecure and impressionable young man in his early 20s, it was very cool to be into Refused and Mastodon and The Bronx and High on Fire and Converge. The grungy stadium rock bands with their flannel shirts and the mopey songs from the 90s were disappearing into my (and music's) rear view mirror. It was old shit. I was living for the new shit.</p><p>It's not like I <em>privately </em>disowned them. There have always been Pearl Jam tracks in my favourite playlists, and I’ve kept all my old albums in my garage, but there's not a chance in hell you'd have ever caught me wearing a Pearl Jam shirt or blasting Pearl Jam at a party in the 21st century. I had grown into someone who was simply too cool for that. I was going to cool shows for cool bands in cool basements and cool pubs.</p><p>What a <em>stupid </em>fucking thing to care about! I lived so many of my best years treating band shirts like RPG armour, as though their obscurity or heaviness would bestow me with status upgrades, and by the late 2000's it would have taken a waterboarding for me to publicly admit I knew all the lyrics to every song on <em>Vitalogy</em>. You do a lot of dumb shit when you're young and trying to find your way, but few of my own transgressions are as regrettable as pinning so much of my identity on the music I was into and other people's expression of their love for theirs.</p><p>When I got to the show on Saturday night, I did so with an open mind. I'd loved this band 30 years ago, and now I was finally seeing them; this should be fun in the same way all those other throwback shows were! When the set started with “Garden” and “Why Go”, I was into it. By the time they were hitting “Even Flow” and “Tremor Christ” 30 minutes in I was singing along. Then they played a double of “Immortality” and “Rearviewmirror”, two of my favourite Pearl Jam songs, and I just...lost it. I was standing there, a grown-ass man, shouting the words (which I probably hadn't done aloud for decades, but which could be instantly retrieved from deep storage) but also tearing up. I didn't cry throughout, this was a rock show, not a sad movie, but yeah, there were moments during the two-hour set where I genuinely lost my shit.</p><figure><video controls="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/11/PXL_20241123_103850253.mp4"></video><figcaption>I don't normally like to be the "phone out" guy at a show, but they went so hard at the end of Rearviewmirror I had to get some of it</figcaption></figure><p>Turns out there are lines, riffs and entire Pearl Jam songs that had been filed deep in my memory banks because they existed alongside key points from my childhood, and seeing them live dredged them all up--the songs and the moments--in quick succession. It was like my life was flashing before my eyes, but only the parts of it when I was an awkward teenager who listened to too much grunge. I'd turned up to this show expecting a throwback, but dear reader, it was I who had been thrown back, back into my teenage years and waist-deep into moments I hadn't thought about in <em>decades</em>.</p><p>I'd met my first girlfriend to “Better Man” as the final song at a school dance. We broke up a few months later, only days after I'd bought her a copy of<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB2W3vuzVGk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Merkinball</em></a> for her birthday (which I kept and still have, it's great). I'd been to basketball practice where we played these songs. I played “Porch” one day after I came home so stressed from exams I was crying in the shower. The best karaoke I've ever done was an acoustic rendition of “Indifference” in the dying light of a graduation party. I moved out of home and to England to work as a sports coach at a boarding school when I was only 17, <em>way </em>too young to be doing that, and proved it by only thinking to take one cassette for my Walkman: Pearl Jam's MTV Unplugged set, which I played so often I wore the tape out.</p><p>At seemingly every pivotal, formative and often embarrassing moment of my youth, moments my slightly older self had clearly tried to protect myself from (probably out of sheer embarrassment), this band had been there. And me being the stupid young asshole I was, I'd tried to bury it all, the moments and the music. Now, as a middle-aged man, here they were, in person, right in front of me. Playing those same songs live, in my face, sent all those memories crashing right back to the forefront of my consciousness whether I wanted them or not.</p><p>And what's more, Pearl Jam <em>killed </em>it. The show wasn't just nostalgic, it was <em>incredible</em>. Their age was utterly irrelevant. Eddie Vedder's soaring vocals could still climb into the heavens, Mike McReady shredded everything he touched and Matt Cameron casually spent the night reminding us all he's still one of the best drummers on the planet. This show took place in 2024 but aside from the haircuts and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raSMqE-CoYo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> lack of scaffolding-climbing</a> you could squint--and I was pretty far back, so this wasn't hard--and pretend it was 2004. What a privilege it was now to be able to feel this, all of this, to get this kind of reconciliation.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Pearl Jam - Hunger Strike, 23rd Nov 2024, Sydney" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2dmEncBN66c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>For the first time in over a decade, the band played <em>Hunger Strike</em>, the Temple of the Dog track on which Vedder was a guest vocalist alongside friend Chris Cornell. Getting to see it live was something I'll remember for the rest of my life. </figcaption></figure></div><p>I've spent the week since the show not just endlessly listening to live Pearl Jam recordings (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/album/4VCFCNy4B35Mx0qzG6JLoF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a <em>fantastic </em>1994 set just landed on Spotify</a>), but also swimming in all the memories this show dragged up and what they meant to me now that I was decades later in my life. It shouldn't have been legal for me to move overseas and do that job at that age, it messed me up! My first girlfriend had been filed away as a "sad" memory, but that wasn't right; she broke up with me over the phone, while I was in a phone booth, and I'd had to walk home for ten minutes in the rain<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oabcM9SOF-E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> like an extended <em>Arrested Development</em> bit</a>. That was sad when I was 15, but it's fucking hilarious now.</p><p>It's no great revelation to say that music has these powers. We've all experienced something like this, waves of nostalgia and glimpses of our lost youths through the songs of those times, but this was something else. I'd never been hit with feelings as hard or as revelatory as I had on Saturday night. I went to a rock show and ended up revisiting the entire 1990s, and even parts of the decade to follow. In that time I'd been an idiot, an asshole, a child and a young man, and it was wild revisiting the rawness of those years, having them thrust upon me by a band I thought I'd moved on from, but clearly never had.</p><p>Hopefully we--Pearl Jam, my memories, my regrets and my indiscretions--are all cool now, and we can all get along for the rest of my life without so much pointless baggage and drama.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With the end of the year looming, Hello Games' exploratory space sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is - in an occurrence that's rapidly becoming a bit of a tradition - revisiting all its limited-time Expedition events from 2024 over the next ten weeks. That means you've got another chance to whizz through and earn their various rewards if you missed them the first time around.
</p>
<p>
And I do mean whizz. While Expeditions ordinarily last around six weeks, No Man's Sky's latest Redux event is racing through this year's offerings at a pace of one a fortnight. Furthermore, things are already underway with Omega - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-is-free-to-play-this-weekend-as-new-omega-update-lands">kicked off 2024's Expeditions</a> back in February - now live and running until 11th December.
</p>
<p>
Omega (as is the case for all future Expeditions) can be accessed via the terminal in No Man's Sky's communal Space Anomaly, and - among its many rewards - gives players the opportunity to earn the rather flashy Starborn starship. Before we cover the highlights of each Expedition, though, here's the upcoming Redux schedule in full:

<figcaption>No Man's Sky's spooky The Cursed expedition arrived in October.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyPJUtsQiEY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li>Omega: 27th November - 11th December</li>
<li>Adrift: 11th December - 25th December</li>
<li>Liquidators: 25th December - 8th January</li>
<li>Aquarius: 8th January - 22nd January</li>
<li>The Cursed: 22nd January - 5th February</li>
</ul>
<p>
Rewards for Adrift, which sees players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-latest-update-lets-players-explore-a-lonely-abandoned-universe-devoid-of-life">stranded alone in an empty universe</a>, include a haunted frigate known as the Ship of the Damned. Liquidators, meanwhile, features organic chitlin armour to earn as players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">embark on a Starship Troopers-style bug hunt</a> across the stars. 
</p><p>
As for Aquarius, it's a fairly leisurely Expedition primarily concerned with introducing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-reel-in-new-aquarius-fishing-update">No Man's Sky's new fishing system</a>, and rewards here include the Lost Angler's fishing equipment and a octopus-inspired bobblhead for your starship's dashboard. As finally, there's The Cursed - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-the-cursed-is-a-spooky-expedition-for-halloween-set-in-a-collapsing-reality">horror-themed Expedition</a> set in a collapsing reality populated by spectral entities. Rewards here are pretty nifty, including the Cthulhu-esque Horror Exosuit customisation, bioluminescent pets, and the UFO-like Boundary Herald starship.
</p>
<p>
Hello Games' Expedition Redux event is now underway on all platforms, and it follows yesterday's news that No Man's Sky has finally - eight years after its rocky launch - managed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eight-years-after-its-rocky-launch-no-mans-sky-finally-hits-very-positive-reviews-on-steam">hit the "Very Positive" reviews threshold</a> on Steam. Reaching the coveted "Overwhelmingly Positive" ranking will be a bit of a challenge given the way Steam ratings are calculated, but who knows - Hello Games has <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/11/holiday-2024-expeditions/">confirmed</a> it still has "much more in store" for No Man's Sky.

            <title><![CDATA[Which PS5 Exclusives Might Arrive in 2025?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-exclusives-arriving-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-ps5-exclusives-might-arrive-in-2025.1047744/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-exclusives-arriving-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rumors continue to swirl about a new PlayStation event, but with no official confirmation in sight, what PS5 exclusives might arrive in 2025?</p>



<p>Luckily, unlike the quieter 2024—which focused on new IPs and games from partners—next year seemingly looks packed with first-party AAAs!</p>



<p>Before we dive in, though, let me clarify that we’ll soon have a similar article focusing on Xbox, and this is nothing more than speculation on what we believe could be released in 2025.</p>



<p>Last but not least, this list focuses on console exclusives, meaning the games mentioned are confirmed only for PS5 and PC.</p>



<h2 id="h-ps5-exclusives-for-2025">PS5 exclusives for 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei </h3>



<p>Details about the sequel to Ghost of Tsushima are still a bit scarce, but the game was announced with an exciting trailer earlier this year. more importantly, it’s one of the only first-party games for PlayStation with a launch window of 2025. Since PlayStation has a tendency to repeat its dates too, so it seems plausible that this second installment of the “Ghost of” series will drop sometime in June.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7z7kqwuf0a8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In this new adventure, we won’t be controlling Jin Sakai; instead, we’ll play as a woman named Atsu. Set in 1603, 329 years after the first game’s events, the time skip might allow for more varied gameplay.</p>



<p>During this period, European countries heavily influenced Japan, leading to a “technological exchange.” For instance, Japanese soldiers began using firearms for the first time, which could add more variety to Atsu’s adventures. </p>



<h3 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach </h3>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach came out swinging with its first trailer, and in pure Kojima fashion, no one quite understood what exactly was happening. Its various trailers since have continued to keep people on their toes and guessing what’s next in the Death Stranding universe. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Death Stranding 2 On The Beach - State of Play Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wbLstJHlC4U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Unlike Ghost of Yotei, Death Stranding 2 at least seems to be a direct continuation of the first game, but the big question is how Kojima will manage to surprise us again and what new gameplay he has in store.</p>



<p>Since the first game launched in November 2019, the safest bet for this sequel’s release is sometime in the second half of 2025, especially if Ghost of Yotei takes up the first half.</p>



<h3 id="h-horizon-online">Horizon Online </h3>



<p>According to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent job</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/">listing</a>, Horizon Online is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to arrive sometime next year</a>.</p>



<p>Many hope it will have gameplay similar to the Monster Hunter series, but is that the direction in which Guerrilla Games is going? Will it be an open world, or are we looking at a hub-based system? Will there be PvP? How will progression work? Unfortunately, we only have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12-minute video from the game’s alpha</a> to go on, and with so much potentially changing since the leak, it’s challenging to know what exactly is in store.</p>



<p>With Monster Hunter Wilds launching at the end of February, I imagine PlayStation is tentatively looking to put Horizon Online in the second half of the year.</p>



<h3 id="h-lost-soul-aside">Lost Soul Aside </h3>



<p>Fans of Lost Soul Aside definitely deserve an award for their patience! The game was first announced back in 2017 and still doesn’t have a release date in sight.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="LOST SOUL ASIDE Boss Fight 9 Minutes Gameplay - ChinaJoy 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZeEUb7_am4Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>However, there’s a good reason for the delay. The project was initially led by a single developer, Yang Bing, but it caught the attention of PlayStation, who decided to back the game.</p>



<p>They were so impressed that they took on the role of publisher. The game showcased a solid video at ChinaJoy 2024, indicating that things could be coming together for a 2025 release.</p>



<hr>



<p>What do you think about the PS5 exclusives set to arrive in 2025? It’s worth noting that more titles will likely launch throughout the year, but these probably will be smaller-scale projects. One example is AI-Limit, which is a game that’s a part of the PlayStation China Hero Project. But who knows, maybe PlayStation is hiding some surprises up its sleeve?</p>



<p>There are rumors that Marathon might show up next year, too, but given the project’s current state, I think that’s highly unlikely, especially considering the failed launch of Concord.  I strongly suspect that PlayStation has some real concerns about its live-service slate of games and is reevaluating its strategy. Unless, of course, Bungie is in a rush to get the game out the door, which has its own problems.</p>



<p>Other announced games, like the temporary exclusive KOTOR Remake, the<span> </span>highly anticipated&nbsp;Phantom Blade 0,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Marvel’s Wolverine, will probably not appear until sometime in 2026.</p>
