            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Chris Roberts</strong>, the video game designer known for the Wing Commander series and most recently for <strong>Star Citizen</strong>, penned his usual end-of-the-year <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/comm-link/transmission/20960-Letter-From-The-Chairman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'Letter From the Chairman'</a> to the SC community, including a few updates on <strong>Squadron 42</strong>.</p>



<p>The single player campaign was initially supposed to launch its beta in <strong>Q2 2020</strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-beta-delayed-by-three-months-now-targeting-q3-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">then in <strong>Q3 2020</strong></a>, before being delayed indefinitely, with Chris Roberts <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-will-be-done-when-its-done-says-chris-roberts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commenting in October 2020</a> that the game would be 'done when it's done'. </p>



<p>The tune finally changed in October 2023, when developer Cloud Imperium Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Squadron 42 was now <strong>feature-complete</strong> and would enter its polishing phase. A year later, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-gets-2026-release-window-and-new-gameplay-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the new target release window: <strong>2026</strong>. However, a few months ago, the game's Content Director <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-content-director-isnt-100-sure-game-launch-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that delays could still happen.</p>



<p>Today, though, Chris Roberts has reiterated that Squadron 42 is on the right path toward the Beta milestone and the eventual launch at some point next year. According to Roberts, the game will take <strong>over forty hours</strong> to complete. The game designer also teased that the content quality is something he's proud of, from writing and performance capture to characters, environments, ships, lighting, sound, cinematics, and design.</p>



<p>Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-launch-2027-2028-squadron-42-top-gun-star-awrs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his previous statement</a> about hoping to attract a GTA 6-like attention, Roberts has now said that Cloud Imperium Games isn't planning a long marketing campaign. Because of this decision, fans should expect to learn more about the game relatively close to its actual debut compared to most triple-A games.</p>



<p>The plot of Squaron 42 will see the player character in the role of a rookie pilot joining the celebrated 42nd Squadron, a naval combat unit deployed aboard the massive capital ship UEES Stanton, assigned to the 5th Fleet, 87th Battlegroup in the Odin system, during the Events of Vega II in 2945. The story is framed as a military war narrative centered on the United Empire of Earth (UEE) Navy, where the player is thrown into a hazardous campaign to combat a sinister pirate threat and the alien Vanduul.</p>



<p>Cloud Imperium Games recruited <strong>major Hollywood talents</strong>, including <strong>Gary Oldman, Andy Serkis, Gillian Anderson, Mark Hamill, Mark Strong, Liam Cunningham, John Rhys-Davies, Henry Cavill, and Ben Mendelsohn</strong>, to play the role of key non-player characters in the game. Cloud Imperium used new 4D technology to create digital replicas of these actors (as well as player characters and other NPCs) thanks to a unique partnership with the Hollywood VFX company <a href="https://www.clearanglestudios.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clear Angle Studios</a>.</p>



<p>In the 'Letter From The Chairman', Roberts also boasted that Star Citizen received many big updates this year, driving record engagement with the game up to <strong>64 million hours</strong> (last year, CIG registered 48 million hours of playtime) played in 2025. Looking ahead, the Dynamic Server Meshing technology will evolve to reconfigure in real-time, aiming to support thousands of players in a single shared instance; a next-generation planetary tech will debut, offering significantly higher graphical fidelity, denser biomes, and natural ecosystems; a new AI population management system will create more complex and appropriate NPC interactions; and significant improvements are also coming to systems like Inventory, Insurance, and Cross-Patch Persistence.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent PlayStation Network (PSN) hacking incident involving a journalist has revealed a major security flaw that could put many users in trouble. </p>



<p>A lot of PlayStation users have been hacked at some point; some users manage to get their account back, whereas unfortunate others have to leave behind all of their years’ worth of progress for a new account. Interestingly, some users are hacked again when trying to recover their accounts, and someone has now discovered a flaw that could be the cause. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-network-accounts-can-be-hacked-with-just-an-invoice-number-and-your-username">PlayStation Network Accounts Can be Hacked With Just an Invoice Number and Your Username </h2>



<p>A journalist at the French publication <a href="https://www.numerama.com/cyberguerre/2147695-je-me-suis-fait-pirater-mon-compte-playstation-et-jai-decouvert-un-enorme-probleme-de-securite-chez-sony.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Numerama</a> (translated by Google) has discovered a major security flaw with PlayStation Network. The report dives into an incident in which the journalist’s account was hacked despite 2FA protection. The user’s account login ID (email address) was changed, and he was charged €9.99 as the hacker had changed the username. The journalist was able to recover their account by getting support over the phone, but what’s interesting is the information they needed to retrieve it. </p>



<p>The report reveals that after spending some time on the call, all the information they needed to share was their PSN username and a transaction number from an old invoice; the year didn’t matter. With that, the journalist recovered their account; however, it was hacked again within an hour. This time, the user was unable to reach PSN support on the phone and decided to contact the hacker themselves by messaging their old PSN account from a new one. </p>



<p>The hacker was strangely cooperative and revealed that they had hacked the journalist’s PSN account “using a transaction number you posted on a page.” Turns out he had posted one of his bills in an old article, which the hacker could use to get access to the PSN account. The hacker also claimed to have “coded an app” to access Sony’s servers; however, that claim hasn’t been verified, as the promised video hasn’t been shared yet. </p>



<p>The journalist got on another call with PlayStation Network support, expressed his concerns about his account being hacked, and was then asked questions such as his date of birth, original email address, and original username. At the moment, their request is on hold, with the account seemingly suspended and a 5-10 day waiting period for a response.</p>

Additionally, you can see the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-the-gathering-gift-ideas">best MTG gift ideas</a> or more of IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/best-gift-ideas">gift guides</a> for any last-minute shopping needs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are the best gaming and tech deals available now, AKA the day before Christmas Eve!</p><p id="tldr-deals-for-today"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TL;DR: Deals for Today">TL;DR: Best Deals Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sweet spot seems to be getting a product on Amazon that is cheapest or at market value, as you're getting a bargain and should <strong>get it delivered before Christmas Day</strong>. If you are looking to get some MTG by then, I wouldn't wait around, as this is likely the final day to get something delivered before a round man breaks into your home, eats your food, and leaves you something nice under your tree. Let's get into it:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save up to 50% on Webroot Cybersecurity Plan - Includes VPN, Antivirus, Identity Theft Protection &amp; More</h2><div catalogid="bc0e7f43-d26a-4642-b84f-939b2357eccd" id="233791"><p data-cy="paragraph">For when Santa's not the only one watching you...</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any time is the right time to ensure you’re doing everything right to protect yourself online from cybercriminals.

The Bloomburrow Commander deck bundle is down to $124.98, which is great value. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you really want to build out your Commander game, the Commander Masters Set and Draft Booster boxes are below market value right now too, at $447.20 and $366.47, respectively.</p><p id="mtg-at-market-value-on-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG At Market Value on Amazon">MTG At Market Value on Amazon</h2></p><div><div id="233830" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value on Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender Play Booster Box</h3></p></div><div id="233833" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value on Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Outlaws of Thunder Junction Play Booster Box</h3></p></div><div id="233841" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value on Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Avatar: The Last Airbender Play Booster Box has dropped by $15 from its preorder listing and is in line with current secondary market listings on TCGPlayer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Grand Theft Auto series is known for always being set in a fictional version of cities in the United States. Liberty City is Rockstar's version of New York, Vice City is Miami, Los Santos is Los Angeles, and so on. At the core of the series has always been its parody of US culture, which is part of why each game has remained in the US. That said, according to a former Rockstar developer, we were close to seeing an entirely different version of the GTA games we've come to know.</p>



<p>In fact, we were close to seeing several different versions of GTA games, with one intended to be set in Tokyo, another in Istanbul, another in Rio de Janeiro, and another in Moscow. This all comes from Obbe Vermeij, a former technical director at Rockstar and the technical director for GTA III, GTA Vice City, San Andreas, and GTA VI, in <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/">an interview with GamesHub</a>. </p>



<p>When asked if the development team at Rockstar ever considered taking the GTA games out of the US, Vermeij said, "<em>There were desires, yeah, but it’s like talking about alternative projects at Rockstar when you really start thinking about it.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We had ideas about GTA games in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and Istanbul. Tokyo almost actually happened. Another studio in Japan were going to do it, take our code and do GTA: Tokyo. But then that didn’t happen in the end.</em> <em>People love having these wild ideas but then when you’ve got billions of dollars riding on it it’s too easy to go let’s do what we know again, and also America is basically the epicenter of Western culture, so everybody knows the cities, even people who haven’t been there. They have a mental image of the cities</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I think it’s unlikely it’s going to be in Bogota next time, especially since there’s just more and more money involved as the project gets bigger. It doesn’t make sense to set it in some left-field location for novelty. GTA: Toronto? It just wouldn’t work</em>."</p>



<p>When asked about the prospect of Grand Theft Auto games moving to Europe, Vermeij continued, "<em>It’s just not realistic. I would love it, and if games still took a year to make then yeah sure, you can have a little fun, but you’re not going to get that when there’s a GTA every 12 years.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>You’re not going to set it in a new location. You don’t really need to either because the technology changes so much. Nobody is going to say that they’re not going to play GTA VI because they’ve already played Vice City. That doesn’t make sense. It’s completely different.</em> <em>They’ll revisit New York again. They’ll go back to LA or maybe Las Vegas. I’m afraid we’re stuck in this loop of about five American cities. Let’s just get used to it.</em>"</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is returning to Vice City and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">is due to release on November 19, 2026</a>. It's been over a decade since the release of GTA V, and considering how long it is taking to get GTA VI out the door, it'll be years before we even start to hear rumours about where the series could go next.</p>



<p>In other Rockstar news, while everyone continues to wait for GTA VI, the studio is currently being accused of union-busting for the firing of 34 workers across Rockstar offices in the UK and Canada. While Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/">claims the employees were leaking confidential information</a>, the 31 workers fired across the UK and three workers fired at Rockstar Toronto deny those allegations.</p>



<p>The dismissals have resulted in Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">employees and union supporters protesting outside of Rockstar's offices</a> in Edinburgh, Paris, New York, and, most recently, Toronto. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">Wccftech was able to attend the protest in Toronto and speak with those protesting</a> and get a first-hand account of Rockstar's refusal to speak with those at its office in Oakville, Ontario, that day. </p>



<p>Wccftech also spoke with one of the workers who was fired from Rockstar Toronto, who told us, "<em></em><em>Every single one of us was talented;</em> <em>we wouldn't have gotten into Rockstar if we weren't talented, if they didn't see our potential, if they didn't see how talented and how good we are at what we do, we wouldn't have gotten in in the first place. We just want to get back to work on the game. We poured our heart and soul into</em> <em>it, and to be let go just for discussing our working conditions amongst ourselves and wanting the company to be better, it's heartbreaking</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Unbeatable Is Messy, But Somehow Still Hits]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/unbeatable-rhythm-game-review/</link>
            <guid>1391176</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>To steal a line from <em>Unbeatable</em>, I could feel the game's last chapter in the space between my eyes. It's the place where tension builds before you're about to cry—a unique feeling <em>of</em> feelings that manifests through pain. Played in episodes, the sixth of which is the culmination of it all, <em>Unbeatable</em> is set in a world where music is illegal. So illegal, in fact, that the world's become a fascist police state; musicians and music lovers still exist, but they’re pushed to the margins of society. Music is the key theme here both narratively and mechanically; the story is centered around it, tied to traditional rhythm-based gameplay where you push buttons to a beat.&nbsp;</p><p>Storywise, where <em>Unbeatable</em> lands is the idea that music and art are not only "amplifiers" of feelings, as <em>Unbeatable</em>'s characters put it, but <em>are</em> feelings. The last chapter is where all of this becomes clear, and the game's rhythm gameplay, stylish animation, incredible music, and high-stakes story work together to reinforce that.</p><p>The problem is that it takes five episodes to get there. When <em>Unbeatable</em> is good, it's really good, but there's just too much time where it's not. Up until the last episode, I couldn't tell you why music is illegal, how the main character Beat was dropped into this world, or even who she really is. After the last episode, I still can't answer some of those questions, but it doesn't really matter. <em>Unbeatable</em> feels like the sort of game that's supposed to be a bit messy. This ending section of <em>Unbeatable</em>, though, is&nbsp; where the game gets to the heart of its characters, what drives it all—not the overly complicated story and slow pacing. For most of <em>Unbeatable</em>, the game gets in its own way.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: D-Cell Games/Playstack</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Unbeatable</em> is about music, but it's also about grief. It's about making mistakes, creating good and bad art, about feeling things. There's one scene, at the end, where the main character, Beat, is talking to her much younger companion, Quaver, about loss. The circumstances of their losses are different—from each others' and my own–but the feeling is universal. Just last night, I was talking about this: It's too painful to remember what I've lost. If I don't think about it, I don't feel it—that tension between my eyes. But in refusing to remember, I lose the overwhelming love that makes the loss much too painful. Beat and Quaver don't necessarily have the answers, and I don't either.</p><p>From this conversation, the screen cuts to white. Quaver starts to sing. The instruments come in, and I can start hitting stuff on beat—the perfect emotional release after the game's most poignant moment.</p><p>But the rest of the game, aside from several other moments here and there, move too slowly, with too many extraneous details, and way too much walking around. There's one section, early on, where the crew is trying to escape from prison. There's some rhythm elements, and it works as a sort of tutorial. There's a part where you get a prison job. A baseball minigame. A lot of walking around with bad camera work. It's so painfully slow, while also somehow moving way too fast—narratively, I have so many questions. Later, there's a random platforming part to restore power to an arcade that never comes back up in the story. The problem with these sections and several of the others is that the material within doesn't necessarily point towards the core of the story, what's at the center of the last chapter. <em>Unbeatable</em> is shrouded in a mystery that makes this feel intentional. I haven't mentioned this yet, but there's also a supernatural element: Cops are arrested musicians and music lovers, but there's also a big black hole that's threatening to engulf the whole world. You're kind of fighting both at the same time, but it's not until the last few chapters where <em>Unbeatable</em> reveals why. (I still don't entirely get it.)</p><p>There were a lot of times during <em>Unbeatable</em> when I wanted to quit the game's story mode. And right when I was thinking that, I hit one of the moments where the visuals, music, and writing really work. Those moments do a lot of work in forgiving the bad parts. It's easy to see the vision of developer D-Cell; the game drips both heart and an undeniable cool. But you can also see where the focus was—rightfully on these big, key moments—and where everything went off the rails.</p><p>Yet, by the end, I found myself shrugging off its failures. That's kind of the takeaway of <em>Unbeatable</em>, no? It's messy. Sometimes bad. And yet it still made me feel.</p>

              <p>It’s not quite 2026 yet and the release calendar is already getting shuffled around. IO Interactive just confirmed its upcoming James Bond game won’t release as previously scheduled. Instead, <em>007: First Light</em> will get a few more months in the oven as it snags <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>‘s old release date.</p> <p>Originally set to arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC on March 27, 2026, the stealth action game will now launch on May 27, 2026. The <em>Hitman</em> maker said <em>007: First Light</em> was in good shape but the delay would allow for extra polish.</p> <p>Here’s IO Interactive’s full statement:</p> <blockquote><p>Today, we are sharing an update regarding 007 First Light, as we have decided to move the game’s release by two months, to May 27, 2026.</p> <p>007 First Light is our most ambitious project to date, and the team has been fully focused on delivering an unforgettable James Bond experience, bringing together breathtaking action, globe-trotting, spycraft, gadgets, car chases, and more. As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one.</p> <p>The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end, so these additional two months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We’re confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we’ve received ever since we revealed the game. We look forward to sharing more updates regarding 007 First Light in early 2026.</p></blockquote>

            <guid>1391167</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, not all games can be great. In fact, many of them are not good, and some even fail to be simply okay. If you’re looking for all things good and great, then check out our list of the best-reviewed games of 2025. But this place, sadly, is not where they live. No, this is where I have the job of reminding you of all of the worst games we played this year. The ones that didn’t quite live up to expectations and received a score of five or below from IGN reviewers. Maybe you did enjoy some of these, and to that I say, all the power to you. Let us know in the comments which games featured on this list you did actually love playing. But before you scroll all the way down there, let’s talk about IGN’s worst-reviewed games of 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5 - Mediocre</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">What better way to kick this off than with a welcome tour? A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>, to be exact. A collection of minigames and digital museum displays designed to give you a better idea of the tech powering your new Nintendo console, this one just ended up committing a criminal cardinal sin by Nintendo standards — it just wasn’t fun. Our review described this “interactive brochure” as “a muddled collection of quaint tech demos and boring factoids”. Not exactly the best way to get everyone excited about a new generation of hardware, was it? And it didn’t even come packaged with the console. A standalone purchase isn’t exactly the best way to deliver your new spin on a digital manual. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At least the tech being shown off in Welcome Tour is very impressive, though, which sadly couldn’t be said for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kaiserpunk-review">Kaiserpunk<strong>. </strong></a>A city-builder that, unfortunately, suffered from significant performance issues at launch, ranging from “huge, save-killing bugs” to an interface that lacks “fairly basic functionality”, it provided unsolid foundations to build any metropolis on. If a fully-built sci-fi city is more your vibe, then maybe you could be tempted by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steel-seed-review">Steel Seed</a><strong>, </strong>an action-platform dripping in neon. But when we tell you that it’s actually a “stealth action game cursed by mediocrity”, then maybe you’ll be less interested. Hence, the five out of ten rating, which stands for “mediocre” here at IGN. Along those lines, if “30 mediocre hours of dodge rolling and sword swinging” sounds appealing, then maybe you want to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-limit-review">AI Limit</a>. A “soulslike without any soul”, this one just lacked the sort of creativity you’d hope for in what’s become a fairly played-out genre these days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of souls, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lost-soul-aside-review">Lost Soul Aside<strong> </strong></a>was a hotly anticipated PlayStation console exclusive this summer, which sadly didn’t quite live up to the hype. While it did come packed with some exciting combat, unfortunately, “repetitive story, derivative characters, and bland level design” couldn’t support it. Another game that fell foul of repetition was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/full-metal-schoolgirl-review">Full Metal Schoolgirl</a>, which you may not instantly see as a negative when considering it's an action roguelike — a genre grounded in attempting the same objectives over and over again — but when you hear that after “a couple runs, you've pretty much seen it all”, that isn’t ideal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Feeling like we’d pretty much seen it all before is exactly why we gave the<strong> </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-review">Battlefield 6 campaign</a><strong> </strong>a score of five, too. As our shockingly handsome reviewer said, the single-player offering is a “safe, dull reimagining of what Battlefield once was, rather than a bold reinvention of what it could be”, and I, for one, agree with him. It’s a short string of missions that doesn’t embrace the chaos naturally created in Battlefield 6’s multiplayer, instead feeling like a relic of a bygone age of FPSs. We also gave this year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 campaign</a> a less-than-shiny score, too, but it narrowly misses out on making this list due to us giving it a 6, because it at least tries to do something new, even if it isn’t very successful.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we head into the remaster, reboot, and reimagining section of proceedings. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yooka-replaylee-review">Yooka-Replayee<strong> </strong></a>aimed to bring the 2017 original into the modern day with some tweaks, but while improvements were made, we were of the opinion that “none of its changes do enough to bring it close to the 3D platforming standards of today”. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/double-dragon-revive-review">Double Dragon Revive</a><strong> </strong>attempted to breathe new life into the classic side-scrolling beat ‘em up, but ended up feeling “less a miraculous resurrection and more like exhuming a shambling corpse”. Similar things could be said for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/painkiller-2025-review">Painkiller</a><strong>, </strong>a reboot of People Can Fly’s 2004 cult-favourite, which again fell short, instead playing like a “mediocre resurrection of a classic trying to put a new cover on an old book and hoping it still has some relevance 21 years later”. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-labyrinth-review">Shadow Labyrinth<strong> </strong></a>did at least attempt to take something incredibly old and do something new with it. Unfortunately, this gritty, Metroidvania reinvention of Pac-Man was deemed to be “largely dull,” with crimes ranging from “annoying checkpointing to the one-note combat”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no shortage of checkpoints in racing games. Sorry, that’s the best segue I have for this one. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-motor-racing-review">Project Motor Racing<strong> </strong></a>is the most recent game we have on our list to score a five or below, as it failed to excite our reviewer, who said that “there are certainly glimpses of a competent racing sim here, but it is drastically unfinished”. On the other end of the racing spectrum was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wreckreation-review">Wreckreation</a>, not in terms of quality, as it also received a five, but in its very “arcadey” approach to action of four wheels. Disappointingly, it just didn’t reach the heights of the likes of its Burnout inspiration. Instead, “overflowing with ambition but ultimately plain and with no style to call its own, Wreckreation feels like a supermarket brand homage to a series of better arcade racers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s head into fantasy corner now and take a look at those sword-swinging games that just weren’t quite sharp enough this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yasha-legends-of-the-demon-blade-review">Yasha: Legends of the Demon Blade<strong> </strong></a>was yet another action roguelite to come out in 2025, but one that didn’t leave much of an impression, thanks to “repetitive levels and a flimsy story”. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blades-of-fire-review">Blades of Fire</a><strong> </strong>took an interesting approach to third-person action by placing an emphasis on creating your own bespoke swords through an involved blacksmithing process, which was admittedly quite good, but its “overly simplistic combat and a mediocre story mean it doesn’t forge a sharp enough edge to put its customizable weapons to good use”. And, finally, rounding out our list of games that received a review score of five from IGN this year, is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-review">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad</a>.<strong> </strong>A microtransaction-riddled interpretation of George R.R. Martin’s world, in which the recreation of HBO’s visual style is admittedly impressively done, it’s unfortunately hampered “by an overly grindy, pay-to-win live service model, and both its combat and homestead management are too tedious to keep things interesting on their own”.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4 - Bad</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Heading into the games that got a four, which represents “bad” on the IGN review scale, let’s stick with another beloved piece of fantasy literature that struggles to produce good video game adaptations. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-review">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game<strong> </strong></a>was an attempt to “cosify” Tolkien’s world and asked the age-old question, “What if Animal Crossing, but Hobbits?”. The answer, sadly, was a resounding “no”, as we described it as “a promising idea that turned out dreadfully boring and extremely buggy”.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arguably, no other game arrived with as heavy a thud as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> did in 2025. The brainchild of former GTA dev, Leslie Benzies, this throwback third-person action-adventure was not only incredibly dull, but borderline broken. Sure, it looked like a blockbuster when viewed from a very specific, narrow angle, but on the whole, it failed to live up to any expectations that may have been held for it. “MindsEye’s flashy graphics and cinematics can’t hide its serious lack of substance and major performance problems”, says our review, and that tells you all you need to know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To round things off, we have a handful of early access games that we gave a score of four to this year. These include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-review-early-access">Hyper Light Breaker</a>, which we described as a “roguelite that currently feels hyper light on content and the wrong kind of broken”, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/la-quimera">La Quimera</a>,<strong> </strong>an “FPS version of a direct-to-video movie, with dialogue that is both poorly written and badly acted, middling combat, and an unfinished campaign”. Then there was EA’s reboot of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-early-access-review">Skate</a>,<strong> </strong>which we called<strong> </strong>a “faithful facsimile of the incredible feel of the old games, but its mobile game-style progression, dud dialogue, and cutesy art style make its early access debut drastically inferior to the originals in all other ways”. Unfortunately for Hyper Light Breaker, similar responses from both other critics and players eventually led to developer Heart Machine bringing development to a close. As for the other two, they remain developing projects, so let’s hope that these games fix their respective issues and have a better time in 2026 in the run-up to their full launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s it, all of the games that we at IGN scored a five or four out of ten this year. Believe it or not, nothing actually scored lower, so I’m glad to say there are no twos or threes to report this year. Did you actually love any of the games listed here? Let us know in the comments.

<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>Today, we are sharing an update regarding 007 First Light, as we have decided to move the game's release by two months, to the 27th of May 2026.</p><p>007 First Light is our most ambitious project to date, and the team has been fully focused on delivering an unforgettable James Bond experience, bringing together breathtaking action, globe-trotting, spycraft, gadgets, car chases, and more. As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one.</p><p>The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end, so these additional two months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We're confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we've received ever since we first revealed the game. We look forward to sharing more updates regarding 007 First Light in early 2026.</p><p>Thank you again for your support,</p><p>IO Interactive/ Hakan Abrak</p><p>007 First Light will tell the origin story of the iconic British spy James Bond, showing him as a hotheaded recruit in the years before he became the agent we all know and love. It's a particularly exciting project for IO Interactive, because its work on the Hitman series makes it a perfect candidate to adapt Bond's espionage to video games. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/02/watching-a-behind-closed-doors-demo-of-007-first-light-quelled-my-biggest-worry">We got a chance to see the game behind closed doors last September</a> and came away quite impressed, so hopefully this added development time makes the final product as polished as we hope.</p><p>In other 007 news, we recently learned <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/007-first-light-villain-revealed-and-hes-played-by-lenny-kravitz">the game's villain will be played by none other than Lenny Kravitz</a>.

            <guid>1391149</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>IO Interactive had one final holiday surprise for players ahead of the release of its next game, 007 First Light: a delay. The studio announced that the game has been delayed by two months and will no longer release on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">previously announced release date of March 27, 2026</a>. Now, it will launch on May 27, 2026.</p>



<p>The news came in the form of a statement shared on the game's official social media accounts, where the studio writes, "<em>As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end, so these additional two months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring that we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We're confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we've received ever since we revealed the game. We look</em> <em>forward to sharing more updates regarding 007 First Light in early 2026</em>."</p>







<p>When IO Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-007-announced/">first announced that it would be making a James Bond game back in 2020</a>, which we knew at the time by the name of Project 007, everyone <a href="https://wccftech.com/james-bond-and-io-interactive-are-a-match-made-in-heaven-says-mgm-itll-be-special/">agreed it was like putting peanut butter and chocolate together</a>. No other developer could be better suited to bring Bond into modern video games, and it's been exciting to know that 007 First Light is coming down the pipeline for next year.</p>



<p>A two-month delay for polishing and bug fixes can't really do much to quell that excitement, as IO Interactive and James Bond fans alike would prefer the team take the necessary time it needs to get everything right and in its proper place.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we're sure to learn more about 007 First Light as we dig into the first half of 2026, especially <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-debuts-new-beyond-the-light-bts-007-first-light-series/">as IO continues its 'Beyond the Light' BTS series</a>. Recently, at The Game Awards, <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-trailer-showcases-lenny-kravitz-as-latest-bond-villain/">we saw the official reveal of Lenny Kravitz as Bawma, one of the villains in the new Bond story IO Interactive has crafted</a>, and prior to that, we got confirmation that <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-007-first-light-trailer-shows-off-bonds-stylish-wheels/">IO would be including Bond's iconic Aston Martin Valhalla</a>.</p>



<p>We also got the chance <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-uncharted-x-hitman-qa-narrative-drives-things/">to speak with IO Interactive about the story it crafted for 007 First Light, and you can check out that interview here.</a> </p>

<p>If you're awaiting more information about <em>007 First Light</em>, IO Interactive says it'll share more about the project early next year, so you won't have to wait too long. Hopefully, that'll take the sting out of the tail of this delay.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar, <em>007 First Light </em>is an upcoming stealth-action game from IO Interactive, the creator of the <em>Hitman </em>franchise.&nbsp;</p><p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-007-first-light" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f80f45ac-0336-4e81-901a-6eb99e901f21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">earlier this year</a>, the game will seemingly operate along similar lines to the studio's flagship series, placing protagonist James Bond in a series of exotic locales as he sneaks and bluffs his way past the locals in an attempt to "expose a deep conspiracy".</p><p><em>007 First Light </em>takes place towards the beginning of Bond's career; despite the game's name, Bond hasn't yet earned his "00" license to kill, so you'll witness how he does so over the course of <em>First Light</em>'s narrative.</p>

              <p><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>fans had to wait over a year for their Limited Run Games special edition of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560"><i><span>Sonic X Shadow Generations</span></i></a><span>. The remaster/excellent pack-in game launched in October of 2024, but with multiple shipment delays, it took 14 months between launch day and the special edition’s arrival on fans’ doorsteps. Was it worth the wait? Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span>Several fans are reporting that the package’s Sonic and Shadow statues are showing up with various defects. Some have scratches, others have misprinted eyes, and one poor soul’s Shadow arrived with his nose broken off. The special edition cost $249.99 before taxes and shipping, and after a year-long wait, I would also be livid if this is what showed up in the mail.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Three months before its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 27th, 2026</a> release, IO Interactive has delayed 007 First Light by two months. The James Bond game will now release on May 27th, 2026. </p>



<p>The upcoming action game from Hitman studio IO Interactive looks to be one of the biggest hits for next year. With an&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gemma-chan-announced-for-007-first-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-star cast</a>, including singer Lenny Kravitz, there’s a lot riding on the developer’s ambitious project. Set at the beginning of Bond’s career, fans will see the young agent earn the 007 moniker on a world-trekking adventure fit for the novels. Its upcoming March 27th, 2026 release made it a huge blockbuster for the Spring season. Now, it’s been moved to the summer for polishing.</p>







<h2 id="h-007-first-light-playable-but-delayed-two-months-for-polish-says-io-interactive">007 First Light ‘Playable’, But Delayed Two Months for Polish, Says IO Interactive</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a statement on <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2003511022141817016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s official Twitter/X</a>, it was announced that 007 First Light would be delayed two months. Now, instead of coming out on March 27th, 2026, it will now launch on May 27th, 2026. As to why the decision was made, the team brings up the need for refinement and polishing the final build. However, IO Interactive did share that the game is fully playable from start to finish, so the two months will help make it that much better.</p>



<p>The initial reaction to 007 First Light’s gameplay from its State of Play was a bit lackluster. Constant frame rate issues and iffy textures did sour the game’s reputation a bit. However, it seems the version fans have been waiting for will come to light thanks to the new delay. While it won’t be meeting it’s March deadline, it does position the game to be a great start to the Summer season. </p>







<p>What do you think of 007 First Light’s delay to May 2026? Do you think it needed the polish? Sad to see it miss its March 2026 deadline?

<blockquote>
<p><em>"Wake up, Sleeper</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I knew next to nothing about Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector when a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryA2lZ-FEp8">trailer</a> first caught my eye back in the early days of 2025. Its predecessor, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a>, somehow managed to slip under my radar and, despite my love for sci-fi, TTRPGs and, weirdly, <strong>Severance</strong>, the sequel threatened to do much the same.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qwultx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>But that trailer grabbed me. I'm not sure whether it was the art, the music, or the bubbling mystery that ran under the whole thing, but I picked up a copy on launch day, spent one evening getting to grips with the mechanics and then <em>bam</em>, 48 hours later I was sobbing into a cushion as the credits rolled.</p>
<p>This sweet little game about found families in space, sticking it to the man and breaking free from the restraints of a broken regime might feature one of the most emotionally devastating finales I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. Despite, on the surface, being a game all about life, Citizen Sleeper 2 made me think about death in a way very few games have ever done before.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9369c981a68f4"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9369c981a68f4/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But before I get to that, much like the previous Gareth Damian Martin (of the game's one-person team, Jump Over The Age) joint, Citizen Sleeper 2 is a text-based game about finding your place in the universe. It has the same dice mechanics where you roll five dice at the start of a 'cycle' (one in-game day), and then use them on whichever task you please — be that something simple like working a shift in a nearby bar, or a little more intense like rummaging around a wrecked space station before the entire thing collapses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your Sleeper is not some galactic hero who can do everything on their own</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You play as a Sleeper — a robot body who's had the working mind of some lazy sod on Earth uploaded into it so it can crack on with dangerous menial labour in space while its fleshy originator lives comfortably back on terra firma (see? There's the <strong>Severance</strong> connection!). You jet between space stations, chatting to the locals, taking on missions, adding friends to your crew while generally trying to survive, all while the ominous owner of your mechanised body hunts you across the belt to reinstate you as his slave.</p>
<p>It all sounds pretty bleak and stressful, and it <em>very much is —</em> stress is an in-game mechanic, in fact — but Citizen Sleeper 2 is also unexpectedly joyful. Successfully squeaking a job with less-than-ideal dice rolls gave me as big a kick as beating any Soulslike boss. The character writing is so damn good that I would nervously weigh up whether to take my beloved crewmates like Juni or Bliss on high-risk missions because I didn't want any harm to come to them. Your Sleeper is not some galactic hero who can do everything on their own — depending on which class you pick at the start of the game, certain skills will be completely locked out to you.</p>
<p>All of this means that for roughly 10 hours, I came to adore my Sleeper and the friends I surrounded them with. We ignited a revolution, ended a corporate war, and escaped from the clutches of our former master. We also collected weird cooking ingredients from across The Belt, repainted our ship god knows how many times, and adopted a cat. It was all so happy, so triumphant, but Jump Over The Age had one last curveball.</p>
<figure data-uuid="886c86a7bf862"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/886c86a7bf862/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We had won the day, but, much like Frodo Baggins trying to return to a simple life in the Shire after casting the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, my Sleeper had been changed beyond repair. Their body was decaying. The only cure was a potentially personality-wiping reboot, where all those hopes, dreams, and friendships risked being lost in the process. Most devastating of all, I was given all the time I wanted to think about it.</p>
<p>Naturally, my first instinct was to ignore the finale that I was hurtling towards and go back to mopping up the remaining sidequests that my ragtag crew and I left unattended. I picked up more ingredients, hacked a few more computers, cleared some nasty debris. Or, I tried to.</p>
<p>Like I said, my Sleeper's body was decaying, and jobs that were previously easy with five decent-rolling dice soon became not-so-simple. The die would irreparably break, rolls wouldn't come out as high as they used to, my stress levels would rise uncontrollably at the smallest of tasks. My Sleeper was dying, and try as I might to forget, the game kept reminding me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's the exact ending I wanted. The one that felt right</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this isn't the first example of a game where I <em>felt</em> the cold grip of Lady Death. <strong>Zelda</strong> games have the incessant beeps of panic when Link's hearts are low; 3D <strong>Mario</strong> clutches his knees and wheezes when the end is near; even adventure games like <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> add a little screen blur or burn-in to up the stakes. But in all of these instances, you can stumble through and make it to the next health point, with all of your abilities still intact.</p>
<p>Not in Citizen Sleeper, 2. There are no retries, no extra lives, and no hope of returning to your former strength. Instead, there's a visceral day-by-day deterioration. I could feel the life slipping out of the character I had grown to love, and there was nothing I could do about it.</p>
<p>After successfully wrapping up a simple task that used to take me one dice roll but now took several cycles, I decided it was time to say my goodbyes.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6d62a6e34ff80"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6d62a6e34ff80/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I visited each of my crewmates individually, soaking up the last lines of dialogue while I still could. I headed back to my ship one last time and set the paintwork to my personal favourite, with the idea that my co-pilot, Serafin, could still take to the skies in style after I was gone. I gave one last meal to the cat.</p>
<p>The reboot <em>is</em> the end of Starward Vector, but it's yours to take on as you please. As the world outside of your Sleeper's perception fades to black, the game throws a few final decisions your way: what future do you want your Sleeper to imagine in their final moments, and who do you picture it with? It's the game's final blow.</p>
<p>I initially opted for a life outside The Belt, travelling the stars with the hunky Yu-Jin, but an "Are You Sure?" option profoundly left me all teary again. How could I leave Serafin, the friend who had been by my side since the very start? I backed out of my choice and instead selected a future where he and I explore The Belt together forever, hopping between stations wherever duty calls.</p>
<p>It's the exact ending I wanted, the one that felt right. And with one final line, the screen faded to black and the credits rolled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And then, somewhere nearby, a button is pressed. And all at once, one thing ends and something new begins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sobbed as the names scrolled up the screen. I sobbed again as I recounted to my partner what had happened. Then I just sat and stared at the wall for a bit.</p>
<p>I finished Citizen Sleeper 2 about 10 months ago, and I can honestly say that I've thought about its ending almost every day since. The story, dice gameplay and music all deserve their praise, but a game hasn't hit me this profoundly in the 'thinking about death at 3am' feels since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/outer_wilds">Outer Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>Hey, is there a more morbid reason for a game to make your GOTY list?</p>

			<p>When <strong>Epic Games</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-7-out-now-with-nanite-foliage-and-megalights-powered-stunning-dynamic-shadow-casting-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> <strong>Unreal Engine 5.7</strong> (UE 5.7 from now on in this article) a month and a half ago, it immediately appeared to be a significant improvement in various regards, at least on paper. The addition of <strong>Nanite foliage</strong>, although experimental, was very exciting, while the <strong>MegaLights</strong> feature promised to increase the number of dynamic shadow-casting lights that developers could add to their games without crashing the frame rate.</p>



<p>Last week, YouTuber MxBenchmarkPC <a href="https://wccftech.com/with-significant-gpu-and-cpu-performance-improvements-unreal-engine-5-7-is-another-step-in-the-right-direction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tested UE 5.7 against UE 5.4</a> in a Venice-set tech demo and noticed measurable performance gains. Would these additions and changes still be equally beneficial in an actual game, though?</p>



<p>I got an answer to that question from <strong>Studio Wildcard</strong> Co-Founder, Co-Creative Director, Lead Designer, Lead Programmer, and Development Director <strong>Jeremy Stieglitz</strong>, as part of a much larger interview on <strong>ARK: Survival Ascended</strong> and its recently released narrative-driven <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-lost-colony-dlc-expansion-out-now-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Colony DLC</a></strong>.</p>



<p>When I asked him what had changed in the reception of ARK: Survival Ascended since <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-first-ue5-gameplay-cross-platform-modding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the early access launch two years ago</a>, with recent user reviews finally reaching <strong>Mostly Positive</strong> on Steam, he pointed out the performance improvements as a major reason. Then, he revealed that UE 5.7 is already being tested internally, is expected to be released in March 2026, and is <strong>'as close to a magic bullet'</strong> in delivering better performance as one can imagine, particularly with the Nanite foliage.</p>



<p><strong><em>Jeremy Stieglitz:</em> </strong><em>When the game came out, it didn't run very well. It still doesn't run as well as it should, frankly, but we're up about 50% performance-wise over the initial release of the game on the same hardware. It's a really significant improvement, but it's not ultimately where we want to be. Where are we going to get more performance from? Well, a big part of it is actually with Epic's latest version of Unreal Engine 5.7, which introduces some serious new performance-oriented improvements and systems. 5.6 did as well, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-gets-ps5-pro-patch-with-pssr-support-ue5-5-upgrade-and-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we're still on 5.5</a>. So, the performance improvements of 5.6 combined with the new features of 5.7 are going to gain us about another 30 to 40% on both the GPU and the CPU. UE 5.6 did a lot of render thread optimizations, where they made things work much better in parallel between the render thread and the game thread and the GPU and the CPU. There's major architectural changes in 5.6, and in UE 5.7, they added an entirely new system for how to draw large foliage, demonstrated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher IV demo</a>, for example. </em></p>



<p><em>And we're actually able to utilize that directly. We have this working internally. We are just still preparing it for release. It's going to take a few months to work all the kinks out of other parts of the engine that have been upgraded, but we can already say that it's about a third performance gain on our existing maps due to the use of this new Nanite tesselation and culling system that Epic has introduced in UE 5.7 for foliage. We're really, really excited about that. It's as close to a magic bullet as you're going to get at this point, and it's one of those rare cases where it's an unalloyed win. There's no real caveats or asterisks. It works way better than what existed before, and we don't have to sacrifice anything to make it work. So, it was as close to a magic solution for some of those performance problems as possible. We expect the UE 5.7 upgrade for ARK: Survival Ascended to roll out by the end of March of this coming year.</em></p>



<p>When I asked whether UE 5.7 would help get rid of the dreadful stuttering that gamers have to suffer in ARK but also generally in Unreal Engine games, Stieglitz replied that it would, but players shouldn't expect stutters to be entirely gone.</p>



<p><strong><em>Jeremy Stieglitz: </em></strong><em>It should be better, but I don't know that it will be completely eliminated because of two factors. One, in ARK in particular, some of the stuttering is due to the initiation of actors which cannot be multi-threaded. When you are playing an online game and you go to a new area and a giant base that somebody has built gets loaded on the client, it really has to be done instantaneously as soon as we get that data. We could possibly try to multi-thread it, but Unreal Engine 5 is pretty bad about network actor instantiation and multi-threading. I don't know if they have an inherent system for that. In other words, when the client receives an actor like a dino or a building over the network, it wants to immediately spawn that to start receiving the network data associated with it immediately. Now, multiply that by 50,000. When you've got 50,000 structures that you've got to spawn and you receive them in a big batch of data all in a single frame, as you can imagine, that's going to result in a hitch. It has nothing to do with graphics or background loading of the world. It's literally that it just received 50,000 game objects over the network and needs to prepare them for play because it's about to receive network data associated with them.</em></p>



<p><em>That's part of the stuttering that's unique to ARK. That's probably the main stuttering people receive when they're playing online, especially associated with large bases. There's another kind of stuttering that's more associated with background loading of the world. A lot of that's been eliminated in more recent versions of Unreal Engine and smoothed out, but there's one that I think is somewhat particular to Unreal games in general that it relates to shader caching. We don't do pre-shader caching, so I think it has to generate some shader code on the fly from the kind of intermediate shader code that's HLSL basically and it has to prepare it for uploading to the GPU, and I believe it does that on the fly. It's specific to your GPU hardware, and that can result in stalls. The way a lot of Unreal games can eliminate that and do is they pre-cache all the shaders they can for your hardware on startup. The issue why I don't like doing that with ARK is that we've just got so much content that I don't think it would be practical in terms of how long it would take. And the second thing is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we also do modding</a>, which makes it even more unpredictable what kind of materials and shaders we're going to need to compile.</em></p>



<p><em>In practice, I think the modding would make it very ineffective even if we did it for the base game content. There would still be stalls due to that because, for one thing, when you play online we do allow people to create custom cosmetics. It's an option people can turn off, but by default, those get downloaded dynamically to people as they play. So, you can encounter people with arbitrary cosmetics on their character or their bases as you play the game. And those can have completely unique materials and therefore unique shaders. There's no real way to pre-cache those because we don't know what they are in advance. I think over time Epic might be able to thread those things even better than they are now, but I do think that hitching in a game which doesn't pre-compile all the shaders is always going to exist to some extent. I will say that I think it's gotten a lot better since the earlier versions of Unreal Engine 5 to UE 5.7 and I wouldn't be surprised to see continued improvements there as Epic continues to iterate on the engine. For our part, we expect to do at least one major engine upgrade per year going forward. We found that we got a good sense of how to do it reasonably efficiently with our upgrade from 5.2 to 5.5 last year in June. We'll do it again to UE 5.7 in March, which we've already begun on, and then wherever Epic is with the version in early to mid 2027 as well.</em></p>



<p>The full interview with Stieglitz has a lot more details on performance enhancements and on ARK: Survival Ascended as a whole, including its roadmap all the way to ARK 2 (now tentatively slated for 2028). Look forward to its publication soon.</p>

			<p>It feels almost sacrilegious that, in a year when a new Nintendo console was released, a Mario game isn't in the running for one of the year's Best Platformers. That doesn't mean 2025 was a slouch in terms of which games were the best at jumping from one ledge to another - just that it's not what anyone would've predicted going into 2025.</p>



<p>That said, there are Nintendo Switch and Switch 2-exclusive titles on this list, so Nintendo did have something for platformer fans to go along with their new console. Here are our picks for the best platformers in 2025.</p>



<p><em>Other Best Games of 2025 per Category: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/">Role-Playing Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/">Fighting Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/">Action</a></strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-bananza-9-10">Donkey Kong Bananza (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">9/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16x9-DonkeyKongBananza.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Bananza. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the most surprising games of 2025, Donkey Kong Bananza was not the 3D platformer we thought we would get from Nintendo this year, but it more than surpassed any expectations we could have had. The platforming, world design, and most importantly, the smashing, and the different forms DK takes on his journey with a young Pauline make this one of Nintendo's more unique experiences in some time.</p>



<p>While it still might not reach the highs of a new 3D Mario platformer, Donkey Kong Bananza is able to deliver its own take on the Mario formula in a way that helped establish the character for a new generation of players and a new generation of Nintendo.</p>



<p>As Nathan Birch wrote in his review, "<em>Donkey Kong Bananza doesn’t monkey around, as it’s inarguably the biggest, most ambitious 3D platformer Nintendo has ever produced. Taking the formula established by Super Mario Odyssey as a starting point, Nintendo goes deeper, wilder, weirder, and punchier. Donkey Kong Bananza is perhaps a bit less refined than the near-immaculate Odyssey, but if you can overlook a few minor brown spots, this banana is very much worth peeling.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Xbox-Game-Pass-September-2025-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight Silksong key art. Image credit: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Once again, Hollow Knight Silksong's inclusion in one of our mainline lists comes because it simply cannot be ignored. Yes, Hollow Knight Silksong is a Metroidvania-style game. Yes, it has a lot of combat, and you might be able to make an argument for it being an action game.</p>



<p>But it is a platformer before it is anything else, and that is evident every minute you spend with Silksong. It is challenging 2D platforming at its finest, offering you the tools to expand your movement capabilities as you find new abilities while exploring, and then testing your skills and ability to string together an intricate series of jumps, wall-bounces, dashes, double-jumps. Anything and everything that can be thrown at you to test how good you are at jumping, Team Cherry launches - and then some.</p>



<p>It's also incredibly impressive how Team Cherry mixes platforming into its combat, almost like, if you had never played a platformer that also included combat, but had just played hundreds of hours of platformers and understood the genre and gameplay deeply, you'd be able to play and beat Silksong.</p>



<p>Because your parry timings and ability to learn enemy patterns and strike when you have an opening matter less than being able to platform and manoeuvre in whatever tightly designed room Team Cherry has you squished into this time. The question in Silksong isn't can you fight. It is, can you jump?</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-8-10">Split Fiction (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">8/10</a>)</h2>

<p>Jumping back to the beginning of the year, Split Fiction was one of 2025's early Game of the Year contenders, as Hazelight Studios proved once again that it knows how to craft fun and entertaining co-op adventures.</p>



<p>Split Fiction was one of the year's biggest commercial successes, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/split-fiction-becomes-million-seller-in-just-two-days/">over 1 million copies sold in two days</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/">there's already a film in the works with Wicked director Jon M. Chu in the driver's seat</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sydney-sweeney-will-reportedly-star-in-a-split-fiction-movie-adaptation-with-wicked-director-jon-m-chu-at-the-helm/">Sydney Sweeney set to play one of the two lead characters</a>. </p>



<p>While the story, which centers on two writers, Mio and Zoe (named after the two daughters of Hazelight's Josef Fares), failed to impress as much as Hazelight has with its previous co-op titles, the gameplay and inventiveness behind the situations you experience as you go through this co-op journey will stick with you long after the credits roll. </p>



<p>As Nathan Birch wrote in his review, "<em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes-frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-7-4-10">Revenge of the Savage Planet (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">7.4/10</a>)</h2>

<p>After Typhoon Studios was unceremoniously shuttered with Google shutting down its Stadia division, the team rose again as Raccoon Logic, and under its new name, with its newfound independence, released a sequel to its 2020 hit, Journey to the Savage Planet, with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>



<p>This 3D platforming action-adventure may not have the kind of intricate platforming challenges that can be found in the likes of Hollow Knight Silksong, but it has enough fun and entertaining whimsy in every element of its gameplay that carries the entire experience.</p>



<p>Its big issue is that you have to stick around long enough to see its best parts, as it gets off to a slow start. But if you can muddy through, you'll experience one of 2025's most enjoyable platforming experiences. As I wrote in my review, "<em>Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with whimsical and cartoon-y animations, character designs, and smart level design that strengthens the gameplay experience when it opens up to you fully. The problem, is getting to that point, with tedious missions and upgrade pacing that halt any momentum it starts to build, and with it lacking a story with any real punch, if the charm isn't working for you, it's unlikely, and understandable, if you don't stick around long enough for it to start clicking</em>."</p>



<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-7-5-10">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd/">7.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Donkey-Kong-Country-Returns-HD.png"></a><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>After starting the list with Donkey Kong, he's also ending it with Donkey Kong Country Returns HD. Even with this version of the game arguably not delivering enough for players who already blew threw this adventure on previous Nintendo handhelds, DK Country Returns is undeniably a wonderfully fun platformer.</p>



<p>As Nathan Birch wrote in his review, "<em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD still delivers its share of scintillating simian escapades, but aside from a visual spit shine, not much has been added to the game to keep it competitive with the many excellent 2D platformers that have hit the scene since 2010, including its own sequel. DK completionists and newbies looking for a surprisingly stiff "Nintendo hard" challenge will be happy with this package, but others might want to wait until the big ape has something truly new to beat his chest about.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Mike Klubnika and publisher Critical Reflex have revealed that unsettling indie horror game <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>has managed to pass another huge sales milestone, and they've provided an update on the game's console ports as well.</p><p>As revealed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2835570/view/509600244355303413" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on Steam</a>, <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>has reached a staggering eight million copies sold since launching back in 2023. Given that it's currently only available via Steam or Itch.io, that's a very impressive milestone indeed, putting the game ahead of heavy hitters like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-update" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a11aa258-e2c1-48df-ac44-95f3a37e9c4a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, not to mention <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/octopath-traveler-series-sales-6m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee685a54-e9eb-48df-87dd-8c1a309e1116" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the entire <em>Octopath </em>series</a>.</p><p>Klubnika and Critical Reflex describe the new milestone as "insane", emphasizing that there are "whole countries with fewer citizens" than the total count of <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>players. Again, it's worth remembering that the game isn't available on any kind of subscription service and never has been, so this really is sales rather than just players.</p><figure role="group">

<p>In the Steam post, Klubnika and Critical Reflex also provide an update on the console versions of <em>Buckshot Roulette</em>, which were originally due to arrive this year. However, due to "some technical difficulties, mostly because of the engine", the game will be arriving on consoles next year.</p><p>Additionally, over the course of the next year or so, you can look forward to new <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>merchandise hitting the shelves, as well as a physical release for the game's soundtrack in case you want to relive your days trying not to shoot yourself in the face in a grimy basement.</p><p>In case you're unfamiliar, <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>is an indie horror game that combines <em>Inscryption</em>-style atmosphere with Russian roulette gameplay mechanics. As you've probably surmised from the title, the idea is to "play Russian roulette with a 12-gauge", and whether you walk away with your life or not is up to fate.</p>
<p><em>Buckshot Roulette </em>is just one of the unnerving horror games available as part of publisher Critical Reflex's slate; it joins the likes of <em>Mouthwashing </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d5684c77-487f-4888-bbf9-847c5d9828ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>No, I'm Not a Human</em></a>, along with experimental fare like <em>How Fish Is Made </em>and <em>Carimara</em>.</p><p>You can check out <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835570/Buckshot_Roulette/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> and <a href="https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/buckshot-roulette" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Itch.io</a>, and it's slated to come to consoles next year as well.

              <p>The PvP nature of multiplayer extraction shooter <em>Arc Raiders</em> has been contentious since the game’s launch. There are many who see the ability to kill and be killed by other players are vital for the game’s tension and enjoyment. There are others who argue it’s antithetical to the conventions of a game in which a scant, brave few are trying to bring back resources to those living underground. Either way, <em>Arc Raiders</em> players have reached a fascinating and fragile understanding in which most people, most of the time, don’t kill. So when a retired pro gamer shows up and just starts slaughtering everything, it’s…well, it’s just rude!</p> <p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-just-started-i-have-nothing-retired-pro-gamer-goes-viral-for-relentlessly-killing-casual-arc-raiders-players-but-is-it-griefing-or-just-fair-pvp"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>, Taylor “THump” Humphries—a former pro at games like&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rocket Arena</em>, and&nbsp;<em>H1Z1</em>—has decided to spend his spare time taking out as many “casual” players as he can in Embark’s breakout hit game. On recent Twitch streams, THump has been broadcasting himself <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thump/clip/ThoughtfulGracefulRhinocerosPunchTrees-6vUn_UhjhRo_L3KC">griefing in&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em></a> for, seemingly, his lone amusement. His most recent stream, a grueling 13 hours long, is primarily the guy killing other players in a game in which most people opt to be peaceful.</p>

  <div> <p><span>Now, let me stress, he’s doing nothing </span><em>wrong</em><span>.&nbsp;</span><em>Arc Raiders</em><span> has PvP for a really good reason: it makes it a thousand times more tense to play. Were it only PvE (and honestly, all the wrong parts of me dearly wishes it were), then every interaction with another player would become banal, lacking the terrifying hope for uneasy, fleeting alliances that make it so exciting. Every time a player deliberately kills you, it feels like wanton betrayal, though it’s clearly well within the rules.</span></p> </div> <p>The issue with THump’s murderstreams is that the entire exercise is the video game equivalent of shitposting. His commentary is incessant irony, with him laughing as he makes other people sad. And, I dunno, I’m too old and tired to find that shit funny. Somehow this is proving entertaining enough to the streamer that he’s doing it night after night of late, most recently delighting in lobbing grenades.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Logging in with a full inventory of trigger nades and killing everyone trying to get re-looted after the expedition is a joy.

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love killing grown men that have jobs and children as they are trying to get 5 million credits for the expedition. Killing all teamers in solos, live now.<a href="https://t.co/hiY3uPb3e7">https://t.co/hiY3uPb3e7</a> <a href="https://t.co/ncHTgNMT1x">pic.twitter.com/ncHTgNMT1x</a></p> <p>— THUMP (@THump) <a href="https://twitter.com/THump/status/2001729907760730180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Given THump’s a troll, his responses to those objecting—<a href="https://x.com/THump/status/2002365789475660245">such as</a> “I come from a place where PvP is not optional…<span>it’s a way of life. You want optional PvP go play <em>WoW</em></span>“—are obviously insincere. When one person calls him “another toxic streamer,” and suggests he’d have a better time helping other players rather than killing them, <a href="https://x.com/THump/status/2001832306106159267">he replies</a>, “Id rather ruin others time than have fun myself.”</p>

 <p>But, again, he’s not doing anything wrong. While THump’s repeated claims of innocence, that he’s just killing other players “in a PvP game,” are clearly disingenuous, there’s no arguing that <em>Arc Raiders</em> isn’t designed to facilitate it. Honestly, as much as seeing someone do this for clout is embarrassing to watch, I take huge solace in knowing that his actions are something that stands out among players. I really rather love that this ostensibly PvP game has somehow engendered a player base that, 90 percent of the time, opts not to kill, even when there’s personal gain in doing so. In 2025, that feels like a beacon of hope, and a douche like THump exploiting it only highlights how valuable it is.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Racing Game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/game-of-the-year-2025-best-racing-game/</link>
            <guid>1391071</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we speed towards the close of the year, we’re going to take a handbrake turn into our award for best racing game, so pop your seatbelt on (and let’s be honest, you really should be wearing one if you’re pulling a handbrake turn), ease off the throttle, and enjoy a drive-by of our top picks. It’s been a decent year for racing games, particularly in the arcade and kart racing genres, with the lighter end of the racing spectrum proving to be a big hit with our team, and the community at large.</p>

<p>What can we say? The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> needed a killer launch title, and Nintendo delivered it with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. That ‘World’ in the title is doing a good chunk of tone-setting, because it’s the first open-world Mario Kart game, and you can tootle off, driving across a huge island, and find the answers to all sorts of unknowable questions, like, where do Toads like to go for breakfast? And how long can I follow this Shy Guy for? It’s easy-going, and genuinely likeable, and you can explore the tracks and the larger world to your heart’s content, with Nintendo having filled the place with interesting little visual treats and gatherings that you can ruin by barrelling through them.</p>


<p>Thankfully, the racing action itself is as tight as ever, and Grand Prix now see you racing between the different track locations, adding a new feel to each event. It is familiar, but when Mario Kart 8 gave us a decade of incredible racing, we probably shouldn’t feel too hard done by when Nintendo has chosen to do a bit of inventing too. The biggest and freshest highlight has to be the addition of Knockout Tour, bringing a Battle Royale flavour to Mario Kart’s already-brutal karting combat by whittling a larger-than-ever field of racers down through a series of areas, before ending in a four-racer battle to first place. It’s thrilling, frustrating, and unmissable, and you’ll keep coming back time and time again.</p>
<h3>Fast Fusion – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 didn’t just get one arcade racer at launch, it got two, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> found its way into nearly as many hearts as Mario Kart World did at launch. How did it manage that? Well, it was priced incredibly competitively, an indie game that proved to be the cheapest game at the new console’s launch – no, we’re not including Welcome Tour here – and on top of that, its sci-fi racing was utterly brilliant, winning plaudits from critics and gamers alike.</p>

<p>Framed within the same sub-genre as Wipeout or F-Zero, Fast Fusion is actually the latest entry in the Fast series from Shin’en Multimedia, who’ve continually rung both incredible performance and visuals out of Nintendo’s humble systems. Its colour-changing mechanic for boosting means you can never switch off through races, and the Fusion aspect that lets you combine vehicles means that you can create something that truly feels like your own craft. Fast Fusion looks and feels so good, you could almost mistake it for a AAA title. In our minds, it is one.</p>
<h2>Tokyo Xtreme Racer – Runner Up</h2>
<p>Here’s where the resurgence of arcade racers became clear in 2025. Alongside JDM, Tokyo Xtreme Racer returned us to the kind of racing game that epitomised the Dreamcast and PS2 era. In Tokyo Xtreme Racer’s case, that was the last time we had an entry in the series, with the most recent entry arriving all the way back in 2007.</p>
<p>The brand new Tokyo Xtreme Racer put us on Tokyo’s highways and byways let us loose, allowing you to challenge anyone you like to a race, beating scrubs, upgrading your car, and working your way through every possible rival. The racing is fundamentally unique too, built on a ‘stamina/tug-of-war’ system where the race is won by finding and maintaining a lead on your rival for a certain amount of time, and not just reaching a clear finish line. It’s got heaps of content, feels completely different from eveything else this year, and reminds us of a time when everything was simpler. In 2025, that’s as good as it gets.</p>
<p><strong>Honourable Mentions</strong> (in alphabetical order)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/22/nascar-25-review-heart-pounding-racing-action/"><strong>NASCAR 25</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review/"><strong>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, that’s it for this award, and you’ll excuse us for not stopping before we race off to the next one. For some reason, we’re not allowed to drop below 50MPH, which would be rather scary if Keanu Reeves wasn’t on the bus with us.</p>

			<p>Despite being released over 10 years ago, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt remains incredibly popular, thanks to its compelling story, engaging characters, immersive world, and engaging gameplay. Following the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-next-gen-looks-amazing-on-pc-when-it-works/"><strong>Next-Gen update</strong></a> which brought the game to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S while adding new features and ray-tracing support on PC, updates and new content have become progressively more sparse, but something new could be breweing that might bring back players back to the Continent next year.</p>



<p>As reported by Polish publication <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk"><strong>Strefa Inwestorów</strong></a>, Mateusz Chrzanowski, an analyst at Noble Securities, predicts that a big DLC expansion expected to cost $30 will drop for The Witcher 3 in May 2026 (the game's 11th anniversary), and will kickstart the marketing cycle for The Witcher IV, the next entry in the series, which the firm expects to release in late 2027.</p>



<p>If this is indeed the case, there's a chance that the rumored new DLC expansion will bridge the gap between the two games, possibly providing more details on how Ciri began her new journey as a Witcher.</p>



<p>Although the idea of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt receiving a new major DLC expansion over 10 years since its original release may sound unlikely to most, this isn't the first time we have heard rumors about it. This June, well-known Polish game industry commentator Borys Nieśpielak revealed that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-dlc-2026-the-last-wish-project/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">an additional story DLC for the game is supposedly in the works by Fool's Theory</strong></a>, the studio comprised of series veterans that is working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-full-open-world/"><strong>the remake of the first entry in the series</strong></a>. Reportedly, this is one of the new projects yet to be announced by CDPR.</p>



<p>As a massive fan of the world created by Andrzej Sapkowski, I would be delighted to return to the continent for one more adventure together with Geralt before he finally passes the torch to Ciri. </p>

              <p><span>I have already spread the gospel of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/heated-rivalry-show-book-watch-cast-hockey-2000649249"><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span>,</span></a><span> the gay hockey romance TV series bestowed upon us by our yaoi-loving neighbors in the north (Canada). But now, weeks later, many more worshippers have heard the word of our gay Lord.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>According to </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/heated-rivalry-hbo-biggest-tv-show-surprise-hit-1236614905/"><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> is the most-watched original series ever on Canada’s Bell Media Crave streaming service. In the United States, it’s the top-rated non-animated series HBO Max has acquired since its launch in 2020, and amongst the top five of all scripted debuts on the streaming service this year.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The breakout TV series is spreading like flash frost across the nation. There’s an </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=heated%20rivalry&amp;t=1766503148249"><span>entire TikTok cottage industry</span></a><span> dedicated to the show (I bought my sister a shirt through it). The gay bar I occasionally work at won’t stop playing </span><a href="https://www.billboard.com/culture/tv-film/heated-rivalry-episode-four-music-all-things-she-said-tatu-1236141882/"><span>“All The Things She Said”</span></a><span> over the speakers.

 <p><span>That episode, titled “I’ll Believe in Anything,” is currently rated as the second-best episode of television ever by </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=tv_episode&amp;num_votes=1000,&amp;sort=user_rating,desc"><span>IMDB users</span></a><span>, topped (teehee) only by </span><i><span>Breaking Bad</span></i><span>’s “Ozymandias.” Both episodes have a perfect 10-star score, but&nbsp;<em>Heated Rivalry</em>‘s up there with just 31,000 votes compared to <em>Breaking Bad</em>‘s 273,000.<br> </span></p>

 <p><span>The NHL, a league infamous for its players <a href="https://www.outsports.com/2025/6/4/24112574/nhl-gay-slur-suspensions-playoffs-fine/">hurling homophobic slurs</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/35927172/brothers-eric-marc-staal-decline-wear-panthers-pride-night-jerseys">refusing to take part in Pride nights</a>, is embracing the newfound attention the sport has gotten thanks to </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> (hockey has struggled to gain a consistent viewership foothold in the States). </span><span>“There are so many ways to get hooked on hockey and, in the NHL’s 108-year history, this might be the most unique driver for creating new fans.

 <p><span>If you have a young woman or a gay man in your family, expect to hear about this show during Christmas if you haven’t already. Especially because the season finale of </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> airs on HBO Max at 12 a.m. ET on December 26.&nbsp;</span></p>
