			<p>The modding scene of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 on PC is thriving, to say the least, with a dedicated community that even somehow managed to expand the PvE Operations mode to support <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40000spacemarine2/mods/244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 12 players</a>, as if it were an MMO-like raid.</p>
<p>Now, though, the developers from Saber Interactive have opened the door to much bigger and deeper tweaks and improvements to the game with the release of their internal development tool, the Integration Studio. The tool can be downloaded from the <a href="https://discord.gg/QRWxNCDDdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space Marine 2 Modding Hub Discord channel</a> and weighs less than 50 MB. Here's what Space Marine 2 Game Director Dmitry Grigorenko said in the announcement:</p>
<p><em>This is the exact same editor we use internally for all gameplay development. No more editing files in Notepad and praying you didn’t miss a bracket — Integration Studio makes editing anything SSL-related ten times faster, safer, and more intuitive.</em></p>
<p><em>With this first release, you’ll be able to work with:</em><br>
<em>• Level scenarios</em><br>
<em>• Game modes</em><br>
<em>• Individual blueprints — and even write your own gameplay logic</em><br>
<em>• AI Behavior Trees (work in progress)</em><br>
<em>• The AI Director</em><br>
<em>• Abilities and melee combo logic</em><br>
<em>• VFX editing — now 100x easier</em><br>
<em>• UI and HUD elements</em><br>
<em>• …and more to come</em></p>
<p><em>And this is only the beginning.</em></p>
<p><em>Not long ago, I promised we would support the modding scene — and we meant it. Watching this community grow, push boundaries, and create incredible experiences has been both inspiring and humbling. We’re excited to see what you build next — whether it’s a cinematic campaign, wild new game mode, or something we never saw coming.</em></p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has been a smashing success for Saber Interactive, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling over five million units in around three months</a> on the market. It was so successful that they already <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Space Marine 3, although there's still a meaty content roadmap planned for the current game, and the release of the modding tools will undoubtedly improve the game's longevity for PC users.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Microsoft is laying off three percent of its workforce across the business - potentially including its gaming division.</p>
<p>The news comes from a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">CNBC</a> report, following Microsoft's latest financial report from the end of April where it announced an 18 percent year-on-year increase in net income - plus a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports">five percent increase in gaming revenue</a> specifically.</p>
<p>"We continue to implement organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace," a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.</p>
<p>Back in June last year, Microsoft had 228,000 employees, meaning that a three percent drop would amount to approximately 6840 people - though of course employee numbers may have fluctuated, especially following other rounds of layoffs.</p>
<p>As such, this would be the largest round of cuts since the company laid off 10,000 employees in January 2023. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a>, The Coalition, and 343 Industries were all affected.</p>
<p>Since then, Microsoft has continued to lay off staff. In January 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 people from across Microsoft's video game teams were laid off</a>, with a further <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">650 staff laid off in September</a>.</p>
<p>Already this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reportedly-makes-small-number-of-layoffs-across-divisions-including-gaming">Microsoft laid off a "small" number of employees back in January</a>. While these cuts were performance-based, this new round of cuts are not related to performance, the Microsoft spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for further comment on whether Xbox Studios are impacted.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">Microsoft confirmed it would be raising the price of its Xbox console across the world</a>, with some new games costing $80.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5s-best-selling-games-last-month-were-all-from-xbox">Microsoft-published games even dominated the download charts on rival console, Sony's PS5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-precinct-review.1188078/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-precinct-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Deep in the pre-history of 1997’s original Grand Theft Auto, an earlier gameplay concept that was being noodled on within the halls of DMA Design initially would have had us playing as <em>police</em>. Eventually the call was made to pivot and exclusively focus on the <em>wrong </em>side of the law, because it was decided being a criminal was way more fun than being a boring old cop. GTA as we know it was born and, a bazillion in sales later, it’s hard to argue they made the wrong decision. However, nearly three decades down the track, The Precinct has arrived to remind us that there actually <em>is </em>a way to make upholding the law just as engaging as breaking it, in an old school, GTA-inspired sandbox city. The Precinct may be a modestly sized package overall – and the crime-busting gameplay loops it throws at us do eventually become a little samey and worn over its roughly 12-hour campaign – but its isometric, grimy ’80s aesthetic is absolutely excellent and there’s real novelty in patrolling the rain-slick streets, seeking to chip away at Averno City’s neverending supply of miscreants, mobsters, and malefactors.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Setting The Precinct in the ’80s is the single best decision developer Fallen Tree Games has made here. There’s no cyber crime, social media, or mobile phone nonsense cluttering up proceedings. Rather, it’s a world detached from all manner of modern crap; it’s just you, your partner, and a radio. The Precinct is nothing if not an earnest and distinctly 20th century cops ’n’ robbers playground, and it’s all the better for it – it’s like an old TV show. I feel like my CD collection would probably make it clear I understand that police accountability is not a new debate by any stretch but, hey, even Henry Rollins found a way to go from spraying cops with Black Flag lyrics to playing cops in The Chase and Bad Boys II. The Precinct just wants to let us screech in, sirens blazing, and save the day. This is not a game that attempts to grapple with controversy, or the seedier side of ’80s policing – it’s an idealised portrayal of cops and how they’re supposed to properly protect and serve, rather than a commentary on how they actually do it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Precinct is nothing if not an earnest and distinctly 20th century cops ’n’ robbers playground.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At its core, it’s an action-packed ode to iconic 1980s police procedurals and movies; every day would be the busiest and most dangerous day of any actual cop’s career, baddies are cuffed and booked without delay, and the city will never run out of squad cars, no matter how many you destroy. No one would realistically continue to live in The Precinct’s Averno City by choice – it’s chaos. It’d be like living in the last 15 minutes of The Blues Brothers every hour of every day, as countless squad cars crash through crumbling concrete in their relentless pursuits of the city’s brazen crooks. The cop fiction cliches are certainly all here – you can check off the young, idealistic rookie partnered with a jaded veteran counting the weeks until his retirement, a moustachioed chief, and an officer named Kowalski. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do wish the script had a bit more of a natural, spoken-word flow to it, though. As it stands it tends to sound a little overwritten and hammy, and some of the voice acting comes over a bit corny as a result. If The Precinct really was a TV show, it unfortunately wouldn’t be in line for any of Hill Street Blues’ 26 Emmys.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Cop gear</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately the hokey dialogue does little to detract from what it gets right, and I was very quickly hooked into its cadence of daily shifts on the beat. These can be pounding the pavement on foot, with your eyes peeled for vandals and violence. They can be cruising the streets, prowling for carjackers, or watching for the telltale weaving of a drunk driver. They can even be aerial missions where you’re hovering above the city in a chopper, catching crooks in your spotlight and calling in backup to effect arrests. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a great amount of variety in the types of crimes being committed, which is unfortunate for Averno City’s victimised citizens, but good for us as the emergent missions essentially never stop. I did eventually reach a point where the busts began to feel a little repetitive, but this wasn’t until I was quite close to the end of the roughly 12 hours I spent completing the core story. The procedural street crimes continue after the credits roll, but I suspect I’ll leave The Precinct sweating in the interrogation room for now, and come back to it later if it has anything further to offer me down the track – like fresh cases or different street crimes in a potential future update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action occurs both on foot and in vehicles so, whenever you’re not airborne over the city, a typical shift will involve hoofing it after some suspects before tackling and subduing them – and high-speed, paint-trading car chases to catch others. Those car chases are terrific thanks to The Precinct’s strong handling model. Vehicles may appear cute and toy-like on screen thanks to the elevated, isometric camera angle, but they’re not sticky or twitchy. They have a really well-honed sense of weight as you hurl their all-American bulk into handbrake turns to negotiate corners. When a gaggle of squad cars with sirens blazing close in on a fleeing perp all at once, there are times when The Precinct reminds me more of the original Driver than the old 2D GTA games. (The original Driver as viewed from a low-flying drone, that is.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The range of era-correct lookalike vehicles is spot-on, too, from off-brand Mustangs and ’Cudas, to A-Team-adjacent Vanduras, and the classic, boxy third-gen Caprice cop cars I’ve seen Hollywood crash a thousand of over the years. It’s Detroit steel as far as the eye can see. I love the visual style, with subtle outlines on the vehicles that give them an almost illustrated look. Sirens are especially snazzy at night too, casting a soft blue and red glow on the slick streets. It’s a great looking game overall, and there’s a lot of granular detail that’s been baked into the environment – from heavily vandalised phone booths to the signage for slimy strip clubs. The level of care is admirable considering the distant camera perspective makes it hard to notice these finer touches while bombing through the map in a battered patrol car, but I was able to appreciate them after slowing down to better absorb the surroundings. Regardless of whether I was playing slowly or recklessly, The Precinct ran reliably for me throughout testing with no crashes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>By the book</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Precinct places a clear focus on following correct procedure, and you’ll earn fewer experience points if you make errors or stray from the rules. This will mean levelling up delays and slower access to the upgrade trees if you go rogue and accost people before checking their ID, attack civilians, use inappropriate force on perps, or issue bogus parking tickets. You won’t lose XP from your previously banked total, but being a bad cop will wipe out your daily gains. Most of the upgrades are fairly typical – resilience to attacks, greater ammo capacity, and the like – but naturally it pays to have as many as you can when you find yourself in a shootout. The abilities to call in heavy-duty riot vans and roadblocks are definitely useful in helping end pursuits, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an interesting approach, and it’s one you can go quite deep with if you really want to take control of which individual charges you’re booking your suspects with, and escort them personally to the station (which will earn you more XP). This part of the process can be automated, however, and that’s what I opted to do on almost all occasions, in order to keep things moving along. I’d rather be out on the streets than riding a desk doing paperwork.</p><div id="rank-these-cop-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these cop games</h3><h3>Rank these cop games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, most arrests generally do unfold the same way: you ID your suspect, search them for weapons and contraband, and then arrest them, fine them, or let them go. It’s a system that wears a bit thin by the story’s conclusion because there aren’t enough variables or surprises to separate one from the next. It’s also always a little unsatisfying when it seems to misread the situation, such as when some scumbag is trying to run me over with their car and it scolds me for using my gun to defend myself. I’m a loose cannon, goddamnit! At least let me charge them with trying to kill me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not certain whether this sort of thing is a bug or just something that hasn’t been accounted for, but The Precinct is a little janky overall. I didn’t face any game-breaking issues, but I did encounter the odd gravity-defying fling and unexplained invisible wall that broke the illusion.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The Precinct’s focus on proper arrest protocols and penalising excessive force requires a certain level of patience that not everybody will possess (and it’s a system that eventually wears out its welcome) but I genuinely enjoyed prowling the city for procedural crimes while the story lasted – and the soggy, neon-splashed ’80s setting works wonders. Fallen Tree Games had a previous crack at emulating the top-down shenanigans of classic Grand Theft Auto back with 2019’s American Fugitive, but putting the action on the right side of the law in The Precinct has proven to be far more arresting. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Image credit: Steam / GeoGuessr.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not the only thing bothering GeoGuessr fans, however. If you link your browser GeoGuessr account to your Steam one, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3478870/discussions/0/603029962779303287/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>you cannot unlink it</u></a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3478870/discussions/0/603030065018615131/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>nor can you log out of the Steam version</u></a>. You cannot play alone, not even to practise and improve. The free amateur mode <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3478870/discussions/0/603029755512529810/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>seems to be full of bots</u></a> rather than real-life players. And perhaps most surprisingly of all, even if you pay to unlock the features on the browser version, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geoguessr/comments/1kijyv4/old_pro_subscription_does_not_qualify_as/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>this does not carry over to Steam</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its defense, GeoGuessr does make this clear — in its <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3478870/discussions/0/603025833901182599/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>FAQs</u></a>, the developer states "having a GeoGuessr browser subscription does not grant you full access to the GeoGuessr Steam Edition, unless you have an Elite Yearly subscription" — and unlike the browser edition, which requires an annual payment, the Steam Edition Steam Pass is a "one-time purchase giving you access to the full game for the year." It is also clearly marked as an early access title, so it can refine the gameplay, introduce new features, "and ensure the best possible experience with direct feedback from players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, it's clear from both the Steam discussion forums and GeoGuessr's subreddit that the monetization model and lack of features has really taken players by surprise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though sold as free-to-play, GeoGuessr Steam arguably offers less than an hour's free content (that's how long it took us to complete it), hosts just one mode, Duels (wherein you ostensibly face-off against another human player), and lets you play in just one league: Amateur Division. That's it. Without paying for the $2.50 monthly subscription — which does not bill monthly but instead requires a $30 upfront one-off payment — you cannot access higher ranks. There are no other modes at all at this time. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/screenshot-2025-05-13-at-11-59-50-1747134092159.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GeoGuessr's three premium plans for its browser game. Image credit: GeoGuessr.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, GeoGuessr's browser game is not free, either. While you can play three rounds a day for free, to unlock all modes, you need to subscribe to one of three premium tiers: Pro Basic at $2.49 a month, Pro Unlimited's $2.99pm, or Pro Elite's $4.99pm. Only the latter two include free access to the Steam game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an exclusive statement to IGN, GeoGuessr said it was "excited to have a first version of our game available on Steam, something that has been highly requested by our community for a long time." It said that the Steam rollout "align[ed] with its vision of letting everyone explore the world, regardless of their preferred platform," adding: "Bringing the game to Steam offers some great new possibilities, like connecting with Steam friends, enabling additional anti-cheat functionality, and so on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That anti-cheat functionality is hugely important to the GeoGuessr community, too. The browser game has long been plagued by cheaters using exploits, bots, or good 'ole Google, despite it clearly being against the community rules, so it's possible the developers hopes to lean on Steam's architecture to help combat pervasive cheating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is a major milestone for us, and also just the beginning," explained head of marketing, Tomas Jonson. "The game is currently in Early Access, and we’re committed to expanding and improving both the free and paid experiences over time. Much of the feedback so far has been around the monetization of the game, with many wishing for a one-time purchase model."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer said that as GeoGuessr relies on data from Google Street View, "where the costs for street view are ongoing and tied to the number of games played," it based the Steam edition "on a model similar to what we use in the browser game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The main exception that the Steam Pass is a non-recurring yearly purchase," Jonson pointed out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GeoGuessr suggests the Steam version will be in early access for "at least six months", and it will "introduce new features and ensure the best possible experience with direct feedback from players." It also states on its Steam page that it aims to "expand" the Steam game with "new modes, maps, and competitive features."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We really appreciate the high engagement and all the player feedback we have received so far. We’ll continue listening closely and working with the community as we further develop the Steam Edition," Jonson concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

                <p>What started as a meme has become a quest of sorts for Tekken boss Katsuhiro Harada. Last summer, Harada became morbidly curious about the diner chain, asking his followers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-director-harada-wants-the-lore-behind-waffle-house-fights/1100-6523937/" data-ref-id="1100-6523937">what the deal was with these brawls</a> and the culture behind it. He tried to get an official collaboration going, similar to other past collabs with New Japan Pro Wrestling and The Walking Dead, but that doesn't seem to be on the table.</p><p>Harada took to <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1922122520406458818" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>, updating his fans and followers on the situation and confirmed Waffle House has not returned his calls, but he is trying to think of a way around it.</p>

<p>"To be honest, within the bounds of what I can say, I fully understand your (you guys) request--that's precisely why I had considered taking on this challenge," Harada wrote. "In fact, I had already been thinking about it quite a while ago. Over the past year or more, I've actually tried to make contact through several different channels. However, and this is purely my own speculation, I suspect that the lack of response may be due to the fact that the project I'm known for revolves around fighting-themed video games. By the way, no response = very rare case."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1922113179674345512" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">If we can't get that “House” name license, how about we call it “Hustle House” stage?<br>Doesn't that make sense to everyone? <a href="https://t.co/OLJeLshGet" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/OLJeLshGet</a></p>  — Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1922113179674345512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>He did mention that maybe an homage or parody might be the best solution. "If using a different name or format is acceptable as long as the core message is maintained, then I would be willing to seriously reconsider and explore this again." He had tossed around the name Hustle House, which seemed to catch on with his fans.</p><p>Since Waffle House seems out of reach, Season 2 of Tekken 8 already had some collabs coming with Pac-Man and Karate Kid Legends, along with much-needed balance adjustments.</p>

            <p>
It's all go on the Illuminate front in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, with the co-op sci-fi shooter's powerful third faction having now set a course for Super Earth - and it's bringing "new terrors" along too.
</p>
<p>
All this arrives as part of Helldivers 2's latest update which - in lore terms at least - sees the squid-like Iluminate emerging from the Meridian singularity in order to bring the never-ending fight for Democracy to Super Earth itself.
</p>
<p>
In more specific terms, that means a wave of brand-new Illuminate enemies. There's the Stingray - jetfighters that unleash devastating strafing runs from above - and the Crescent Overseer, which "has the ability to lay barrages on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> in cover".

<p>
Worse still are the Fleshmob; failed Illuminate experiments assembled from Voteless parts and let loose on the battlefield. Developer Arrowhead is also teasing "even larger ships", but is leaving players to discover these on their own.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Arrowhead has introduced a new load-out customisation  feature it says will work with "the bulk of" Helldivers 2's weapon offerings. "Most primary weapons now have levels that are achievable by completing missions," it <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/?sf277258176=1">explains on the PlayStation Blog</a>, "which then in turn unlock new attachments obtainable through Requisition."
</p>
<p>
Players can also unlock patterns and apply them to their weapons, and a variety of patterns tied to previous Warbonds - specifically Viper Commandos, Freedom's Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds - will be made available on 15th May. That's the same day the new Masters of Ceremony Warbond arrives.
</p>
<p>
And finally for Helldivers 2's latest update, item rotation has been removed from the Superstore, meaning players can purchase any item they want anytime they want, no waiting required. It launches today on PS5 and PC.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has a distinctive French style from its Montpellier-based developer Sandfall Interactive, but originally it was very different.</p>
<p>Fans have uncovered a trailer from an early version of the game <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RecordThisForFree/comments/g5a6e8/game_ambitious_aa_game_project_looking_for_3/">posted on reddit</a> by director Guillaume Broche in a bid to find voice actors. The post, from five years ago, describes the project as an "ambitious AA game" and "3D modern take on the JRPG genre with western style characters". It had a planned release on PC and "possibly" PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>The post includes a link to a draft trailer that's since been shared elsewhere. The game was originally called We Lost, and shows a steampunk town, fantastical boss battles, and even a sci-fi section.</p>

<p>It's likely much of the trailer is using placeholder assets, but it at least gives a glimpse into the development process. What's more, turn-based battles seem to have always been part of the project, as do the names of characters Lune and Maelle.</p>
<p>Further, lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen has detailed how the game's setting was completely different in its early phases.</p>
<p>"The gameplay would have been similar," she told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-writer-reveals-game-almost-had-zombies/">The Gamer</a>, "but the story was completely different. It was set in a steampunk Victorian England with zombies, aliens, and various things."</p>
<p>A call with potential investors inspired Broche to "think bigger", Svedberg-Yen added, which prompted a complete re-think of the narrative. It was ultimately inspired by a painting Broche admired and a short story Svedberg-Yen was working on, which revolved around an artist entering her own canvases.</p>

			<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has been delayed, developer Skydance Games has announced, with the game now aiming to arrive sometime in <strong>early 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>A couple of months prior to this announcement, Black Panther voice actor Khary Payton <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-the-hydra-could-launch-this-holiday-says-voice-actor/">suggested</a> that the game would be arriving this coming holiday season. Well, clearly, plans changed compared to what Payton was last told, as Skydance says the decision to delay the game was made to give the team more time to "<em>add more polish</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will now be launching in early 2026</em>," developer Skydance Games began in its short statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">X</a>. "<em>Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision. We have some exciting things in store and look forward to sharing more soon!</em>"</p>
<p>Published by <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-to-be-published-by-plaion/">Plaion</a> and developed by a team at Skydance Games led by the legendary Amy Hennig, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has a lot of strong potential. The few trailers <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/">we've seen</a> depict a pretty impressive-looking game and a story that could be one of the better tales we've gotten from anything Marvel in recent years.</p>
<p>It would be nice to see some gameplay by now, though, as we've all been waiting since <a href="https://wccftech.com/captain-america-black-panther-wwii-amy-hennig-confirmed/">2022</a> to see this game come to fruition. And with <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-comes-to-los-angeles-again-from-june-6-9/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> right around the corner, there's always a chance we're not too far off from getting that first gameplay look.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-set-to-air-in-december.1188006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-december<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>streaming show has been renewed for a third season, and we now know roughly when the second season will be airing as well.</p>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/fallout-season-2-season-3-prime-video" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Amazon says that&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>season two will air in December, although the streaming giant stops short of announcing exactly when we can expect the show to land during that month.</p>

<p>As Amazon itself points out,&nbsp;confirmation of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>season three "comes well in advance of the show's second season", so it's clear that the company is putting a lot of eggs into its&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>basket. Still, given the show's popularity, that isn't too surprising.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-season-3-confirmed-brotherhood.jpg?itok=nlX1ZVAo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-season-3-confirmed-brotherhood.jpg?itok=Y6wav9A3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>show will be returning for a third season, Amazon has confirmed.</figcaption></figure><p>The first season of the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-amazon-prime-tv-show-premiere-date-officially-revealed-it-will-be-canon" rel="nofollow">began airing in April last year</a>, and it quickly found an audience, becoming Amazon Prime Video's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-prime-video-100-million-viewers" rel="nofollow">second show to hit 100 million viewers</a>. In case you're wondering what the first show was, that honor obviously goes to&nbsp;<em>The Rings of Power</em>.</p>

<p>The show follows former Vault 33 resident Lucy, who leaves her home in search of her father. As she wanders the wasteland, she meets the likes of Walton Goggins' gunslinger The Ghoul, New California Republic commander Lee Moldaver, and Brotherhood of Steel squire Maximus.</p>

<p>While the first season takes place in Los Angeles and its surroundings, the second will take Lucy to New Vegas, following on from the first season's finale (which I won't be discussing here for fear of spoilers).</p>

<p>Amazon hasn't revealed too much about the story for the second season and whether we can expect it to mirror its video game namesake, but we'll likely get more info about&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>season two in the coming months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-season-3-confirmed-new-vegas.jpg?itok=UGao1R4i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-season-3-confirmed-new-vegas.jpg?itok=dWDGu8Kf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fallout</em>'s second season will take viewers to New Vegas.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also not clear where&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>'s third season will take place, although it'll likely be a while before we learn that given that the second season won't air for another seven months or so.</p>

<p>In any case, the second season of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>airs this December. There's still no word yet on whether Bethesda will be developing a new game in the series anytime soon, but if I was Todd Howard, I'd be thinking about capitalizing on the show's success. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Earlier this year the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Black Panther</a>(‘s voice actor) suggested that Skydance New Media’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise Of Hydra</a> would release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydras-release-may-fall-in-christmas-2025-according-to-the-black-panther">in Christmas 2025</a>. We all slept a little easier that night, knowing that King T'Chanda himself had all but rubber-stamped the WW2 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a>’s launch window. Well, it turns out the Black Panther was lying to us. Skydance have just announced that it’ll now release in early 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">this TwiX post</a>, it’s all for the sake of adding Polish localisation. Sorry, I meant for polishing. Terrible joke, terrible joke, but I regret nothing and I'd do it again, I tell you. “Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision,” the post explains.</p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise Of Hydra was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uncharted-directors-black-panther-and-captain-america-game-revealed-as-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-out-2025">formally announced</a> in March 2024, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uncharted-directors-new-studio-are-making-a-marvel-game">appears to have been in the works since 2021</a>. Directed by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> and Uncharted shot-caller Amy Hennig, it follows Captain “Steve Rogers” America and Black Panther through occupied Paris, and introduces a couple of original characters, “Howling Commandos” squaddie Gabriel Jones and Wakandan secret agent Nanali, all four of whom are playable at points in the story. Nope, there's no co-op multiplayer.</p>
<p>You can expect much shield-lobbing and jaw-clubbing, a conspiracy or two, and some clashes between superheroes. Also probably a lot of banter as Cap and Panther pander to fans or punch Panzers. If it handles anything like Uncharted, I imagine it would have made a fair Xmas play. Alas.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 – Official System Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"Nintendo Switch 2 is priced relatively high compared to Nintendo Switch, so we recognize that there are corresponding challenges to early adoption," said Furukawa. "That being said, Nintendo Switch 2 can play compatible Nintendo Switch software, so there is continuity between the platforms. We are taking steps like bundling software with the hardware to accelerate adoption in the first fiscal year, aiming to get off to the same start we did with Nintendo Switch."</p><p dir="ltr">Furukawa seemed to dismiss the idea that production or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">the US tariff situation</a> factored into the numbers. Instead, the Nintendo president continued stressing Switch 2's price point as well knowing "it will not be easy to keep that momentum [with hardware sales] going over the long term through the holiday season and beyond."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-scammers-are-convincing-people-they-won-the-nintendo-lottery-in-japan/1100-6531112/">Switch 2 preorders are off to a hot start</a>, and they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">sold out almost immediately in the US</a> last month. Nintendo is launching Switch 2 on June 5, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/">Mario Kart World</a> releasing alongside the system.</p>

The Doom Slayer is instantly recognizable thanks to his hulking physique and signature battlesuit, which has been tweaked once again to match the medieval themes of the new Doom game. But what would that armor look like in real life? Very cool, and <em>very </em>cumbersome for the person inside it. But mostly cool.</p><p>YouTuber Emily the Engineer--who specializes in 3D prints and builds on her channel--was tasked with bringing the Doom Slayer's armor to life by Bethesda, as the company sent her the official game-model files to use for this ambitious project. What followed was a Herculean effort to get the files ready for 3D-printing, a mind-numbing amount of sanding, painting, and figuring out how to fit into a suit of armor that looked like it was designed for Reacher actor Alan Ritchson to wear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3tt0BRPmKk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p3tt0BRPmKk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The end result is still impressive, even if moving around in the costume is a bit on the cumbersome side because of the sheer number of armor pieces here. The final build is quite intimidating, and if you had something like this on display in your home, it would make for an instant neck-turner.</p><p>While most of us don't have access to a small army of 3D printers, you can pick up an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/become-the-doom-slayer-with-this-replica-doom-the-dark-ages-helmet/1100-6530251/">official Doom Slayer replica helmet</a>. Priced at $175, it features LED light effects, an adjustable strap, and it looks like it was ripped straight from the game. It also comes with a Doom keycard replica and three woven patches as extras.</p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages launches on May 15--or right now if you preordered the Premium or Collector's Editions for 48-hour early access--for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Bethesda and Microsoft have dialed up the marketing for the game to celebrate its release, with other promotions focused on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-wireless-controller-game-bundle-deals-amazon-walmart/1100-6530902/">official Doom controllers</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-custom-doom-harley-is-a-sight-to-behold/1100-6531325/">very cool custom Doom Harley Davidson motorcycle</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/order-this-doom-the-dark-ages-pizza-get-in-game-skin-and-a-game-pass-trial/1100-6531453/">Doom-inspired pizza</a> that comes with several digital goodies.</p>

It’s available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC and is free for existing owners of the original game on those platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Originally developed in Unreal Engine 4, the remastered version of The Sinking City has been fully relit in Unreal Engine 5 with 4K textures, improved reflections, support for PC features like DLSS and FSR upscaling, a new Photo Mode, and more. It also features “enhanced locations with additional levels of detail and objects,” according to a press release from Frogware. Check out The Sinking City Remastered launch trailer below for a comparison between the original game and this new version.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NEoQxVMzBEg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NEoQxVMzBEg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“We plan to do big things with The Sinking City IP, starting with the sequel and then beyond,” Frogwares publishing director Sergiy Oganesyan writes in a press release. “So, after our rather well-known struggles with the original, it feels amazing to have this positive moment be part of the game’s twisted history and for us to be the ones to fully decide it. Making it free to all our existing fans is our way of giving back to them for having supported us all this time through thick and thin.”&nbsp;</p><p>Frogwares announced that it was working on The Sinking City Remastered back in March, but it didn’t indicate when it would be released. It made this announcement alongside news of a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2">Kickstarter campaign</a> to help fund the development of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a>. That campaign ended in April, raising roughly $627,000, 450% above Frogware’s initial Kickstarter goal.&nbsp;</p><p>For more about Frogwares, read our original <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-sinking-city/macabre-tales-and-mediocre-gameplay">review of The Sinking City</a> and about how <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/19/ukrainian-developer-frogwares-reveals-new-game-calls-it-clear-middle-finger-to-russian">the company’s next game is a “clear middle finger” to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Revealed to a live audience at PAX East 2025 in Boston over the weekend, the trailer features a new look at gameplay and a quick glimpse at a boss fight against an armored Omen Beast bear named Bromius.&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer also showcases the game’s combat, with clips of sword-based gameplay and Soulframe’s magick system. Unlike the ultra-fast combat of Warframe, which is not a part of the Soulframe universe despite a similar name, Soulframe slows things down a bit for a more deliberate action experience. Check it out for yourself in the new Soulframe trailer below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mLydrgmH4g"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mLydrgmH4g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Digital Extremes plans to release Soulframe in 2025 on PC. It is currently in pre-alpha and select people have been able to play it. If you anticipate playing Soulframe when it launches, you can reserve your envoy name on the game’s <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en">website</a> today.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting for the launch of Soulframe, check out <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/warframe/b/playstation4/archive/2013/11/25/warframe-review-game-informer.aspx"><em>Game Informer’s</em> review of Warframe</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
