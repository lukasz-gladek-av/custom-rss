			<p>Sandfall Interactive's debut game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, is undoubtedly one of the defining games for 2025. Not only is it one of the most beloved titles of the year and the heavy favourite to win Game of the Year at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a> this evening (<a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">especially after it swept the Golden Joysticks</a>), it's one of the greatest success stories this year of an independent team made up of former Ubisoft developers coming together to prove, at least to themselves, that they could make the game they wanted to make, and that it would resonate with players.</p>



<p>Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html?searchResultPosition=1">The New York Times</a> (spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3m7ps6x4vgk2h">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>) reveals that's not all the studio wanted to prove. According to the report, not only did Sandfall Interactive keep the cost of Clair Obscur's development under $10 million, but it did so to prove that it didn't need to spend a crazy amount of money on a game to make something incredible.</p>



<p>"<em>Sandfall wanted to prove that indie studios were capable of making prestige games at a fraction of the budget and personnel of larger studios</em>," the report reads.</p>







<p>Now, you're probably thinking that there have been countless indies before Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 that proved you could make a top-tier game at a fraction of the budget that major publishers like Activision pour into Call of Duty every year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">and still they can't seem to get it right</a>.</p>



<p>Several games in the last two years alone proved you don't need to spend a ton of money to make something that captivates the entire industry, see Hollow Knight Silksong, Animal Well, Blue Prince, Hades 2, etc. But those games, and many like them, don't include big-name voice actors behind their characters, let alone big-name Hollywood actors. They don't include the kind of cinematic triumphs included in Clair Obscur, and they don't reach the level of triple-A polish that we're more accustomed to seeing from the likes of Rockstar, Sucker Punch, Naughty Dog, Activision, Obsidian, and more.</p>



<p>It is incredibly impressive that Sandfall was able to accomplish what it did with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and it feels more than deserving of the accolades it has been given since it launched earlier this year. Tonight, it has the chance to add to its list of accolades, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">with its record-setting 12 nominations at The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>



<p>When Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 launched in April this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo gave it a 9.5/10 in his review, writing</a>, "<em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em>"</p>

            <p>"This game makes an expression that is impossible in reality," reads the blurb which pops up when you go to play DriveCrazy's demo. "Because it is dangerous to drive like this in real life, never imitate." "Ah," I yell as I race a kei truck down the side of a building while missiles and lava lurk in my vicinity, "I see what you mean."</p>
<p>Prompting me to give TubezGames' small lorry game a go was the fact it's just emerged from early access, having been in the oven since July 2023. Now, though, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1556010/view/565894691447373826?l=english">hit 1.0</a>, and I'm seriously considering seeing what the rest of its now-complete story has to offer.</p>

<p>The demo begins in normal enough fashion. There's a kei truck rally on, so you've got to blast your little lorry down a bunch of narrow lanes and trails in a fashion that'd make Colin McRae proud. You're rewarded technique points for clean driving, but the game also doesn't seem to mind too much if you bulldoze a few hedges or barriers without taking damage.</p><p>Then, the stage ends. As the camera fades, you see a mysterious saucer float across the sky. The next thing you  know, you're fleeing for your life through the streets of a city collapsing as aliens invade. No matter. Your truck has so much grip that it feels glued to the road, which helps in evading the missiles which menacingly float after you, the orbital strikes which attempt to get you in their sights, and the falling skyscrapers which lurch forwards across the streets.</p>
<p>Then, you turn a corner and the road's full of lava. Pants. Time to wall-ride, the game says. While your truck can take a bit of convincing to hop onto the vertical axis if you're not running at top speed, once you're racing along the windows you can nimbly jump from one side of the street to the other, skipping any gaps in the façade. It's a Fast and Furious-worthy stunt chase, but with a ride that wouldn't look out of place delivering sushi or pizza through Tokyo's backstreets.</p>
<p>In truth, I'm not sure if the level of stuntage can be taken high enough to sustain a whole game's worth of the adrenaline rush which powers the two demo levels. Then again, the Steam page mentions a battle with a giant bear and the spoiler tag in the 1.0 release notes mention, er, a large fish. So, maybe I'm fussing about nothing.</p>
<p>If you fancy finding out for yourself, you can check out DriveCrazy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1556010/DriveCrazy/">Steam</a>. At only £6, it's slightly cheaper now then it will be once its 20% launch discount expires on Christmas day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-adds-another-mini-drone-deal-to-amazons-year-end-clearance-as-the-flip-rc-n3-crashes-to-its-lowest-price-2000652303</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you like sharing your adventures with the world and are ready to go beyond what your smartphone or a traditional camera can shoot, you need a high-quality drone camera in your setup. These don’t come cheap, but Amazon is making it easier than ever to pick one right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6348/">The DJI Flip (RC-N3) drone with a 4K camera, which usually sits at $439, is currently going for just $349 at the retailer.</a> That’s after a nice, and quite rare, 21% drop. This is also the lowest we have seen this drone drop to in a long while. The deal is open to all shoppers, but it wraps up soon. We recommend getting your orders in sooner, before that happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6348/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dynamic Angles, Six Shooting Modes</h2>
<p>Don’t let the look overwhelm you. At just under 249 g, it’s a lightweight drone that doesn’t need FAA registration or Remote ID in America. It’s convenient to travel with, and much easier than most models on the market to use. You can choose between multiple shooting modes for different types of adventures. Getting started couldn’t be simpler; just unfold the arms of the drone, select your desired shooting mode, and send it off.</p>
<p>The foldable propeller guard offers ultra-reliable close-up coverage for when you want to take a detailed look at something, while subject tracking keeps you the center of attention, always. Flip offers MasterShots and six Quickshot modes that deliver simplified cinematic footage for dynamic angles. The modes include Drone, Circle, Rocket, Spotlight, Helix, and Boomerang. Maybe go for the circle mode when you’re trying to capture your furry friend, and the Helix mode during some early morning outdoor walks! Stabilization comes from the 3-axis mechanical gimbal, plus up to level-5 wind resistance. These come together to provide smooth footage, even in chaotic, windy environments.</p>



<p>Picture quality is stunning, thanks to the large 1/1.3-inch CMOS sensor that’s capable of capturing more light for clearer images with vivid detail. Similarly, 4K/60fps HDR gets you breathtaking videos where every little detail is taken care of. The drone also supports vertical crops at 2.7k resolution; great for sharing your adventures on social media instantly. Even better, the dedicated app comes with beautification features that edit the shots on its own when exporting the footage. What’s more, the camera records audio with noise reduction via your phone. It does a good job of focusing on your audio while cutting out background distractions, but for an even better experience, it’s best to pair the drone with a DJI mic (sold separately).</p>
<p>You’ll also enjoy up to 44000 feet/13 km of 1080/60fps video transmission. Pair that with a battery that lasts up to 31 minutes on a single charge, and explore far-off areas without a worry. The DJI Fly app makes managing the drone easy, and also supports voice control for when you’re not in the mood to tweak settings manually. Just say something like “Hey Fly, follow me” or “Hey Fly, start recording”, to begin. The box includes the DJI Flip, DJI RC-N3 remote controller, one Intelligent Flight Battery, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6348/">This deal brings the price of this top-rated drone camera down to $349, making the upgrade quite affordable.</a> You might also be able to enjoy free delivery with your purchase if you order today.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/disney-open-ai-sora-deal-star-wars-frozen-2000652583</link>
            <guid>1379758</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The Walt Disney Company and tech bro Sam Altman’s OpenAI have signed a massive deal that will allow users to create AI slop videos centered around their favorite Disney characters starting early next year.</span></p> <p><span>News of the $1 billion deal (h/t </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-openai-deal-200-characters-to-sora-video-invests-1-billion-1236606401/"><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>) comes just days after Altman was on Jimmy Fallon’s </span><i><span>The Tonight Show</span></i><span>, claiming that AI could help people raise their kids. According to the rather fluffy </span><i><span>Variety</span></i><span> report, the deal makes Disney the “first major licensing partner on Sora,” which is OpenAI’s generative AI video platform. Users will be able to make videos featuring more than 200 characters across Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and </span><i><span>Star Wars, </span></i><span>and a variety of “costumes, props, vehicles, and iconic environments” that they can then share on social media.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Importantly, the deal </span><span>does not</span><span> include “talent likenesses or voices,” so you won’t be seeing a mostly accurate Harrison Ford building a snowman with </span><i><span>Frozen</span></i><span>’s Elsa, or whatever weird digital amalgamation Disney adults decide to type into the slop machine. </span></p>

 <p><span>Characters people </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> use in their <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-energy-demands-water-impact-internet-hyper-consumption-era/">quest to rob the planet of water</a> include:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ariel from </span><i><span>The Little Mermaid</span></i></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Belle from </span><i><span>Beauty and the Beast</span></i></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Cinderella</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Mickey Mouse</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Minnie Mouse</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Baymax from </span><i><span>Big Hero 6</span></i></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Simba and Mufasa from </span><i><span>The Lion King</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Black Panther</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Captain America</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Deadpool</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Groot</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Iron Man</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Thor</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Thanos</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Importantly, the deal allows for “iconic animated or illustrated versions of Marvel and Lucasfilm characters,” so a cartoon version of Harrison Ford building a snowman with Elsa appears to be in the cards. </span></p>

 <p><span>It’s unclear what kinds of guardrails Disney (<a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-epic-fortnite-project-mickey-mouse-1851666530">notoriously protective over how its characters are used in media</a></span><span>) will put on Sora, which had to readjust back in October after users created videos of&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Altman grilling </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089"><span>and eating Pikachu</span></a><span>. Considering that the depravity and stupidity of AI knows no bounds, I expect Disney will be regretting this deal sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The corporate conjunction also means Disney will be folding OpenAI into its daily operations, including “deploying ChatGPT for its employees.” It’s unclear if that means AI-generated content will be in the next </span><i><span>Moana</span></i><span> film. Disney is investing $1 billion into Altman’s AI company, so it clearly wants to get its money’s worth.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Disney CEO Bob Iger rang the “AI is good” bell in an official statement, saying, “Technological innovation has continually shaped the evolution of entertainment, bringing with it new ways to create and share great stories with the world. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.”</span></p> <p><span>Today, </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-google-ai-copyright-infringement-cease-and-desist-letter-1236606429/"><span>Disney sent Google a cease-and-desist letter,</span></a><span> accusing the company of using AI to engage in copyright infringement on a “massive scale.” LOL. LMAO, even. </span></p>

    <div>
        
<p>Sandfall Interactive has revealed how much it cost to develop and release Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In a new profile piece for the New York Times, the developer of one of 2025’s biggest hits talked about the game’s development, the approach to creating the game, and more.</p>



<p>As part of that talk, Sandfall claims that Clair Obscur was built for less than $10 million.</p>







<p>In order to achieve that goal, the studio chose to not have the game be a true open-world title. They say that they decided to use other classic role-playing game (RPG) design choices such as having battles take place in specific “arenas” rather than out in the overworld and having the map be a “miniature version of the explorable realm”. </p>



<p>Since its launch in April, Clair Obscur has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. It’s also been up for numerous awards, including Game of the Year from shows like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/golden-joystick-awards-2025-all-award-winners/">Golden Joystick Awards</a>—which it won—and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>. </p>

<p>Rockstar Games is busy readying everyone for the arrival of GTA 6, but continues to work on GTA Online in the background, going as far as dropping a new gameplay feature to enrich the raucous online game further.</p>



<p>Each day feels longer than the last in the wait for Grand Theft Auto 6. Rockstar Games is busy developing and polishing one of the most anticipated games of all time. This doesn’t mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-players-can-get-free-500000-through-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online</a> is kicked to the curb, though, and if you look carefully enough, you might see the game has WORKED OUT something new for you.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-online-adds-gyms-amp-working-out">GTA Online Adds Gyms &amp; Working Out</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strong move. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The ability to work out and visit gyms in GTA Online has been discovered ahead of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-reveal-trailer-is-already-two-years-old/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>‘s full launch.</p>







<p>GTA Online has continued to receive updates and improvements over the years, but this feels like quite a meaningful update so far into the game’s lifecycle.</p>



<p>As shown by <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown"></a><a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GTA 6 Countdown</a>, you can work on your Bench Press, stretch out on some yoga mats, do some curls, and other gym-related curricular activities. Always remember: Swole is the goal!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>YouTube creator NikTek has gone as far as speculating that this could be Rockstar Games testing out the incorporation of gym features for GTA 6. It’s not like this would be the first time we’ve ever seen these mechanics in a GTA game, as San Andreas famously used life-sim features such as hunger, weight gain, strength, and other biological attributes to influence your gameplay.<a href="https://x.com/NikTek"></a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What do you think Rockstar’s intentions with this addition are? Is it simply a fun new feature for GTA Online, or is it obvious foreshadowing for GTA 6?

                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been one of 2025's breakout success stories in gaming, and it was developed on a relatively small budget, apparently.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html?searchResultPosition=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times reports</a> that the budget was "less than $10 million," crediting the information to developer Sandfall. The report added that the team "conserved resources" by purposefully avoiding an open-world setup in favor of making Expedition 33 a turn-based game.</p><p>Sandfall's Guillaume Broche said Sandfall now has the right technology to "make those games with a relatively small team," and he hopes to see more like it from other studios.</p><p>"Games like this are coming. We are lucky to be early," he said.</p><p>Broche did not elaborate as to what technology specifically he was referring to as it relates to being able to embrace new systems to build games on a smaller budget. GameSpot has contacted Sandfall for further details on Expedition 33's budget.</p><p>Independent developer Billy Basso, who made Animal Well, said he hopes to see "more straightforward games" in the future. "You don't need to fill your game with hundreds of hours of checklist content," Basso said.</p><p>Expedition 33 was also notable for its relatively lower price point, as the game sells for $50 instead of the $70 or more that many other games ask. Some industry-watchers have theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">AAA games are becoming unsustainable</a> due in part to their larger budgets, and in turn, the requirement that they sell lots of copies to make their money back.</p><p>Expedition 33 was developed by a "core team" of about 30 people, the report said, with battle animations outsourced to a studio in Korea. Sandfall also worked with other external teams on things like marketing and localization. The game's credits list <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/241065/clair-obscur-expedition-33/credits/windows/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hundreds of people</a> who worked on the game, and this has led some to question if the game should have received a nomination for "Best Independent Game" game at The Game Awards. <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Previous estimates</a> suggested the game's budget was as much as $25 million.</p><p>The game has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-getting-a-free-update-with-new-boss-battles/1100-6535296/" data-ref-id="1100-6535296">sold more than 5 million copies</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-breaks-game-pass-records/1100-6536666/" data-ref-id="1100-6536666">broke Xbox Game Pass records.</a> It's nominated for 12 awards at The Game Awards, including overall Game of the Year, and that's the most nominations for any game in the show's history.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6536768/" data-ref-id="1100-6536768">how to watch and what to expect from The Game Awards.</a></p>

                <p>Just one day after Bethesda released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-is-now-on-yet-another-platform-but-theres-a-way-to-upgrade-for-free/1100-6536793/" data-ref-id="1100-6536793">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the publisher admitted the new version has performance problems. Players called the port a "disaster," and many more reported major input lag and a locked 30 frames per second.</p><p>Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1piegpl/input_delay_on_skyrim_switch_2_edition_is_terrible/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-investigating-skyrim-switch-2-performance-issues-as-fans-brand-latest-port-a-disaster" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, the details of the lag became apparent when someone posted the delay between moving the Joy-Con stick and his character reacting in the game. "There's like a whole second between me flicking the stick and my character moving its head." </p><p>The discussion evolved into comparing Skyrim's Switch 2 version to Cyberpunk 2077, which runs at 40 frames per second on the same hardware while showing more detailed worlds. Another common complaint is the game's size: Skyrim takes up 53GB of the Switch 2's limited internal storage, even though it uses only 25GB on PC. For many fans, this raised questions about how the port was handled.</p><p>On Bethesda's official support site, the company <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/57181" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a mouthful of a question</a> titled "Why am I experiencing frame rate issues with The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim following the Anniversary Edition update on Nintendo Switch?" Bethesda responded by saying it is investigating the situation, but has not found solutions as of yet.</p><p>"We are investigating reports of performance issues on Nintendo Switch with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim after the Anniversary Edition update," and told players to subscribe to the article for updates. "In addition, you can provide feedback and information regarding on this topic via the <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/home/product/373/skyrimcat/287" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Feedback form</a>."</p><p>The Anniversary Edition is priced at $60, and players who own the older Switch version can pay $20 to upgrade and use it on both consoles. The edition includes the base game and the expansions Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and Hearthfire, along with improvements on Switch 2 such as enhanced resolution, faster loading, performance boosts, Joy-Con 2 mouse support, motion controls, Amiibo support, and other upgrades.</p>

<p>Remember, outside of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Dread</a>, Metroid has historically not sold well in Japan, so we're not entirely shocked to see Beyond appear so low.

<p>The hardware charts have seen a big boom for Switch across the board. The Switch 2 shifted a whopping 200,000+ units last week, pushing its total up past the 3 million mark, and the Switch OLED and Lite models comfortably took second and third place.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this means that combining the SKUs for the Switch and PS5 systems leans things firmly in Nintendo's favour. The standard, Lite and OLED models came together for 51,316, while the three PS5 options combined for 25,240.</p>

		<p>Moi Rai Games has released a major quality of life update for roguelike monster battler RPG Aethermancer. This new update, which is update 0.5.0.8, adds the new monster Ravager, a Combat Inspect feature, and the ability to redistribute equipment among monsters. Ravager’s addition brings new moves and traits to use, so players can experiment with party builds some more. The Combat Inspect feature can be used at any time in battle so you can see exactly what buffs, debuffs, and conditions are active at any time. You can read the full patch notes below.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Balancing Changes (Monster)</span><wbr></p>
<p>The balancing changes for this update are rather conservative, since the last set of balancing changes was rather recent. We mostly tried to target monsters, types, and skills that have been overperforming or underperforming for a long time.</p>
<p><wbr><b>Medusa</b><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Adjusted the Signature Trait to trigger for every 5 debuffs cleansed (from 6) and deal 1 x 5 damage (from 1 x 6)<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Naga</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted the Signature Trait (unshifted) to deal 2 x 4 damage (instead of 2 x 2)<wbr></li>
<li>Increased 2nd Worthiness Perk (unshifted + shifted) to Shield Generator +3 (from +2)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Djinn</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>3rd Worthiness perk (unshifted + shifted) increased to Evasion +20% (from 15%)<wbr></li>
<li>Shifted Djnn’s health reduced to 30 (from 35); matching the unshifted value<wbr></li>
<li>Signature Trait (unshifted) was adjusted to grant +35% Crit Chance (form +30% Crit Chance)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Balancing Changes (Types)</span><wbr></p>
<p><b>Critical</b><wbr></p>
<p>We decided to give a soft rework to the Critical type with this update. We removed the few skills that apply Force (instead moving them to the Force type). To make up for that, Critical now has easy access to skills that apply Bleed stacks. Bleed stacks open up more potential for synergies for the Critical type itself, as well as for Maverick skills with other types. We think this is a more interesting direction for the Critical type and also helps to distinguish the Critical type from the Force type. We also made some further buffs and reworked some non-aura skills into auras. Please also take note of the new skills we added to support this rework (listed above)!<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Generate Force (Action): Only available to Force Type now.<wbr></li>
<li>Precision Meteor (Action): Only available to Force Type now.<wbr></li>
<li>Fire Blast (Action): Crit Chance increased to +30% (from +25%)<wbr></li>
<li>Stone Edge (Action): Damage reduced to 3 x 8 (from 3 x 9). Added: “On Crit: Applies 1 Bleed.”<wbr></li>
<li>Critical Bleed (Maverick Trait): Changed into a regular Critical Trait (no longer requires Affliction type in the party, is no longer a Maverick Trait)<wbr></li>
<li>Cruelty (Trait): Reworked into a Force + Power Maverick Trait: “At the start of combat, and whenever an enemy is staggered: Applies&nbsp;<b>1</b>&nbsp;Force and&nbsp;<b>2</b>&nbsp;temporary Power to self.”<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Old effect (as a regular Critical Trait): “Crit Damage +3. At the start of combat, and whenever an enemy is staggered: Applies&nbsp;<b>1</b>&nbsp;Force to self.”<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Critical Hybridization (Trait): Reworked into an aura: “Aura: On Crit from an ally: Deals an extra hit with 3 Wild damage. Triggers once per action.”<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Old effect: “On Crit: Deals an extra hit with 3 Wild damage. Triggers once per action.”<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assault Shield (Maverick Trait): Reworked into an aura: “On Crit from an ally: Shields them for 3.”<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Old effect: “On Crit: Applies 3 Shield to the ally with the lowest amount of Shield.”<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sidecrits (Maverick Trait): Now also applies 1 Bleed: “This monster’s Sidekick Attack is always critical and applies 1 Bleed.”<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Old effect: “This monster’s Sidekick Attack is always critical.”<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Force</b><wbr></p>
<p>Apart from the Critical rework, the most drastic set of changes are aimed at the Force type, which has been underperforming for a long time. These changes are meant to help promote the intended Force strategy of using Support Actions to build up Force stacks.<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Petal Shield (Action): Force stacks applied increased to 2 (from 1)<wbr></li>
<li>Air Shield (Action): Force stacks applied increased to 3 (from 2), but Shielding per Force stack reduced to 2 (from 3)<wbr></li>
<li>Precision Meteor (Action): Damage increased to 1 x 18 (from 1 x 15)<wbr></li>
<li>Into the Fray (Trait): Adjusted to apply 1 Force to each ally (instead of applying 1 Force to target ally and 1 Force to self)<wbr></li>
<li>Reinforce (Trait): Reduced the healing to 3 (from 5) and increased the Force applied to 2 (from 1)<wbr></li>
<li>Fierce Summoning (Maverick Trait): Also Shields the attached monster for 3 when it triggers<wbr></li>
<li>Massive Damage (Maverick Trait): Health required per +1 Crit Damage adjusted to 15 (from 20)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Burn</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Burn Hit” equipment affixes were buffed: regular affix was buffed to +12% (from +10%) and rare affix was buffed to +20% (from +15%)<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Terror</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Bone Chill (Action): Terror stacks applied increased to 5 (from 4)<wbr></li>
<li>Panic (Trait): Terror stacks applied increased to 6 (from 5)<wbr></li>
<li>Nighmare (Trait): The damage hits now ignore retaliates<wbr></li>
<li>Dark Exchange (Maverick Trait): Debuffs cleansed (and transferred) increased to 4 (from 3)<wbr></li>
<li>Frightful Lightning: Applies 3 Terror to each enemy (instead of 3 Terror to each other enemy)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Summon</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>New equipment affix: “Essence Summoning +1” (Minions summoned by this monster gain +1 Essence). Requires “Summon” type in the party to be obtained.<wbr></li>
<li>Protective Servitude (Trait): Increased healing and shielding to 6 (from 5)<wbr></li>
<li>Summon Mastery (Trait): Increased Minion Damage to +2 (from +1). Removed the aura tag.<wbr></li>
<li>Impactful Summoning (Trait): Increased the damage to 4 (from 3)<wbr></li>
<li>Totem Summons: Changed to apply 4 heal + 4 shield (instead of only doing 6 shield)<wbr></li>
<li>Faun: Heal changed to 2 x 3 (from 3x 2) (This was always meant to be 2 x 3, but was set up wrongly)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Purge</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Shock (Trait): Damage reduced to 6 (from 7)<wbr></li>
<li>Split Aether (Maverick Trait): Damage reduced to 6 (from 7)<wbr></li>
<li>Wildflower Harvest (Maverick Action): Damage reduced to 3 x 4 (from 3 x 5)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Weakness</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Hexing Strikes (Trait): No longer has Weakness Reduction +1<wbr></li>
<li>Warlock Party (Trait): Now also has Weakness Reduction +1, but only applies 1 Weakness to the enemy with the lowest amount of Weakness (instead of 2 Weakness distributed to up to 2 enemies with the lowest amount of Weakness)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Dodge</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eye of the Storm: Required damage adjusted to 35 (from 30)<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Bug Fixes</span><wbr></p>

            <title><![CDATA[You Won’t Believe How Cheap It Was To Make Clair Obscur: Expedition 33]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-cost-goty-sandfall-2000652590</link>
            <guid>1379710</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Much has been said about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> success and the business calls that made it an unexpected frontrunner in the 2025 Game of the Year race. Now we’ve learned that the game was somehow made for less than $10 million.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html"><i><span>The New York Times</span></i></a><span>, Sandfall Interactive co-founder and CEO Guillaume Broche said that </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s budget was a tiny fraction of your average AAA game, coming out to “less than $10 million.” To put that into perspective, Insomniac’s </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2 </span></i><span>cost around </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233"><span>$300 million</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> managed to avoid those ballooning budgets by aiming for a much smaller scale and refusing to chase the modern open-world bloat that has some games costing huge fortunes and taking half a decade to make.</span></p>

 <p><span>As Broche lays out, Sandfall made a string of creative decisions that would allow the studio to create a lot with fewer resources, a smaller team, and a reasonable budget. One major example is how the game’s overworld is a miniature recreation of a map, rather than a full-blown open-world space. This allowed the devs to present an explorable universe to players without having to create something on the scale of open-world games that show off every detail as players walk through it.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sandfall </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070"><span>is an independent studio</span></a><span>, but much of </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>‘s funding came from publisher Kepler Interactive, and some parts of development (including battle animations and localization) were outsourced. The result is that </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> manages to have all the polish of a prestige AAA game at a budget that a lot of other publishers would have you believe can’t possibly produce games of its quality.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s still a false narrative floating around the internet that </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people"><span>only 30 people</span></a><span> made Sandfall Interactive’s breakout debut RPG. While yes, the company itself may be smaller than your average studio, </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>was also </span><a href="https://vgbees.com/if-you-dont-count-everyone-else-all-devs-are-solo-devs/"><span>developed in collaboration with contractors</span></a><span>. The numbers don’t lie, though. When blockbuster development costs are ballooning,</span><i><span> Clair Obscur</span></i><span> proves you can make a hit that still looks and feels impressive without breaking the bank.</span></p>

 <p><span>It also, thankfully, is not a massive time sink. I rolled credits at around 30 hours, while most RPGs last at least twice as long. Broche told </span><i><span>The New York Times</span></i><span> he hopes </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>‘s success will help bring the cost of developing AAA games back to a more reasonable range.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We have the tech now to make those games with a relatively small team,” Broche said. “Games like this are coming. We are lucky to be early.”</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243"><span>The 2025 Game Awards</span></a><span> are tonight, and </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>has 13 nominations</span></a><span> across multiple categories, which is the most any game has earned in the event’s decade-long history.</span></p>

              <p data-start="168" data-end="915">Storage has become one of the most frustrating limitations of modern tech. No matter how much space manufacturers promise, it never feels like enough. Our phones eventually fill up with new photos and videos, our PCs balloon with game downloads and media files, and our gaming consoles never seem to have enough room for the next title we want to install. Because of this ongoing struggle, storage deals tend to be some of the best and most reliable purchases you can make. When SSDs, external drives, or microSD cards go on sale, it’s usually smart to grab one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6346/">Right now, the Samsung EVO Select line of memory cards is discounted by as much as 25%, making it a great time to upgrade your device’s storage without spending much.</a></p>
<p>Amazon has a handful of options at various capacities all on sale at the moment. The 64GB version of the Samsung EVO Select microSD is only&nbsp; $15 at the moment. But what’s this? So is the 128GB version. You can double the storage for no extra charge. Beyond that, the 256GB version is down to $23, and the full 1TB option has dropped from $93 to just $70.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6346/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Download More Game to Your Nintendo Switch</h2>
<p>For gamers in particular, especially those who own a Nintendo Switch, a microSD card is practically a necessity. The original Nintendo Switch model launched with only 32GB of internal storage, which disappears remarkably fast once you start downloading games. While Nintendo titles tend to be smaller than the enormous triple-A games common on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC—many of which exceed 100GB—Switch games can still add up quickly. For instance, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> weighs in at around 18.2GB, which is more than half of the system’s default storage all by itself. Add a couple more games and your space is gone in an instant.</p>
<p>That’s why ya gotta upgrade. With the Samsung EVO Select 1TB MicroSD card currently available for just $70, you can multiply your Switch storage many, many times over without needing to delete and redownload your favorite titles. 1TB gives you enough room to store a massive library of games, screenshots, captures, and save data, ensuring you’ll never need to stress about running out of space before a big download ever again.</p>



<p>However, if you’re playing on the Nintendo Switch 2, I hate to be the bearer of bad news. These particular microSD cards will not work with the latest Nintendo console. Nintendo’s next-generation console uses the newer microSD Express format, which offers significantly faster read and write speeds. Because of this difference, inserting a Samsung EVO Select MicroSD card into a Switch 2 will be met with nothing but an incompatibility message. Or maybe just nothing at all, I haven’t personally tested it.</p>
<p>The good news is that the EVO Select cards remain fully functional with the former lineup of Nintendo systems: the original Nintendo Switch, the Switch Lite, and the Switch OLED model.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the Samsung EVO Select series delivers read and write speeds up to 160MB/s. While that doesn’t meet the more demanding requirements of the Switch 2, it exceeds what’s needed for the original Switch family, which only recommends speeds up to 90MB/s. In practical terms, this means smooth loading times and reliable performance for everything you play. Unless you’re playing a&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>game because nothing can help those perform well.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PC RAM Now Costs More Than Some New Graphics Cards]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/</link>
            <guid>1379704</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The PC Ram pricing problem continues to get worse for consumers. What was once one of the cheaper parts when building a custom PC, buying RAM has gotten to the point where it’s more expensive than buying even a brand-new graphics card for some.</p>



<p>A few weeks back, Insider Gaming reported on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-prices-have-soared-by-up-to-250/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fact that RAM prices have risen</a> by up to 250%. Well, fast forward to mid-December, and those prices now look “affordable”. There have been increases in PC RAM prices by, on average, another 25% since November 26. Some have even gone up by another 50% or more if you were looking at picking up a 64GB pack. </p>







<p>That means modern day graphics cards like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series and AMD Radeon RX 9000 series are becoming cheaper in comparison. Need specific examples? A new ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5070 is available for $549.99 while a ASRock Radeon RX 9070 XT can be had for $599.99. Even an RTX 5070 Ti, which costs an average of $749.99, is cheaper than some 64GB packs, like the Corsair Vengeance. </p>



<p>Below you’ll find a comparison of prices from November 1 to November 26 to December 11. All of them have continued to rise, with reports suggesting that it’s not going to slow down. It’s even gotten to the point that traditional budget-friendly brands are being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/micron-shutting-down-its-consumer-crucial-ram-and-ssd-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completely shuttered</a> in order to focus on the needs of the big AI companies that are causing the problems. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>PC Memory</th><th>Nov. 1 Price</th><th>Nov. 26 Price</th><th>Dec. 11 Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>16GB Kingston Fury</td><td>$62.99</td><td>$149.99</td><td>$241.02</td></tr><tr><td>32GB T-Force</td><td>$96.99</td><td>$339.99</td><td>$429.99</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$97.99</td><td>$269.99</td><td>$349.99</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$104.99</td><td>$279.99</td><td>$439.99</td></tr><tr><td>64GB Corsair Vengeance</td><td>$239.99</td><td>$839.99</td><td>$899.99</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$629.99</td><td>$719.99</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$569.99</td><td>$669.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out to multiple manufacturers to discuss what consumers can do and if they are going to do anything to make sure they still have options when building a PC. As of publishing, however, no company has given answers.</p>

<p>Mega Evolutions are having a moment elsewhere in Pokémon too, thanks to their inclusion in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. Its DLC arrived yesterday, bringing spatial distortions to Lumiose City, on top of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-fan-favourite-pokemon-gets-a-new-mega-evolution-in-pokemon-legends-z-as-dlc-as-mewtwo-strikes-back">Mewtwo's recent appearance in the base game</a>.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, Pokémon TCG Pocket has a holiday-themed event starting on Christmas Day and running until 8th January, with various seasonal awards.</p>
<p>In addition, January will see a Mareep Drop Event, a fresh Wonder Pick Event, and a Mega Latios ex Drop Event.</p>

<figure data-uuid="ecd2498efbcc1"><a title="Tomb Raider" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ecd2498efbcc1/tomb-raider.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Core Design</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-game-awards-2025-time-date-and-how-to-watch">The Game Awards</a> is taking place later today (or early tomorrow depending on your timezone), but it seems that yet another major announcement has leaked ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/major-tomb-raider-announcement-leaks-ahead-of-the-game-awards">Eurogamer</a>, the cover art for a new Tomb Raider entry has cropped up online along with a handful of screenshots. Titled <strong>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</strong>, some are speculating that it might actually be (another) remake of the original game from 1996, which itself also dealt with Atlantis.</p>
<p>The cover art features an updated iteration of Lara Croft which seems to blend the original design with the more realistic take featured in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">2013 reboot</a> (which, by the way, recently saw a release on Switch and Switch 2).</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6uoirst&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>So if this is all legit – and it certainly seems to be – is it possible that this new entry could come to the Switch 2? It's hard to say at this stage, but it's a definite possibility. There's been a smattering of Tomb Raider titles on the Switch and Switch 2 in recent years, with the aforementioned Definitive Edition preceded by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_iv-vi_remastered">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_i-iii_remastered">Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</a> from Aspyr.</p>
<p>Remake or not, the screenshots certainly look pretty neat, so we'll have to wait until The Game Awards to see this thing in action. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is also due to receive a fresh new trailer at the event, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/leon-kennedy-is-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-via-psn-store-image">a new piece of key art</a> from the PSN store prematurely revealed the existence of veteran protagonist Leon Kennedy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today might be all about <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a>, but it's still another Thursday in a new week, which means another NVIDIA GeForce NOW Thursday is here, with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-monster-hunter-stories/">a new batch of games added to NVIDIA's cloud streaming service</a>. This week, seven titles enter the service for the first time, including two games from one franchise, and three games are added to the selection of titles that are RTX 5080-ready.</p>



<p>The two games from one franchise are Monster Hunter Stories and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin. Ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection arriving on March 13, 2026</a>, you'll now be able to play through the first two games using GeForce NOW.</p>



<p>Two other notable games joining the service this week are two new releases, Skate Story and Death Howl, both two of the more interesting indie games to arrive towards the end of the year.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining GeForce NOW for the first time this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Skate Story (December 8)</li>



<li>Dome Keeper (December 9)</li>



<li>Death Howl (December 9)</li>



<li>RuneQuest: Warlords (December 9)</li>



<li>Everdream Village (December 12)</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Stories</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin</li>
</ul>



<p>As far as the three games that are now RTX 5080-ready, it's a good week for 4X strategy players and city-sim building players, with the three games being Age of Wonders 4, Cities: Skylines, and Cities: Skylines 2.</p>



<p>Speaking of the RTX 5080 Blackwell servers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-adds-8-games-rtx-5080-servers-soon-to-be-live-worldwide/">they are still one region short of being available worldwide, according to the map of their initial rollout</a>. Stockholm has yet to be added, though it is expected to join the rest of the regions where RTX 5080 servers are already available "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>Lastly, a final mention for The Game Awards, you can play a majority of the nominated games through GeForce NOW, including the heavyweight favourite, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and the games that have a shot at stealing GOTY out from its grasp, like Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and Hollow Knight Silksong.</p>

              <p>You can’t really enjoy an immersive viewing experience without great sound to match the visuals. If you’re looking to make holiday movie nights better but your current TV doesn’t have solid built-in speakers, adding a soundbar to the setup can be a smart move. And thanks to Amazon, picking one up doesn’t break the bank today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">The Sony S100F 2.0ch soundbar is currently going for just $98 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping 39% off its usual price of $160</a>. Shipping is free as well, so you’re not adding anything on top of the sale price. Even better, orders placed today will arrive before Christmas, so you can have fun streaming marathons with friends and family with fuller, richer audio that fills the room. Note that it’s only around for a short time, so it’s best to grab yours before the offer expires.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Surround Sound Experience</h2>
<p>The slim design blends into every entertainment setup well, matching the aesthetics of any room. You can place it on your console right below the screen, or mount it on the wall if you prefer a cleaner setup. It punches well above its weight, though. Sony has packed the soundbar with a two-speaker setup that delivers front surround sound by handling the full audio range without requiring additional subwoofers or speakers. It produces audio as a stereo mix for a wider soundstage that fills the entire room, instead of just blasting from the front.</p>
<p>The bass reflex speaker does an incredible job of delivering punchy, deep bass without compromising on the details, even when you have pumped the volume all the way up. You will be able to vibe to all your favorite tunes, plus immerse yourself in thrilling scenes like never before. S-Force Pro, on the other hand, emulates cinema-style sound fields for better clarity and a 3D experience. Translation? Cars in F1 race past your couch, gunfire erupts right in your living room, and the Grinch’s footsteps feel like they’re actually coming from behind you. Whether you’re planning to watch an action-packed series or stream some good old Christmas title, it makes you feel a part of what’s happening on the screen.</p>



<p>There’s a voice enhancement feature that automatically improves dialog clarity, even in those loud, chaotic scenes. It also comes in handy when you’re catching up with friends on a bigger screen; you will be able to hear everyone on the conference call clearly. Connectivity couldn’t be easier. A single HDMI ARC connection between the TV and the soundbar gets the party started. You can control both the TV and the soundbar with a single remote. Best of all, it supports Bluetooth connections just as well, which is great for when you want to pair your smartphone wirelessly with it. Maybe play some songs or a podcast in the background as you set holiday decorations up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">On a regular day, this speaker would run you around $160, but this deal lets you grab it for $98, which is quite affordable considering all the features it gets you.</a> If you’ve been after better sound, this soundbar can be an excellent addition to your setup. Snap it up quick, though, as the discount is a limited-time one. The retailer hasn’t specified an end date, but we’re not expecting it to last long. Placing your orders now will also allow you to get it before Christmas!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This ARC Raiders Backpack Has Single-Handedly Crashed the NVIDIA Website]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-backpack-crashed-nvidia-site/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is a beloved game after being on the market for a little more than six weeks. It’s an all-new extraction adventure title from Embark Studios, and it’s proving to be a true disruptor to the genre. Recently, NVIDIA kickstarted a promotional event that allows certain players to unlock an exclusive ARC Raiders backpack, and it has proven to be a little too popular.</p>



<p>If you try to redeem the ARC Raiders NVIDIA backpack right now, you’ll be met with network errors and server issues.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-nvidia-arc-raiders-backpack-is-sought-after">The NVIDIA ARC Raiders Backpack is Sought-After</h2>



<p>There are a few caveats to claiming the ARC Raiders NVIDIA backpack, the most critical of which is that you need to be a PC gamer with an NVIDIA GPU. This is because it needs to link to the NVIDIA App and the GeForce Rewards program.</p>



<p>We’ve got a full guide explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/get-free-arc-raiders-nvidia-backpack/">how to get the ARC Raiders backpack</a> from NVIDIA.</p>



<p>The listing went live at 6 AM PT, and what must be thousands of ARC Raiders fans were waiting to receive it, so much so that the NVIDIA site stopped working:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is a testament to the power of ARC Raiders, which is one of the most popular and successful games of 2025 after just a few weeks on the market.</p>



<p>To be honest, customization in ARC Raiders could be a little better. It’s limited right now, and that’s fine, because it’s a live-service game and Embark Studios is adding more content as they flesh out the holistic offering. But that’s why deals like this NVIDIA ARC Raiders backpack are so special – because people want <strong>more</strong> ways to outfit their character.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you managed to secure one of the NVIDIA backpacks in ARC Raiders.</p>

                <p>Bethesda's RPG The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has been released on so many platforms over the years since its 2011 debut that one developer at Bethesda believes it's becoming something of a joke.</p><p>Bethesda's Matt Carofano, the creative director for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-is-now-on-yet-another-platform-but-theres-a-way-to-upgrade-for-free/1100-6536793/" data-ref-id="1100-6536793">just-released Switch 2 Anniversary Edition of Skyrim</a>, told <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/its-a-bit-of-a-joke-at-this-point-skyrim-dev-on-returning-for-a-switch-2-re-release" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a> that, "It's a bit of a joke at this point how often we release Skyrim."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Skyrim Made Dominic Monaghan's PS3 EXPLODE | Star Players</p>
      </div>
<p>Carofano said Skyrim is a "great game" and the goal in releasing the game in so many places is to help it reach more people "in the best way possible."</p><p>He also discussed bringing Skyrim to Switch 2, saying there is a "whole new generation" of people who might pick up a Switch 2 and "that's the first time they've ever played Skyrim."</p><p>Bethesda previously put Skyrim on the original Switch, so creating a native Switch 2 version was "really an easy development process" and a "pretty quick" job to do, at least compared to Bethesda's traditional development timelines.</p><p>"Making the game takes years and years and years, but bringing it to this new console was a much, much faster process," he said.</p><p>The developer went on to discuss the ways in which Bethesda took advantage of the Switch 2 hardware.</p><p>"A lot of it was really just focusing on taking advantage of the new hardware. We can use DLSS now and get better resolution, better performance, and the game loads faster," he said. "Switch 2 has the Joy-Con 2 controllers that let you use mouse controls, so we added that. A lot of it is really just, 'How do we take advantage of the Switch 2? What can it do? And [how can we] give players the best version of Skyrim for that console?'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIntv_QfQjU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fIntv_QfQjU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Skyrim for Switch 2 launched this week and people quickly discovered numerous issues, including input delay. Bethesda said it is <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/57181" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">now investigating reports of performance issues</a>, but there is no timeline or further details for when fixes will be available.</p><p>Before this, Bethesda boss Todd Howard<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-still-play-skyrim-every-month-todd-howard/1100-6460286/" data-ref-id="1100-6460286"> joked about all the re-releases for Skyrim</a>. He said, "If you want us to stop releasing it, stop buying it." Skyrim was originally released in 2011 for PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, before coming to PS4 and Xbox One in 2016, then Nintendo Switch in 2017, and then PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2021. The Switch 2 edition launched on December 9.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who already own the Anniversary Edition on the original Switch, the Switch 2 upgrade for Skyrim is available for free. Those who don't already own any version of Skyrim on Switch can buy it on Switch 2 for $60. Owners of the non-Anniversary Edition of Skyrim on Switch can upgrade to the Anniversary Edition for $20 and then receive the Switch 2 version for free. The Anniversary Edition includes the base game and its three official expansions, as well as access to Creation Club content made by players.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyrim has sold more than 60 million copies and ranks as one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/" data-ref-id="2900-4814">top 10 best-selling games of all time</a>. Its enduring appeal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-lead-designer-reacts-to-games-enduring-appeal-what-the-hell/1100-6535441/" data-ref-id="1100-6535441">even surprised Skyrim's lead designer</a>, who recently said he expected some other game to eclipse it in the years following its release. Part of the game's enduring popularity comes from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-skyrim-mods/2900-6392/" data-ref-id="2900-6392">Skyrim's vibrant mod scene</a>, where players are always creating new content that can transform the world Bethesda created in surprising ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Bethesda is currently working on Skyrim's sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-483377">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, which was announced in 2018 but does not have a release date. In November, Howard said the highly anticipated RPG is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">"still a long way off"</a> and that he's "preaching patience" to fans. Howard has previously said he wonders if it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-talks-elder-scrolls-6-and-retirement-i-want-to-do-it-forever/1100-6517168/" data-ref-id="1100-6517168">mistake to announce Elder Scrolls VI so early</a>.</p>

I want a Milky Way, Mr Bond. I'd just like a Milky Way, YEAH YEAH YEAH (Milky Way), Mr Bond.

<p>The video above isn't the trailer the <a href="https://x.com/007">007 Twitter account</a> shared and the yanked earlier today, as spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-twitter-account-jumps-the-gun-and-posts-trailer-announcing-first-light-villain.1379350/">users on ResetEra</a>. It is, however, the first thing which comes to mind when I think of musician Lenny Kravitz, whom the trailer shows lending his face to a First Light villain named Bawma.</p>
<p>Bawma, according to the text of the tweet that's handily been screenshotted by the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-leak-reveals-music-star-will-play-new-james-bond-villain-and-youll-never-guess-who-it-is">Ian Games Network</a>, "rose from nothing, broke free, and built his own Kingdom of Aleph." He's "the largest black-market dealer in the Western Hemisphere who's as charismatic as he is unpredictable."</p><p>Bawma shows off this charismatic unpredictability in the trailer by threatening to drop Bond into a pit of female crocodiles. Bond, always thinking with his tadger, ends the trailer by saying "Girls? Of course." Like he's just figured out his life's a big cosmic knob joke. A cosmic knob joke that'll presumably be laughed at again at tonight's Geoff Awards, assuming IO Interactive debut this trailer properly there.</p>
<p>Anyway, shout out to Neil Cicierega for absolutely ruining a bunch of songs for me in the best way possible. Make sure you're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tdyU_gW6WE">bustin</a> into our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">Geoff Awards liveblog</a> today if you fancy watching the show alongside us.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-game-awards-2025">Games Awards 2025</a> livestream airs tonight – or tomorrow morning, if you’re a Prime Meridian chump like we all are – and, like most forms of bewildering media, it'll be best enjoyed together. We therefore invite you to join us for our liveblog coverage, which if you don’t have tickets yourself, promises to be the most up-to-the-minute source of game reveals and announcements that you can get without standing up against the theatre doors with a big cup to your ears. And Geoff <em>hates</em> it when people do that.</p>

<p>The main show begins at 12:30am GMT / 7:30pm ET / 4:40pm PT, with 30 minutes of pre-show beforehand. We’ll be covering the whole lot, which we know includes a new Tomb Raider reveal, a fresh look at a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> (possibly with grudging acceptance that yes, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leon-kennedys-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-cover-art-leak-confirms">Leon is in it</a>), and some manner of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> update news. To drift into the realm of speculation, there’s circumstantial evidence of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-divinity-trademarks-suggest-larian-are-behind-geoff-keighleys-regal-inspiring-and-thick-teaseage">new Divinity game by Larian</a>, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag remake</a> mumblings are getting too loud to ignore. I personally hope we get a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> trailer that’s immediately followed by another delayed release date, ‘cos it’d be funny.</p>
<p>Whatever happens: livestream up there, liveblog down here. And remember: the typos are <em>only</em> because of the sleep deprivation.</p>
