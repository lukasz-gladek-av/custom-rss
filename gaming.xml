            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/639509/unity-matt-bromberg-runtime-fee-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today, I’m talking with Matt Bromberg, who is the CEO of Unity, one of the leading video game development platforms. He’s been in the job for less than a year, and in many ways, he is the perfect <em>Decoder </em>guest.</p><p>Unity is one of those companies that we love here on <em>Decoder</em> because we interact with its products all the time, but the company itself is somewhat hidden from view. Unity doesn’t make or publish its own games. Instead, its core product, the Unity game engine, is what all kinds of games — especially mobile ones — run on. If you play games on your phone, which you probably do, you’ve used a product built with Unity. It’s not just on phones by a long shot, and you’ll hear us talk about that quite a bit, too, but Unity as a company is what makes a core part of the mobile phone experience work.</p><div><p>Listen to <em>Decoder</em>, a show hosted by <em>The Verge</em>’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/welcome-to-decoder/id1011668648?i=1000496212371&amp;itsct=podcast_box&amp;itscg=30200&amp;ls=1&amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;ct=verge091322">here</a>!</p></div><p>That’s a <em>Decoder </em>all by itself, but Bromberg took over the job of CEO in a moment of crisis, and he’s made significant changes to the company since. You’ll hear him describe Unity as being “at war with its customers” before he joined, and he’s not wrong. The former CEO, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/18/23269218/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-apology-game-developers-fucking-idiots-ironsource-merger">John Riccitiello</a>, led the company through a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development">major pricing model change</a>, called the runtime fee, that was going to raise costs for many of its customers. The communication around that pricing model change was also, frankly, terrible. Unity developers were in open rebellion, leading to Riccitiello’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/9/23910441/unity-ceo-president-john-riccitiello-out-retire">resignation</a> and, eventually, the company’s decision to scrap the runtime fee altogether.</p><p>So you’ll hear me ask Bromberg about his decision to walk the fee back after he joined, because it was clear to him even before he took the job that he would need to make that choice if there was going to be a Unity left for him to run. And you’ll hear him explain that while deciding to make such a big change was easy for him, working out how to execute that change slowed him down a bit.</p><p>Bromberg’s in charge of Unity during a moment of contraction for the game industry overall — studios are closing, and some big bets on things like the Metaverse and live service games haven’t paid off. So we talked about all that and where he sees growth ahead: Unity isn’t just a game engine provider, but the platform for everything running those big live services and the monetization on top of that.</p><p>One note before we start, because it really grabbed me: Bromberg’s one of the first CEOs to come on this show and disagree with me about the importance of structure. I tend to think of a company’s org chart as a proxy for its culture and its tradeoffs. I’m always saying that if you tell me your org chart, I can guess 80 percent of your problems, and so we joke that <em>Decoder </em>is really a show about org charts. But Bromberg told me he thinks culture isn’t enabled by structure. You’ll hear what he means.</p><p>Unity CEO Matt Bromberg. Here we go.</p><p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p><strong>Matt Bromberg, you are the new CEO of Unity. Welcome to </strong><strong><em>Decoder</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>Thank you so much for having me. It’s really my pleasure.</p><p><strong>I am very excited to talk to you. This is a perfect episode of </strong><strong><em>Decoder</em></strong><strong>: You are less than a year on the job as the new CEO. You took over, you made a bunch of changes to the company, you restructured the company, you hired a new C-suite, you used to work for the old CEO — and then, Unity itself is a very core piece of technology that I think is under-covered. So, it’s like a perfect episode. Thanks for joining us.</strong></p><p>You bet.</p><p><strong>Unity really is kind of under-covered. It’s on everyone’s phone: Everyone has games on their phone, and Unity is almost certainly powering those games. What is Unity? What are game engines?</strong></p><p>Game engines are effectively the thing that developers use to build games. And maybe that’s obvious, but the technology is pretty deep and pretty complex. Unity is a platform where developers can aggregate all the tools, technologies, and content they need to build interactive applications. And yeah, to your point, it’s a really important tool in our world. About <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/mobile">seven out of every 10</a> mobile games in the world are built on Unity. About 30 percent of the [top 1000] PC games in the world. Seven out of 10 best AR games were built in Unity. Last night, or two nights ago, at GDC, eight out of 10 of the top independent games that won awards were built on Unity. We’re an important partner in that ecosystem.</p><p><strong>There’s a lot of history in game engines and investments in game engine development. A lot of companies that made popular games and then thought they could peel the engine out of those games and turn that into a business; that’s worked or, mostly, not worked in various ways. Unity is just an engine company. You’re not trying to make consumer-facing games.</strong></p><p>That is correct. We do a little bit. It’s funny you should say that. Generally speaking, that’s absolutely true. We are not a game developer <em>and</em> a publisher. We have recently been doing more development ourselves on a couple of projects. But only to ensure that our tools are production-ready and dogfooding what we’re doing. We have an expert team that does some of that, but it’s really about feeding back into our development process more than trying to be a games company. I was the chief operating officer at Zynga for a lot of years —I know what it is to run a games company. I think it can be very hard and unnecessary to try to run a games company and an engine company.</p><p><strong>I made that comparison explicitly because your biggest competitor is Unreal Engine, which is Epic Games. Epic is a games company, they’re the </strong><strong><em>Fortnite </em></strong><strong>company. They’re doing both, and then they’re expanding their engine into Hollywood, into automobile design, all this other stuff. You seem pretty narrowly focused on games still. What do you think about that competition?</strong></p><p>There’s a lot to unpack there. First, there are increasingly lots of applications of Unity outside of gaming. And in fact, <a href="https://unity.com/industry">what we call industries</a> is the fastest-growing part of our subscription business.</p><p>But we are, to your point, much more focused now than we were before. We were chasing sort of everything: Hollywood, architects, digital twins for building nuclear reactors, and all sorts of things. Right now, we’re really just focused on a few core verticals.</p><p>For example, most of the <a href="https://unity.com/news/unity-chosen-by-toyota-motor-corporation-for-next-generation-hmi">in-dash experiences in cars</a> are built on top of Unity. If you think about the little computer that’s in the dashboard of your car, it feels a lot like a phone or some other small device. And that’s really our strength to be able to design and develop interactive experiences for those things. [We work in] virtual, retail, and lots of applications on the manufacturing floor, so we do a fair bit outside of gaming.</p><p>I guess the other thing to understand is that Unity as a platform is focused on making games, but we are the only company in the world that helps developers through the whole lifecycle of development. From prototyping through building, operating in life service, and then crucially to acquiring new players, monetizing, and inventorying your games. The big second piece for us is the advertising and marketing piece. It’s a piece that we think grows really organically out of our core business, which is about deeply understanding consumers, and helping developers build for those consumers. And then when they turn to that next phase where they need to acquire players, we’re also there to help them.</p><p><strong>I kind of understand why all the car makers use Unity. They under-spec the processors in their cars, and the closest comparison to that is a mobile phone, which is power constrained. I don’t think a car is power constrained; I think they’re just cheap, but there they are. They’re just using under-specced mobile processors to drive their dashboards. Unity is a great engine for mobile phones. It makes sense that you just expand in that direction.</strong></p><p><strong>But that’s not games, right? That’s just another set of constraints that looks familiar, so you end up there. When you talk about games, we’ve just gone through an apocalypse of live service games recently. That industry doesn’t seem as predictable. It doesn’t seem like the games industry knows where its next set of growth will be, or how many people it should employ quite broadly. There’s some big change there that it feels like I can’t draw the line as quickly as I can to the expansion into cars, right?</strong></p><p>Yeah, listen, there is a lot of consternation about the video game industry. I’m someone who shares that. I’ve been around long enough to know that towards the end of hardware cycles, everybody’s throwing up their hands and saying, “Gee, I don’t think gaming’s doing so well.”</p><p>I’ve been through this cycle several times. Here’s what happens: Creative people innovate, and they make new experiences. Those experiences explode into hits, and that drives growth. That has always happened. I think the pain that we’re feeling right now in the industry is principally a pain born of creative destruction, so I accept that there’s been a fair bit of pain. There’ve been a lot of layoffs and other really unfortunate things. I think that’s about folks reimagining themselves for the future. The explosion of new devices and new experiences is going to be the gateway to that innovation.</p><p>The thing about Unity is… It’s not so much that we’re optimized to run on low-spec phones, it’s that when you build any experience in Unity it can operate at a really high level of performance fidelity anywhere. And that’s where consumers are moving. We used to be in this world where, and I remember this… I worked at Electronic Arts for many years. We were in this world where folks believed that visual fidelity and high-quality visuals were the primary things that video game consumers wanted, and they were obsessed with it. And I think what we’ve realized now is: that’s not what’s driving the consumer. I don’t think it ever has been what’s driving the consumer. We’re really proud of the quality of our visuals, but what drives consumer adoption is gameplay innovation. And all that is what’s going to drive this industry forward. I’m hugely optimistic about it.</p><p>Keep in mind, again, web games, AR, and VR. We’re going to get a new Nintendo platform. We’re going to get new Sony and Microsoft platforms. Phones are going to become ever more powerful. You’ve got dual-screen phones. The form of games will change, and the nature of them will change, but the appetite for interactive experiences, to my eye, has not lessened in any way.</p><p><strong>Just in the context of what a game engine is, what you’re describing here is: Let’s say I have an idea for a game. I see a market that’s changing. Unity is going to provide me with the physics engine that lets me build the game, with the ability to render the game in high fidelity across a number of platforms. And that number of platforms is important because a game needs to be everywhere now. You’ll operate the live service that lets people connect and play multiplayer, and then you’ll help me monetize the game by putting ads in it. Which part is the hardest right now? Because it seems like the games industry is “every part is the hardest,” and it seems like you have a much clearer view. What do you think is actually the hardest part?</strong></p><p>My experience of making video games for many, many years — which is what I did before I came to Unity — is that generally speaking, especially for game publishers of any scale, there’s a really simple equation. At the end of every year, they look at their P&amp;L and say, “How much money can I spend next year making new things?” They usually have a big life service or many, and that’s what’s kind of driving forward the business on a day-to-day basis. But the video games world is about hits and about new experiences, and you have to make investments. You also have to control and modulate those investments. The most important equation is people and time. If it takes me, if it’s 300 people and three years to make a game, versus 50 people and a year, that equation is very, very different.</p><p>The amount of innovation I can afford, the amount of new starts I can afford, and the amount of marketing I can afford, are very different in both equations. To me, when I think about Unity’s place in the world and where we can be the most help, it’s there. We’re a proud tools provider. We help video game developers make games, hopefully, as efficiently, quickly, and easily as possible so they can spend more time creating innovation. And if we’re really good at our job, they can have more starts, because they’re moving more quickly and they can do it more efficiently. And that’s the role I’d love to see us play there. And then to your point, as many new starts as we can get out there, great. Now we’ve got to go out and find new players. So, that’s the flywheel you want to see.</p><p><strong>Let me ask one more kind of existential question. I want to get into the changes you’ve been making here. I feel like every industry, but in particular, the games industry got fundamentally confused by the combo platter of the pandemic in Fortnite. Meta was like, “We’re all going to wear headsets all day long in our house.” And I don’t know, it doesn’t seem like that’s happening. A bunch of companies thought, “Okay, we can see all these people playing Fortnite. The future of live music is going to happen in video games, and we’re going to build these huge live service multi-experience games, and everyone’s going to spend all their time in them.” And all that’s left from what I can tell, that’s sustainable, is Fortnite. There’s not another Fortnite, and that drives a lot of your competitor’s business. That drives a lot of Epic’s business. Do you see that as a mistake that the industry is correcting, or do you see other games being able to reach that level and then go even one step farther into, “Okay, we’re having true metaverse experiences”? Because I don’t see that anywhere right now.</strong></p><p>I don’t think about it exactly that way. Listen, I think that the pandemic more than anything pulled demand forward. It pulled about a couple of years of consumer demand forward, and then we did see some natural slackening after having pulled all that forward. And I think that part of the dynamic is obvious.</p><p><strong>Meta renamed the company, and they were like, “We’re not Facebook anymore. We’re Meta now.” And I don’t know if that’s paid off for them.</strong></p><p>I was never a massive believer in the metaverse during that period of time. I’ll tell you why: Because, as a game maker, I experienced all those new platforms and just thought they were garbage. And I thought, “This looks like the games we tried to make 15 years ago. There is no way that’s a sustainable consumer experience.” All sorts of metaverse companies — I was completely confused by them. Having said that, I actually continue to believe, and I see the vibrancy of big live service platforms and communities as being fundamental to the games business. I mean, yeah, Fortnite, but Roblox, FIFA, and every game… Every major company has many enormous live services with millions or tens of millions of players. And in some ways that is the fundamental feature of the video game business right now — 80 percent of the people are deeply invested in this experience that they’ve been playing for years.</p><p>And I think one of the challenges now is, “Okay, how do I get those folks to move to something new?” I think that’s the push-pull that we’ve had. But I see platforms, communities, and interactive communities of gaming continuing to dominate and explode. And I do think we’ll see some new things. I think we’ll see innovation, some lighter experiences that will begin to challenge those. But I wouldn’t confuse the failure of the metaverse with some lack of sustainability in major life service gaming.</p><p><strong>That’s a connection that has always been the most interesting to me. If you believe that the world is going to be big live service games, it’s not that much of a jump to say, “And we’ll all wear headsets all day long.” We’re spending time virtually which will just get more immersive. That’s a straight line. But it seems like we didn’t hit the first spot.</strong></p><p>No, I think some of that has to do with — again, put aside the idiocy of some of the metaverse stuff… The future, to some degree, is going to be tied to massive consumer adoption of peripherals, or maybe that’s an old-fashioned word for it, but new devices. I’m an enormous believer in AR, for example. I think that one of the things that happened during the course of the pandemic and the couple of years since is we’re starting to get closer and closer with every rev to something that’s real here. I have no doubt that a couple of years from now everybody’s going to be wearing AR glasses. And how long has it been since Google Glass came out? But the combination of AI and voice, which enables really easy interactions with the form factor, the battery life that is now possible, and the ability to overlay information and services in front of your eyes, to me, is obviously going to explode.</p><p>And we’re going to look back and think about the time when we kept reaching into our pockets to pull out this thing for everything, it’s going to seem quaint. But it takes a long time to get true mass consumer adoption of these devices because it all has to be perfect. But once it hits, it explodes.</p><p><strong>You’re a glasses wearer. I can see you wearing your glasses. I wear contacts. My theory is that you have to deliver far more value than is required to care for whatever you mount to your face. And glasses deliver an extraordinary amount of value. I’m horrible at maintaining my glasses; they’re very scratched, they’re very dirty. I wear them just to go to bed. I don’t have to care for them, but they deliver. I’m allowed to see, that’s a huge value amount.</strong></p><p>But you go outside in the sun and you put on sunglasses, right?</p><p><strong>But I only get value at that time. I don’t come back in and keep wearing my sunglasses, which is what I think Meta wants me to do. I think they want us to believe that transition lenses are going to be cool, and maybe they’ll pull that off. Who knows? Mark Zuckerberg’s wearing a chain. He’s got a haircut. Maybe he’s going to pull this off.</strong></p><p>Well, we will see.</p><p><strong>My point is, right now the most compelling AR experience is way down on the curve, right? It’s actually the Vision Pro, which is a huge thing that has an external battery and limited app support. Do you see, when you put on the Vision Pro, “Okay, I can get from here to there if the hardware improves on some curve?” Because when I reviewed it my conclusion was, “We’re racing down a dead end. This is the best pass-through VR that I’ve ever seen, and we should not keep doing this. It’s never going to get better than this.”</strong></p><p>We partnered with Apple in the creation of that device. And I would say this, I would not… History is littered with first-generation devices that seemed absurd and then in another form became ubiquitous. And I do fundamentally believe that when the device form factors get right, consumers will adopt them. I do think it’ll be a mix though. I think one of the things we learned is that there’s a pretty high bar for folks wanting to isolate themselves completely from the world. And that’s why. When I think about AR, I think that the first mass-adoption devices we’ll see will be those that allow people to continue to be social and interact in the world while overlaying or enhancing that experience. Completely absorptive experiences have… I think folks will engage in those things, but there’ll be a time and a place for it. So, my view of that device was that it was a first swing. And also, by the way, Apple has a very long history of that as well. The first generation of devices is not necessarily the thing that takes off. So, I continue to be hugely encouraged by that.</p><p><strong>Are you of the view, I think the cliche was, that this is a simulator for the thing they want to actually build?</strong></p><p>I don’t know. I mean, I guess maybe that would be something you’d say after you’ve shipped it, maybe it didn’t go quite as well as you’d want to. But I applaud their willingness to put a stake in the ground, get out there with something, and then go back to the drawing board and continue to invest. At the end of the day, all of us making technology products need to do that. So, pushing the envelope for me is a good thing.</p><p><strong>I ask this, because again, with the games industry as it is currently configured, we are at the end of a console generation. It appears to be restructuring, reconsolidating in some ways, and falling apart in other ways. It was <a href="https://unity.com/events/gdc">just GDC</a>. There’s just a lot of turmoil when you get the whole games industry in one conference center and talk about the future. And the big bets, like “We’re all going to play a bunch of AR games,” while <em>Pokemon Go</em> just got sold. A lot of the big bets seem to be structurally changing.</strong></p><p><strong>Unity obviously plays a part in that. But the sugar rush of the pandemic led Unity itself to make big decisions about how much demand there would be that fundamentally you’ve had to undo. The decision to charge the runtime fee feels like your predecessor as CEO was saying, “Okay, there’s going to be this much more demand for all this stuff. I can now extract a toll.” Do you see that in that framework?</strong></p><p>I don’t. I don’t. By the way, I also don’t, fundamentally… I believe in the vibrancy and growth of the video game business, which, by the way, is still growing nicely and continues to be larger than streaming media, streaming music, and theatrical distribution combined. And this you will grow in high single digits, or maybe low double digits. I see this business as really vibrant. I don’t think the things that Unity has done in the past were sort of a ... And frankly, the other folks were a direct response to demand… I accept it maybe as folks staffed up across the industry and then demand slackened a little bit. I don’t think that’s so much this year, but maybe in the year before — you had some dislocation.</p><p>But I think for us, the thing about Unity which is spectacular and fascinating, is that we sit at the intersection of so many powerful forces: 3D, digital advertising, interactive entertainment, AI, I could go on. And you could convince yourself that you have a meaningful role to play in all of that. Because we have this platform and this engine, this tool that is connected deeply to all those powerful forces. But you have to make choices in the world if you want to execute at an exceptionally high level. And the way we’re thinking about this business now is that we are going to make some really focused choices, hit the ball out of the park around those things, kind of re-earn the trust of customers, be better partners, and deliver at a much higher level. And that all good things are going to come from that. Which doesn’t… It’s great to be expansive, but if you want to deliver, you have to make choices.</p><p><strong>I think this is a perfect transition to what I think of as the </strong><strong><em>Decoder </em></strong><strong>questions. I want to start with a quote. You </strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-want-to-be-a-fundamentally-different-and-better-company-says-new-unity-boss-as-unity-6-launches"><strong>gave an interview to IGN</strong></a><strong> where you said, “We want to be a fundamentally different and better company. It is what we want. We have to have a fundamentally different relationship with our customers and our community. We want to develop and deliver products in a fundamentally different way. And that starts with you thinking about it differently.”</strong></p><p><strong>One of my ideas for the show is that structure is a proxy for culture. You have to build a corporate structure that enables the culture you want. You’re basically talking about totally transforming the company, in that quote. Everything has to be different, down from how you deliver the products to what your relationship with the customer is. You’ve been there less than a year. How have you restructured Unity to get to the culture you want?</strong></p><p>It’s funny. Culture is a really interesting thing. And the way I think about culture is that I think it’s actually fundamentally backward-looking in a way. What I mean by that is, when we think about our culture in the context of a company, we usually, what we’re usually doing is saying, “Hey, we got together to do this thing and it went pretty well.” Now, let’s stop for a second and look backward and ask ourselves, “How were we behaving? What were our values while we were doing that? Because it went pretty well. Let’s write those down, and we’ll put them on a mug or a T-shirt,” and those are going to be … that’s how we’re going to talk about our culture. That’s not a criticism from my perspective. I just think that’s usually this thing where we look back to understand how we’re behaving. And because it’s worked.</p><p>And so, the way I think about transforming culture is about setting really clear expectations and communicating more than anything an approach and an expectation about how we’re going to behave with one another. What’s going to count as the way we do what we do? How do you know you work here? Because every great company feels that way. Like, “Hey, this is how we do.” When you unpack that idea, folks get clear on that, having a common view of it. But having that view be authentic to the actual experience is important. For example, on my first day there was a lot of pressure to do the kinds of things that you’d expect in a big company. “Hey, we should send out new values.”</p><p>I don’t do that. Because how do I know? I just got here, I haven’t met anybody, we haven’t done anything yet. How about let’s work together, let’s get to know each other. Let’s figure out how. And then we go back in an authentic way that’s actually connected, in a way that isn’t about mugs and T-shirts. Can we get to a short list of what we expect of one another? And that’s sort of how I think about culture.</p><p><strong>It’s interesting you say that. It reminds me that when we started </strong><strong><em>The Verge</em></strong><strong> 13 years ago, we used to argue endlessly about what a </strong><strong><em>Verge </em></strong><strong>story would be. And now our audience knows, right? And that’s a backward-looking reflection of how we made some definitions and held onto them, communicated them. But you have also restructured the company. You have a new COO, you have a new CTO, you have a new CFO — that’s an entirely new C-suite. You’ve rethought how the company should work. What are the changes that you’ve made?</strong></p><p>The first and most important thing for us was to reinvest in the relationship we had with customers and to be a better partner. We were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development">at war with our customers</a>, effectively, when I arrived. Folks were boycotting us. They were really unhappy with how we were charging them and how we spoke. And you can’t have a business where we’re your customers. That’s insane. The first thing was to take a breath and reorient ourselves around being good partners, around authentically trying to deliver, to listen to people, and authentically trying to deliver what they need as the primary touchstone of what drives our behavior. And I know that, in a way, that sounds obvious and like a cliche. But some organizations do that and some don’t. The process of coming to understand in an authentic, but also accurate, way what signals to listen to and respond to is more complicated than it seems. But the first piece was to be better partners.</p><p>The second piece, to your point, was I wanted us to lead differently. I wanted our organization to be different and to have different values. And in my experience, the fastest way to do that is to make changes at the top. Especially, by the way, if you think you might later have to change the rest of the organization, what is soul destroying for people is when somebody comes into a company that’s having a little bit of difficulty and they start restructuring the company and they leave the management layer intact and they think, “Well, hang on a second, who is responsible for all this stuff? How do we skip over the folks who were in charge?” And suddenly like, “I’m taking it in the neck. How did that happen?” If you want different outcomes, if you want different approaches, some of it’s changing culture, but a lot of it is changing people.</p><p>And especially if you want to do it quickly, you can’t be afraid, because you need alignment. You need instant and immediate alignment if you want really fast results. So yeah, we changed a lot of leadership. Then, I think about the other things we did… We did some important things in our business, which we can talk about if you want to, just in terms of we needed to make certain investments, especially in our advertising business and other things. But putting those aside for a second, the third big thing from a culture and a company perspective was that I think we went about trying to redefine how we do what we do. And honestly, that is my obsession. I am someone who believes that the <em>what </em>is a lot less important than the <em>how</em>.</p><p>If you have the how right, all the what’s will go better. And you have to ask yourself when you come into any organization, if that organization is not organically producing really high-quality answers all the time… What you should not do is run around trying to tell people what to do and ask them to do it differently. There’s no leverage in that. There’s no leadership in that. There’s no inspiration in that. What you need to do is ask yourself, “Why is that? How come this organism doesn’t produce good answers?” And start to get into the how and start to fix the how and then you start getting better answers. That’s the key to transformation.</p><p><strong>Those ideas are in a little bit of tension. Let me just push you on that.</strong></p><p><strong>There’s the notion that you came into the company, you didn’t want to impose culture from the top down. You wanted to wait and see and diagnose the problem of how the company made choices. And then there’s a need to move fast in taking out all this old management, putting in new people, and you have to have a vision in order to go hire all those new people and change fast. Those ideas are in a little bit of opposition.</strong></p><p>You’re right, you’re right. Totally fair. You have to listen. The truth is you have to do both. And you have to do both in a way that is authentic and effective. I am generally very, very clear and we as a team are very, very clear about what we want to do and what we think the right direction is. But here’s where they’re not in conflict: It’s the process through which you get clear about what you want to do, which is where all the action is. So, it’s not, “Hey, here I am, here’s what we got to do.” It’s much more about, “Hey, here I am, help explain to me how we got here.”</p><p>What do you do? What are the challenges? How do you guys see this? You fly all over the world, you talk to customers, you meet with everyone you can inside the company. You have hundreds of conversations, hundreds. Because in the beginning when you get here, you have no idea. If you’re being honest with yourself, you ought to have no idea what to do. Where you get that inspiration is through the coalescing of the hundreds and hundreds of conversations.</p><p>And at least what I experience is, I begin to understand where the areas of energy are and where the areas of opportunity are. And so then, when you show back up, and you stand up in front of people and you say, “Hey, here’s the direction I think we ought to go in.” It doesn’t feel like something you came up with by yourself in a room with a legal pad. It’s a reflection and an echo of what you heard from all the assembled people. It’s organic to what you’re doing, and it’s a byproduct of listening as opposed to stuffing it on top of people. And that’s why if you do it that way, it ought to be better.</p><p><strong>You are the new CEO, but you also used to work for the old CEO: John Riccitiello was the CEO of Electronic Arts when you worked at Electronic Arts. Then he became the CEO of Unity, and you replaced him. What did you learn about what not to do or what to do from that experience working for the old boss?</strong></p><p>John actually hired me in my first job in video gaming, back in — well, it wasn’t my first job in video gaming. He hired me at Electronic Arts in 2012. I learned a lot of what I learned about this industry from him, and have an enormous amount of respect and admiration for him, so I have really no inclination to sort of pick apart what he did or didn’t do.</p><p>The world is a new place now than it was four or five years ago. Unity is a new company and we’re pursuing a different direction.</p><p><strong>All right, it was worth a shot! So, you made some changes to the top. I think this is the big </strong><strong><em>Decoder </em></strong><strong>question: How is Unity structured now?</strong></p><p>Here’s the thing, and maybe you and I just won’t agree about this. I’m much less interested in structure than I am in behavior. And I’ll tell you why. I’ve worked in big companies, a lot of them over the years. My experience is that what people want to do, especially if they think they want to improve things, is they immediately go to an org chart. They go and they start moving things around. The truth is, if people are not properly oriented, if they’re not properly situated, if they’re not spiritually in the right place to do what you need to do, I don’t care what the structure is, it’s not going to work. And there is no right answer to structure. People think, “Hey, if I could just get it in the right shape, it’s going to be okay.” The truth is that some structures accelerate some outcomes and create different tensions, and other structures accelerate other outcomes and create other tensions. I tend not to think first about structure. I try to think first about the landing approach and behavior.</p><p>Once we get oriented around how we’re going to do what we’re doing and people start behaving differently, different things happen. If somebody comes to me, for example, and says, “You know the reason we can’t do this, it’s because this thing is over in this division and this thing is over in that division and they can’t talk to each other; they should be in the same division.” I have no time for that conversation. What do you mean? Do you have a phone for that person? Do you guys sit down and have a conversation about that? If we’re properly motivated, what difference does it make where it sits? Look, of course, I’ve restructured things and I’ve changed things, so again, I don’t want to, but in terms of orientation, I want to land one before the other because one I think is more substantive and more likely to fundamentally change things than the other, if that makes sense?</p><p><strong>It does. My joke on the show is that I always ask that question, because to your point, if you tell me your structure, I can abstractly tell you 80 percent of your problems. I can identify the trade-offs that come with various structures. And it seems like you are making different trade-offs. You changed the structure, which means there’s something you wanted to change in the trade-offs you were making.</strong></p><p>Yeah, I’d say principally the change in the structure… The only meaningful changes we made were around reducing layers and making sure that everybody was communicating, and that we could quickly escalate any issues, make decisions, and move on. We always had the right folks in the room to operate in a unified way. And if ever there were issues, we insisted that they get escalated and resolved quickly. So if there was some organizational thing that made it impossible for us all to sit together, or if there were too many layers and I couldn’t see, we made some of those changes. And I do think those have been important, but again, not as important as the behavioral changes.</p><p><strong>Obviously, part of restructuring is shrinking. You’ve had a few rounds of layoffs now; last year, in January, </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030695/unity-layoff-staff-25-percent"><strong>25 percent of the company</strong></a><strong> was let go. You</strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610165/unity-layoffs-2025-runtime-fee"><strong> just had another</strong></a><strong> [round]. Is that all to get smaller to reduce those middle layers, or is there something else going on there?</strong></p><p>I wasn’t at the company for that really, really big one, but I will offer my strategy and my approach to these things. And I can already anticipate you’re going to tell me there’s a tension in them.</p><p><strong>Welcome to </strong><strong><em>Decoder</em></strong><strong>. The producers, by the way, joke that that is what the tagline is.</strong></p><p>Yeah. And by the way, that’s life, right? Nothing is black and white where it’s a Zen thing. But I never… We as a management team do not think about trying to get financial leverage by doing layoffs. I hate that. I think it’s nonsensical. What you have to do is make decisions and try to be really disciplined about the very few things you think you can do really, really well, and be a little bit ruthless about stopping the other things. And so for me, those kinds of restructurings are about putting your money where your mouth is as it relates to investing in the things that are important and ceasing the other things. </p><p>The thing I think that most leaders miss is, when they stand up and they talk about things that are important, what they don’t realize is that all they’re doing is adding another thing to people’s to-do lists. Because last week you said something else was important. The week before you said something else was important, and folks drown in those priorities. And nobody ever tells you what to stop doing, because that requires courage, and you probably wouldn’t be doing them if it wasn’t a pretty good idea at some point. </p><p>There’s a reason why people do things, but if you want organizations to perform really well, you have to be really, really clear about what you’re not doing, and then you have to put your money where your mouth is with respect to that. And sometimes there’s real pain associated with that, and it’s the unfortunate part about it, but in my experience, you come out the other end in much better shape.</p><p><strong>Here’s the other big </strong><strong><em>Decoder </em></strong><strong>question: How do you make decisions? What’s your framework?</strong></p><p>I’m a big believer in full transparency, context, sharing with people, and having them share with me everything they understand about something. And then holding that up and making a call. And so, for me, it’s about engaging in a really deep conversation, being sure we’re talking about the same thing that we understand at the same level. I expose all the thinking I have on a topic, I’d like you to do the same thing. And we balance the pros and cons and then we make a call and we move on. For me, it’s much more important that we make a decision, than it is what that decision is. And it goes back to what we were talking about before. I believe in the <em>how </em>more than the <em>what</em>. If it turns out that decision was wrong, we’ll make a different decision. But the thing that kills companies, especially large companies, is a lack of courage and clarity around making decisions. So, my thing about decisions is, mostly make them.</p><p><strong>That one comes up a lot. You are an interesting person to ask that question, because you came into the company and one decision that you had to make was obvious, I think, right? You said you came into a company that was at war with its customers, and that is </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development"><strong>because of the runtime fee</strong></a><strong> that your predecessor had announced, which has shifted the pricing model of Unity to a per-install fee. Every time someone installed the game, the developer would have to pay, which would skyrocket costs.</strong></p><p><strong>I don’t know why that fee was instituted. It was obviously a problem. Here you are, you’re the new CEO. You knew you were going to walk that back, right? But you’re saying the </strong><strong><em>how </em></strong><strong>was really important. Walk me through how you made this decision, where the outcome seems so clear.</strong></p><p>You’re absolutely right, and I appreciate you asking the question because I do think it’s a good example of what we’re talking about. I absolutely knew I was going to roll it back before I even took the job. The important part was not that I was going to roll it back, and not even so much how we were going to roll it back, but in the way in which we’re going to roll it back. For me, the most important thing, as I said, was, “Hey, I wanted to get back into a place where we were being partners with our customers.” And so, what I did was get on an airplane and started flying around, meeting with customers, and saying, “Hey, between you and me, we’re going to repeal this fee. I have some ideas about how, what do you think of them? Here’s what they are. If you want to vent about how upset you are about the old thing, that’s why I’m here too.” But I prefer to say, “If I did this, how would that strike you?”</p><p>And we started an open conversation. You have to select the folks you talk to because it is confidential. It’s important, you have to trust people. But we consulted and what we heard again and again was, “Hey, I accept that we’re not paying you enough. I actually think you’re delivering more value. I just hate the way you ask for the money. I don’t like the structure, I don’t like the tone. And by the way, if you’re going to raise prices, I need you to deliver better and execute better, because the two together strike me as aggravating.” And so, by the time… It took a little while, but it wasn’t a very long time. It was a few months and people were saying, “How come it took you so long?”</p><p>But it’s because I wanted to be sure we heard people and I wanted to be sure they understood that we were going to do things differently. We’re going to be disciplined, we’re going to communicate, we’re going to execute at a high level, and we’re going to listen. What came out of it was pretty sharp increases that, by and large, and listen, nobody likes to have prices raised... But we came out of it with a stronger bond with our customers, and the way we talked about it internally was equally important. Because to your point, we made this decision which was really ruinous for the company. You have to ask yourself, “How did that happen?” And so, how we make the new decision, how we have that conversation, who’s at the table? What kind of analysis do we do? What kind of feedback do we take? Getting into that and using that exercise to fix the organism and fix the process was equally important. It’s like, again, it was less about the thing and much more about using the thing to get healthy.</p><p><strong>Can you just, in a sentence, diagnose how the decision to impose the runtime fee was made since you looked into it? And then how the decision to pull it back was made since you made that one differently?</strong></p><p>I see Unity as a product company, and I’m a big believer that the way we create value is by delivering product value, and then folks will pay us for the value that we create. The thing about the runtime fee was that it was a business model. We were thinking about dynamics and how you can get people to do this versus that. If we raise one price here, then they’ll be forced to do that. That has nothing to do with creating value. That’s a trick. It’s a business model trick. It’s a hack. I don’t believe in that. I believe you create value by building better products. And so, the runtime fee decision was about, “Hey, we’ve got an engine business and we’ve got this ad business and we can’t exactly figure out how those two things would leverage one another and work together really well.” Okay, here’s a way. “I think we can structure a fee that brings them together and sort of encourages (which would be a kind word) folks to spend in one area if they spend in another.” I think customers found it more coercive than encouraging, but whatever. </p><p>My point is that, no… The way those two things come together is that both the developer part of our business and the ad part of the business depend on a deep understanding of consumer behavior. And just as folks who are building games need to understand how consumers are behaving in those games, in order to effectively acquire users, they also need to understand how consumers behave and that we can create product linkages and value there. That’s how we’ll drive value, and that’s substantive. I think that was sort of the distinction between the two approaches if that makes sense.</p><p><strong>When you rolled back the runtime fee, you increased prices on some of the tiers of Unity. It seems like those could go up independently if you think you’re delivering more value there. But they did go up pretty steeply as you mentioned. And then there’s a monetization side where you’re making investments in ad companies to help you deliver more monetization. There’s a tension there. You can see that increasing ad monetization helps you get more money if there are more installs, so you might want to lower the price on the engine to get more market share and compete there. But if you increase the price on the engine, you might just make more money upfront against this ad thing that you have to keep developing. How are you reconciling those things?</strong></p><p>I agree that there is a tension there. </p><p><strong>We’re going to make a Decoder game in Unity called </strong><strong><em>There’s a Tension There</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>Any ad business at a high level thrives by opening the top of the funnel as broadly as possible. That’s what drives so that you’re left with something at the bottom of the funnel. That’s what ad-driven businesses do. And you’re right, there is some tension if you charge for the product, then presumably fewer people will use it, and then that’s not good. I think the important thing to understand about our structure is that Unity is free for everybody if you make less than a couple of 100,000 dollars in revenue. The top of the funnel is really big and broad. And there are millions of developers of Unity, and that’s why in the aggregate we have something like eight billion DAU (daily active users). It’s not deduped data. Cut it in half, say four billion people who are touching that Unity runtime in some way. So, it is hugely distributed. </p><p>I accept that if it was completely free, maybe you’d have more people using it, but again, keep in mind that you’re only paying us once your game is really successful. And as a percentage of what you’re making it’s not… it ought not to negatively impact you.</p><p><strong>That’s interesting because I’ve seen that dynamic play out on other platforms, particularly the app stores. Where you’re free to a point and then you tick over into the next tier of success and suddenly you’re paying a penalty — or what developers perceive as a penalty — for success, right? You’ve tipped over into the amount of revenue it would cause you to pay. And you actually have an incentive to stay just under a certain level of success in order to stop paying more money, in order to prevent paying more money. Do you see that dynamic in Unity?</strong></p><p>Listen, I think that, in general, our customers and the community understand that in order to invest in the engine, it’s important for us to be able to charge folks. And engines are very complex beasts and there’s a lot of engineering there, and there’s a lot of investment we make every year. And in general, I think there’s an understanding about that.</p><p><strong>The hard part of the ads business, particularly on mobile, is that you’re up against the platform vendors. Google is particularly interested in ads in various ways. Apple is not interested in ads in various ways. The mobile ad business, particularly in iOS, took a big hit from app tracking transparency.</strong></p><p>Apple is interested in their own ad business. Just to be clear.</p><p><strong>They’re definitely interested in their own ad business. They’re not interested in anyone else’s business. I think that’s a good call out. </strong></p><p><strong>But they made the ad business on iOS much harder with app tracking transparency. I think I would argue that they made the correct trade-off. They made it harder to track people across apps and platforms, the web, and mobile. I don’t know that anyone perceives that that has gotten better. I still feel awfully tracked. But it had an impact on, for example, Meta’s business to the tune of billions of dollars. Is that a challenge that the ad industry has overcome? Is that a challenge you’re still working on?</strong></p><p>I think it’s a challenge that largely the industry has overcome. It certainly had a meaningful impact. Different folks could be more or less cynical about what Apple’s motivations were or not. I don’t know. But I think now it’s largely in the rear-view mirror. And that in general, the systems have adapted.</p><p><strong>You mentioned Apple is interested in its own ad business. The other thing they’re particularly interested in is in-app purchases. Their services revenue line is the one that’s growing as iPhone sales taper or even decline. I look at a show like Severance or Ted Lasso and I say, okay, that’s the shiny face on a huge revenue line that is mostly in-app purchases and games, right? Candy Crush whales are the growing business, and we just get Ted Lasso for free because we don’t want to talk about in-app purchases and games in that way.</strong></p><p>I think 60 percent of the app economy is actually the game economy.</p><p><strong>How much pressure do the platform vendors put on that? Because across the non-game iOS app ecosystem, the developers we talk to are basically just in full outrage mode, right? Apple calls them, they call it a shakedown. You can see various developers argue loudly for and against Apple. Sometimes the rules change. Sometimes all of Europe’s issues or regulations change the app store. The games industry has not been as loud, right? The game makers… In-app purchases make everybody money, and it seems to be left alone. Do you see that same conflict or that same angst there?</strong></p><div><p>Well, I think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050696/epic-games-tim-sweeney-apple-app-store-response">Tim Sweeney</a> at Epic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367904/epic-parody-apple-1984-ad-fortnite-removal-app-store">has been</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23500363/tim-sweeney-epic-games-ceo-interview-apple-app-store-google-legislaton">exceptionally loud</a>, in fairness.</p></div><p><strong>That’s true.</strong></p><p>But listen, I think that there’s a tension there, Nilay.</p><p><strong>Are you all just following behind him? Are you just letting him take the heat?</strong></p><p>Apple and Google are incredibly important partners to the industry. And they’re incredibly important partners of ours. They’re platform partners. They’re partners to our customers, and so there’s a tension. I think it’s probably a brilliant flash of the obvious to learn that folks would rather pay less. But I think what you’re seeing in the industry is tension between folks who are relatively small in the scheme of the world, have important partnerships, and probably don’t have a lot of interest or incentive to be at war with their biggest platform partners.</p><p><strong>Right, that’s why I’m asking about Tim. I was going to come to that. Most game makers are not willing to be at war. He is, because he has </strong><strong><em>Fortnite</em></strong><strong>, and that’s just a weapon that he can wield or shield, I suppose, from attacks he might face. No one else has that as far as I can tell. Is the industry just waiting to see what happens with Epic, or is there anything else concerted going on? Because I would say the pressure from the platforms is coming in different ways, particularly as different countries around the world regulate their fees and how open they have to be. They’re going to seek that revenue and games are already the largest portion of the revenue.</strong></p><p>I think your description of the landscape is accurate. There are clearly pressures, significant pressures, regulatory pressures in Europe, regulatory pressures in the U.S., lawsuits, alternative app stores, and new devices. These are all pressures. And I do think that that is a feature of the world we’re in right now, and I’m sure Apple and Google are feeling some pressure around those things.</p><p><strong>At the top of the episode, you were saying you perceive that there’s a lot of growth yet to come in the industry. You mentioned </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24284512/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-games-features"><strong>the Switch 2</strong></a><strong>. There’s a new console generation, there are new form factors, and potentially there’s new hardware that’s coming.</strong></p><p><strong>All of that is up against those pressures. That’s the escape valve. Apple can keep squeezing gaming on the iPhone for fees, but if you can escape and the business is actually on the Switch 2, that’ll relieve the pressure. If the business Ray-Ban AR games — let’s say that works — maybe relieves the pressure, you get some competitive relief there. What’s the number one relief valve that you see as being viable in the near term?</strong></p><p>Well, one of the things that’s really interesting in the most recent version of Unity we shipped has support for web GPU. I think web gaming is a really fascinating, really fast-growing part of our world, and it’s maybe a little bit back to the future. But I think that’s a great example of what you’re talking about.</p><p><strong>I see the web as an out for a lot of app store problems, and then there’s a lot of pressure on, are the browsers good enough? Are they being held back by the mobile vendors in particular? Do you see the browsers being held back? Is there something you want to do in the browser that you can’t do on a mobile phone?</strong></p><p>I think that as it relates to tools and standards there’s progress we need to make. But I’m optimistic about that, and again, I see web gaming exploding. I think we’ve largely got what we need, and you’re going to see more of it.</p><p><strong>Do you think that web gaming is on a phone, or on a desktop?</strong></p><p>I think principally you’ll be on your phone.</p><p><strong>So, you see people playing more games on mobile Safari.</strong></p><p>Why not?</p><p><strong>I think Apple at least thinks it’s “Why not?” That’s the problem.</strong></p><p>They might, well… I just think that the consumer will ultimately push people and partners where they have to be pushed. I think that. And I don’t know exactly how that’ll play out, but I don’t see Apple and Google as preventing web gaming.</p><p><strong>I’m curious because the other thing I see from our audience is, boy, people love building gaming PCs, and actually, that’s a relief valve in a way. People love the Steam Deck; that’s another relief that way. But it doesn’t seem like those are flickers of growth that would give you some relief from the pressure</strong>.</p><p>I am much more optimistic in a generalized sense about the industry than you are, so I wouldn’t say flickers and you’re making me feel sad about it. I don’t see it that way.</p><p><strong>I think the scene is real, but it’s not.</strong></p><p>It’s real. It sort of seems to be, it is what it is. It’s a sizable audience. I don’t know that it’s going to suddenly become more massive, a place of more massive consumer adoption. I think that we have… Gaming happens on your TV. It happens on your phone and happens on your PC. There’s overlap in some of those places. But we continue to be, I think, more of a lean-back society in the living room and a more on-the-go society than we are a sit-down-at-your-desktop society. I think you’ll see those two probably grow more quickly than the third.</p><p><strong>I want to be very clear for you and the listener, </strong><strong><em>The Verge</em></strong><strong> as an organization </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc"><strong>is very high on the Steam Deck</strong></a><strong>. I feel like if I didn’t assign other stories, we would only write about the Steam Deck. That might be the only thing that happens in our newsroom, but I also know who we are.</strong></p><p>We’re usually supportive of PC gaming too. As a tool, what we mostly think about is how can we ensure that whatever the new platforms are, we’re supporting them on day one so that developers can push to those platforms. We don’t have favorites. We don’t choose. We want to be everywhere, and that’s mostly how we think about that.</p><p><strong>The one thing that would change that is another idea that I think flashed really brightly, particularly during the pandemic, and then has maybe come back to Earth, which is the idea that we would stream the games. Unity would run on big data centers operated by Netflix or Microsoft or someone, and really what we’re doing is live-streaming video, which maybe requires a total re-architecture of the entire industry. Everyone loved this idea. This idea has not, I would say, panned out in any realistic way. Do you think it has a future?</strong></p><p>Not in the near term.</p><p><strong>Why is that?</strong></p><p>I don’t see it. I think the hurdles were a combination of technical, really hard problems to solve there. And I think it was a consumer solution looking for a problem that people didn’t have. It was like, “Well, I don’t know. I’m playing this game on my PlayStation or my PC. Why do I need to use my phone as a controller or get some other controller, because you want to delivery the game? I mean, okay, I downloaded the game last month. What are we talking about here?” I just don’t think consumers cared.</p><p><strong>I think there was some desire to play the games everywhere. I agree with you, it obviously didn’t happen. But the thing that really prevented it was that you couldn’t install a game streaming app on a mobile phone, which would have been, I think at least one thing to market as opposed to however the platforms wanted you to do it. Do you think if they opened that up it would become more viable?</strong></p><p>I don’t think, I don’t. Again, I think that the input device is maybe more important that people understand in this context. I don’t want to play Call of Duty on my phone with an external controller. And I want to pick a mobile version of Call of Duty, which is a different experience. I think different platforms should be developed as unique experiences. So, this idea that it was going to be this one version, which, I get it at a high level, at a technical level, but I don’t think consumers wanted it.</p><p><strong>I feel like I’m required by law to ask you about AI to wrap up this conversation. I have to say it’s been a relief to not be mostly talking about AI with a CEO. I appreciate that.</strong></p><p>I would never force you to talk about AI if you don’t want to.</p><p><strong>I appreciate it. If you listen to some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel">other episodes of <em>Decoder</em></a>, you can see, I’m just fighting it for an hour.</strong></p><p><strong>The games industry, like almost every creative industry, is in turmoil because of AI, right? The creatives are upset. We see video game voice actors <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630176/ashly-burch-sony-ai-horizon-aloy-tech-demo-sag-aftra-strike">putting out Instagram Reels</a> about having their voices cloned by AI for AI characters. You see entire games being made in AI. Actually, there’s a very funny video where someone claims a game is AI, but it’s actually just Elden Ring. That’s deeply amusing to me.</strong></p><p><strong>But you see this happening. I generated some simplistic game using AI. I </strong><a href="https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/silicon-valley-ceo-says-vibe-coding-lets-10-engineers-do-the-work-of-100-heres-how-to-use-it/"><strong>vibe coded</strong></a><strong> it here. I shipped it, we’re ready to go. And then you see the creatives in the industry really worried that their jobs will be taken over by AI. I know Unity is somewhat agnostic to this. I think that’s actually <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/unity-ceo-strives-for-execution-and-accountability-matthew-bromberg-interview/">the phrase you used</a>. “The Unity platform is agnostic to the derivation of the 3D asset,” but then there’s the actual making of the game. Then there’s who gets paid. There are layoffs across this industry for a variety of reasons and rethinking of cost structures. How do you see AI playing out?</strong></p><p>Yeah, this is a big topic and we could probably spend longer than you’d want to talk about it. I would say this, first, you’re right. We are agnostic with respect to where and how 3D assets get created because Unity is an assembly point. And it’s always been a place where you ingest or build the assets you want to build. You assemble the tools you want to assemble, and then you build these deep systems around them, which become fully formed games. I actually don’t think that any of the layoffs we’re seeing in gaming are driven by AI. I don’t think that. I think what video game developers and publishers will do, as we talked about a little bit earlier, is if they gain efficiencies in the making of games, I think they’ll make more games. And that’s where they’ll use that extra wiggle.</p><p>What we sort of believe will happen at the end of, maybe not the end, later in this process, is that there’ll be human creators sitting in the middle of the process of creation of these games, using a platform to create them. And they will have vertically oriented agents that are helping them do so. An agent that specializes in physics, an agent that specializes in sound, an agent that specializes in I.O., whatever it is. And there’ll be multiple people in that loop, and they will have those tools at their disposal, and they will need to bring them together in an interactive experience. We would like to continue to be at the center of that, and we think there is a need for a platform to be there. I think that it’s sort of a slightly Grognardian, boring point to make, but it’s critical. The biggest problem with either the creation of assets or even the full imagining of games, this hallucination of full game experiences, is that there’s no connection to workflows.</p><p>Games are massively deep systems, successful games, that need to be built around some of these assets and even some experiences. I think AI will be a really important part of putting those things together, but the systems, workflows, connections, how you manage large teams of people doing those things, and how we output and distribute those things — those are likely to be a part of this process for a really long time.</p><p><strong>We have talked about a lot of things that are pressure on the industry, and you’ve pointed out that you’re more optimistic. What are the things that are making you excited about the future of games right now?</strong></p><p>There almost isn’t anything that’s not making me excited about the future of games. Again, I see the difficulty we’re experiencing as this moment of creative destruction. One where the industry is going to have to reimagine itself to some degree, and that reimagination is going to take the form of innovation and gameplay, innovation and distribution, innovation and business models. And just we’re going to rethink. Just to take one example, because I think we haven’t talked about it, think about how meaningful game-related and actual property has become in the broader entertainment industry. That, by the way, was never true, until very recently, right? There had been a million unsuccessful movies and things that related to games, very few good ones. Now, suddenly there’s this whole other life. We’ve talked about some of the new possible distribution platforms, the shifts in the business models, and platform partners. All these things are opportunities. And yeah, we as companies… You feel pain and then you respond to that pain, and I think the history of the industry is that we innovate through those things.</p><p><strong>Do you agree with me that </strong><strong><em>Uncharted </em></strong><strong>would’ve been better as a long-running series instead of </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/17/22937238/uncharted-movie-review"><strong>a movie</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p><p>I do.</p><p><strong>This is my thesis. Adaptations got good when we started making TV shows out of them, not movies.</strong></p><div><p>It’s easier. Yeah. I mean, even though I think <em>The Witcher</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill">was good as a series</a>, at least <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23808594/the-witcher-season-3-volume-2-finale-review-netflix-henry-cavill">initially</a>.</p></div><p><strong>Spicy take.</strong></p><p>I know. I know. I’m sorry. I enjoyed it.</p><p><strong><em>Fallout</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p><p><em>Fallout </em>was great. Listen, I think there are a lot of things that are better in that form than a full movie form.</p><p><strong>All right, well, Matt, we’re going to have to have you back and only talk about video game adaptations for a full hour.

So obviously, there are deals on all sorts of storage today, including SSDs and microSD cards. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Ffind%2FdealZone.jsp" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> is making a big thing out of its deals, and with this being the final day of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/634880/amazon-big-spring-sale-march-2025-prime-day-deals-shop">Amazon’s Big Spring Sale</a>, there are many discounts happening there, too.</p><p>The one that popped out to me immediately as being exemplary is a 26 percent discount on the <strong>1TB</strong> <strong>WD Black C50</strong> expansion card that can fit in an Xbox Series X or Series S console. It typically hovers around $150, which is criminal for 1TB of storage, but you can snag it now at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/296xkk8qih1xd">Best Buy</a> for a much more reasonable $109.99. It’s never a bad idea to snag one of these. You don’t need me to remind you that game install sizes are getting huge, and with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23987993/gta-6-news-trailers-rockstar-games">Grand Theft Auto VI</a></em> set to come out sometime this year, you’ll likely want the extra space.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->110</span></p><div><p>Western Digital’s storage expansion cards for Xbox Series X / S consoles are speedy, plug-and-play cards that match the performance of the consoles’ onboard SSDs.

It might not sound like much of a deal, but this is the most sizable discount we’ve spotted yet on this charger.</p><p>In addition to being able to charge multiple devices without the need to buy extra cables, it’s worth pointing out that this battery supports passthrough charging, letting it quickly charge a device while being charged itself. Its USB-C ports support up to 165W of power when just two devices are plugged in, or 130W when three or four are tapping into its juice.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->88</span></p><div><p>Anker’s latest power bank sports three USB-C ports, plus one USB-A port.

It’s a running deal, so Woot must have plenty of stock, but I like to point readers to this discount occasionally. Whether you’re dipping into podcasting, or just want to sound good while gaming and during video calls, there’s no reason to spend over $100 without first seeing if this mic under $20 can suit your needs.

It’s listed as normally having a $99.49 MSRP, but you can get one for a very reasonable $69.99. While it lacks a built-in heatsink, making it a plug-and-play affair with PS5, you can buy a heatsink for about $10 (here’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heatsink-Cooler-Double-Sided-Thermal-Silicone/dp/B09DBF8FX1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">one</a> of many examples) and easily add it on yourself with next to no technical knowledge required.</span></li><li><span>We’ve covered this deal before, but it bears repeating: you can get a good 48-inch OLED TV for just $549.99 at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/fb2i4rixxpjc4">Best Buy</a>. This deal is on the <strong>LG B4</strong>, which unlike the previous generation B3 has four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two.

			<p>A remaster of The Sinking City, the Lovecraft-inspired open-world detective game released back in 2019 by Frogwares on PC and consoles, has been announced today ahead of the end of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-qa-frogwares-on-renewed-combat-focus-ue5-switch-and-continued-war-impact/">sequel</a>'s <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-shows-off-gameplay-and-launches-kickstarter-campaign/">Kickstarter campaign</a> conclusion.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the remaster, which will be available for free to all owners of the original game on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, will feature an upgraded visual experience, sporting 4K textures, new lighting, improved detail and reflections, 4K textures, support for NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and TSR upscaling and more. The Sinking City Remastered will also feature some requested quality-of-life features as well as a brand-new Photo Mode, providing players with plenty of reasons to dive back into the flooded city of Oakmont together with Charles Reed.</p>

<p>The upgraded visuals featured in The Sinking City Remastered will make the experience even more immersive, as the original game definitely nailed the atmosphere. Hopefully, the quality-of-life improvements will make the game more fun to play, especially the combat, which I found pretty lacking compared to the excellent investigation mechanics, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-sinking-city-strongest-fear-unknown/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Sinking City is probably the best Lovecraft-inspired game currently available on the market, thanks to its oppressive atmosphere and its story, which utilizes the lore masterfully without deviating from the canon. AI and technical issues, as well as the clunky combat, are often immersion-breaking, but the excellent investigation mechanics and exploration features make it easy to look past these issues. Highly recommended to survival horror fans and those who live and breathe Lovecraft.</em></p>
<p>The Sinking City Remastered launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

This is where their most obvious differences come into play: mobility and defense. The Heavy Bowgun, true to its name,restricts your hunter to pretty slow movement. For the cost of slow movement, however, this weapon lets you guard and even trigger a Power Clash against monster attacks.</p><p>The Light Bowgun doesn’t slow your hunter down and ends up feeling a lot smoother in comparison. It lacks the option to guard, but offsets this with fun movement options such as a sidestep and slide. Rapid Fire Mode expands upon these and incorporates a strafing dodge that lets you keep shooting called Burst Step.</p><p>I’ll also add that both weapons (and in particular the Heavy Bowgun) are great to use on your Seikret. Being limited to only standard fire and Focus Blasts while mounted isn’t that restrictive with so many ammo types.</p><h2 id="h267827"><a id=""></a>Rate of fire and damage</h2><figure id="" data-id="133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-recommend-id="image://133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-recommend-id="image://133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Although the standard fire for either weapon can use the same ammo, there are still some important differences. With the Heavy Bowgun, you’ll deal with a slower rate of fire and strong damage numbers. The range for critical damage also tends to be a bit farther away from your targets.</p><p>All of that is naturally reversed with the Light Bowgun. Your shots come out faster, but they won’t hit as hard. I’ve also noticed that the critical damage range is comparatively closer across all ammo types.</p><h2 id="h267828"><a id=""></a>Special modes and ammo</h2><figure id="" data-id="fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-recommend-id="image://fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-recommend-id="image://fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each of these has access to a secondary firing mode and choices for Special Ammo.

When it comes to the Bowguns, some ammo types are just a better fit on one or the other. Pierce Ammo is arguably the best ammo type in the game and works well for either weapon. I’ve enjoyed using it on the Heavy Bowgun more, simply due to how much damage it does.</p><p>Ammo associated with elements or status ailments meanwhile shine with the Light Bowgun. Any extra elemental-based damage adds up nicely with all the rounds you shoot off. Similarly, it’s a lot easier to trigger a status effect when you’re constantly hitting a monster with status ailment ammo.</p><p>Both bowguns are fantastic tools that serve as excellent secondary weapons if you prefer having a melee as your primary.

<p>A Minecraft Movie is one of the biggest movie prospects in 2025, and while promoting it, Jason Momoa told journalists that he doesn’t let his kids play video games or have phones.</p>



<p>Jason Momoa plays Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-minecraft-movies-cast-in-the-game-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Minecraft Movie</a>. The character has become one of the most iconic images from each trailer. Aside from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jack-black-has-logged-more-than-100-hours-on-minecraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Black</a>, Momoa is easily the biggest star power. It’s hard to see A Minecraft Movie not doing well, and it’s likely to help the already-enormously successful franchise.</p>



<p>While promoting A Minecraft Movie, Momoa shared fascinating details about his kids and specific strict measures he implements.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It’s a strict lifestyle. Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://x.com/Deadline/with_replies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Momoa was asked if his children play video games. The actor answered frankly: “We don’t have a TV, my son doesn’t even have a phone. He’s 16 and doesn’t have a phone—we’re different dude. Sorry, man.”</p>



<p>The actor explained that his son can have a phone when he turns 18, and “explore the world” after that. Momoa justified the decision by saying he wants his kids to “use their creativity in a different way.” He also adds that he didn’t grow up with a phone and “everyone was doing just fine” without them.</p>



<p>You can see the full exchange for yourself.</p>



<div><article><p><span>‘A Minecraft Movie’ star Jason Momoa on why he doesn’t let his kids play video games or have phones: “We’re different dude. I just want them to use their creativity in a different way”</span></p></article></div>



<p>It’s a unique way of operating life, of course, but it’s interesting to see one of A Minecraft Movie’s key stars admitting he doesn’t let his kids play video games when he’s starring in an overtly video-game movie.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-early-access-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Game of Thrones franchise is one of the most popular in modern entertainment history. Unfortunately, for as well-received as the books and shows have been, the games—for the most part—have left a lot to be desired. For developer Netmarble, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is an attempt to turn that around and release a new game in the series that will have people talking.</p>



<p>Sadly, the type of talking most people will have about this game is its uninspired gameplay and heavy monetization practices.</p>



<h2 id="h-game-of-thrones-kingsroad-early-access-review">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad Early Access Review</h2>



<p>As the title mentions, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">currently in early access</a>. While the game will be free-to-play once out of early access, those who want to play now will have to buy one of three bundles of the game. The cheapest is the standard pack for $24.99 while the most expensive, the Ultimate Pack, costs $89.99. Each of the three packs come with access to the game along with various benefits like Iron Bank Marks, outfits, emojis, and even battle pass access for the two higher bundles.</p>



<p>Without giving away much in terms of spoilers, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad’s story takes place during the fourth season of the show. You play as a brand new character to the world who is the heir to House Tyre.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting started, you pick one of three classes—knight, sellsword, or assassin—and create your character using a pretty limited character creator. I mean, you can’t even make yourself bald. What’s up with that?</p>



<p>In and of itself, the story isn’t too bad. The dialogue is solid, and nothing feels out of place as you play. What does feel out of place, though, are the animations. In an area where the game feels exactly like a mobile game or something from the mid-to-late 2000s, everyone’s mouth either looks like it’s chewing the words being said or is nowhere close to how it should be. In some cases, you kind of feel like you are watching a 1970s kung fu movie with English voiceovers. And yes, I likely dated myself with that reference.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Moving on to gameplay, there’s nothing really special to write home about. It’s your typical action RPG with your basic attacks, special attacks, blocking, and dodging. Most of the moves look solid, but there’s no weight behind the attacks. Every swing of a weapon or kick you make just feels like you are swinging around the lightest paper towel tube. Even dry pool noodles feel like there’s more power behind attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other animations also feel janky, such as any movement in a diagonal direction. Whether you are running, walking or riding a horse, it all looks and feels like your characters are sliding around and/or floating. Like the attacks, there’s no weight behind what’s being done. It just all feels like going through the motion with no sense of reward for anything you do.</p>



<p>There are three different trait trees—attack, defense, and support—that you can progress through as you play. They add things like increased damage, mount stamina, parrying ability, and other skill improvements that you’d expect. They are fine for what they are, but the trees are so small that it just feels like something to be added to the game rather than help improve your play.</p>



<p>One other area with the game that bothers me is with your equipment. You can buy, find, and unlock better equipment like other games. But, when you equip them, you don’t see it. It’s there, but the only look you have is the basis of your character. Get a rare set of gloves to equip? They are there in stats only. Some might not care about it, but not being able to see the gear I’ve found is a major turn off with games like this.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-the-mobile-monetization">The Mobile Monetization</h3>



<p>Now onto what is, arguably, the most frustrating of the game: the microtransactions. First things first, this is going to be a free-to-play game, so in-app purchases are expected. However, there’s a way to do it right and then the way Game of Thrones: Kingsroad does them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As expected, there are various cosmetics that you can pay to unlock for your character. That’s the norm in almost every game, free or paid, at this point. The problem lies in some obvious cash grabs within the game right now.</p>



<p>Should you die and you want to revive with your health, it’ll cost you copper. Want to fast travel to an area you unlocked? It’ll cost you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early on in the game it’s not too bad, but the further into the game you go, the more and more tedious it becomes. There are energy restrictions throughout, and timegating becomes a major concern that will make you feel like you wasted the dozen or so hours you have spent in the game to that point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game is advertised as co-op, but only dungeons are able to be played with friends. Oh, and that’s another area where an in-game currency is needed in order to access. It’s easy to continue on with the problematic monetization practices, but it’s not really worth rambling at this point.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-game-of-thrones-kingsroad-review-verdict">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad Review Verdict</h3>



<p>Don’t let the fact that it’s available on PC fool you, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is a mobile game. It looks like a mobile game and plays like one, too. While in 2025 that’s not necessarily a bad thing, it’s when it attempts to pass itself off as something more that it becomes an issue.</p>



<p>At this present moment, it’s hard to tell anyone not to hold off for the game to go free-to-play after the early access period ends. Even then, with the heavy—and I mean heavy—microtransaction push, the lack of exciting gameplay and frustrating animation issues, this is one trip to Westeros you’re better off postponing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>VERDICT: SKIP</strong></p>

<p>But, what of those projects that are yet to be announced? Well, I for one am now very hopeful for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-reportedly-real">that long rumoured remake of</a> - in my humble opinion - one of the best Final Fantasy games yet. My goodness, how I wanted to be Garnet. I hold her and April O'Neil responsible for my love of yellow clothing.</p>
<p>And, I am not alone in hoping that a Final Fantasy 9 remake will soon actually materialise. "I beg you square enix please let there be a remake," <a href="https://x.com/SiKthYEXP/status/1906662931061784939">reads one comment on social media</a>. Plenty of others echo this sentiment, with variations on the begging and praying post found scattershotted in replies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some are now speculating we will hear more about this hypothetical Final Fantasy 9 remake during Nintendo's dedicated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> Direct, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">scheduled for this Wednesday</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pocketpair-announces-palworld-dating-sim/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The April Fool's dating sim from Pocketpair has made a return, and this time, it doesn't seem to be a joke. Last year, Pocketpair released a trailer for a dating sim called Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~, where it was released as an April Fools joke.</p>
<p>However, today, Pocketpair has released another trailer for Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~, an the game seems legitimate and actively developing. So, for those who want to date some of the pals you find in Palworld, this will be your opportunity. There is now an <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/?snr=1_5_1100__1100&amp;utm_source=steamwidget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active Steam page</a> for the game, where you can wishlist it and get a little bit more information about what the game will be.</p>
<p>Below is the trailer that was released today by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">Palworld developers</a>. From the description on the YouTube video, it seems that the game will be available to wishlist on Steam and the PlayStation Store. Thus far, there is no mention of whether this will be available on Nintendo Switch or Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~ | 2nd trailer | Palworld | Pocketpair" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZUpilXM6638?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this title, you enroll as a transfer student in the Palpagos Private Academy, where you will be introduced to some unique friends (pals) and get to enjoy the school life alongside them, with the option to romance them along the way. You can choose whether you stay friends with them or work on a romantic relationship with them. There is also the third option of dismembering and eating them if you want a touch of horror to your gaming experience.</p>
<p>The Steam Page for Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~ also reveals some of the students that you will meet, including Lovander, Chillet, Zoe, Chillet Ignis, Quivern, Nurse Saya, Tarantriss, and more. It seems that there is a wide range of options for those who want to participate in learning the stories of each character, with some seeming on a bit of the darker side of things.</p>
<p>From the screenshots available, it seems to share similarities to Doki Doki Literature Club, luring you into a false sense of security. There are two trailers for the game, with one of them being the trailer that was released as an April Fool's joke last year.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no set release date for this title, and the announcement has come very suspiciously close to April Fool's once again. The Pocketpair Community Manager, John "Bucky" Buckley, assured Eurogamer that this is, in fact, legitimate and not another April Fool's joke.</p>
<p>So, will you be playing Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~?</p>

            <p>Ahead of this Friday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-will-release-on-pc-in-april-adding-a-grand-hub-mizutsune-and-new-quests">big content update</a> for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, Capcom have put out a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter/">new blog from director Yuya Tokuda</a>, detailing more scaly, slimy, and shiny additions. The main theme here is "harder fights", with arch-tempered variants of monsters besides the announced Ray Dau. But there's plenty of other planned smaller tweaks and goodies, including a reduction in VRAM usage coming "very soon".</p>
<p>Friday's update includes long n' purple Mizutsune, plus repeatable fights with Zoh Shia, previously a one-off story monster. There's also a new gathering hub, which I'm especially happy about - I miss what I once referred to as "Astera's gung-ho trumpetbastardry". I want to see people and I want to see lights, and I also want to see virtuosic cat chefs.</p>

<p>That's all ancient soup though, so what's new? First, there's seasonal event Festival of Accord: Blossomdance starting April 22nd. These are limited events that offer new cosmetic gear, gestures, and decorations, with the titular blossoms being a theme this go around. April 30th brings a limited time arch-tempered Ray Dau event, with a permanent free hunt from May 7th. At least, this is what the text says, the image above seems to contradict that. Either way, arch-tempered Raymond is on the way.</p>
<p>Then, at the end of May, there's a 'Capcom collaboration', plus additional features. Monster Hunter World featured a Dante (from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a> series) set, so I'm assuming it's something similar. I'll avoid any easy wanking jokes about Capcom 'collaborating' with itself, obviously.  Finally, there's another big update due sometime in Summer, fonted as such to suggest a similar sized offering to Friday's monst drop.</p>
<p>Tokuda then goes into details about future plans. First up: more 8 Star Tempered Monst in the vein of Tempered Arkveld, with Tempered Mizutsune being the first. "In addition, the update at the end of May will add the Tempered Monsters (★8) Gore Magala and the apex predators of each locale: Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad," say Capcom.</p>
<p>Next, there's balance adjustments across the board, with hammer buffs and corruption mantle nerfs mentioned specifically. There's some quality of life bits mentioned, specifically "the ease of restocking items, checking skill information, participating in multiplayer quests and using the Seikret; and camera behaviour during hunts". A bit later on, there's also the mention of layered weapons, endemic life previews, and "a wider look at overall gameplay flow, which encompasses a range of things, such as the in-game economy, balance and other areas".</p>
<p>In terms of PC performance, Capcom say the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>The team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements where possible, especially on the Steam version. This will be an ongoing process, where we'll aim to make continual steps forward in this area and respond to critical issues.</p>
<p>Improvements coming very soon include a reduction in VRAM usage and an upgrade to the DirectStorage version of the Steam version in Free Title Update 1. These should result in an overall improvement in stability for our PC players.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jubilant news indeed. If you're still having issues with performance and/or general ugliness, I found that the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/93">REFramework</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/245">Disable Lens Distortion</a> mods work wonders, although official improvements are obviously welcome. Now give me an Arch Tempered Greater Jagras. He deserves revenge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m 90 percent sure it was just because we could carry him. I was like a 12-year-old Hanzo main who was barely in Silver. He was a Bronze Torbjörn main. He was fucking dogshit. Awful. Like, godawful. So no, I don’t believe the fucking- ‘I am a pro <em>Path of Exile</em> whatever the fuck.’ Like, no the fuck you are not. This is so cringe. Why would you even pretend to be? It’s fine not to be a gamer.”</p><p>The Bronze ranking is funny enough on its own, but the revelation that he was having such a hard time climbing the ranks as Torbjörn, arguably one of the lower-skill heroes on the roster, is also pretty good. However, nothing beats knowing he had to force pre-teens to help him climb out of the Bronze hole into the illustrious ranks of…Silver.</p><p>All of this comes after years of Musk trying to position himself as a pro-level gamer in games like <em>Path of Exile 2 </em>and <em>Diablo IV</em>, seemingly in an attempt to buy credibility in the eyes of nerd followers who will stroke his ego on X and elsewhere. As his business ventures have grown over the years, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-asmongold-poe-2-account-boosting-controversy-1851741223&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-asmongold-poe-2-account-boosting-controversy-1851741223">people have become increasingly skeptical of his claims</a></span> because one person running half a dozen companies likely doesn’t have time to be sinking hundreds of hours into grinding away at video games. Now we have another story to add to the fake gamer saga, and the evidence is really piling up. I don’t care that Musk might not be good at video games, but it’s pretty funny that he’s so desperate for people to think he is.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/when-will-gta-6-trailer-2-come-out-take-two-boss-says-its-better-to-provide-marketing-materials-relatively-close-to-the-release-window<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It might be a while yet before we get Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 2, after comments from the boss of Rockstar’s parent company revealed his preference for releasing marketing materials relatively close to a release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-rockstar-officially-unveils-first-trailer-early-after-leak"><u>Rockstar released GTA 6 Trailer 1 to record-breaking viewership</u></a> in December 2023, but it hasn’t released a single asset since. The 15-month wait for more information has fueled increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories about when Rockstar will release GTA 6 Trailer 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These have included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/on-the-gta-6-trailers-1-year-anniversary-fans-are-debating-youtube-playlist-updates-and-batting-away-misleading-ai-generated-images"><u>counting the holes in Lucia’s cell door net</u></a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/were-now-at-the-bullet-holes-and-braille-stage-of-gta-6-fan-theory"><u>bullet holes in the car from Trailer 1</u></a>, and even registration plates. But chief among the conspiracy theories is GTA 6’s ongoing moon watch, which was, remarkably, proven to have accurately predicted the date Rockstar announced when it would release GTA 6 Trailer 1, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect"><u>debunked as a hint at the release date for Trailer 2</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the big question right now is, when <em>will</em> GTA 6 Trailer 2 be released? We’re no closer to finding out, but based on comments from Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick, fans may have to wait until much closer to GTA 6’s actual release date for their next look at the most anticipated video game in the world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/0M53-LKlECk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Zelnick was asked straight up: why is GTA 6’s release date such a carefully held secret?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property," Zelnick replied. "And I’ve been around the block a few times and I’ve been in every entertainment business there is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. And we do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance. And we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation. We don’t always get it exactly right, but that’s what we are trying to do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few things worth digging into here. The first is Zelnick’s comments about keeping GTA 6’s release date such a carefully held secret “to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.” That’s something fans and the media alike have assumed to be true, and indeed former Rockstar developers have tried to explain is true.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Key Art's Hidden Map..?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mike York, who worked as an animator at Rockstar New England for six years helping to build Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 before leaving the company in 2017, said on <a href="https://youtu.be/TnTIV8AFs2o?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>his YouTube channel</u></a> that Rockstar is playing up to the conspiracy theories, deliberately avoiding saying anything about the game or when Trailer 2 will be released in order to fuel even more speculation within the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They're reaching and pulling and trying to come up with these really cool theories to decipher when the next trailer will be,” he said of fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Specifically Rockstar, they're very secretive about what they do, and this is a really cool tactic because it creates allure and it creates mystery and it creates people talking about it without them having to do anything. The more they're silent the better it is, because the more people will be antsy and want to talk about it and have this feeling of not knowing what's going to happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">York went on to say that Rockstar is likely resisting pressure from its army of fans to announce the GTA 6 Trailer 2 release date for this exact reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They could easily release the trailer date and be like, ‘Hey this is when the trailer's coming out,’ but they don't do it. And they don't do it on purpose because it's a really, really good marketing tactic. If you think about it, it creates these really cool theories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This brings the fans together. This is a really cool way to get fans to talk about your game when you’re not releasing anything yet, in-between the times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All these theories are great. They only create hype, they create talk, they create mystery behind the games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second thing worth pulling out of Zelnick’s quote is the suggestion that GTA 6 Trailer 2 won’t be released until we’re closer to the game’s actual release date in fall 2025 (assuming it’s not delayed). If that’s true, it may be half a year before we get another look at GTA 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait for GTA 6 to come out, check out IGN’s coverage of an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, Take-Two boss Strauss <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6"><u>Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

More Than Just Pals, a dating sim set in its massively popular monster-catching universe — and no, it’s not an April Fools’ Day joke (this time).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind 2024’s Pokémon-like survival experience revealed its plans to inject a bit of romance into its catalog today, March 31. It’s an announcement that, on any other day of the year, fans would accept without question. However, April Fools’ Day gags, fake games, and more strange announcements from game developers will surely flood the internet as soon as the new month rolls in tomorrow, so most fans are already taking Palworld!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-weve-played-it.1149837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-weve-played-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I went into my hands-on with Doom: The Dark Ages I was prepared for intense violence and high volume heavy metal, but what I didn’t count on was such an exhilarating amount of demon-killing variety. By the end of my two-hour demo I’d used a saw-toothed shield to slice through demons like it was Beelzebub’s Beyblade, stomped around a war-ravaged city as a colossal Mecha-Slayer, and even brought a snarling Cyberdemon to an explosive end by breathing fire directly down its throat with my faithful dragon steed – which seemed as though it had come to life from one of the sketches I used to draw in the margins of my high school maths books. In fact, every aspect of it looked and felt incredible. It may take place in the dark ages of the Doom timeline, but the Slayer’s latest slaughterfest might well represent the peak of the series’s modern era.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with the most crucial new change: the shield. While 2016’s Doom was focussed on run and gun, and 2020’s Doom Eternal evolved into jump and shoot, the core combat principle of Doom: The Dark Ages is to stand and fight. That’s not to say I wasn’t immediately strafing through the strife as I met each new wave of Satan’s soldiers, but the Doom Slayer’s new shield allowed me to hold my ground and block or parry enemy attacks, and even deflect projectiles back at them whenever I managed to nail the timing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to which enemy attacks can be deflected and which can’t, it’s basically traffic light rules – red means stop and green means go. Or for Star Wars fans, red is bad and green is good. The point is, you must constantly stay on the move to weave your way through the red waves of enemy fire, but the moment you see a green burst you need to dash towards the danger in order to perfectly bat back everything from searing bolts of energy fired by enemy archers to the deadly volleys launched by the hulking Hell Tanks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Dark Ages’ shield makes the new Doom feel like the greatest unofficial Captain America game ever made.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It introduces a welcome new test of your timing and positioning on top of the already high intensity gunplay – which has also been revitalised by an awe-inspiring arsenal that includes a machine gun that crushes skulls and spits out shards of bone and just might be the most heavy metal weapon ever conceived – but the shield isn’t there simply to block and deflect. It can also bare the brunt of a powerful lunging bash that instantly closes the distance between you and your target, and you can even rev up its spinning saw-toothed edge like a chainsaw and hurl it. The shield will pinball through crowds of weaker enemies like the Imps, or it can be lodged straight into the sternums of the beefier Imp Walkers to stun-lock them in place while you mop up the lesser minions around them. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Doom: The Dark Ages - Preview Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Slayer’s shield can also work in tandem with your bulging bag of boomsticks in some incredibly satisfying ways. Come up against a platoon of soldiers marching behind seemingly impenetrable steel shields of their own? Just pump a few super shotgun rounds into their metal mobile cover to heat it until it’s visibly molten, before frisbeeing your shield straight at them to ignite the entire group and shower yourself in valuable armour pickups from the resulting explosion.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Ages’ shield is perhaps the most devastating interpretation of the phrase ‘the best offense is a good defense’, and it makes the new Doom feel like the greatest unofficial Captain America game ever made. Only, instead of fighting an army of Nazis you’re battling the most evil villains that Hell has to offer. Which, I suppose, are both one and the same.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any rate, no sooner had I settled into The Dark Ages’ sensational new shield-wielding combat system, than I was suddenly whisked into the cockpit of a massive Mecha-Slayer to take on the tallest terrors to ever emerge from a Hell portal. The Atlan assault mechs have only been teased in the past couple of Doom games, but in The Dark Ages they’re finally pilotable, and I was absolutely thrilled to get behind the controls of one of these green-helmed goliaths in order to raise some hell. Or should I say, raze some hell, as I stomped out tiny tanks and crashed through bridges lined with troops on my way to going toe to towering toe with each Titan demon trying to take me down.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best of First-Person Shooter Campaigns</h3><p>It’s easy to immediately think of classic multiplayer matches and modes when thinking about the history of first-person shooters, but the genre is full of captivating campaigns and memorable stories.  From the far-reaches of the galaxy to the literal pits of hell – and everywhere</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Doom: The Dark Ages takes the series’ signature ultra violence and literally elevates it into Kaiju-sized carnage. Its Atlan combat is simple in setup but seriously satisfying in execution, as you repeatedly pump the right trigger to unleash combos with a pair of school bus-sized fists, with each successful blow you land filling up a special meter consisting of two halves. Fill it halfway and you can deliver a powerful stomp that sends a shockwave through the earth below and opens up cracks of damaging lava that stagger your opponent. Fill it completely and you can deal a devastating finishing move to force Lucifer’s leviathans to go in peace. Or more specifically, in freshly shredded pieces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like your 50-storey-tall fisticuffs with a side order of gargantuan guns then fear not, because midway through the level a whopper of a weapon drop gave my mech access to a machine gun so large it could use an aeroplane hanger for a holster. Performing perfect dodges on incoming enemy attacks powers up both barrels of this not-so-mini-gun, and I was soon blasting gloriously gory chunks of flesh off each Titan’s torso that showered on the soldiers below. You don’t normally see this much raining blood without buying a ticket to a Slayer concert and sticking around for the encore.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You don’t normally see this much raining blood without buying a ticket to a Slayer concert and sticking around for the encore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately I was only given the smallest taste of these supersized shootouts, since my hands-on quickly switched tracks from Godzilla to Game of Thrones as I slipped out of the Atlan’s cockpit and into the saddle of a cybernetic dragon, complete with twin cannons and a pair of dazzling laser wings. Soaring through the skies above a humungous holy city, I took the fight to a series of Hell Carrier airships, again performing perfect dodges to power up my attacks to demolish the artillery along their sides and the deadly assault cannons atop their hulls. With each airship’s defenses down, I was then able to swoop down to its exposed landing zone, leap off my dragon to briefly blast through Hades’ hordes on the flight deck, before shield-bashing into its central power core and forcing the whole thing to erupt like a Hellspawned Hindenburg, as I flew to safety aboard my scaly skybound steed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both the Atlan and cyberdragon sections proved to be propulsive palette cleansers rich with spectacle, but I was itchin’ for more of that bitchin’ shield and shoot ’em up action. Thankfully the Slayer was soon brought back down to earth to unleash further terror on terra firma as my hands-on finished with a taste of one of Doom: The Dark Ages’ sprawling sandbox levels. While the previous gameplay stretches were dynamic but somewhat directed action set pieces, this bumper battlefield level dubbed The Siege gave me the freedom to tackle its objectives in any order and progress through it entirely at my own pace.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thus, in between exhilarating encounters with waves of heavily armoured Mancubuses and shield-based slugfests with super heavy Cyberdemons, I was also able to scour the landscape in all directions for gold to spend on weapon upgrades, collectible toys, and even brand new guns to add to my growing arsenal of demon-destroyers. This included the Reaver Chainshot, which delivered powerful charged up attacks that basically allowed me to fire a cannon ball to instantly mulch a monster, before retracting it on a chain and firing it again to crush their minion mate beside them. Kind of like a Chain Chomp but not nearly as adorable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The expanded map also provided plenty of nooks and crannies to hunt through for health and armour pickups, including melee ammo for the Slayer’s new flail and electrified gauntlet attacks. That’s right, as if the Slayer wasn’t already badarse enough, he now manually reloads his punches like he’s Henry Cavill in the bathroom brawl scene from Mission: Impossible - Fallout. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The overall impression I got from The Dark Ages’ Siege map is that, although it’s large in size, it’s still dense with breathtaking discoveries and diverse encounters. Some open-field fights locked mini-bosses behind a morale meter, keeping them immune to my attacks until I’d hustled to take out a few dozen of their underlings. Other caves I explored featured almost no combat at all, instead challenging me to use my shield for environmental puzzle-solving, either as a grappling hook to launch me to otherwise unreachable areas or a tool to manipulate the controls of a variety of arcane machines. There were wonderful surprises almost everywhere I looked, but also some not so wonderful ones… like the giant tentacle that suddenly emerged from the ground beneath my feet in a swamp area and turned me from unstoppable beast to recently deceased in an instant.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that, my time in the Slayer’s combat boots was up, and what a brief but utterly brilliant ride it had been. If this small taste is anything to go by, then I'm pretty sure that the only reason id Software is calling this one Doom: The Dark Ages is because the title of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-ultimate-doom">The Ultimate Doom</a> was already taken three decades ago. From its satisfying shield-based combat shake-up and enticing sandbox level structures, to its Pacific Rim-rocking skyscraper-sized beatdowns and its dazzling dragon-riding dogfights, the team behind Doom: The Dark Ages is seemingly throwing everything but Hell’s kitchen sink into making this the biggest and best campaign seen to date in the seminal shooter series.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Doom: The Dark Ages seems to have the flexibility to allow any level of player to become a god tier Slayer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also set to be the most accessible. If you’ve ever wanted in on the wanton demon destruction but have previously been too intimidated to try, Doom: The Dark Ages looks to have you covered. Not only is there an expanded number of difficulty settings to choose from this time, with six different levels of challenge from the exceedingly gentle Aspiring Slayer to the absolutely mental Ultra Nightmare, but there are also tools to tweak almost every aspect of the experience. That includes sliders to adjust everything from parry timing windows to the damage dealt from each attack, and the overall speed of the action. Whether you want it to be a friction-free power trip or a synapse-straining punishment, Doom: The Dark Ages seems to have the flexibility to allow any level of player to become a god tier Slayer. What’s more, since it’s a prequel to the 2016 reboot, you can go in completely fresh even if you have NFI what a BFG is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom: The Dark Ages is set to arrive on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 15th. Until then, if you want a daily dose of doom, you could just spend a few minutes scrolling through social media. But if you want more Doom: The Dark Ages, be sure to check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/doom-the-dark-ages-developers-discuss-the-future-of-doom">interview with the team at id Software</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/doom-the-dark-ages-gameplay-overview-xbox-developer-direct-2025">gameplay overview trailer</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a Senior Video Producer at IGN's Sydney office.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-ghost-of-ytei-gets-new-story-info-commits-to-2025-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">We haven’t heard much about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> in recent months, but after fans spotted a morsel of new story information published to the game’s website, they’re having fun speculating about how Sucker Punch’s hotly anticipated PlayStation 5 exclusive will actually play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a> includes the following story snippet:</p><blockquote>300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, a new warrior – Atsu – rises from the ashes of her homestead.</blockquote><blockquote>Filled with fury and determination, Atsu will hunt down those responsible for the death of her family and exact her revenge. Every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the Ghost, will be up to you.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">We already knew Ghost of Yōtei’s setting and the time period, and that Atsu was on a revenge mission of some kind. But what we didn’t know was that she’s hunting down those responsible for the death of her family after her homestead is destroyed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s the mention that “every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the Ghost, will be up to you.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are speculating that Ghost of Yōtei will have a bounty hunting mechanic in which Atsu takes on jobs to earn money needed for other things in the game. There’s the potential here, then, for an actual in-game economy, where Tsushima didn’t really have any sort of money mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If true, this may tap into Sucker Punch’s stated goal of giving players more control over Atsu's story. Creative director Jason Connell has said that one of the changes compared to Ghost of Tsushima will be a less repetitive open world: “One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the  repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again. We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ghost of Yotei</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the website retreads old ground, mentioning new weapon types (ōdachi, kusarigama, and dual katanas), “massive sightlines that let you look far across the environment, skies of twinkling stars and auroras, and vegetation that sways believably in the wind,” and “enhanced performance and visuals on PlayStation 5 Pro.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s the crucial point: the website lists 2025 as the release window for Ghost of Yōtei. There’s been much talk about Sony maybe waiting for Rockstar to announce GTA 6’s release date so it can make sure Ghost of Yōtei doesn’t clash. GTA 6 is currently set for a vague fall 2025 launch, but some are wondering if parent company Take-Two will delay the game into the winter or potentially beyond. With that in mind, perhaps Ghost of Yōtei will release this summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the release date, it does feel like things may be ramping up for Ghost of Yōtei. Hopefully we'll hear and see more soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-pals-in-palworld/2900-5039/" data-ref-id="2900-5039">Palworld</a> established itself by doing things that Nintendo would never do with Pokemon, including arming pals with lethal weapons. Now, Palworld developer Pocketpair has revisited its 2024 April Fool's Day joke with a new look at Palworld: More Than Just Pals, which lets players romantically court pals and even date them. And what started out as a joke could be real this time. </p><p>Even if this new update is just a continuation of the original joke, some of the Pocketpair devs clearly put a a lot of work into this one. Palworld: More Than Just Pals <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has a page on Steam</a> with multiple screenshots, and a detailed breakdown of some the characters that the players can supposedly pursue. Most of the romantic options are for pals, but there's one adult, Nurse Saya, that players can also flirt with. Most of the main characters are showcased in the announcement trailer that was created for the game and published a year ago.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep4kasLrZug" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ep4kasLrZug" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The newly released second trailer continues the flirtations as Nurse Saya and the pals practically throw themselves at the players-character.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUpilXM6638" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZUpilXM6638" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Palworld's social media accounts have also announced a contest for a More Than Just Pals Lovander body pillow. Lovander is a character in the game who is described as "A senior who makes a love approach to new students every year. She calls her love approach 'hunting.'"</p><p>Although Palworld's communications director, John "Bucky" Buckley, <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1906694803632644593" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">insists that the game is real</a>, our bet remains that this is just an elaborate April Fool's Day joke. But there probably would be an audience for this game.</p><p>Despite the ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo, Bucky recently hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-could-come-to-switch-2-if-the-system-is-beefy-enough/1100-6530302/" data-ref-id="1100-6530302">Palworld could come to Switch 2</a> if the system is powerful enough. Earlier this month, Palworld also received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/huge-palworld-update-adds-cross-play-photo-mode-and-new-pal-storage/1100-6530211/" data-ref-id="1100-6530211">a big new update with cross-play, photo mode</a> and more additions to the game.</p>

Sometimes it can be seen as even more of a challenge on emerging platforms within games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. These platforms are still developing features that are commonplace on popular platforms in other mediums like YouTube and Twitch. Since these platforms also rely on user-submitted content, they can be defined as “UGC” platforms as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How can UGC platforms learn from the functionality of YouTube and Twitch? Netase data mining engineer Xingchen Zhou explored the UGC landscape and the specific ways the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developers have adjusted their recommendation system to appeal to its massive audience of players during a talk at the 2025 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, according to Zhou, is the most "popular competitive casual game in China." The party game, which shares similarities with games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stumble Guys</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fall Guys</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, surpassed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/neteases-eggy-party-reaches-500-million-players-in-under-two-years/">40 million daily active players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> during Lunar New Year in 2024. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has surpassed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/eggy-party-sails-past-100-million-user-generated-maps/#:~:text=60%25%20of%20players%20actively%20create,by%20the%20game's%20incentive%20program.&amp;text=NetEase%20Games%20has%20revealed%20that,100%20million%20user%2Dgenerated%20maps.">100 million user-created maps</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as of last March.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Recommendation algorithms are key to UGC platforms">Recommendation algorithms are key to UGC platforms</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-we-need-to-define-what-it-means-to-be-safe-as-gamers-around-the-world-a-code-of-ethics-in-gaming" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We need to define what it means to be safe as [players] around the world:' a code of ethics in gaming</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhou covered a common thread among other UGC platforms outside games, arguing that their uniting element is an effective distribution system. He compared them to Vine, a popular short form video platform that shuttered at the beginning of 2017, saying the Twitter-operated video app failed due to its lack of "personalized recommendations and a lack of innovation" which led to a loss of content creators.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"TikTok, Google, Netflix, Spotfiy - having a strong distribution capability is key to achieving market leading position," Zhou said, also alluding to non-UGC platforms like Netflix. "They all share one advantage - a powerful distribution system with algorithmic recommendations."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games are far more complicated to distribute effectively than short videos. In a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players will need to play a map for at least 5 minutes in order to "truly experience a map," according to Zhou . Short videos only take a matter of seconds for a user to understand what they are watching, and then decide if they want to continue watching for the full duration of the video. Despite the difference, the main factors in the success of a UGC platform are similar.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Although the product forms are different, the core always lies in the interaction and connection between users and the platform," Zhou said.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/cyberpunk-2077-developer-cd-projekt-taps-scopely-to-develop-franchise-spin-off" target="_self" data-discover="true">Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt taps Scopely to develop franchise spin-off</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhou went into detail about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "digital DNA bank," which helped the platform create a portrait of players in "1000 dimensions." These portraits include thousands of tags that identify personal attributes of players, including what sort of content they enjoyed in the past and what they might enjoy in the future. Tags included a player wanting more challenging maps, multiplayer experiences, and genre-specific maps like puzzles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Outside a recommendation system, Zhou emphasized the importance of first impressions during discovery. The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> user interface includes titles, cover images, and statistical data highlighting the number of players and likes a map has at a moment's glance. Players need to get an idea of what a map is and how popular it is in seconds, making those first few moments in front a player crucial for success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"High rated maps receive more exposure opportunities," Zhou said, talking about how player interaction is also important for discovery.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhou also covered some mistakes the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> recommendation system made, including recommending what he called a "female-oriented dress up" map to male college students, which led to dissatisfaction for both the players and the creator.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/activision-user-research-workers-are-unionizing-to-create-an-industry-that-works-for-them-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Activision user research workers are unionizing 'to create an industry that works for them'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Missteps like that can prevent creators from building more experiences for other players and can dissuade players from using a games' built in recommendation systems, both problems that could harm the overall health and reputation of a UGC platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eggy Party's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> recommendation system can also lead to rapid success. Zhou pointed out another use case where a creator had a critically low player count on their maps, but integration within the system led players who enjoyed similar maps to this specific user. It led to a huge uptick in interactions with players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NetEase has been running an incentive program that rewards players who create popular with cash prizes, which has brought in a large number of creators to their UGC environment. Zhou didn't bring this up during the talk, but did mention the importance of not falling into the trap of the "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">Matthew Effect</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," which refers to certain users gaining an advantage over others, leading to a wider gap between those who have resources and those who do not.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That result has become common on some UGC platforms, where some users have the advantage of more time in the space, publisher favoritism, monetary resources, or something else giving them a leg up on the competition. Creating a system that can bypass any of those advantages and lead players to maps they would enjoy naturally is a key to success.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/schedule-1-game-early-access-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Politically, I am very much in favor of decriminalizing weed, but on a personal level, I absolutely can’t stand it. I feel bad about this–who hates weed?!--but after years of trying not to feel like the world’s biggest dork, I’ve learned to just quietly slip away when people are using it. Given this, recent early access drug-dealing game <em>Schedule 1</em> should in no way be my thing, but somehow I’ve been playing the hell out of it.&nbsp;</p><p>I hadn’t heard of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Schedule 1</em></a> until Aftermath pal Javy Gwaltney <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jgwalt.bsky.social/post/3llkbykvm3c2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned it on Bluesky</a> over the weekend, but it rocketed to Steam’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top seller</a> slot as of this writing and has reportedly been <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simoncarless_valve-has-just-given-solo-indie-megahit-schedule-activity-7310837300601442305-AvHb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wildly successful</a> for its solo developer. It’s a simple-looking, cartoonish game where you play as a small-time drug dealer who flees your desert town for a modestly-sized city, where you have to rebuild your supply chain and customer base from scratch, steadily crafting a bigger and bigger empire while evading cops and rival dealers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Schedule I Release Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dUxiQ1qN0rg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Lest this sound like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> or similar flashy, high-octane games, <em>Schedule 1</em> is scratching my <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival game</a> itch far more than any desire for shootouts and action. A day in my game is full of wonderfully tedious chores: skateboard over to the hardware store to buy some more soil and baggies, head across town to pick up some different weed seeds from a dead drop, trek all the way back to my shitty apartment above a Chinese restaurant with my haul. Growing weed requires pouring soil, planting seeds, and watering them, all with the need to slice the tops off bags and pop the lids off containers and make sure to throw all that stuff away in the trash when you’re done. Weed needs to be harvested and then packaged by hand, in a wonderfully physical assembly line of placing nuggets in bags and sealing them up. The game is on a day/night cycle that often feels way too short for all the things you need to get done, though time stops at 4am until you go to sleep, in effect pausing the clock to let you catch up on things.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, you deliver your goods by yourself: accepting orders on your phone, arranging a meeting time, and even haggling on price, amount, or strain. Buyers have connections to others; by strengthening your relationships with customers and handing out free samples to new ones, you slowly build a customer base that can connect you to new suppliers. It can also connect you to dealers, who can sell drugs for you–once you manually deliver the product, decide which specific customers they can sell to, and then remember to come back to top them up and collect your money. Later, you can hire workers to do some of your chores and buy machines that can automate the process, all of which will require more space and money as you work your way toward building a grand operation.</p><p>In the early hours I’ve played solo, <em>Schedule 1</em> is a decidedly <em>unsexy</em> game. (It also has co-op, though I haven’t checked that out yet.) Games like this often want to be about becoming untouchably powerful, but my most memorable experiences so far have been times I’ve had to escape the cops like any small-time hood. While the trailer suggests car chases and shootouts, I’ve mostly faced challenges by fleeing. Cops patrol the streets and institute a nightly curfew, which I get around by sneaking through alleys and clambering through ditches. In the game’s intro area, the cops wanted to frisk me; thinking fast, I ran behind a dumpster and smoked all my weed so they wouldn’t find it, only to learn you can hide it on your person in a clever little mini-game. In another instance, the cops busted me when I brilliantly made a drug deal right in front of them; I fled into a taco shop and hid under a booth until they stopped looking. There are cars and guns to buy, but I kind of like the idea of seeing how small I can keep things.</p><p>This desire extends to the kinds of drugs the game lets you make, too. So far, I’ve mixed weed with mouthwash and painkillers to make new strains; on the horizon is the ability to make harder drugs like meth and cocaine, but I feel uncomfortable with that idea. I’m curious to see if the game will let me avoid it; I might not <em>like</em> weed, but at least it generally isn’t hurting anyone. I like the idea of playing the game like a regular person, just trying to get by and survive the (<a href="https://aftermath.site/starting-a-website-has-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relatable</a>) challenges of scaling a business, rather than some kingpin introducing dangerous drugs into my new community.</p><p><em>Schedule 1</em> is obviously a game about drugs, but I appreciate how low-key it is about them so far. Characters have bloodshot stoner eyes, but I haven’t encountered any over-the-top drugs jokes or other stuff I’d find too off-putting. I feel like I could be <a href="https://aftermath.site/wanderstop-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">running almost any kind of business</a> and a lot of the game would play the same, minus all the running from the cops. I’m surprised to find myself liking it so much, and I think that’s down to all its mundane moving parts and unexpectedly soothing chores. (I love the idea of being a drug dealer who spends a chunk of his day picking up street litter; you can exchange your trash for money, which is a great way to help finance your operations.) The early access <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/schedule-1-updates-roadmap-with-map-expansion-fishing-cartel-interactions-3170476/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> sounds full of cool stuff to look forward to, including more side activities that will hopefully keep me from losing all my money in the game’s casino in my rare downtime.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-severance-season-two-review"><h3>Severance Season Two Stuck The Landing</h3></a><p>With big tech trying to automate everything, Severance just keeps feeling more and more relevant</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne"><h3>Split Keyboards Are Superior And The Reason I’m The Writer I Am Today</h3></a><p>Split keyboards are the best, but no company offered one that satisfied me completely.

		<p>Frogwares has announced that it is releasing The Sinking City Remastered, with owners of the original release for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S getting this as a free upgrade. The Sinking City Remastered sees the original game being ported to Unreal Engine 5, joining The Sinking City 2 on that platform. While a trailer or gameplay footage is not yet available, Frogwares has released screenshots of The Sinking City Remastered.</p>

		
		

<p>In other The Sinking City 2 news, Frogwares has opened up submissions for people to have their voices in the game, becoming part of a choir that praises the Eldritch god Yog-Sothoth. To enter, people just need to submit a voice recording saying the word “Yes”, in whatever style they wish. A form will need to be filled out along with an upload of the submission, and that can all be done <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tally.so/r/wQOPMY&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1743346118601063&amp;usg=AOvVaw13x8tRr9K5rXe2MkOnnojn">at this link</a>. Frogwares will then choose 100 submissions at random to be in the game, and of of those 100 will get The Sinking City 2 Collector’s Edition.</p>


<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/27/the-sinking-city-review/">The Sinking City Review</a></h2>
<p>In our The Sinking City review, Steve said,<em> “The Sinking City promises a nightmarish journey through a Lovecraftian townscape filled with monsters and threatening cults, but too often falls into a loop of forced combat and resource hunting. The investigative parts are excellent, and this is probably the best Lovecrat adaptation since Call of Cthulu: Dark Corners of the Earth, but it still never really lives up to its potential. Close, but no Shoggoth.”</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-preview-%E2%80%93-doom-unlike-any-other.1149795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Few people predicted the triumphant return of DOOM in 2016. Bethesda was unwilling to have games reviewed before launch. The overwhelming feeling was that the game wouldn't be as good as they had hoped from DOOM, with the prior multiplayer beta underwhelming players. Needless to say, DOOM was great, DOOM Eternal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which I reviewed</a>, was also great, and now we have DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Or, at least, we will have DOOM: The Dark Ages. I recently got hands-on experience with the first level of the game and the first portion of the second. Then, parts of two later levels, before an even later - open - level, for a chunk of time. Essentially, ID Software and Bethesda wanted me and others at the event in Frankfurt to have a feel for what the game will offer and its variety.</p>
<p>Now, I'm working on memory here, but something that I wasn't a massive fan of in DOOM Eternal, in retrospect, was that it had gone quite platform-heavy in some areas. Not enough that I expected an Italian plumber to show up, but maybe a Gecko dressed like a spy. Somebody at ID Software must have agreed because this has been toned back significantly, though the verticality isn't lost from what I have seen here.</p>
<p>No, the first level I could play feels like DOOM as we know it. The maps are large; you have several secrets to find if you choose to, and little bits of exploration may also net you extra health and armour. This is in between moving from one arena, where you kill hordes of enemies, to the corridors in between until you reach the next arena. So far, so DOOM. It's what you would expect, too, and my initial impression is that it brings the tight combat from DOOM Eternal to the tighter design of DOOM 2016.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>That will be until you explore some of the newer things in DOOM: The Dark Ages. So, to put it quite simply, I could play parts of, not all, two different levels. You are essentially riding a DOOM Guy Gundam in the first of these two. The second, you get to fly a dragon with mecha wings and guns. Now, DOOMdam, as I will now call it, feels similar enough to other levels. It's just that you're now a big machine. You get to punch the hell out of Titans, sometimes shoot them, and there is a sense of scale due to the surrounding combat. I don't know how impactful it will feel over time, but it offered something different while still feeling like the DOOM we know.</p>
<p>The dragon, however, I'm not entirely as sold on. Now, when I get more time with it, I could be blown out of the water - it needs to be remembered that I played part of a level. The initial rush of zooming out of a cave system on the back of a dragon is pretty impressive. Particularly so, when you see the level of devastation happening, you will be there, fighting off giant hell-ships, and the sense of scale is awe-inspiring, even at first glance.</p>
<p>This isn't a case of more artificial corridors moving from ship to ship. You will fly around, and there are extra things to defeat and paths to find before you weaken a ship's defences enough to land on it and deal the finishing blow. Of course, the last part is done on foot, and you go around areas bigger than just the ship as it has crashed into the city below. All of that was good. I wasn't enthralled by the combat on the dragon itself, if only because, once locked on, the controls felt a little too rigid. It's an area I am looking forward to exploring more.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>Understandably, ID Software knew DOOM: The Dark Ages would shine in a later area they had us play, giving us an hour to do what we wanted. This massive battlefield was far more open than what you generally get in a DOOM title. Some trappings remained, in that you have arenas to encounter and loads of secrets to find via some exploration, but it never felt constrained by the usual corridors you come to expect. While still somewhat driven, it offered a bit of an open feel, where you could maybe find yourself at odds in one area, decide to tackle somewhere else and rearm before coming back.</p>
<p>Combine this more open approach with the excellent fast-paced combat from DOOM Eternal, where you will be finishing off enemies to have extra life and ammo fall out of their bodies, combos and well-timed attacks being rewarded with more to keep you going, and you have a recipe for greatness. It's even better to use new weapons, like the shield saw, in an enjoyable combination of attacks that makes you feel like the DOOM Slayer in overdrive.</p>
<p>I am also intrigued by the narrative of DOOM: The Dark Ages. This is an entirely single-player-focused title, and I am all on board with that. I have zero interest in multiplayer; anybody who knows me knows that my time on this planet has been one of ensuring humans keep as far away from my fun as possible. This focus on single-player also means that resources haven't been diverted, and there's no need to start balancing guns, melee weapons, or any other nonsense about how they work around other people. No, this is about the DOOM Slayer, his time before DOOM, and the medieval-ish world he came from.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages will be released on May 13th, 2025, if you buy the premium edition, or on May 15th if you don't. Needless to say, after the resounding success of both DOOM 2016 and DOOM Eternal, and what was a very fun time I had with the game in Frankfurt, I'm looking forward to DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>

It’s an incredible game for one. It was also the last entry on PS1, and the last before the series moved to a full 3D look and voice acting on the PS2. Most importantly, it was the last produced by creator Hironobu Sakaguchi before he left Square, and harkens back to the franchise’s more traditional, medieval roots. Also it features an adorable black mage named Vivi. </p><p>In the past, <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> producer Naoki Yoshida has been coy about the rumors. “Of course, I do know there are requests for<em> Final Fantasy IX</em> to be made, but when you think about <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, it’s a game with huge volume,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said last fall</a></span>, appearing to pour cold water on the rumors. “When you think about all of that volume, I wonder if it’s possible to remake that as a single title. It’s a difficult one. It is a tough question.”</p><p>July 7 will be exactly 25 years since the game shipped and Square Enix hints that fans should expect to hear more announcements leading up to it. Maybe a sneak peek of the game itself at an upcoming PlayStation or Summer Game Fest showcase will be one of them.

<p>According to a reliable source, Naughty Dog plans to release a new special edition for The Last of Us franchise, with a physical PS5 edition in the works.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A report by <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a><a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-mysterieuse-edition-physique-dun-jeu-de-naughty-dog-est-en-cours-de-preparation-60078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> on Dealabs</a> states that Naughty Dog is working on “a new special edition of a game in The Last of Us franchise”; however, which game it will be about is unknown. The report also tells us the price, which will be set at EUR 119.99 and USD 109.99, and this mystery edition will be available for purchase in Europe and North America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems that the mystery special edition of The Last of Us franchise will receive a physical release on the PS5. Moreover, the announcement could arrive very soon, as pre-orders are expected to begin within the next two months. Many players are placing their bets on a bundle that includes the remastered versions of The Last of Us Part 1 and The Last of Us Part 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Last of Us HBO series will receive a second season on April 13, 2025. The new season will have seven episodes, with one dropping each week. The rumoured pre-order announcement date for this mystery special edition coincides with the end date for season 2 of the HBO series, which could mean something. However, players should take this information with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>In other news, Naughty Dog has been working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-working-on-unannounced-game-three-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an unannounced game</a> for three years, according to a new claim. Also, The Last of Us 2 Remastered is getting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-2-remastered-announces-free-no-return-content-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">free No Return content</a> on the PS5.

                <p>The slogan “Stand and Fight” has been plastered all over Doom: The Dark Ages marketing: a catchphrase that feels at odds with the modern Doom series. Doom 2016 was applauded for its fast gameplay and Doom: Eternal took that one step further with the Meat Hook that let you whip around the battlefield at breakneck speeds. The movement--for many--is what makes Doom, Doom. So to see Doom: The Dark Ages’ encourage players to hold their ground and fight seemed antithetical to that finely tuned formula. At least, that’s what I thought. After three hours of hands-on time with id Software’s next shooter, it seems like Doom: The Dark Ages has found a hypnotic balance between its iconic fast-paced gameplay and the blow-for-blow combat that Dark Ages is bringing to the mix.</p><p dir="ltr">Doom: The Dark Ages is a prequel to Doom 2016. The forces of hell are invading a realm heavily inspired by the medieval era, and the Doom Slayer is summoned to do what he does best: Rip and tear through demons. Although this may sound like standard fare for a Doom game, The Dark Ages appears to be taking its story a bit more seriously. It’s still a campy, somewhat self-aware, bloodsoaked romp through demon guts, but the team wanted to use the fantasy setting to its full potential. According to game director Hugo Martin, “When you think of fantasy, and Lord of the Rings, you think huge… There’s a grandness, an epicness to fantasy that people expect.” Despite the shift to fantasy, some of Doom: The Dark Ages’ biggest narrative inspirations for its story were action films like Roadhouse, Die Hard, and First Blood, when it comes to keeping the story engaging throughout its runtime.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467012-screenshots_round_2_5logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467012" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467012-screenshots_round_2_5logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467012"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467012-screenshots_round_2_5logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">While I loved Doom 2016’s minimal approach to storytelling, I’m curious to see what id Software does with Dark Age’s setting. The arenas, enemies, characters, and weapons have all received a medieval makeover that fits the setting and series perfectly. Gothic castles loom over battlefields, enemies use a mix of medieval weaponry and sci-fi firearms, characters are donned in plated armor, and macabre weapons like the Pulverizer grind up skulls and fire out deadly bone shards. It’s a match made in heaven, or rather, hell. That said, Doom: Eternal’s greater emphasis on story felt superfluous. There were some clever callbacks to previous games and fun moments, but when it comes to Doom, all I want to do is shoot, shred, and eviscerate demons. Thankfully, The Dark Ages has plenty of that.</p><p dir="ltr">As with previous Doom games, the weapons are the star of the show. There are some returning firearms like the iconic Super Shotgun, but The Dark Ages brings a slew of new guns that fit neatly into the gothic setting. The aforementioned Pulverizer fires out a horizontal spread of skull bits that can shred multiple demons at close range, the Impaler fires out rune-adorned rail spikes that deal high damage at long range, and--my personal favorite--the Chainshot launches a retracting cannonball that pulverizes demons at close range. Of course, each weapon comes with a handful of upgrades and modifications that can alter their characteristics. Doom’s weapons have always been larger than life, but The Dark Ages setting has allowed id Software to really push the boundaries of what a weapon in Doom can be. “[They’re] brutal. […] The Rail Spike, the Skull Crusher. They’re all supposed to be like little torture devices you’re holding,” Martin told me.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467013-screenshots_round_2_4logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467013" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467013-screenshots_round_2_4logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467013"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467013-screenshots_round_2_4logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Doom: The Dark Ages biggest shake-up to the gameplay is the Shield Saw. During combat, you can block and parry attacks with it, bash enemies, and throw it around the battlefield. It’s most useful purpose--at least for my playstyle--was the dash. By holding your up shield, you can lock onto an enemy and rush them down in one swift motion. While it doesn’t offer the same verticality as the Meat Hook, it’s far more controlled. Your inertia and momentum aren’t working against you when you rush down an enemy. Instead, you speed across the battlefield and deliver a satisfying shield bash to whatever poor demon the Doom Slayer sets his sights on.</p><p dir="ltr">While I didn’t use the Shield Saw’s block all that much, the parry is paramount. When an enemy or projectile glows green, a well-timed block will stun the demon or send the projectile right back. It’s a fairly straightforward mechanic that fits in surprisingly well with Doom’s gameplay loop. You can’t parry every move so you’re still spending most of your time running and gunning, but when I did see that green glow, I found myself subconsciously repositioning in hopes of exploiting it. It may seem like a simple addition, but the parry does what any good parry system does: It adds more risks for more rewards. I would regularly put myself in harm's way to rush down enemies and projectiles as they started to glow green just to hit the parry.</p><p dir="ltr">The Shield Saw feels like a natural extension to the Doom Slayer’s kit, but it isn’t just for bludgeoning unfortunate demons. A lot of Doom: The Dark Ages’ puzzles and platforming segments are built around the Shield Saw. Like Kratos’s axe in God of War (2018), the shield can be used to activate switches, knock down weak walls, and launch the Doom Slayer up to hard to reach areas. While the puzzles in the Doom games rarely offer more than a brief change of pace, the Shield Saw brings just enough to the table to keep the moments interesting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467014-screenshots_round_2_3logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467014" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467014-screenshots_round_2_3logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467014"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467014-screenshots_round_2_3logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Shield Saw goes hand-in-hand with Doom: The Dark Ages’ new melee weapons. The chainsaw from Doom 2016 and Eternal has been replaced by a handful of blunt weapons and new mechanics. These weapons require a “charge” in order to use them, and--at least in the beginning--can hold up to three charges. You can find pickups on the battlefield or you can parry an attack to charge your weapon. Unlike the chainsaw, the further along in the preview I got, the rarer these pickups were. As a result, I mostly relied on parries to refill my melee charges. This loop fits seamlessly into the “stand and fight” mantra because when you’re facing down a Tyrant, the most efficient way to kill it is to get in its face, parry its attacks, and follow up with a powerful melee attack. Of course, you can still melee enemies without a charge, but it’s fairly ineffective against anything other than the imps and fodder demons.</p><p dir="ltr">Doom: The Dark Ages brings a lot of fresh ideas to its combat loop, and in order to let players experiment with all these new weapons, mechanics, and strategies, id Software has created some of its largest arenas to date. The final level I played in my preview, titled Siege, took place on a wide-open battlefield that consisted of multiple objectives that could be completed in any order. This approach to level design is nothing unique, but it’s a first for the modern Doom games. While I still think I prefer the more linear level design when it comes to Doom, this section was a nice change of pace and gave me ample opportunities to test out some of the new mechanics with some unique encounters. One of these optional scenarios had me eliminate a VIP demon. However, in order to damage the special demon, I needed to lower its morale by killing dozens of other demons. I died a handful times, but with each new attempt I was able to try out different approaches in a more free-form and open-ended way than we saw in Doom 2016 or Eternal.</p><p dir="ltr">These large, open-ended battlefields complement the “epicness” Martin mentioned, but another component of The Dark Ages’ grand scale are the Dragon and Atlan mech missions. While neither of the segments I played had the mechanical depth of Doom’s grounded combat, they did offer a different perspective on The Dark Ages' world. I soared over a sprawling city as an aerial assault took place, occasionally dismounting my dragon to decommission Hell Carrier dropships from the inside. In the Atlan mech, I was going toe-to-toe with some of Doom’s most formidable demons that are typically saved for boss fights.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467015-screenshots_round_2_2logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467015" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467015-screenshots_round_2_2logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467015"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467015-screenshots_round_2_2logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The aerial and mech combat are built around well-timed dodges. Like on foot, enemy attacks that glow green are your tell. Dodging a green attack slows down time and lets you strike back with a deadly attack of your own. The Atlan feels great to pilot. Each step satisfyingly crushes fodder demons and levels buildings. Meanwhile, its weighty punches and hooks can shatter demon bones and pop their skulls into a mess of blood and gore. Unfortunately, as of now, aerial combat seems to be the weakest link. Speeding through tunnels and over cities feels great, but the second you lock onto an enemy, all that speed comes to an abrupt halt as you awkwardly maneuver around the space directly in front of the locked-on enemy holding down the attack button. Martin made it clear that the team was still fine-tuning the aerial combat and will continue to up until launch. Hopefully a little extra polish is all the dragon combat needs.</p><p dir="ltr">According to executive producer and game director Marty Stratton, “With each game we’ve done more. We get better at what we’re doing. The stories we’re telling have gotten bigger, and [Doom: The Dark Ages] feels like the realization of the last 10 years and the last two games.” After wrapping up my demo, it feels like The Dark Ages might be the most comprehensive Doom game to date. Id Software is bringing a lot of new mechanics and ideas to the series, while maintaining its hypnotic flow state. It’s hard to say if they’ll be able to keep that momentum as new ideas and mechanics are introduced, but it’s made an excellent first impression. Doom: The Dark Ages comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox, and PC on May 13, 2025.</p>

Warcraft</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-20">StarCraft</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo/" data-ref-id="5000-15">Diablo</a>. In 2017, Bungie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> became the first non-Blizzard (but still Activision-published) game to be offered on Battle.net, followed by other Activision titles like yearly installments of Call of Duty and even Crash Bandicoot 4 in 2020. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-steam-release-coming-leaving-activisions/1100-6467437/" data-ref-id="1100-6467437">Destiny 2, meanwhile, would later be removed from Battle.net in 2020</a>, as it's no longer published by Activision.</p><p dir="ltr">In February, Obsidian's new first-person RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a> became the first non-Activision Blizzard game to be offered on Battle.net. Obsidian is owned by Microsoft, which acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023. Doom: The Dark Ages developer id Software was acquired by Microsoft as part of its acquisition of ZeniMax Media in 2021. Microsoft has not stated whether all of its future first-party PC titles will also see release on Battle.net, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4/" data-ref-id="5000-666086">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>, an Activision title, will be available on Battle.net later this year. Doom: The Dark Ages, Avowed, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 are also all available for purchase on Steam. Meanwhile, numerous Blizzard titles, including Diablo 4, the Blizzard Arcade Collection, and others have become available on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-in-may-with-giant-mech-and-cybernetic-dragon-vehicles/1100-6528975/" data-ref-id="1100-6528975">Doom: The Dark Ages releases May 15</a> and serves as a prequel to id's two most recent entries in the demon-slaying franchise, exploring the origins of the legendary Doom Slayer as he battles the armies of hell in a medieval-styled world that is a far cry from the sci-fi setting the series is typically known for. While melee weapons and a chainsaw shield will bring some new flair to Doom's signature FPS gameplay, players can still expect plenty of ranged weaponry to blast demons apart with, alongside the ability to pilot a cybernetic dragon and a giant Pacific Rim-esque mech. Despite now being a Microsoft franchise, Doom: The Dark Ages will be available on PlayStation 5 as well as Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out our Doom: The Dark Ages preorder guide.
