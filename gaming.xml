			<p>Remedy put out a call on its <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1921933626389786975">social media channels</a> asking for players to sign up for a new closed technical test for <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/">FBC: Firebreak</a> taking place this weekend.</p>
<p>The studio is focusing on testing the crossplay functionality in FBC: Firebreak during this test, so players on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S are all <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/waitlist">encouraged to register their interest</a> in joining. The test will begin on May 15 and run until May 19.</p>
<p>Firebreak is due to release in<a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-is-out-on-june-17-reveals-remedy/"> a little over a month</a>, and this closed technical test is one of the final steps towards release as Remedy gets set to launch its first multiplayer-focused game. It's a big 'first' for the studio known for crafting exceptional single-player experiences, so it'll be interesting to see if it can land with the players who go to Remedy for those single-player games.</p>
<p>Though perhaps more important than getting Firebreak to land with Remedy's current fans is Firebreak being able to bring in new players to Remedy's titles. Fans of multiplayer games who've yet to try out a Remedy title might find Firebreak to be their avenue into Remedy's other games like Alan Wake and Control, which could be significant in the lead up to Remedy's next major single-player release, Control 2.</p>
<p>However, players who are fans of Control and can't wait for its sequel should note that they don't necessarily need to jump into Firebreak to keep up with the story. <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-info-all-post-launch-content-will-be-free/">When we spoke to Remedy</a> earlier this year about Firebreak, the studio confirmed that the core narrative will continue in Control 2, and while there will be some Easter eggs to discover, Firebreak won't include some key narrative details that players should have before jumping into Control 2, whenever it releases.</p>

That’s what makes the VMU Pro unique. Although it’s been upgraded with a 16-bit IPS TFT color screen and enough power to emulate NES, Sega Master System, and even Game Boy Color titles, it can still be inserted into an original Dreamcast controller and used to store save game data.</p><p>Other upgrades include a rechargeable battery (the original Dreamcast VMU was notorious for going through CR2032 coin cell batteries when used on its own), MP3 playback for those living without a smartphone, the ability to copy and backup save game data directly from an original VMU, Wi-Fi, and unlimited storage through microSD memory cards.</p><p>The retro emulation on a full-color screen is a fun feature, but if that’s the only reason you’re considering the VMU Pro, the <a href="https://anbernic.com/en-ca/products/rg-nano">Anbernic RG Nano</a> offers far superior emulation (including 3D consoles like the N64 and PS1) on a similarly-sized handheld. The VMU Pro will appeal more to those who still have a Sega Dreamcast in regular play rotation but are looking for a more reliable and easier way to store and swap game saves.</p><p>That’s assuming the VMU Pro isn’t going to be prohibitively expensive. In 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/21/23365268/sega-dreamcast-vmu-virtual-memory-unit-card-2022-fundraiser-indiegogo-console">Dreamware Enterprises launched its own upgraded VMU called the VM2</a> with a backlit but monochromatic and pixelated screen for $114. It was a pricey upgrade for a console that Sega no longer supports, so hopefully three years of electronics evolution will result in a cheaper price tag for the VMU Pro.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And while going back to this 20 minute show is a bit embarrassing now, it’s wild how Microsoft and Xbox really did see the future coming before the rest of the industry. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197533" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="197533,196181,196230" data-current="197533"><div><p>Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23065.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But before we praise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-celebrates-20th-anniversary-with-a-museum-that-mig-1848113162&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-celebrates-20th-anniversary-with-a-museum-that-mig-1848113162">Xbox</a></span> for predicting the online future of games and get really sad at how cosmetic microtransactions were already part of the plan in 2005, let’s make fun of this weird 20 minute infomercial that is the most ‘00s thing ever created. Here’s the full special if you’ve not seen it: </p><p>“Fact: Gaming isn’t just a hobby. It is a lifestyle,” says an unnamed narrator during a short video at the front of the special. It explains video gaming started with <em>Pong</em> and Atari,  some other stuff happened, then the original Xbox launched and don’t worry about that thing called the PlayStation. </p><p>After that, the funniest moment in the entire special happens. Remember, up until this point we didn’t know the console was to be called the Xbox 360. It was just the “Next Gen Xbox.” So young Zack, who watched this MTV special back in 2005, was excited to learn more about the next Xbox. Elijah Wood yells, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LTs0AoaMYGA?t=166&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LTs0AoaMYGA?t=166" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The future of gaming!” and points off screen</a></span>. The camera cuts to a...woman carrying a gray bag. Can you imagine the online chuds today watching this? Their heads might explode. </p><figure id="" data-id="74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-recommend-id="image://74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-format="png" data-width="639" data-height="360" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox /hunchbiscuit / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-recommend-id="image://74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-format="png" data-width="639" data-height="360" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In reality, the woman is carrying the Xbox 360 in her shoulder bag. She saunters up to a podium and pulls out the console. Sets it up. Hits a button. Green lights turn on. And the console’s name is revealed.</p><p>The rest of special is mostly MTV nonsense, celebrities, and The Killers performing music. The only segment that is actually somewhat interesting happens about 11 minutes into the show: Sway from MTV is invited to talk to the designers behind the Xbox 360 and J Allard (one of the OG Microsoft execs behind the Xbox project.) It’s during this segment that we see a bunch of 360 prototypes and learn about why it looks the way it does. And then Allard walks Sway through the idea of buying digital content on a video game console using the internet. </p><p>Today, this is something every device can do. Back in 2005, this was the future. It was hard for young Zack to believe that one day we’d buy games digitally on a console. 20 years later, it’s clear Microsoft was on to something with Xbox Live, the marketplace, a single username that follows you from game to game, and hanging out online with friends in voice chat. Though, the moment when Allard mentions buying clothes for your digital character, I realized microtransactions were being invented in front of my eyes and got sad. </p><p>At the end of the event, Wood got on stage and signed off by saying: “I think we can all agree on one thing tonight: Xbox 360 is going to be amazing and I look forward to meeting all of you in the Xbox 360 universe.” I never met Elijah Wood online. But I do agree, the Xbox 360 was amazing and will likely be the one and only time Microsoft was at the top of the console gaming market. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-unveils-warframe-1999-update-named-techrot-encore-releasing-in-march/">Digital Extremes</a> took over the PAX East 2025 main stage to discuss a bunch of new information about Warframe and <a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-soulframe-devstream-showcases-companions-new-social-hub-more/">Soulframe</a>, including the next major update to Warframe, Isleweaver, coming in June, a new Soulframe trailer, and how Digital Extremes is overhauling the experience for brand-new players to make it easier to get into Warframe in the first place.</p>
<p>The Isleweaver update is the next narrative chapter in Warframe's story, continuing the narrative threads that were pulled in Warframe's big 1999 update. Players will return to Duviri and clash with Major Rusalka once again, with new Murmur enemies to fight in the new clan operation, Eight Claw.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warframe | Isleweaver Official Teaser - Coming in June!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBsQROfuf0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Soulframe trailer showed off more gameplay from the upcoming co-op RPG, including a new boss that players will fight called the Tired King. The panel also discussed the development journey Soulframe has been on so far, and while there's still no release date in sight, the team did say that those interested in hearing more about Soulframe should tune in to Tennocon 2025 to learn more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Soulframe: Preludes - Gameplay Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mLydrgmH4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest news of the panel came halfway through, when principal writer Kathryn Kingsley discussed how the new player experience in Warframe has been streamlined to get brand new players to the 1999 content as soon as possible, which will prepare them for everything else beyond that.</p>

<p>"<em>One of the things we did was lay out what ever new player has to do from account creation to 1999, and just tried to streamline that as much as possible to remove as many trip hazards,</em>" Kingsely began saying.</p>
<p>"<em>Making sure that all of the content there sort of made sense and make that as friendly as possible, especially now that we have so much more content at the end of the game. And not removing any content, just making sure that it all just sort of now makes sense now that we have so much cool stuff.</em>"</p>
<p>You can see in the slides below that Vor is getting a rework, Digital Extremes is continuing to work on the Junction, a few enemies are being refreshed and you no longer have to scan a plant before picking it up, you can just pick it up.</p>
<p>Also, Digital Extremes is changing how melee slams work. To prevent players from spamming the melee slam with small hops, you'll soon need to jump much higher to have the same hit radius you can have now with a small hop.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>All of these updates are coming in the Isleweaver update in June.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This dev stream was the last major update for Warframe that players will get until TennoCon, which is taking place <a href="https://www.warframe.com/tennocon">July 18-19</a> this summer, and where we'll find out a lot more about what's to come for Soulframe and Warframe for the rest of the year and beyond.</p>

            <p>For too long have our video games been tainted by the spectacle of people moving around using their own feet and legs. For too long have our NPCs been left to rot in the grip of "simple town life", surrounded by acres of thriving grass that have never known the blessed touch of a Chevron or a Ford, let alone that duchess of the asphalt - the Banana Mobile.</p>
<p>All that changes... well, they haven't shared a release date yet, but rest assured that Car Park Capital will soon be here to transform all of your awful virtual countryside into a sea of rumbling isometric bonnets. Here is a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Car Park Capital is a satirical business <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim in the tradition of Rollercoaster Tycoon, built using a custom rendering engine. Your job is to tarmac over the world's last remaining stretches of vegetation and fill the screen with neat lines of parking places, plus the occasional zebra crossing for those pitiful pedestrians that yet remain, shaking their fists at the uncaring sky.</p>
<p>Any townsfolk who object to driving must be persuaded otherwise using propaganda. You can, for instance, put up billboards with dastardly mind-control slogans such as "you love cars", "how about a nice car, eh" and "eat smog you filthy little piggies". I may have invented one or two of those, but I did not invent the below bullet points, lifted direct from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3031880/Car_Park_Capital/">the Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Real time simulation with hundreds of vehicles and citizens.</p>
<p>Per-person behavior simulation: Each person is different, except they're all bald.</p>
<p>Play into their minds with propaganda.</p>
<p>3D map editing: Be creative when designing car parks or other buildings. You can make multi-floor structures.</p>
<p>Expand as the demand increases. Get rewarded accordingly.</p>
<p>Elevators!</p>
<p>Retro styled graphics with a playful color palette.</p>
<p>Moddability: Scripts and content can be altered if you possess some Lua skills.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's not quite clear how the levels work from the trailer, but I wonder if each map starts out as a proper settlement, and your goal is to stealthily insert and obfuscate roads until the commutes become endless and the gridlock becomes self-sustaining, allowing you to remove the homes, shops and businesses like Jenga blocks, without interrupting the circle of fumes and frustration. Regardless, this is a lovely visual confection for all its baleful premise. These are the best cars I've seen in a game since, oh, let's say Rollcage.</p>
<p>Developer <a href="https://hilkojj.nl/">Hilko Janssen</a> is based in the Netherlands, and is a Ludum Dare game jam regular. I like <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/hapman-the-inevitable">this thing they made</a> about a fly trying not to get eaten by Pac Man.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/nintendo-threatens-to-brick-switch-consoles-for-hacking-piracy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Switch and Switch 2 users who try to hack their consoles or play pirated copies of games may find their devices rendered completely inoperable by Nintendo. That new warning was buried in a recent update to the Nintendo User Account Agreement, as <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-emulation-hacking-brick-warning-terms-of-service">first noticed by Game File last week</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/eula-update/">May 2025 EULA update</a> adds new language concerning the specific ways users are allowed to use "Nintendo Account Services" on the console, a term defined here to encompass the use of "video games and add-on content." Under the new EULA, any unlicensed use of the system not authorized by Nintendo could lead the company to "render the Nintendo Account Services <em>and/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part." </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>
<p>That language would apply to both the current Switch and the upcoming Switch 2.</p>
<p>Later in the same EULA, Nintendo adds new language clarifying that it reserves the right to "suspend your access to any or all Nintendo Account Services, in our sole discretion and without prior notice to you." That suspension can even come before a EULA violation occurs if Nintendo has "a reasonable belief such a violation... will occur, or as we otherwise determine to be reasonably necessary for legal, technical or commercial reasons, such as to prevent harm to other users or the Nintendo Account Services."</p>
<h2>Play inside the lines</h2>
<p>So what kind of Switch usage counts as a "violation" here? Unsurprisingly, playing pirated games is high on the list; the EULA now specifically calls out "obtain[ing], install[ing] or us[ing] any unauthorized copies of Nintendo Account Services." That language would likely apply to users with hacked console hardware and those who use any number of third-party flash carts to play pirated games.</p>

The video confirmed that the game's story will focus on Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos, after the couple was seen a bit in the first trailer that debuted in late 2023. Another fascinating aspect of the second trailer is Rockstar noting that it was captured on PS5--as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-includes-playstation-controller-and-console-references/1100-6531330/">some PlayStation references</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Days before the trailer dropped, Rockstar revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/">Grand Theft Auto VI would be delayed to May 26, 2026</a>. Previously, the game was set to arrive this fall. However, there was always skepticism about that release window because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/">Rockstar has a lengthy history of delays</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Grand Theft Auto VI is one of the most anticipated video games ever. One research company believes the Rockstar title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/">could sell 40 million copies and make $3 billion dollars</a> after just a year. Meanwhile, Circana believed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/">Grand Theft Auto VI would help the overall gaming industry bounce back</a> this year, along with Switch 2's launch, before the game was pushed back to 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">So far, Grand Theft Auto VI is only confirmed for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/">a PC version is expected later down the road</a>. Meanwhile, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-was-only-30fps-and-it-may-be-too-much-for-switch-2/1100-6531393/">doesn't believe the game will come to Switch 2</a> and even speculates it may not run on Steam Deck.</p>

            <p>
Last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> was stellar for many, many reasons, and composer Akira Yamaoka's gorgeous reworking of his nearly 20-year-old original soundtrack was undoubtedly one of them. So when you tell me the whole thing is being released as a fancy £125 six-disc vinyl edition, my power to resist - even as my bank balance screams in protest - is minimal.
</p>
<p>
Konami's newly announced <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/collections/silent-hill/products/silent-hill-2-limited-deluxe-x6lp-boxset">Silent Hill 2 Limited Edition Deluxe X6LP Boxset</a> is beautiful in a so-putrid-you-can-almost-smell-it sort of way. Each inner sleeve features strikingly grimy artwork from developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s concept work, and each translucent disc - officially described as "brown + red" - has the lurid purple sheen of rotting meat. Delightful!
</p>
<p>
Across the six discs - which are being released by Laced Records in collaboration with Konami - you get 93 tracks from last year's remake (I will inevitably be wearing a deep groove into Laura's Theme - Repetition) and there's 32-page art book featuring liner notes from Akira Yamaoka.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
And for those with far better impulse control than me, Laced is also releasing two alternate additions with fewer tracks and a smaller price tag. The <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/collections/silent-hill/products/silent-hill-2-deluxe-double-vinyl">Silent Hill 2 Double Deluxe Vinyl</a> features an 'essential selection' of 27 tracks from Yamaoka's soundtrack across two "black heavyweight" LPs for £36, and there's also an <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/collections/silent-hill/products/silent-hill-2-exclusive-edition-deluxe-double-vinyl">Exclusive Edition Double Deluxe Vinyl version</a> which is identical in content and price, but which comes on foggy hued "milky clear" discs.
</p>
<p>
All three editions are set launch this October, and pre-orders are available now.
</p>
<p>
And if you haven't already played Bloober Team's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake. Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">awarded it five stars in her review</a> and it earned itself fourth place in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2024-ranked">Eurogamer's best games of 2024</a>. All of which is incredibly encouraging for Bloober's next game, Cronos, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-has-found-its-feet-with-cronos-the-new-dawn-its-survival-horror-follow-up-to-silent-hill-2">alternate history sci-fi horror partially set in 1980s Krakow</a>.

            <p>Warner Bros had a 48 percent decrease in games revenue last quarter, as it failed to release a single game.</p>
<p>The company has released its latest earnings report, with the dip in revenue also owing to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> failing to meet expectations on its release last year, as well as strong carryover sales from the previous year of both the incredibly popular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> making for a tough comparison.</p>
<p>So why no games? Back in March, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-cancels-major-game-expansion-as-financial-woes-continue">reported the company cancelled a planned expansion to Hogwarts Legacy</a>, in addition to plans for a Definitive Edition with all content.</p>

<p>The expansion was never officially announced, but was reported by Bloomberg last year. Reportedly, it was cancelled due to the extra content not being substantial enough to justify its price.</p>
<p>Additional content for Suicide Squad has also now been curtailed, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-chapter-brings-game-to-a-cheap-end">the final Suicide Squad chapter</a>  released in January this year. The full game remains playable both online and offline, though fans complained its final addition was a cheap conclusion to the story.</p>
<p>After launch, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">game failed to meet sales expectations</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">reportedly flopped due to an ill-suited genre pivot</a>, a constantly shifting vision, and a culture of perfectionism. The studio, Rocksteady, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">suffered layoffs</a> as a result, but is now reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>.</p>
<p>Warner Bros also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancelled its Wonder Woman game</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thats-all-folks-another-warner-bros-live-service-bites-the-dust">ended support for live-service brawler Multiversus</a>, closing Monolith Productions and Player First Games in the process.</p>
<p>All of this has led to a quarter with no game releases from a major publisher.</p>
<p>Its next release will be Hogwarts Legacy on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> - one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">many launch games</a> arriving alongside Nintendo's new console</p>
<p>Still, the company is doing alright when it comes to films. In a letter to shareholders, the company described Warner Bros. Motion Pictures as recently "demonstrating strong momentum", driven largely by the massive success of A Minecraft Movie.</p>
<p>The game adaptation has grossed almost $900m globally since launch, with over $300m <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">generated in its first weekend</a>. It's the top grossing film of 2025 to date.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-releases-digitally-next-week">film will be available digitally later this week</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, NVIDIA <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/565124/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new GeForce driver (Game Ready version 576.40) for DOOM: The Dark Ages. The game is coming out on Thursday, May 15, but early access begins tomorrow for those who purchased the Premium Edition. This is also the edition that comes with the GeForce RTX 50 Series bundle <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-geforce-rtx-50-series-bundle-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>The game supports various NVIDIA GeForce RTX technologies, such as DLSS Super Resolution (on RTX 20 and upward GPUs), DLSS Frame Generation (on RTX 40 and upward GPUs), and DLSS Multi Frame Generation (on RTX 50 GPUs). NVIDIA says that owners of the latest graphics cards can expect up to 4x faster frame rates when enabling all these technologies at once. DOOM: The Dark Ages, powered by id Tech 8, also already supports ray tracing. However, with a post-launch update, its visuals will be further improved with full-fledged path tracing.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages received an 8.5/10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on Wccftech</a> from reviewer Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a rip-tearing fun ride that reigns in some of the excesses of DOOM Eternal, bringing the gameplay closer to DOOM (2016), while adding meat to the story in a long, meaty, campaign across over twenty stages. Put simply, if you liked DOOM and DOOM Eternal, you will like this, even if there are a few minor missteps.</em></p>

These days it feels like you need a pedantic, encyclopedia-level recall of in-universe minutiae to really call yourself that, which I certainly don’t have. Like a lot of folks, I’m mostly just here for vibes and battles. But somehow <em>Andor</em> has bridged that divide and made me appreciate all of those little details that classic <em>Star Wars </em>fans are always gooning over. It did it with a single blaster I haven’t thought about in years. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,197559,197556" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong><em>Spoiler Warning:</em></strong><em> If you’re not caught up on </em>Andor <em>season 2 this is your cue to turn back. The thing I’m going to share isn’t a major spoiler in and of itself, but why it works so well requires delving into some of the show’s biggest moments up through the most recent episode 9. </em></p><p>Okay, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/andor-s2-episode-7-8-9-review-vgchat-recap-star-wars-1851780084&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/andor-s2-episode-7-8-9-review-vgchat-recap-star-wars-1851780084">so near the end of the last episode</a></span>, rebel operative Vel is at the rebellion’s base on Yavin taking stock of the armaments. She notices an insignia on one of the guns and asks the group of new recruits who it belongs to. A guy in the back claims it as his own, and although his face looked really familiar, I couldn’t quite place it. The moment doesn’t linger for long and it also serves as a nod to the rebellion’s growing ranks, but I still had the nagging feeling I was supposed to recognize a deeper meaning to the exchange. </p><p>My instinct was right. While idly scrolling X over the weekend I came across a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RedTeamReview/status/1920875503889608810&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RedTeamReview/status/1920875503889608810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post by YouTuber RedTeamReview</a></span> that used a handful of screenshots to trace the backstory of the gun in question. It turns out it’s the gun Cassian took from Syril Karn in season 1 when the latter was trying to apprehend him for the unsolved murders on Morlana One in episode 3. Later, Arvel Skeen asks Cassian where he got it ahead of the heist on the imperial base on Aldhani. Arvel notes it’s “corpo issued” and Cassian simply responds, “Didn’t get a name.” </p><p>Cassian later hides it in his apartment on the beachy resort planet of Niamos only to get captured and sent to the prison on Narkina 5. After spurring the revolt there, he escapes alongside another inmate named Ruescott Melshi. They get back to Niamos and Cassian gives him Syril’s blaster as they agree to split up for a better chance at survival and spreading the message of what happened to them on Narkina 5. Thanks to episode 9, we now know that Ruescott eventually finds his way to the rebel base on Yavin, where presumably Vel recognized the gun from when Cassian used it in the Aldhani mission. Incredible!</p><p>But somehow the best detail draws on an even more subtle throughline. While <em>Andor </em>viewers have watched Syril obsessively hunt Cassian and other “outside agitators” because of some pathological need to assert law and order, Cassian has no real idea who he even is, culminating in an exasperated “Who are you?”  that stops Syril dead in his tracks when the two finally throw down during the Ghorman Massacre. The “didn’t catch a name” from back on Aldhani hits even harder in that context, and Syril’s blaster unexpectedly ends up acting like a sort of breadcrumb trail leading us back to it. </p><p>Callbacks like this rarely net such a payoff, especially in the blockbuster IP franchises we’re now surrounded by. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501">Most easter eggs</a></span> these days amount to simple name dropping so that anyone not in the know has to go Google what was going on until they eventually end up on a for-profit wiki so loaded up with auto-play ads and pop-ups that it crashes their browser. This is why I’ve generally defaulted to rolling my eyes at cheap lore deepcuts meant to earn credibility without actually doing the work, and why<em> Andor</em> is such a breath of fresh Chandrila air. </p><p>The show did the same thing with a moment in <em>Rogue One</em>, which all of <em>Andor</em> is leading up to, when Cassian tells Jyn Erso that “rebellions are built on hope,” a line she later repeats as the sentiment begins to take hold. Showrunner Tony Gilroy said he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/andor-creator-mocked-by-son-not-including-famous-rogue-one-line-11730406&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/andor-creator-mocked-by-son-not-including-famous-rogue-one-line-11730406" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was bullied by his son</a></span> into giving the quote an origin story in <em>Andor</em>, which is why the Ghorman bellhop ends up saying it to Cassian right before the fighting breaks out. That hope culminates in a bomb he lobs to give Ghorman’s freedom fighters a route to escape. So much of modern <em>Star Wars</em> is slavishly devoted to stale canon for no reason. <em>Andor</em> is the rare exception. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Among the cards was <strong>Sephiroth, Fabled Soldier // Sephiroth, One-Winged Angel</strong>, a double-faced card with new original artwork from Tetsuya Nomura, the creative director of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth at Square Enix. Nomura commented on the artwork he created for the card via social media, while also hinting that there may be more to the card than it seems.</p><p dir="ltr">The card features adult Sephiroth on one side, and it flips over to show his final form, Safer Sephiroth. Nomura <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1921822729013186730" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">says</a> that he specifically designed the art to match up vertically: "if you manage to get two of the same card and line them up, you'll see how the original illustration looked."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4492449-sephiroth.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492449" data-ratio="0.69857697283312" data-width="1546" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4492449-sephiroth.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492449"></a><figcaption>Sephiroth, Fabled Soldier // Sephiroth, One-Winged Angel</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4492449-sephiroth.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, Nomura also commented that one of the halves may seem different to eagle-eyed FF7 fans. "There is also a reason that the design of Safer Sephiroth is different from the original game," Nomura said, "but I unfortunately can't share more about that."</p><p dir="ltr">The tease implies that something about Safer Sephiroth is going to change from what fans normally expect, though <em>when</em> that change happens is still a mystery.

            <p>Word on the street is that Rockstar is getting ready to release a GTA 4 port for modern consoles.</p>
<p>According to the latest rumours from known Rockstar insider Tez2, a spruced up version of the open-world action game could release later this year, followed by a remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne-3">Max Payne 3</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1001944-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2/page/90/#comment-1072547918">GTA Forum</a>, Tez2 said someone at Rockstar had "hinted" at a GTA 4 port, and "by now it should've gone up a year in development". The insider added that this port was one of the reasons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">Rockstar put the stoppers on the fan-made Liberty City Preservation Project earlier this year</a>. This project would have added a playable version of Grand Theft Auto 4's map to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a>.</p>

<p>"If [Rockstar] still follow their plan laid out from the pandemic days, they'll do an MP3 port after 4. So that is an opportunity to do a bundle or a Definitive Edition. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2 remakes, and a Max Payne 3 port," Tez2 wrote.</p>
<p>GTA 4 is set in Liberty City - Rockstar's version of New York - and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-cast-and-locations-revealed-troublesome-rappers-vice-city-and-beyond">where GTA 6 protagonist Lucia Caminos hails from</a>. So, a GTA 4 port ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s release may be a nice way to tide players over until next May, while also offering a bit of background on Lucia's once home.</p>
<p>Haven't played GTA 4 for yourself yet? Well, on its release Eurogamer called it "a genuinely ground-breaking blockbuster" in video game history back in the day.</p>
<p>"There were moments playing GTA 4 that I thought back to my initial experiences with games, and realised exactly how far we've come. There's never been anything quite like GTA 4in the world. That there makes me genuinely happy to be a gamer," Kieron Gillen wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-iv-1-8">Eurogamer's GTA 4 review from 2008</a>. "Also, beating up people and taking their money and stuff."</p>

<p>As for the future of the series, the next new mainline entry will be Grand Theft Auto 6, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">due to release across PS5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>
Ahoy, consumer of PC games! I fear that Void War may be highly relevant to your statistically determined interests. It's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space</a> combat game in which you steer ancient, crenellated starships through a frightful cosmos of blood cultists, imperial zealots, and ravening corsairs. You will warp from node to node on a roguelite system map, with each node harbouring battles, story encounters, and the occasional friendly or at least, not immediately hostile face such as a merchant. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
To say that in less: this is Subset's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL: Faster Than Light</a> but set in something very like the despairing galaxy of Warhammer 40,000. It is flatplan offbrand Battlefleet Gothica. In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only the mood trailer, below.

<p>
The full game is out 30th May, and there is a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2853590/Void_War/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war">Itch</a>. I have played that demo for about 20 minutes. Here are some exciting things that happened: I got a new recruit killed during a boarding action; I blew up a cultist vessel crewed by reanimating ghouls and some kind of skull wizard, who kept doing psychic sabotage on my engines; I found some vials of demon worms behind a horrible astral altar, which I am saving for the next skull wizard. 
</p>
<p>
All very enjoyable. Perhaps a bit too familiar? It's been years since I played FTL, but this often feels identical. Engagements unfold in real-time, but you can pause to micromanage. The basic trick is to allocate reactor energy between your ship systems, especially your shields and weapons, while ordering your crew between rooms to operate systems and deal with invaders or hazards like fires. 
</p>
<p>
The art direction is also a bit plain for a project riding Games Workshop's coat tails - I need more grot, guts and greebling, damn your eyes. Still, the setting feels adequately horrendous. For example: I have just installed a cannon that gives other ships the plague. I entertain high hopes of recruiting a skull wizard of my own.
</p>
<p>
Going by the breakdown of the backer alpha on the Itch.io page, the full game will offer in the region of: 10 playable ships, eight playable commanders, 70 crew types across six factions, 60 kinds of weapon, 50 modules and 19 ship systems, plus 140 crew items. There is possibly a Warhammer 40,000 FTL mod that does some or all of this already. If you know of one please educate me. If you find all this too grimdark, consider playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/breachway">Breachway</a> instead.

This is because Final Fantasy Remake itself only adapted the opening few hours of the original game, up to the point where the party leaves Midgar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth expanded the scope significantly, however, introducing the open world and thus covering myriad locations such as Costa del Sol, the Golden Saucer, and many more, including some new ones.</p><div id="best-mainline-final-fantasy-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3><h3>Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It brought the overall story up to the end of Disc 1 of the original Final Fantasy 7, which closes in both games with what's arguably the most iconic moment in video game history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part 3 will pick up immediately after this, though very little is known about it so far. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-in-development">Development began in June 2022</a> but Square Enix hasn't said when it will end, only vaguely noting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027">it hopes to release Part 3 by 2027</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Something it has said, however, is that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-we-will-not-cheat-with-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-airship">it "will not cheat" when it comes to the Highwind airship</a>. This allowed the party to quickly move around the map in the original game but, now in the world of fast travel, many fans wondered how the iconic ship could be implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will not cheat with the airship system [in Part 3] but take the challenge head on so it can freely fly all over the game map," Hamaguchi said last November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.
