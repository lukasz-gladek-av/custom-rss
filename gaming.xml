			<p>Neverwinter Nights 2 is a game I didn’t play when I was younger. I don’t know why, because I loved the first game when I was a teenager despite not really knowing what I was doing, but I just never grabbed the sequel back in the day. I did eventually venture in about two months ago, loading up the original game with a bunch of mods, and that very recent experience has me questioning why Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition is really necessary.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TgSqwnpjxyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Neverwinter Nights 2 is a CRPG built around the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 ruleset. It’s big, complex, and incredibly satisfying provided you know what you’re doing. The star here is the story and writing, which is incredibly deep and has more detail that’s just mentioned in passing than you’ll know what to do with. Starting in a village that is inevitably attacked, you recover a macguffin and are sent to the city of Neverwinter by your almost comically disinterested adoptive father. From there begins the kind of fantasy adventure you’d expect, although sometimes with enemies you might not, such as the lizardfolk which are a scourge upon your progress early on.</p>



<p>It’s an excellent game, truly a classic, but this remaster has done the absolute minimum. For one, I played this game on PC three months ago and I’m not certain there’s much of a visual difference between what I saw on my PC then and this enhanced edition. It still looks pretty dated, despite improvements to texture quality, which have counterintuitively made environments look strangely sparse. Characters fare a little better, honestly looking quite good when you’re zoomed out considering, but when you’re in conversation and the camera is zoomed all the way in, they’re still a bit rough. They’re still better than the ones in the first game and its remaster, though that’s more down to the leap in graphics tech between 2002 and 2006 than this remaster.</p>

<p>Little seems to have been done to improve the actual gameplay experience as well. There are also bugs, such as one from just the first fifteen minutes of play that forced me to repeatedly murder a villager who kept getting back up. I was supposed to beat him up a little and then he gives up and agrees to go help defend the town, but instead he continued attacking me afterwards, constantly distracting my party members so they weren’t with me when I triggered combat.</p>

<p>There’s also annoying little things wrong as well, such as having to open a door, then interact with the door again to actually use it, which is dumb on its own (just go through the door the first time!) and fiddly because positioning yourself to interact with it is awkward and the camera has a habit of suddenly zooming all the way in when I’m standing in front of a door so I can’t see. This happened on literally the first door I used.</p>
<p>As a console port of an old PC game, the controls are about what you’d expect for a keyboard and mouse game on a controller. It works just well enough that you’ll be able to put up with the awkwardness if you love the game. It’s definitely not ideal, but it does the job.</p>

<p>Outside of all this, it’s Neverwinter Nights 2 with all of its expansions playable on consoles with a controller. That’s nice. It would’ve been nicer to see some real attention given to these games to perhaps iron out some now almost twenty year old bugs and really improve things, but at least it’s playable and exactly how you remember it. For better or worse. Of course you could just play the original on PC and benefit from all the mods that have released over the years, no doubt some of which will also improve the game’s textures.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition does the bare minimum as it brings the game to consoles. It looks a bit better, but that's about it. It's still buggy and rough around the edges, but it is at least Neverwinter Nights 2. If you really want to sit back and play it with a controller, this will do it for you. If you want anything more, the original is more than playable on pretty much any PC, and has deep mod support.	</p></div>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/mafia-the-old-country-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-return-of-the-gangster-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> launches tomorrow, nearly nine years after the last mainline entry in the franchise, making fans more than eager to get their hands on this new game. Sure, in 2020, there was the Mafia: Definitive Edition remake of the original classic from 2002, but this is a new story, albeit one set in the past.</p>



<p>As the title suggests, Mafia: The Old Country does not take place in America's fictional cities of Lost Heaven, Empire Bay, or New Bordeaux. Instead, it is an origin story of the Sicilian Mafia set on Italy's island very early in the 1900s.</p>



<p>In that light, it is more interesting from a narrative perspective because it shows the true roots of the Mafia. Most American movies have focused on the American side, but the Italian side is where you really understand what it's all about - chiefly, the unyielding adherence to certain values of that world, for better and for worse.</p>



<p>As an Italian myself, I was doubly glad that Hangar 13 chose this setting. Sicily has long been neglected in videogames, and there's hardly a better chance to portray it than in a new Mafia title. To do so, the developers from Hangar 13 (headquartered in Novato, California, but with two offices in the Czech Republic) partnered with local game developer Stormind Games, known for titles like Remothered: Tormented Fathers and Broken Procelain, Batora: Lost Haven, and A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.</p>



<p>Through a joint effort documented in a developer diary, Stormind helped Hangar 13 recreate turn-of-the-twentieth-century Sicily, and I'm pleased to report that the results are excellent. In fact, Mafia: The Old Country may very well include the best, most accurate rendition of Sicily ever seen in a game. Everything from the visuals to the dialect and the music is faithfully reproduced. To that end, I would recommend selecting the extremely well-done Sicilian voiceover and add to that whatever subtitles you need to maximize immersion.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mafia_The_Old_Country_Hillside_Church-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>That's particularly useful because the game is heavily narrative-driven. All the games in the franchise were, albeit to a different extent. Mafia III, for example, included a proper open world experience, whereas previous entries allowed for open world exploration but only offered minimal side activities. </p>



<p>For this new game, Hangar 13 cut all that. There are no real side activities to be found in Mafia: The Old Country, unless you consider gathering hidden fox-like statuettes or Trinacria symbols such a thing. No, the game is very linear, jumping straight from mission to mission. It can be compared to the Uncharted series in this regard (though the very last one, 2017's The Lost Legacy, actually allowed a decent degree of open ended gameplay that is absent here), with plenty of car chases and setpieces to mark pivotal moments in the story.</p>



<p>The game does occasionally allow you to roam a bit of the countryside of San Celeste (a fictional town located in the vicinity of Mount Etna, which would put it in Eastern Sicily) by car or horse, but there really is nothing to do there except look at the gorgeous environments. I can't help but think that's a bit of a shame - while I understand why the developers decided to go with a full linear design (and a lower price), I believe there's a lot of potential in an open world game set in Sicily, provided that it is filled with enough content to make the exploration worth it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mafia_The_Old_Country_Horse_Riding-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>During missions, gameplay consists of a blend of stealth and shooting, just like in the aforementioned Uncharted franchise (platforming, however, is entirely absent). In most missions, you're given the chance to either go in guns blazing or get the drop on the enemies first. Sneaking behind an enemy triggers a little mini-game where you must mash a button repeatedly to fill a bar to knock out the unlucky foe. You can then grab the body and hide it somewhere it won't be seen; otherwise, some other guard could alert the whole map against you. The developers have conveniently (perhaps even too conveniently) placed a great many trunks throughout the levels where bodies of knocked-out foes can be hidden. This is where I noticed something odd: not only could each trunk fit as many as three bodies before becoming unavailable for further disposal, but the previously deposited bodies simply disappeared, with the trunk looking empty each time. A missing detail, albeit a small one, to be sure. </p>



<p>Whenever multiple enemies are looking in the same direction, you can distract one either with a coin toss or by grabbing an empty bottle from the environment and launching it elsewhere. If stealth fails, it will come to shooting. Here, Mafia: The Old Country includes various era-appropriate weapons, from small pistols to sawed-off shotguns, regular shotguns, and long-range guns. These can either be acquired by spending denari (the in-game currency that can be looted off enemies and acquired from small chests after breaking them open with a knife) or by simply looting from the ground weapons used by defeated foes. The shooting component is solid enough, if not quite exceptional. Enemy AI is not the smartest during stealth, but it appears to be more proactive when fights break out, advancing at a steady pace and even flanking the main character's position. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the game lacks a seamless transition from stealth to melee combat, which is a bit jarring. If, for some reason, the enemy you're sneaking on turns early enough, you cannot really switch to fist-fighting like you would in another action/adventure title such as Uncharted. In that case, you'd have to switch to guns instead, as there is no bare-handed melee combat. </p>



<p>The game does include extensive knife fights, but only in one-on-one, cinematic duels against key characters. In these instances, the camera switches to focus solely on the two fighters, not unlike a fighting game. The moveset is a conventional one: the player can select two types of strikes, and also parry and counterattack, and dodge, which is particularly useful against those attacks that cannot be parried (as with most games, they are highlighted in red). They are, effectively, 'boss fights', including two big bars for each contender.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mafia_The_Old_Country_Knife_Fight-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country does feature some character progression, but it's honestly paper-thin. You can equip a few items that provide small boons, such as the chance to dodge a bullet or the ability to carry extra ammunition or bandages. These items can be found scattered throughout the levels, but they do not make much of a difference. Overall, the challenge level is decent when playing on Hard.</p>



<p>By far the best reason to play this game is witnessing the rise and fall of Enzo Favara. The protagonist of Mafia: The Old Country is an orphan youngster who spent long years toiling as an indentured laborer, practically a slave, in the sulfur mines. Following the death of his one and only friend in the mines, Enzo takes his chances and escapes, ending up under the protection of Don Bernardo Torrisi. He begins as the lowliest laborer there, but soon proves his worth in increasingly challenging circumstances. </p>



<p>Without spoiling anything, the plot is pretty much what you can expect from the genre: a talented low-born's tumultuous rise all the way to the top, only to fall again in the end. That said, even without any big twists, the story is told exceptionally well, especially during the cutscenes (the dialogues outside of the cutscenes have worse facial animations). The characters are memorable, if a bit trite, and will stay with you even after reaching the game's ending, which took me twelve hours.</p>



<p>From a technical standpoint, Mafia: The Old Country is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and looks suitably appealing, showing off gorgeous environmental details. Stuttering is thankfully minimal and perhaps that's mostly due to the lack of any open-world elements, which might have complicated matters. The PC version does not feature any ray tracing, offering only standard UE5 options. When it comes to upscalers, all main options are available: Unreal Engine's TSR, NVIDIA DLSS (with Frame Generation selectable in-game and the Multi Frame Generation override available via NVIDIA app), AMD FSR and Intel XeSS (both without frame generation). Even at max settings and 4K resolution, the game only needs about 6.4GB of VRAM.</p>



<p>Finally, the soundtrack is owed a well-earned mention for complementing the mood and ambience in such a striking way.</p>

				<p>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released its financial statement for the first quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and sales are up compared to last year, with the company pledging to continue focusing on its live-service offerings in the future.</p>

<p>As revealed in the statement's accompanying financial <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_sonyspeech.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">documents</a>, overall sales for Sony's gaming segment are up by 8% compared to the first quarter of 2024-25, and operating income more than doubled for "a new quarterly high".</p>

<p>These numbers are up due mainly to "increased sales of third-party software", and while Sony doesn't specify which games sold particularly well, it's very likely that games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Oblivion Remastered</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur</em></a>, and the PS5 release of&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>bolstered its numbers for this quarter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remastered-sony-financials-q1-2025.jpg?itok=5g1B0cdG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remastered-sony-financials-q1-2025.jpg?itok=ynJFbMgk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games like&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>have probably helped Sony to no end this quarter.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Sony says its live-service revenue is "steadily growing" thanks to the performance of games like&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, contributing "more than 40% of...first-party software revenue during the quarter".</p>

<p>In a Q&amp;A following the release (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-its-live-service-shift-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly-but-pledges-to-carry-on-and-learn-from-mistakes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Sony CFO Lin Tao said the company will continue to pursue live-service games despite "negative news" about its two most recent live-service releases, namely&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Marathon</i>.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">unceremoniously shut down last year</a> following a disastrous launch, while Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed following negative feedback</a> from its alpha test, as well as news that the game contained <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">art stolen from an online artist</a>.</p>

<p>Tao says that despite these problems, live-service games are "contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner", citing the aforementioned three still-operational live-service games, as well as&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I'm sure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> won't be exactly the same game, despite their obvious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">bullet casing-littered common ground</a>. However, they are opting to mirror each other in one manner - both will require you to enable secure booting on your PC.</p>
<p>As if summoned to do so by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">EA letting everyone know</a> that this week's BF6 open beta would necessitate a delve in your BIOS to click yes on a thing in the name of eliminating cheating, Activision <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05">have revealed</a> Blops is doing the same thing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>With the arrival of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a>'s season five today, August 7, EA are initiating a "phased rollout" of secure booting and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 as mandatory requirements when hopping into an entry of the series. The goal is to stop folks from loading any files not flagged as 'safe' when they fire up their PCs, such as ones they might use to do the likes of aimbotting or wallhacking.</p>
<p>The switch isn't happening overnight, with this Black Ops 6 season still letting you jump in if you've not enabled one or both features, but you will be served notifications telling you to sort your setup out for the future in that case. Then, when Black Ops 7 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-been-announced-can-someone-please-explain-the-plot-of-these-games-to-me">prone-crawls its way out of the gulag</a> later this year, it'll be mandatory to have both enabled to play.</p>
<p>"These hardware-level protections are a key part of our anti-cheat efforts, and we’re asking all players to get compliant now," Activision wrote. They also provided <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/trusted-platform-module-and-secure-boot">instructions</a> as to how to check whether you've got secure boot and TPM 2.0 enabled via your BIOS settings, and turn them on if not.</p>
<p>If your game-playing box's specs are fairly up-to-date, and especially if you're running Windows 10 or 11, it shouldn't be too much of a faff to sort. That's provided you're open to taking these extra steps with your own hardware as part of publishers' efforts to try and combat cheating by, in Activision's words, enacting measures to "strengthen security and protect the experience, without impacting performance."</p>
<p>As of right now, the company don't have any immediate plans to make secure booting and TMP 2.0 mandatory for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>, but they indicate that could change in future. They also wrote that they'll "share more details on additional protection measures we’ll be putting in place for Call of Duty as we get closer to the Black Ops 7 launch", and that enabling two-factor authentication on your Activision account might become mandatory down the road.</p>
<p>If it helps, maybe imagine it's Captain Price ordering you to do all of this admin just to shoot some folks dressed in swanky tactical getups. Also, if you've been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-battlefield-6-beta-queues-stretching-around-the-block-a-substantial-increase-in-server-capacity-should-just-have-helped">sitting in a Battlefield 6 beta queue all morning</a>, some server messing about by EA should hopefully help you get in soon.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> has passed another round number milestone, as Sony has announced that they have shipped 80.3 million consoles.</p>
<p>The past quarter – ending on 30th June – saw Sony ship 2.5 million more PS5s, up from 2.4 million in the same quarter last year, which is good news for the continued appeal of the platform.&nbsp;Digging back through <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/18q2_supplement.pdf">Sony’s older financial statements</a>, the PS4 would have been at 79.6 million consoles sold by the same point in its lifetime, so the PS5 is sneaking ahead of the last generation at this point.</p>


<p>Even better, of course, is that people are still massively engaged with PlayStation gaming in general. There were 123 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network last quarter, up by seven million from the year before. Similarly, game sales for both PS5 and PS4 combined for 65.9 million games sold, up by 12.3 million from last year. Of that, 6.9 million were first party titles, and we’re now at the point where 83% of games sold are digital downloads.</p>
<p>All good stuff for Sony and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-expected-to-released-by-march-2026-as-bungie-independence-is-%E2%80%9Cgetting-lighter%E2%80%9D.1264227/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony’s CFO has stated that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> is expected to release by the end of March 2026, as Bungie’s independence from PlayStation Studios is now “getting lighter”</p>
<p>The statements came from CFO Lin Tao as part of a Q&amp;A following Sony’s latest financial statements, in which she said that launch is still expected within the current fiscal year, ending on 31st March 2026. However, as this was in response to a question over what would happen if Marathon was cancelled outright, she added, “this is not a commitment. No official announcement has been given yet.”</p>


<p>She also said, “We are now doing modifications in development and, based on the progress, in the autumn time frame we believe we can communicate when we can launch [Marathon], either from Bungie or PlayStation.”</p>
<p>For Bungie as a studio, there’s been plenty of speculation and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/bungies-independence-reportedly-under-threat-developers-suffering-low-morale/">reporting over their independence</a> and ability to operate separately from the rest of PlayStation Studios. Through 2024, the company went through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">a painful round of layoffs and game cancellations</a>, while some teams were branched off into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/sony-founds-new-studio-teamlfg-from-former-bungie-incubation-project/">separate studios</a>.</p>
<p>Tao explained Sony’s longterm plan for Bungie and that “at the time of acquisition we were offering a very independent environment, so that was one way of thinking. However, thereafter, we have gone through structural reform, as we announced last year, so this independence is getting lighter, and Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios, and integration is proceeding.</p>

<p>“So in the long term, if you can see this as an ongoing process, the direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios.”</p>
<p>It’s definitely concerning times for Bungie, with the launch of Destiny 2’s latest expansion, The Edge of Fate, seeming to do poorly, both from the point of sales and reaction from the game’s fanbase. Marathon was intended to be the big shining hope for the company, but the extraction shooter revamp of the studio’s mid-90s FPS series has struggled to gain traction. Having been announced for release in September, closed testing drew strong criticism such that Bungie was forced to delay the game. There was also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/bungie-pins-marathon-art-plagiarism-on-former-employee-promises-to-do-right-by-original-artist/">a whole art plagiarism scandal</a>.</p>
<p>“Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear,” the team wrote in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/marathon-has-been-delayed-as-bungie-commit-to-building-on-player-feedback/">a Marathon Development Update in June</a>. “We’ve taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion.”</p>
<p>It’s expected that Bungie will be able to make fresh announcements on the game this autumn.</p>

			<p>Bungie's <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/">Marathon</a> will launch by March 2026, the end of the current fiscal year, although Sony has yet to commit to this release window.</p>



<p>Speaking during a Q&amp;A session which followed the company's latest financial report, where it was also revealed that Sony shipped <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/">80.3 million PlayStation 5 units</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-marathon-is-expected-to-release-before-march-and-bungies-independence-is-getting-lighter/">VGC</a>, Sony CFO Lin Tao confirmed that Marathon's sales were factored in the latest forecast, as the company expects the game to be out by March 2026. This, however, isn't a commitment to this release window, as the company believes it can announce a release date by this Fall, as previously confirmed. Though a release date hasn't been set, chances of Marathon being ultimately canceled are slim. The game's issues are being fixed, so the Sony CFO believes the game will indeed launch.</p>



<p>Besides commenting on the Marathon release date, the Sony CFO also commented on the current state of Bungie. Right after the acquisition, the Destiny 2 developer enjoyed a certain degree of independence, but this independence is getting lighter, and the developer is "shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios." Ultimately, the developer's direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">2024's restructuring</a> was one of the steps towards this direction.</p>



<p>Marathon was initially scheduled to release on September 23, but was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed</a> shortly after its reveal due to the game's bad reception and some controversies, including using <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">art assets from an artist without their permission</a>. With the additional development time, Bungie aims to up the survival game with more engaging AI encounters, more rewarding runs with new types of loot and dynamic events, increase visual fidelity, add more narrative and environmental storytelling elements, and improve the experience for solo and duo players. Hopefully, the additional development time will be enough to help Bungie give Marathon a distinct identity, which it didn't really show at reveal.</p>

            <p>A new joint investigation between the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud">Guardian</a>, Israeli-Palestinian publication <a href="https://www.972mag.com/microsoft-8200-intelligence-surveillance-cloud-azure/">+972 Magazine</a>, and Hebrew-language outlet <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%9e%d7%99%d7%9c%d7%99%d7%95%d7%9f-%d7%a9%d7%99%d7%97%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%91%d7%a9%d7%a2%d7%94-%d7%94%d7%9e%d7%90%d7%92%d7%a8-%d7%a9%d7%9c-8200-%d7%a2%d7%9c-%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%aa%d7%99-%d7%9e%d7%99/">Local Call</a> has claimed that Microsoft have worked with the Israeli military to store surveillance data on Palestinian civilians in Azure servers overseas, with some of that data allegedly being used to research and identify bombing targets. The report has led to renewed calls for game developers and players to join <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">the recently launched Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign</a> against Microsoft and Xbox gaming products and services - in particular, Minecraft, Call Of Duty, Candy Crush, and Game Pass. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The report is based on interviews with 11 sources from Microsoft and the Israeli military, plus access to a cache of leaked Microsoft documents. In late 2021, the Guardian piece begins, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella met with Yossi Sariel, the commander of Israel's military surveillance agency Unit 8200, to discuss plans for storing intelligence data on Microsoft cloud servers. According to the report's sources, the inspiration for these proposals was that Israel's military did not have the storage space or computing power to handle the amount of data they wanted to collect and process.
</p>
<p>The alleged result of that conversation was a cloud-based system that became operational in 2022, and has been used to gather "indiscriminate" recordings of Palestinian phone calls in the West Bank and Gaza. According to the report, as of July this year around 11,500 terabytes of Israeli military data were being held in Microsoft Azure servers in the Netherlands, while a smaller proportion were stored in Ireland, though not all of this data may be from Unit 8200.
</p>
<p>"Thanks to the control it exerts over Palestinian telecommunications infrastructure, Israel has long intercepted phone calls in the occupied territories," the report notes. "But the indiscriminate new system allows intelligence officers to play back the content of cellular calls made by Palestinians, capturing the conversations of a much larger pool of ordinary civilians." One of the investigation's sources also explains how these phone recordings may have been used to plan airstrikes, commenting that intelligence officers would use the cloud-based system to examine calls made by people in the vicinity of an individual target.</p>
<p>Sariel ultimately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/12/head-of-israeli-spy-agency-unit-8200-resigns-over-7-october-failings">resigned his position in September 2024</a> in response to criticism for failing to anticipate the surprise Hamas-led attacks on Israeli civilians in October 2023, which left over a thousand dead with hundreds taken hostage. According to this week's Guardian report, he was accused of prioritising fancy new technology over older surveillance methods.</p>
<p>But the cloud-based system he allegedly developed with Microsoft's assistance is said to remain in use alongside AI-driven target recommendation tools, as the Israeli military continues a punitive and open-ended assault on Gaza that has killed over 60,000 people, the majority of them civilians, and left hundreds of thousands more homeless and starving.</p>
<p>The report argues that Microsoft had some awareness during development of the system that it was being used to collect phone calls and facilitate airstrikes. It cites internal records that show that during the initial 2021 meeting with Nadella, Sariel referred only to "sensitive workloads" of secret data, not the storage of Palestinian phone calls. But it adds that "documents suggest that Microsoft engineers understood the data stored in Azure would include raw intelligence, including audio files" and that Israel-based Microsoft staff, who allegedly include former members of Unit 8200, appear to have known about the project's overall objectives. </p>
<p>The report also references files that show that Microsoft executives anticipated hundreds in millions of dollars in revenue from the project, calling it "an incredibly powerful brand moment" for Azure.</p>
<p>Back in May, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">confirmed that they had supplied technology to the Israeli military for use in Gaza</a>. But they insisted that they had found "no evidence" that it was being used to target or harm Palestinians, citing an external review carried out by an unnamed third party.</p>
<p>They have also pushed back on this week's claims, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the Guardian that they have "no information" on the data being stored in the cloud by Unit 8200. "At no time during this engagement," the spokesperson added, "has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft's services, including through the external review it commissioned."</p>
<p>Asked about Nadella and Sariel's relationship, the spokesperson continued that the CEO "attended for 10 minutes at the end of the meeting" and there was "no discussion" of the exact content of the "sensitive workloads" above.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Microsoft's comments, this week's news has fuelled calls to join the BDS boycott, with some participants pointing out that this doesn't have to mean parting ways entirely with any and all Microsoft services. "BDS has a standing boycott target on Microsoft products which people can realistically drop from their lives, understanding that not everyone can change their operating system," wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kitsune-tails">Kitsune Tails</a> lead artist and gameplay designer Allison Shabet in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rally.luckyraven.cc/post/3lvr42n2vm22i">a Bluesky post yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>In another <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/austinwalker.bsky.social/post/3lvr4m3lhi222">Bluesky thread</a>, game designer and writer Austin Walker added that "I've obviously been saying this a lot lately, but BDS does not expect anyone to drop everything made by Microsoft all at once. They pick very specific targets in order to get as wide a coalition as possible, and in the case of Xbox, even suggest different tiers of engagement."

              <p>Sony’s latest financial results are in, and the PS5 is doing better than anyone expected. Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-best-selling-forza-horizon-elder-scrolls-oblivion-1851787356">a woeful lack of new games</a> exclusive to the PlayStation console, people won’t stop buying the device, with another 2.5 million units bought between April and June 2025. That’s slightly better than it sold during the same period last year, and brings the lifetime total to 80.3 million. <a href="https://in.ign.com/xbox-series-x-1/238086/news/xbox-series-x-and-s-microsoft-has-reportedly-sold-less-than-30-million-consoles-this-generation">Recent rumors</a> have suggested that the Xbox Series may have sold only 30 million in the same time. Awks.</p> <p>Sony had some other big numbers to boast about. The PlayStation Network currently has 123 million “active users,” up seven million since the same time last year. Meanwhile, 65.9 million PS4 and PS5 games were sold in April to June’s Q1 up 12 million on 2024, although it’s notable that only 6.9 million of those were first party titles. Bear in mind that <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-sales-figures-2000614194">Nintendo sold six million copies of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a> alone in a single month, for a brand new console with no previously established user base, and you can see how Sony’s first party numbers look pretty shaky right now. Although given the success of PS Plus and the hefty cut taken for every software sale, it doesn’t seem like people will be too worried.</p> <p>This all means the PS5 is performing pretty much exactly as well as the PS4 and PS3 before it, all of which should make Sony delighted. Those machines sold during times of financial recovery, while the PlayStation 5 launched in the midst of global catastrophe. Covid was at its peak, while supply chain issues and chip shortages meant the machines couldn’t fill shelves until months after the official launch.</p>

 <p>Sony of course has multiple revenue sources, across music, movies and technology, with $17.8 billion in sales across all its divisions in Q1, again, slightly up on last year, movies alone reporting $2.3 billion. But gaming was responsible for over $6.3 billion, making the sector worth almost triple that of movies to the Japanese corporation. Imagine if the mainstream press noticed.</p> <p>These numbers clearly explain <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">Microsoft’s strategy</a> to start releasing its first-party games onto Sony’s console. A base of 80 million potential new customers is more than double its own, and taking advantage of this is <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-ps5-microsoft-xbox-1851786765">already proving extremely successful</a>. Of course Xbox games are going to launch day-one on PlayStation, when its tripling the possible audience.</p>

<p>As reported on the ResetERA forums, the highly anticipated second entry in the series will be playable at the Nintendo booth at this year's Gamescom, which takes place from August 20 to August 24 in Cologne, Germany. At the booth, players will also be able to try out <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-4k-60-fps-nintendo-switch-2/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/">Hades II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-has-been-rated-by-the-esrb-suggesting-nintendo-switch-2-release-may-be-imminent/">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">Borderlands 4</a>, EA Sports FC 2026, and the already released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-hands-on/">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition.</a></p>



<p>With Hollow Knight: Silksong being playable for the first time to the public this month at both the Nintendo and the Xbox booths, and the game said to be available by the time the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds launch worldwide later this year, a release window which <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-out-this-year-team-cherry-confirms/">Team Cherry also&nbsp;confirmed</a>, there's no doubt a release date announcement is right around the corner. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-indie-world-direct-hollow-knight-silksong/">Yesterday</a>, it was suggested by creator Switchforce, who leaked the Nintendo Indie World Direct happening later today before its official announcement, that the game developed by Team Cherry won't be at the show, but there's still the chance the release date will be announced this month, as the Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase on August 19 would be the perfect stage for one of the most anticipated game announcements of the year.</p>

            <p>If you've tried to hop into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta's early access period this morning and have ended up sitting a queue behind thousands of other folks in camo gear, then don't panic. Or at least that's what EA say, as their wrenches slam against the game's servers in an attempt to let more people in.</p>
<p>With players stuck <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mjubus/i_guess_im_not_playing_tonight/">twiddling</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mju39x/im_getting_trolled_by_the_servers/">their</a> <a href="https://x.com/Sephiroth_VM/status/1953395511010173366">thumbs</a> in lines that can stick you as far away as 240-something thousandth from the front, the developers have been jolted into action. After all, you don't want to anger the sorts of folks who're up for shooting some blokes on an otherwise chill Thursday morning.</p>

<p>"The team is now working on a substantial increase in server capacity, which will reduce your time in the queue," the official Battlefield comms account tweeted amid the cries. "Thank you for your continued patience as we work to get as many of you into the game as soon as possible."</p>
<p>As of a few minutes ago, it appears that works begun to see the lines go down. "We are now seeing signs of queue numbers returning to suitable levels and times," reads a follow-up tweet, "Thank you for your patience as we worked to mitigate the issue. We'll continue to keep an eye on queues and server capacity, and will follow up where needed!"</p> <div>

<p>So, hopefully if you've had to wait for your dose of early FPS access this morning, you should now be facing less time spent staring at a number. Maybe you've been smart and decided to give up on the line until this afternoon, in which case it sounds like you should end up getting in pretty rapidly if you're lucky.</p>
<p>If you've yet to double-check which modes, maps and changes from previous Battlefield Labs testing you'll be in for if you do jump into the open beta from today, August 7th, (early access) or August 9th (general), then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback">read this</a>.

We don’t have concurrent player figures from Sony or Microsoft, so the open beta’s true concurrent figure will be much higher.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But not all those players are actually playing. Those with early access were met with huge queues (we've seen 250,000 in screenshots posted to social media) as the servers hit max capacity. In response, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953383562289299732" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DICE issued a statement</a> to say it was working to improve matters:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The team is now working on a substantial increase in server capacity, which will reduce your time in the queue,” DICE said. “Thank you for your continued patience as we work to get as many of you into the game as soon as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're looking forward to seeing you experience Battlefield 6, and we appreciate your patience!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That statement followed <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953364983057662181" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a message</a> in which DICE explained why it was using queues in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will use queues to protect the player experience but expect this impact to be minimal,” DICE insisted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You may encounter this during high peak moments, such as the start of servers going live. The team is working constantly to reduce any queue that takes place.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Holy sh*t 🤣<br>More than 270.000 players are waiting in server queue!</p><p>If you manage to join the Open Beta, you better don't leave game. <a href="https://t.co/x9lGfpyRAd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/x9lGfpyRAd</a></p></div>— Battlefield Bulletin (@BFBulletin) <a href="https://twitter.com/BFBulletin/status/1953377379180593285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion here is that the open beta is peaking now as the early access kicks off, but the queues will ease. Given the open beta has gone live in early access form ahead of the U.S. waking up, it seems likely the player count will grow in the coming hours, and again when the open beta goes live for all this weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Battlefield 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-forces-pc-gamers-to-mess-about-with-their-bios-to-enable-secure-boot-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-next">how it requires PC gamers to enable Secure Boot</a>, how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-producer-admits-2042-was-missing-the-excellence-of-predecessor-battlefield-bad-company-2">it was inspired by the much-loved Battlefield: Bad Company 2</a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Some dataminers digging into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s files following the arrival of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-delayed-due-to-tsunami-warning">Duos update</a> claim to have uncovered some details about an endless mode.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-have-uncovered-plans-for-a-new-endless-mode-with-armored-core-6s-rank-system-and-skill-based-matchmaking/">PC Gamer</a>, said new mode is allegedly called 'Deep of Night', and will see you grouped with similarly skiller nighfarers to fight your way up through the ranks of a new rating system that players reckon could work similarly to Armored Core 6's rankings.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As of writing, the main sources of info about this endless mode are a Reddit thread penned by a user with the handle Adminisitrator and a video from YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkLAD97-hCA">Scavinjx</a>. Having delved through a number of Reddit threads on the subject, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mgb1gf/comment/n6ncwnh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it appears</a> the original discovery of the files might have been by a user named <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/3286774?spm_id_from=333.1369.opus.module_author_name.click">Supuritto</a>, who <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/opus/1096362317248987138">shared their findings</a> on Chinese social media site BiliBili.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adminisitrator/comments/1mh908l/elden_ring_nightreign_new_mode_deep_of_night/">Adminisitrator's thread</a>, the in-game description of the mode reads as follows: "The Deep of Night is is a battlefield of endless Night. Victory will increase your rating, burnishing your depth. The darkness extends unto infinity." So, a long series of fights with the lights turned off, getting deeper and harder as you go, if you'll forgive the inherent Kenneth Williams 'ooh, Matron' nature of that last bit.</p>
<p>The dataminers claim you'll be working your way through five depths, with each having 999 rating levels to work your way up through, aside from depth five, which is for those elite boss battlers who reach rating 6000 or more. If you lose a fight, you'll slide back down the ratings and depths, but it looks like once you're through depth one, you can't be sent back beyond depth two. I assume that last bit might be a measure to limit cheeky low-level grinding by hardened vets.</p>
<p>As for new rewards, the post shows off screenshots of "depth relics" which it says you'll be able to equip in three new slots just for Deep of Night runs. These come with two buffs, plus one pesky debuff. New weapons work along the same lines, such as a great omenkiller cleaver that boosts your health restoration and damage negation, but increases the damage dealt to by by the encroaching night. Some enemies and bosses also look to be getting "magmafied" variants, which as you might expect see them turned a bit more orange, and I assume able to dish out some toasty damage.</p>
<p>As ever with leaks and datamines, it's worth taking all of this with a grain of salt unless FromSoftware announce that we are all going into the Deep of Night. The mode certainly looks like it could be an interesting alternative to the current weekly boss rotation that arguably leaves a bit to be desired, though I'll likely end up doing a Sum 41 and be in too deep fairly quickly.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-is-getting-an-endless-mode-with-special-relics-and-magmafied-bosses-claim-dataminers]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-bungie-befre-march-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-is-still-scheduled-to-release-by-march-2026-sony-confirms.1264170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony has confirmed that Bungie’s Marathon will still release by the end of its current fiscal year, which ends on March 31, 2026.</p>



<p>The news came following Sony’s latest earnings report during its Q&amp;A section, where one investor asked for an update on the game and its management, as well as if the game could be canceled entirely.</p>



<p>Sony’s Chief Financial Officer, Lin Tao, responded to say that Bungie’s Marathon is still slated to release this current financial year. The statement comes just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-marathon-fy25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two months after a previous statement</a> saying the same thing.</p>



<p>“We are now fixing the problems. So we believe this launch will happen. And if this launch is canceled, we need to do a revision of the valuation. However, as of now, this is not expected,” Tao said.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon was delayed following a lukewarm reception to its reveal and playtests, with additional issues stemming from a huge <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/artist-accuses-bungie-of-plagiarizing-work-for-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism accusation from a concept artist</a>, to which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie responded</a>.</p>



<p>On its delay, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie said</a> that the community’s messages have been “strong and clear”.</p>



<p>“The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling—survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s genre-defining FPS combat,” the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post reads</a>. “We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like&nbsp;Marathon&nbsp;is built around. This means deepening the relationship between the developers and the game’s most important voices: our players.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unlikely that Marathon will do well if it releases this fiscal year, or to be honest, ever. Nonetheless, Bungie seems determined to get the game out of the door and in at least some kind of playable and engaging fashion.</p>



<p>Do you think Marathon will succeed if released by March 2026? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re trying to play the Battlefield 6 Open Beta on PC, you might have run into a problem: ‘Secure Boot is not enabled.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You are not alone. PC gamers hoping to play DICE’s latest now open beta early access is live have no choice but to enable Secure Boot on their PC. And a cursory glance at social media, subreddits and IGN’s own comments suggest some are having trouble with it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/screenshot-2025-08-06-214819-1754555745386.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 forces players to enable Secure Boot on PC.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA has published a user guide for how to enable Secure Boot on PC</a>, and promoted that guide across social media. It’s a guide I myself had to use to boot the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. But it certainly requires a degree of confidence, as it involves tinkering with a part of a computer not all PC gamers will be instantly familiar with: the BIOS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are things like TPM 2.0 (which must be turned on) to deal with, and you need to make sure your Windows disk is GPT and not MBR (not everyone will know what these are). All this before you can even enable Secure Boot — and then you may not be able to enable it anyway, which then means you need to refer to your manufacturer for guidance (gulp!).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, this won’t be a problem for more experienced PC gamers, but it will be an intimidating process for many others. And if you think this is something isolated to Battlefield 6, you’d be wrong. Just yesterday, Activision announced the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will require the exact same thing: Secure Boot enabled.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s all this in aid of? Strengthening game security using built-in Windows PC features. It’s no secret that cheating in competitive multiplayer games is a huge problem for publishers. Activision has spent millions trying to reverse the narrative for Call of Duty. EA will be mindful of Battlefield 6 getting overrun at launch. It seems TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are the new reality for PC gamers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Activision's explanation, from a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> published yesterday:</p><blockquote>TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) is an industry-standard, hardware-based security feature built onto CPUs or motherboards that verifies the PC’s boot process has not been tampered with. Secure Boot makes sure a PC can only load trusted software when Windows starts. </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">When Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 releases later this year, TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot will be required to play on PC. "These hardware-level protections are a key part of our anti-cheat efforts, and we’re asking all players to get compliant now," Activision warned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to Battlefield 6, and the open beta Secure Boot process has certainly caused some people to panic, and others to find themselves with additional problems they didn’t have before. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-huge-queue-to-get-in-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-before-its-even-out">Early indications suggest there’s huge interest in the Battlefield 6 open beta</a>, so it will be interesting to see how this one develops over the course of the weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> currently has close to 250,000 players waiting in queue for access, ahead of the today's early access beta period.</p>
<p>The game, which is set to release on the 10th October, is giving folks a chance to hop in starting later today, as well as this weekend and the next. Everyone who requested access to Battlefield 6's Labs tests has been given access to these weekend tests, which - it turns out - is a lot of people.</p>
<p>On Steam alone, the game has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">reached a player count of 296,500 as of writing</a>. That's almost 300,000 people sat in a queue.</p>

<p>Eurogamer's very own Ian Higton was in the queue around the 195,000 mark, but backed out to test how large the queue actually was. The result, a newfound spot at 227,240. Ouch. This does indicate there's no disconnection protection for the queue, so be sure you don't lose your internet connection while you wait, or you could find yourself in for an even longer queueing experience.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 has been a hotly anticipated game for a good while now, but ever since the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFGEMfyAQtI&amp;rco=1">Multiplayer reveal late last month</a> folks have been especially eager to hop in and try it out. The game will feature all the military FPS goodies you'd expect like large tank battles and squad-based combat, as well as the environmental destruction the series is known for.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">In our own preview of Battlefield 6's multiplayer</a>, we came away especially optimistic, writing:</p>
<blockquote>"I think the building blocks for a truly fantastic Battlefield game are here with Battlefield 6 - perhaps even an all-time great - but I need to see a little more, need to play a little more. I need to see where the dice fall, whether the gamble of bold gameplay changes land well - where the hivemind of Battlefield's playerbase find new strategies beyond the this-beats-that approach of old, say - or whether they simply muddy an otherwise potentially brilliant experience."</blockquote>
<p>If you're still keen to trial the Battlefield 6 beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-battlefield-6-multiplayer-early-access-code">you may be lucky enough to get a code via some avenues that are still open</a>. Just be aware of the queues if you get one.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-almost-250000-people-waiting-in-an-open-beta-queue]]></content:encoded>

This year’s Digital Dragons in Krakow, Poland, showcased a wide variety of upcoming games, and the most attractive amongst them was Vinebound: Tangled Together. In fact, its artstyle dragged me across the showroom floor to the booth, exactly like you and your co-op partner will be, as you fight off wave after wave of plant-based badniks in a Bullet Heaven style, while being tethered together. When I got home, I had to check it out again, and given that it’s priced at an ultra-budget level, there was very little reason not to.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vinebound: Tangled Together - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mKOVnWfdvFE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Vinebound is cute. You take control of a flowery little guy or gal, each of which offers its own stat benefits such as higher critical rates. As you progress, you unlock new characters, some of whom might have higher health but lower damage, and you can find the right chap for the job, and for forming the foundation of your build as you tackle each run.</p>


<p>Vinebound is best played co-operatively, though you can play alone if you must, taking control of each character simultaneously via the left and right analogue sticks. The subtitle is Tangled Together, and that should give you a good idea of how the two characters interact. A vine passes between the two of them, and you can move a certain distance apart or come closer together, before the vine springs back into shape. It means you have to work together as you move around the arena, especially as the resulting spring from an overstretched vine can send you careering into one of the many, many enemies.</p>
<p>As you move about, a flower travels along the vine, and each time it reaches your character, they fire their weapon. That means you need to be closer together to maximise firepower, but that’s not always possible, with copious bad guys spawning in, or hazards appearing to slow you down.</p>


<p>There’s then various weapons to equip, from a straightforward bow and arrow that fires in a straight line, to homing carrots that head to the nearest enemy. As you fell bad guys, they drop juice, and as you collect it, you each get to choose from three levelling-up cards. These boost your stats in some way, and you can begin to tailor your characters’ build until they’re a monstrous, carrot-firing menace.</p>
<p>The further you get, the more enemies there are, and the more weapons you can add to your twosome, but the harder it is to collect the juice. There’s plenty of risk and reward here, and if things are going your way you can find the upgrades popping up every twenty seconds, giving you just a little more chance of staying alive.</p>

<p>It all feels great. Playing through the game with my nine-year-old son, we were able to work together, taking out enemies, reviving each other, and dodging the bad guys and their bullets, even as the screen became more and more congested. It’s pure, focused and undeniably fun, and when our run came to its end, I just wanted to start again.</p>
<p>Luckily, you can do just that, pouring the currency you’ve unlocked into unlocking and upgrading your armoury, giving you a better starting point for your next run, and giving you more chance at finally making it all the way through a level, defeating the big boss that lies in wait at the end.</p>

<p>While the artwork for Vinebound: Tethered Together is going to be its initial selling point, it’s the frantic co-op gameplay that’ll keep you coming back for more. While we played on PlayStation, it especially feels like a perfect Nintendo Switch title, and since it’s launched across every platform for a very reasonable price of just a few quid, it’s well worth checking out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sony has announced in its latest quarterly financial report that the PS5 has sold 80.3m units since its release in November 2020.</p>
<p>The report, <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf">which can be read here</a>, covers the full scope of Sony as a business. On page 12 details on the PlayStation 5's performance - as well as software and peripherals on the platform - are revealed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/playstation-5">PS5</a> sold 2.5m units in Q1 2025, a slight rise from the Q1 2024 figure of 2.4m. Software sales across PS5 and PS4 is up significantly however, with 65.9m copies sold compared to 53.6m at the same time last year.</p>

<p>Monthly active users of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PlayStation Plus</a> are also up. 123m were recorded in Q1 2025, compared to 116m in Q1 2024. Add-on content (DLC) also saw a slight increase, bringing in 292,609m yen in Q1 2025 compared to 290,846 in Q1 2024.</p>
<p>Okay, so that's a lot of numbers, but what does it mean? Well, it means there's continued growth across pretty much all aspects of the PS5 business. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation">PlayStation</a> revenue from games, game DLC, and hardware is up. Plus, there are more people playing online on the PS5 than before.</p>
<p>The console passing 80.3m units sold throughout its life so far also puts it around about the same pace in terms of sales as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/playstation-4">PS4</a>, give or take a million or so. Given the rougher economic climate we're in right now, and the fact that there were serious supply issues at the start of the PS5's release, that's not too bad.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-playstation-5-has-sold-803-million-units-as-it-closes-on-in-on-fifth-anniversary]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/07/guitar-hero-veterans-form-new-studio-as-redoctane-returns/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guitar-hero-veterans-form-new-studio-as-redoctane-returns.1264137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A team of veteran game developers, who have previously worked on the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/guitar-hero">Guitar Hero</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dj-hero">DJ Hero</a> series, have established a new studio. That studio, which falls under the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/embracer">Embracer</a> Freemode umbrella, will revive the RedOctane name long after the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/activision">Activision</a> subsidiary was shuttered in 2010.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the focus of this newly (re)formed studio is “advancing the rhythm game genre, combining the past with the future” with RedOctane expected to announce its first game later this year – at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/gamescom">Gamescom</a> perhaps?</p>


<div id="attachment_462574"><p id="caption-attachment-462574">2023’s Fortnite Festival – developed by Harmonix – is the spiritual successor to Rock Band.</p></div>
<p>At its helm is Simon Ebejer, who worked as production director across numerous Guitar Hero games at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/neversoft">Neversoft</a> before becoming the studio head at Vicarious Visions, going on to hold the title of vice president of operations at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/blizzard">Blizzard</a>.</p>
<p>Ebejer will be flanked by fellow creators “who helped create and scale Guitar Hero and DJ Hero nearly two decades ago, as well as proven emerging development talent and community leaders from across today’s rhythm gaming space.” That talent includes the original founders of RedOctane, Charles and Kai Huang, who will join the revived studio in an advisory capacity.</p>

<p>Exactly what RedOctane is working on remains a mystery for now though hopefully an announcement is just around the corner. For a long time now, fans of Guitar Hero and Rock Band have been pining for a comeback, ready to trawl lofts and garages to retrieve their long-abandoned plastic instruments.</p>
<p>A straight-up successor to these genre-defining rhythm games seems like a no-brainer, but it’s far from being an open goal. Since 2023, rival developer Harmonix has been honing its Rock Band-like Fortnite Festival mode, plugging into the mass popularity of Epic’s battle royale shooter and its A-list celebrity crossovers.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there isn’t room for competition – a Guitar Hero game that weaves in elements from other genres, maybe? To truly evolve the concept, RedOctane will need to do more than simply dress up the old formula with modern graphics and a modern playlist of songs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Guitar Hero Live - Official Reveal Trailer | PS4, PS3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pc7QDU1aaB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One thing we’re particularly keen to know more about is the potential for a new guitar controller. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/20/guitar-hero-live-review/">Guitar Hero Live</a> was unfairly viewed as the final nail in the coffin for Activision’s series though it introduced some bold changes, namely the advanced six-button controller design we still swear by today.</p>
<p>Whatever RedOctane is working on, we can’t wait for this new phase of rhythm games.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/</link>

			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly financial results for Q1 2025</a>, we learned that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 console</a> has now shipped 80.3 million units, breaking the milestone of 80 million. That was thanks to 2.5 million units shipped this quarter, a slight increase compared to the 2.4 million units shipped in Q1 2024.</p>



<p>Overall, it was another excellent quarter for the PlayStation 5, with most indicators trending upward. Full game software sales increased from last year's 53.6 million units to 65.9 million units in the quarter, with a 23% increase. Even first-party game sales went up from 6 million units to 6.9 million units (+15%). The ratio of digital versus physical game sales skewed even more toward digital, which is more great news for Sony, reaching a historic 83%, up from 80% in Q1 2024.</p>



<p>The number of monthly active users (MAUs) on the PlayStation Network also increased, at least compared to Q1 2024, which registered 116 million MAUs, whereas this latest quarter saw 123 million monthly users on the PSN, a 6% increment. Of course, Q3 2024 and Q4 2024 registered higher MAUs (129 and 124 million, respectively), but that is always the case in those quarters.</p>



<p>Overall, sales for the Game and Network Services segment increased by 8% on a year-over-year basis. Sure, the PlayStation 5 is still lagging behind its predecessor, the PlayStation 4, when considering time aligned sales. In June 2018, that console had already shipped 82.3 million units, 2.1 million more than the PS5. </p>



<p>However, the PS5 had other issues to contend with, such as COVID-19, the global chip shortage that lasted from 2020 and 2023, and now increased prices due to the economic environment. All things considered, Sony is probably still happy with how it's going, even if it's selling a little less than the PlayStation 4.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-fastest-io-interactive-game-500k-wishlists-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-is-the-fastest-io-interactive-game-to-break-500k-wishlists-on-steam.1264125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>IO Interactive has <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1953139116930986023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that 007 First Light has already surpassed 500K wishlists on Steam. It is the studio's fastest game to do so, beating their previous HITMAN games, though that's not very surprising when factoring in the power of the 007 IP.</p>



<p>As a reward to the community, IO Interactive revealed that the equippable Savanna Bloom skin will be available at release, and a series of animated wallpapers will be shared shortly. Furthermore, there are other 'missions' to complete if even more fans add the game to their wishlists ahead of the release:</p>



<ul>
<li>Milestone 2: Add flair to your fieldwork with a custom gadget skin, and stream like an agent with a bespoke overlay.</li>



<li>Milestone 3: Go in style with a Deluxe agent skin, plus unlock a developer AMA.</li>



<li>Milestone 4: Confidential. The contents of this final reward are top secret, for now…</li>
</ul>

<p>The title was <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-007-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in late 2020 as Project 007. In late 2024, IO Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> it aims to create a 007 gaming franchise, specifically a 'big trilogy'. 007 First Light was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-cinematic-trailer-revealed-will-launch-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> during Sony's June 2025 State of Play, showing off a cinematic trailer.</p>



<p>Players will step into the shoes of a young, reckless, but already resourceful James Bond as he goes through MI6's training program. After a particularly heroic act, the young naval air crewman is offered a spot in the newly revived Double-O program. However, when a mission to stop a rogue agent goes tragically wrong, Bond must team up with his reluctant mentor, Greenway, to expose a deep conspiracy and prevent an impending coup at the heart of the British state.</p>



<p>In short, it is an origin story that includes the events that transformed an audacious young hero into the best MI6 agent. Players will go on missions in breathtaking locations, drive iconic vehicles, and dive into a cinematic adventure in pursuit of a rogue agent who’s always one step ahead.</p>



<p>Owing to IO Interactive's sandbox approach already seen with HITMAN, players will be able to choose their approach: go silent or go loud. They can fight with fists or firepower, use gadgets to infiltrate, or bluff their way past guards. Moreover, 007 First Light will allow them to replay the missions with additional modifiers.</p>



<p>The game is slated to launch in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

How hefty? Well, it's 100% off! Now, that does come with the catch that you have to pick it up within the first 24 hours of launch, which started at 12 AM PT / 3 AM PT / 8 AM BST / 9 AM CEST, so you'll have to figure out how many hours you've got left yourself. Once you've claimed the game, it's yours for life, but if you miss out after the 24 hours are up, it'll revert to the still-pretty-affordable price of $5.</p><p dir="ltr">For those that haven't heard of Guntouchables before, it's a roguelike where the "entire world has fallen and the surface has been overrun by a hostile and aggressively evolving horde of mutants. Well, not entirely." That last part is in reference to a group of preppers, i.e. the characters you play as, who are tasked with defending their doomsday residence from the mutants. You can either play solo, or with up to three of your friends.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544011-guntouchables-screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544011" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544011-guntouchables-screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544011"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544011-guntouchables-screenshot.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544005-guntouchables_screenshot_10large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544004-guntouchables_screenshot_9large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544003-guntouchables_screenshot_8large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544002-guntouchables_screenshot_7large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544001-guntouchables_screenshot_6large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544000-guntouchables_screenshot_5large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543999-guntouchables_screenshot_4large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543998-guntouchables_screenshot_3large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543997-guntouchables_screenshot_2large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543996-guntouchables_screenshot_1large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4544005,1300-4544004,1300-4544003,1300-4544002,1300-4544001,1300-4544000,1300-4543999,1300-4543998,1300-4543997,1300-4543996" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4544005-guntouchables_screenshot_10large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4544004-guntouchables_screenshot_9large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4544003-guntouchables_screenshot_8large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4544002-guntouchables_screenshot_7large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4544001-guntouchables_screenshot_6large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4544000-guntouchables_screenshot_5large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4543999-guntouchables_screenshot_4large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4543998-guntouchables_screenshot_3large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4543997-guntouchables_screenshot_2large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4543996-guntouchables_screenshot_1large.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>       <figcaption>Guntouchables.</figcaption> <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544005-guntouchables_screenshot_10large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544004-guntouchables_screenshot_9large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544003-guntouchables_screenshot_8large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544002-guntouchables_screenshot_7large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544001-guntouchables_screenshot_6large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544000-guntouchables_screenshot_5large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543999-guntouchables_screenshot_4large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543998-guntouchables_screenshot_3large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543997-guntouchables_screenshot_2large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543996-guntouchables_screenshot_1large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game is mission based, and between missions you and the group you're playing with vote on a random selection of mutations the mutants can develop, making them harder to deal with--on the flipside, you also get some bonuses that also differ depending on your choice.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After four years of development, Malaysian developer Mas now leaves the fate of humanity in the hands of players globally in their debut game, <em>Artis Impact</em>. The turn-based RPG places players at the center of a decaying world ravaged by war, as those that survive must pick up the pieces and forge a new life to move forward.</p>

<p>The game's protagonist and her witty AI companion are at the forefront, protecting them from the threats that remain in this post-apocalyptic world. Along their journey, they will encounter challenging enemies and bosses, colourful characters, and uncover the secrets of their "future utopian world" that is packed with plenty of heart and personality.</p>

<h2><em>Artis Impact</em> Review: Built From Scratch, Pixel By Pixel</h2>

<p><em>Artis Impact</em> is a turn-based RPG developed by a single developer, Mas, a game cited as a "labour of love" by the developer, which took four years to complete. The game follows a charming female wanderer named Akane and her witty companion, an AI bot named Bot, as this oddball pairing delves into the remains of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-delayed-may" rel="nofollow">post-apocalyptic</a> world ravaged by a war between humans and AI.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10630.jpg?itok=8xQJwOjj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10630.jpg?itok=MhJAmPFj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Akane and her companion, Bot, will traverse multiple areas during their adventures to uncover many secrets amidst the ruins of this post-apocalyptic world. (Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Mas)</figcaption></figure><p>While much of the game will be spent exploring multiple areas as they accept missions from their commander, Akane embarks on a deeply personal quest while uncovering her mysterious past. There are plenty of secrets about Akane and this post-apocalyptic world for players to discover while sharpening their combat skills through training and implementing strategies to confront the various corrupted enemies and bosses that Akane and Bot will encounter.</p>

<p>The post-apocalyptic world of <em>Artis Impact</em> is beautifully designed by hand, blending 2D pixel art and "retro comic aesthetics," giving it that distinctive cozy charm in this dark and despondent world. Not everything in-game is all "doom and gloom," as the warm and lighthearted dialogue and moments shared between Akane, Bot, and the many NPCs that populate every area throughout this decaying world add plenty of personality and provide much comfort and hope for their futures.</p>

<h2><em>Artis Impact </em>Review: At The World's Apocalyptic End</h2>

<p>The end of the world has occurred as humanity bands together to try and find a future in this ravaged new world, and at the heart of this game's story is our protagonist, Akane, and her companion, Bot. The game begins with Akane and Bot inside her home at the Junkyard in Sunnyside, where they'll encounter their first AI enemy inside the subway before heading to the Lith Club.</p>

<p>This locale is the home of the aforementioned Lith Club, where Akane and her colleagues assemble to take on various assignments to combat the rogue AI enemies and bosses that are still in operation. It's here that, after completing a few main story quests, Akane will gain access to the Workshop, where she can train against dummies to improve her skills or access the Artificial World and face digitized enemies without much consequences, like death.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10598.jpg?itok=SK1ep5s5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10598.jpg?itok=Rgid_4r4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Death is everywhere in Artis Impact, except when facing enemies and bosses inside the Artificial World. (Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Mas)</figcaption></figure><p>The game's turn-based combat is very streamlined and easy to learn, where aside from her usual attacks, Akane can use various Arts to deal more damage, use Guard to block incoming attacks, and consumable items to replenish her HP and MP meters. Much later on, different food and drink items can grant Akane various buffs that will enhance her HP, MP, attack percentage, defense, and other stats that can turn any combative situation in her favor.</p>

<p>Let's not forget about Bot, who can equip various skills and items to assist Akane during battle. Akane can also equip similar items, such as jewelry pieces, to enhance her stats, as these items can be purchased from vendors or dropped from completing dungeons, areas, and defeating hidden bosses.</p>

<p>Another gameplay aspect of <em>Artis Impact </em>that I thoroughly enjoy is that Akane can take on various jobs throughout the world to earn an income. From working in a supermarket to being a pizza delivery person, a housekeeper, and more, some of these part-time jobs will require her to complete their adjacent side quests, which she could acquire ownership of these businesses and continue earning a passive income.</p>

<p>Akane can also earn money from completing quests, earning interest on funds in her bank account, and acquiring property, which these funds can help her make purchases and upgrade her weapons, Bot's equipment, and her Combat Rank. There's also a Respect mechanic, which functions similarly to a reputation system, allowing her to increase her Respect value by completing specific tasks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10816.jpg?itok=chB0VQ-k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10816.jpg?itok=3qqlzuXu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Akane can pick up full-time and part-time jobs in multiple areas where she can earn an income. (Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Mas)</figcaption></figure><p>By lending her services to defeat the area enemies and bosses, helping put NPCs in escort missions, and more, this increases her Respect, and if she reaches a specific Respect value, it will unlock a hidden ending for <em>Artis Impact</em>. Do keep in mind that certain actions and player choices can influence her Respect value and the overall story development, as certain narrative paths will lead to "relationship and emotional dynamics" with various NPCs.</p>

<h2><em>Artis Impact </em>Review: Unforeseen Technicalities</h2>

<p>While I was deeply impressed with the game's art style, combat system, and character development, there were a few things that didn't resonate with me during my hands-on experience with <em>Artis Impact</em>. Once Akane accepts a mission to Sandy Bay to investigate AI-related activities, certain areas begin to lag, especially the cave system at the Mosswood Foothills, making exploration and, subsequently, engaging in combat, rather tedious and frustrating at times.</p>

<p>Key bindings become delayed or unresponsive at times, which can result in selecting the wrong action to perform when in combat, which the enemy or boss can take advantage of. While the game's narrative is well-written and it does take a while for the story to get rolling, another issue of concern I had with the game is that certain character dialogue, more specifically with the male NPCs, was quite concerning when Akane interacted with them, as the language was rather problematic.</p>

<p>Akane's male colleague, Billy, is one such character who frequently expresses his viewpoints on women early in the game, stating that he wasn't interested in a woman's opinion and that their place in the world "should be at home." As the game does inform players that treating others with respect is a widely accepted norm, not just in-game but also in real life, Billy is just one of many characters that displays this kind of behavior towards the female characters through language until a pivotal moment; however, it's unclear if this decision is intentional to reflect discordance amongst society given the world's setting.</p>

<h2><em>Artis Impact</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10673.jpg?itok=e7MNWYl5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10673.jpg?itok=UZ_SJvC0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The game's turn-based combat is simple in its design but extremely engaging once Akane unleashes powerful attacks to defeat them.(Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Mas)</figcaption></figure><p>Following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review-birds-of-feathering" rel="nofollow"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></a>, <em>Artis Impact</em> was a much-needed game to play in the short break, especially given how <em>Wuchang</em> can be pretty frustrating at times (those boss battles were tough as nails after all). Despite the rather bleak and hopeless post-apocalyptic world in which the game is set, the charming characters and the hilarious, lighthearted dialogue exchanged between Akane, her companion, and various NPCs do bring warmth and a cozy vibe during these dark times.</p>

<p>Akane's personality perfectly complements Bot's, the latter of whom can be rather direct or confrontational towards her and the other characters at times, but they do share plenty of heartwarming moments that are memorable to experience. There were some lagging issues experienced in certain areas, which did take me out of my gameplay experience, mainly due to them being tied to the main story, and I had no choice but to trudge through them as they were essential for advancing the quests.</p>

<p>The pixel and retro comic book art design, along with the enchanting music, further enhanced the game's cozy post-apocalyptic aesthetics; however, the fluid turn-based combat is an absolute favorite, and I enjoyed engaging in battle each time an enemy or boss was encountered. Some dungeon and hidden bosses can be challenging to face, as each has unique tactics that will make these match-ups quite hard to counter, for which players will need to spend some time upgrading Akane and Bot's weapons and equipment to turn the tables in their favor.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Group has published a financial update for Q1 FY25, the period ending June 30, 2025. In the report, the company reported substantial growth in the PlayStation space, with digital sales, customer retention, monthly active users, and hardware sales showing strong trends.</p>



<p>It was noted that, thanks to 2.5 million PS5 units being sold in the financial quarter, the total count has now exceeded <strong>80 million units </strong>so far in the PlayStation 5’s lifecycle, which commenced in 2020.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-strong-momentum">‘Strong Momentum’</h2>



<p>The report filed <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_sonypre.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Sony Group</a> tells a positive story for the tech titan, especially where the PlayStation arm of the corporation is concerned. In a line pulled from the report, it was revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>User engagement continued its<strong> strong momentum</strong>, with Monthly Active Users in June and total gameplay hours across PlayStation during Q1 FY25 both increasing 6% year-on-year.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This has been enough for Sony to ‘upwardly revise’ its operating income forecast.</p>



<p>It was remarked that a strong window for new titles helped fuel the performance of the PlayStation platform in Q1 FY25. In the period, 72 million games were sold across PlayStation’s ecosystem, 83% of which were purchased digitally.</p>



<p>The only core negative to take away from the report referenced an incoming impact from ‘a delay in the launch timing of a first-party title’, which wasn’t named but is assumed to be Bungie’s Marathon, the plagued extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Player counts were also up over the last period, with 123 million active users logging in during Q1 FY25, up 8 million from the number recorded in the previous period. Again, the slate of games launched in the window (Oblivion Remastered, Clair Obscur, Death Stranding 2, Forza Horizon 5) contributed to that greatly.</p>



<p>Recently, the PlayStation brand was in the news when Sony Group’s CEO stressed that the future of the platform, with the PlayStation 6 at the heart of it, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-is-top-of-sonys-priorities-right-now-says-sony-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company’s top priority</a>.</p>

                <p>After a shorter summer season than usual, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is shifting into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-shock-n-awesome/2900-6853/" data-ref-id="2900-6853">Chapter 6 Season 4</a>. Unfortunately for us, there's just one little thing getting in the way of us diving into all the new stuff: Fortnite servers are down for maintenance while Epic deploys the new season update. Below, you'll find a rundown on when Fortnite servers should be back online.</p><h2>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 start time</h2><p>When Fortnite goes offline to deploy a patch, it usually takes about three or four hours, but a new season launch is much more of a thing than your average update is. For a new season, Fortnite typically goes offline for four hours at a minimum, and often longer. Sometimes <em>much </em>longer--Fortnite was offline for 18 hours ahead of the start of Chapter 5 Season 2 last year. If all goes well, you can expect Fortnite to come back online, at the earliest, <strong>around 3 AM PT / 6 AM ET</strong>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock 'N Awesome | Hybrid Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>When Fortnite's servers do return to action, the new bug-squishing season teased in trailers will kick off. With collabs that include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-a-free-halo-skin-in-fortnite/1100-6533721/" data-ref-id="1100-6533721">Halo</a> and Power Rangers--along with whatever other secrets Epic has in store--this season will have a very late '90s, early aughts feel to it. The bug takeover will begin immediately when servers come back up. There will be a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6856/" data-ref-id="2900-6856">battle pass</a> full of several new skins, plenty of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-chapter-6-season-4-all-guns-and-loot/2900-6855/" data-ref-id="2900-6855">new weapons</a>, several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-map-changes-in-chapter-6-season-4-shock-n-awesome/2900-6854/" data-ref-id="2900-6854">map changes</a>, and likely a few new movement items, which are reliably some of the best parts of every season. My Fortnite crew is routinely annoyed at how few actual guns I carry because I want to have all the stylish movement items instead. </p><p>Whether you're like me or you prefer to go guns-blazin', Fortnite's Shock 'N Awesome Chapter 6 Season 4 arrives early on the morning of August 7. See you on the island!</p>
