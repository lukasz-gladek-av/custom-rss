		<p>Nintendo has released a new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, sharing gameplay of the Still World sections that are found by stepping into the ominous purple rifts, Zelda’s swordfighting form, and more. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-lets-you-actually-play-as-zelda-this-september/">Echoes of Wisdom launches for Nintendo Switch on 26th September</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom — Into the Still World, a Journey Continued — Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wUdJF8gyO4A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As the purple rifts have consumed large parts of Hyrule, many of its denizens, the king and link included, have been swallowed into the inky expanses.&nbsp;Thankfully, Zelda has joined forces with a little creature called Tri, who is lending her the ability to make echoes of items and creatures, and let her step into the rifts to explore what the game is calling the Still World.</p>
<p>Chunks of land are suspended here, alongside people that have been drawn into the void, and Zelda will have to get up to some 3D platforming actions to get around – potentially using echoes to solve platforming problems. The Still World is also home to dungeons, again using those echoes and a bit of ingenuity to overcome puzzles, and reaching bosses that need defeating – a boss that looks like a Knack knock off, or maybe “God” from Star Trek V was shown here. You can use echoed creatures or other abilities to hit the weak spots and find your own way to beat them.</p>
<p>Also revealed was a swordfighting form that effectively turns Zelda into a glowing blue Link – Blink, if you will – with sword and shield. However, she’s only got a little time before her energy gauge drains and she reverts to normal – this can be refilled by collecting blue nuggets of energy from the Still World. The final snippet gives a massive hint how you have to acquire this ability…</p>

<p>The trailer also introduces use to Dampé, an engineer of automatons which can be activated by winding them up. These could be a wind up bomb, a music machine, cannon and more – they’ll break if damaged, and act differently to the echo summons.</p>
<p>It all looks positively delightful, as Echoes of Wiszom borrows the visual style of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening remake</a>, which was a real highlight from a few years ago. We can’t wait to see more, and we thankfully won’t have to wait all that long for the full release!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-preview-%E2%80%93-the-long-awaited-return-of-kyle-crane.968400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/dying-light-the-beast-preview-the-long-awaited-return-of-kyle-crane/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The shuffling hordes of the undead have appeared in almost as many games as the hordes they tend to depict, but any hint of zombie-weariness was gone the moment I saw <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> in action. This all-new, standalone entry in the Dying Light franchise boasts an open-world full of zombie action, building on the series’ weighty combat and heart-stopping traversal options, while moving things forward with the power and technology they now have on tap.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c50gFkG91jc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course,&nbsp;Dying Light: The Beast sees the return of Kyle Crane – the hero of the first game – and we’re rejoining him after he’s undergone more than a decade of captivity and experimentation. Original voice actor Roger Craig Smith returns too (thankfully without having to go method for the role) tying it wholly to that first entry, but while that’s going to delight fans, Techland say this is going to be a great entry point for new players as well.</p>


<p>The name might be a bit of a giveaway, but in our preview session it becomes apparent that The Beast is actually you. Thanks to his incarceration and subsequent experimentation, Kyle Crane has developed a series of beast-like powers, coming to the fore when he’s pushed to the limit. These manifest when he’s angry – you wouldn’t like him when he’s angry – though in gameplay terms that seems to be when he’s been taken and/or dished out a certain amount of damage.</p>
<p>This is a new open-world region that’s not appeared in the franchise before, with a central campaign that’s set to give you over 18 hours of standalone zombie action. Techland feel this is the sweet spot in terms of narrative and gameplay content, though as an open-world game, there’s undoubtedly going to be plenty to distract you from what you’re doing.</p>


<p>Our preview mission sees Kyle tasked with getting inside the E&amp;F chemical factory. Straight away, I’d forgotten about the amazing blend of speed, fluidity and &nbsp;of Dying Light’s traversal and parkour, and it looks even more seamless this time around. The environments are incredibly detailed, and every element has been hand-crafted by the visual team. Environments shimmer with foliage, and the new and improved water and weather effects add newfound depth to every scene.</p>
<p>The narrative this time out draws on inspirations from TV shows like Twin Peaks and Stranger Things, with central villain Baron working on a new strain of virus to create chimaeras, or Freaks as the game has it. For a world that is already most of the way to hell, this seems like an unnecessary narrative kick in the balls, but it gives us a clear threat to deal with, and a reason for smashing our way through piles of zombies.</p>
<p>We see Volatiles, the returning apex predators of the undead and “king of the night”. Through our preview, there’s an emphasis on avoiding combat at first, with leaping across rooftops then replaced by hiding in long grass, and avoiding the Volatiles especially. Fans shouldn’t worry though, as Kyle soon takes out a baseball bat, smashing up a pack of zombies, culminating in a particularly graphic replacement of a skull by a crimson hole.</p>
<p>As an open world experience, you’ll come across different encounters that will distract you from what you’re supposed to be doing. We find a small group of raiders trying to lockpick a crate, though that’s an easy distraction to ensure they don’t see Kyle and his bow coming. Or indeed the arrows as they lodge in their chest.</p>

<p>If you’re coming from the first game, there’s a greater emphasis on firearms – just as there was in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-2">Dying Light 2</a> – though Techland are keen to say that melee combat remains the focus. The team just want to give players as many tools as possible to work their way through the hordes, and the assault rifles and shotguns we see during our preview seem weighty and lethal. Ammunition is going to be limited though, so they’re never going to be the answer to every problem you encounter.</p>
<p>There’s also vehicles here, as first appeared in Dying Light: The Following, and we see Kyle hopping into a pickup truck which allows him to ferry a mission-specific canister across the map. This does, of course, involve running down a few zombies, but just as with the outlook elsewhere, this is a game about surviving against the odds. Vehicles will take damage, and you’ll need to refuel them too, so you won’t just be able to trundle across the entire map bopping zombies out of the way with the windows rolled down.</p>
<p>As an aside, Techland originally worked on several racing games including the Xpand Rally series, and they’re drawing on some of their original in-house talent who worked on these to make sure that the vehicles in Dying Light: The Beast feel and handle as accurately and enjoyably as possible. They definitely look fun as another zombie bounces over the hood and just misses out on being lodged in the pickup truck’s cargo bed. Maybe there’ll be an achievement for that.</p>

<p>The close of our preview saw Kyle complete his mission to attract the unidentified giant monster, with this Behemoth arriving in dramatic fashion, smashing cargo crates out of the way to enter the wrecking yard arena we’ve found ourselves in. At first Kyle struggles to do much damage – his guns run out of ammunition, and the equipped machete is basically just giving this guy paper cuts.</p>
<p>However, as the rage in Kyle grows he’s suddenly able to utilise his own powers, gaining some of the same attacks the Behemoth has been using to try and turn him into Kyle soup. You can now leap high into the air, crashing down to cause a painful shockwave, while Kyle’s strength goes off the charts. After wearing the creature down, Kyle finishes the encounter by literally pulling its head off. As blood spurts from the fallen monster, our time here runs out, but tellingly, nobody wants it to end.</p>
<p>As we approach the tenth anniversary of the franchise, it seems fitting to be returning to the world of Dying Light. Perhaps most surprising is that The Beast is going to be available at no extra cost for owners of Dying Light 2: Ultimate Edition, fulfilling the promise of a second DLC expansion for that game. Going so far beyond the minimum bar feels indicative of Techland’s approach to their premiere series, and to its fans. Thus far, The Beast looks stunning, with visceral and spectacular action tied to the franchise’s most impressive visuals yet. We can’t wait to see more.</p>

A realm called the Still World, full of complex dungeons and inventive puzzle platforming, was the main event, but I’m sure most people will instead be talking about how Zelda will in fact be able to use a sword when <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> releases on September 26.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,195755,196394" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As we’ve seen in past trailers, in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> a mysterious purple infection is engulfing Hyrule and sucking up the land and its people— including Link. It appears that everything getting sucked into the purple void goes to a place called the Still World, shown off in the latest trailer. It’s a second map that can be entered from different points in the main overworld, sort of like the Dark World in <em>A Link to the Past</em>. </p><p>Unlike the main overworld of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, the Still World is a topsy-turvy place in which the land has been morphed and frozen in place. This means that some platforms are on their side or completely flipped as they suspend in the void. This effectively creates a puzzle platformer for Zelda to traverse with the use of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-meme-reactions-1851550785&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-meme-reactions-1851550785">echoes</a></span>, the game’s central mechanic. As we’ve seen before, echoes allow Zelda to summon objects and even NPCs from her staff to complete puzzles and fight off enemies. We see echoes come in handy in the Still World, with Zelda creating some platforms to progress from one disjointed, floating island to the next. To reflect the varied environments of Hyrule, the Still World is full of different biomes, and it makes both realms seem brimming with wonderful variety.</p><p>Also within the Still World are <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s dungeons. As in past <em>Zelda </em>titles these will be large multi-room affairs full of tough environmental puzzles that lead to a boss. An interesting detail in the new trailer comes in a few moments that show Zelda in a 2D side-scrolling perspective, in a shift reminiscent of some spots in the dungeons of <em>Link’s Awakening</em>, or perhaps taking inspiration from <em>Zelda II</em>.</p><p>Boss fights give you another chance to really test out the limitations of the echoes system. One boss fight shown off in the trailer highlighted how open-ended these encounters are, thanks to your ability to summon almost anything you want. At one point we even see Zelda summon a bed mid-battle and get in, as if the echoes she’s summoned can take it from here and she’s gonna get some shut-eye. While that may not be the smartest strategy, as someone who is also perpetually in need of a nap I can’t really blame her. However, this trailer also revealed that you won’t just have to rely on your echoes to take down enemies, as Zelda will indeed wield a sword…at least in fleeting moments. </p><figure id="" data-id="27ee2a2af4ecc4bc78977b0a742d101c" data-recommend-id="image://27ee2a2af4ecc4bc78977b0a742d101c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="726" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda wielding a sword while dressed like link" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zelda wielding a sword while dressed like link" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="27ee2a2af4ecc4bc78977b0a742d101c" data-recommend-id="image://27ee2a2af4ecc4bc78977b0a742d101c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="726" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda wielding a sword while dressed like link" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Zelda’s Swordfighter Form—which makes her the second Nintendo heroine to get a swordfighter form this year after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/princess-peach-showtime-switch-review-roundup-1851355320&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/princess-peach-showtime-switch-review-roundup-1851355320"><em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em></a></span>—gives her a Link-like look and her very own pointed weapon. This form seems to play about how you would expect in a traditional <em>Zelda game </em>but the ability is on a timer, so the princess can only swing the sword around for a brief period. In the trailer we saw a bar depleting that notes the form is at Level 1, so this may be something you can upgrade throughout your playthrough. </p><p>In addition to echoes, Zelda will be able to collect more ways of traversing and fighting in Hyrule thanks to a series of allies. The trailer introduces us to Dampé, an inventor who will give Zelda mechanical allies to use that have different abilities than echoes. Be careful, though, as these automatons will break if damaged too much. He’s just one of many allies you’ll meet along your journey. All in all, the latest trailer only makes <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>look even more exciting, and I can’t wait to get my hands on it.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unlocking cooking requires you to make some upgrades and learning new recipes takes more effort than you might expect.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to cook</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4341437-cookingmenu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341437" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4341437-cookingmenu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341437"></a><figcaption>Every recipe in Stardew Valley is shown in the cooking menu, but only unlocked recipes can be made.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4341437-cookingmenu.jpg"></figure><p>In order to cook food, you need <span>a kitchen in your house. To get a kitchen, you need to purchase the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-house-upgrades/1100-6524912/">house upgrade</a> from the Carpenters. The first upgrade costs 10,000G, and you need to provide 450 wood. It takes three days for the upgrade to be</span> completed, adding a kitchen to your house.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the upgrade is finished, you can cook a dish by interacting with the stovetop in the kitchen. To cook a dish, you just need to have the ingredients either on you or in the refrigerator. Just select the dish you want to make, which will be colored in if you have the ingredients, and the dish will be made--no minigame required.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to learn new recipes</h2><p dir="ltr">There are three primary ways to learn new recipes. First, you can watch The Queen of Sauce on TV in your house. New episodes run every Sunday, offering new recipes, and on Wednesdays reruns are shown, with the game prioritizing any recipes you have missed. The second method is to increase your friendship level with different villagers, as they will mail you recipes at certain heart thresholds. Lastly, you can purchase some recipes from Gus at the Saloon in town. <strong>You cannot cook a meal that you have not found the recipe for.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Below you can find every recipe in Stardew Valley and where you can learn it. <strong>Recipes purchased from Gus are bought at the Saloon unless noted otherwise. </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Recipe</th><th scope="col">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fried Egg</td><td>Known by default</td></tr><tr><td>Omelet</td><td>TV Spring 28, Year 1 or Gus for 100G</td></tr><tr><td>Salad</td><td>Emily -

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-sees-zelda-using-a-sword/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>From the past trailers, we have seen that in this game, Zelda will fight using Echoes to her advantage, allowing her to gain leverage over enemies and throw objects at them to defeat them. However, the latest five-minute trailer released on the Nintendo YouTube channel shows Zelda drawing a sword.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom — Into the Still World, a Journey Continued — Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wUdJF8gyO4A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer also showcases the world of Hyrule, which has been torn apart by mysterious Rifts that have appeared out of nowhere. These Rifts similarly took her father, the King, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/link-is-playable-in-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-too/">Link himself</a>. By teaming up with a mystical creature named Tri, she can jump into the Rifts and explore ways to repair the land and bring it back to its former glory.</p>
<p>One of the main areas, aside from Hyrule, that players will get to explore in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the Still World. The five-minute trailer above predominantly showcases this area. Everything that gets sucked into the void becomes petrified and will eventually disappear completely if they cannot be brought back to Hyrule safely.</p>
<p>The Still World isn't just home to tricky platforming where Zelda will have to rely on using her Echoes to platform, but there are also ruins and dungeons to explore, with Zelda having to work her way through the puzzles below to traverse them.</p>
<p>Because of the various Rifts scattered through Hyrule, each Rift brings Zelda to a new part of the Still World, bringing about new exploration and defining features in each area. During her adventures, Zelda picks up a mysterious sword that allows her to utilize her swordfighter form.</p>
<p>By using this form, she can attack enemies directly rather than having to utilize her Echoes to do it for her, and has all of the same basic sword attacks that Link would use. She can also use a shield in this form. While she can take on enemies herself, you can also utilize her Echoes simultaneously, allowing you to take down enemies quicker by fighting them as both Zelda and the Echoes.</p>
<p>However, the Swordfighter form isn't permanently available. When she runs out of Energy, she will transform back into her standard form, where she relies solely on the power of Echoes to do her bidding. To be able to continue using the Swordfighter form, you have to collect Energy that will refill the gauge.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due for release on September 26, 2024</a> on Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/darkest-dungeon-2-kingdoms-update-split</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/darkest-dungeon-2-kingdoms-update-split-into-three-parts-first-due-in-q4.968361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/darkest-dungeon-2-kingdoms-update-split<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Red Hook Studios has announced that the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon 2&nbsp;</em>Kingdoms update, which is set to add a brand new mode to the game and more, will in fact be split into three parts.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1940340/view/4586440679309658784" rel="noopener" target="_blank">development update on Steam</a>, Red Hook says that the update will be released "in thematic modules", each of which will focus on a different threat for your heroes to face down. The first of these threats will apparently be "rotting, ravenous beastmen".</p>
<p>This first module, titled "Hunger of the Beast Clan", is due sometime in the fourth quarter of 2024, although we don't know exactly when just yet. Red Hook does say it'll share more about this update on its socials soon, though, so it likely won't be long until we find out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/darkest-dungeon-2-kingdoms-update-split-combat.jpg?itok=D2RsQPW3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/darkest-dungeon-2-kingdoms-update-split-combat.jpg?itok=kWcns-hR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Darkest Dungeon 2</em>'s Kingdoms update will be released in three installments.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Darkest Dungeon 2</em>'s Kingdoms update was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-darkest-dungeon-2-update-to-add-new-campaign-and-more-later-this-year">first revealed back in April</a>, and it's aiming to combine&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon 2</em>'s combat and traversal with the first game's "permanence and roster management".</p>
<p>Despite being entirely free, the update will bring a whole new campaign experience to the game; Red Hook says it'll offer a "completely reimagined" gameplay style that runs parallel to the base game's Confessions campaign.</p>
<h2>More&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon 2&nbsp;</em>DLC is also on the way</h2>
<p>It's not just the Kingdoms update that Red Hook is releasing, either. The aforementioned development update also contained an announcement regarding a brand new paid DLC pack.</p>
<p>Set to arrive alongside the first installment of the Kingdoms update,&nbsp;<em>Inhuman Bondage&nbsp;</em>brings with it a brand new area in the form of the Catacombs, as well as a grisly new enemy faction to populate this forsaken space.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/darkest-dungeon-2-kingdoms-update-split-base-game.jpg?itok=ffxlhWvu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/darkest-dungeon-2-kingdoms-update-split-base-game.jpg?itok=fwd9gLJl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of new&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon 2&nbsp;</em>stuff is on its way.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the Catacombs and a new enemy faction, <i>Inhuman Bondage&nbsp;</i>will also bring a brand new hero with "unique trinkets, origin story, palettes, weapon kits, and...unique...mechanics", according to Red Hook.</p>
<p>All of this news arrives in the wake of&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon 2</em>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1940340/view/4284698870309376240" rel="noopener" target="_blank">modding update Darkside of the Mountain</a>, which was released last Friday. It adds official modding support to the game, as well as reworks for the Man-at-Arms, Jester, and Vestal heroes and more.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1940340/Darkest_Dungeon_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2619-PPSA19590_00-0191103846959805" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/darkest-dungeon-ii/9n0q3tgwhg1f" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/darkest-dungeon-ii-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-shows-off-swordfighting-dungeons-and-more.968358/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-swordfighter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>trailer has been released into the (breath of the) wild by Nintendo, showcasing Zelda's combat-oriented swordfighter form, some of the game's dungeons, and more.</p>
<p>While previous&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>trailers have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-hyrule">highlighted the natural beauty of Hyrule</a> and its varied biomes, this one's all about the much creepier Still World, which is somewhat reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>A Link Between Worlds</em>' Lorule or&nbsp;<em>A Link to the Past</em>'s Dark World.</p>
<p>You can enter the Still World through rifts dotted around Hyrule (sound familiar?), and while you're there, you'll explore deadly dungeons, solve puzzles, and, of course, battle boss monsters intent on taking Zelda out of the picture.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-still-world.jpg?itok=RLEpTARv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-still-world.jpg?itok=nCDExf7I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Still World should give Zelda plenty of challenges to overcome in&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as exploring and solving puzzles, Zelda will also be able to transform herself into a powerful swordfighter who can take on enemies directly (remember that this isn't possible in moment-to-moment gameplay).</p>
<p>While in this form, Zelda effectively takes on Link's abilities; she can slash directly at her opponents, bypassing the need to have creatures do her bidding. However, this form is finite, so you'll need to collect energy from the Still World to prolong your time as a swordfighter.</p>
<p>The new trailer also shows off some of Zelda's allies, including the crafty gravedigger Dampé (here reimagined as an inventor of automatons) and a Goron who's crazy about fireworks, among others.</p>
<p>It's not just allies, of course; we also get to see some of the enemies Zelda will face off against over the course of&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, including familiar faces like the fire dragon Volvagia. You can check the trailer out here.</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is a brand new top-down Zelda adventure that casts Princess Zelda as the protagonist. Link has fallen into one of the strange new rifts dotted around Hyrule, and it's up to Zelda to rescue him and discover what these rifts might herald.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced">during June's Nintendo Direct presentation</a>,&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>combines the classic top-down perspective of old-school&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games with the more exploratory and experimental approach of recent fare like&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>when it launches <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch</a> on September 26th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Beginner difficulty is designed for those seeking to just experience the story with very little worry about combat. Easy, Medium, and Hard each ramp up how demanding the experience will be, with the sweet spot for most seasoned role-playing fans likely being Medium.</p><p>Just remember that all trophies or achievements can be unlocked on any difficulty, and you can rest assured that you’ll encounter fights that are certain to require some extra strategy or level grinding to overcome even on Easy or Medium. Additionally, you can change the difficulty in the settings at any time during your adventure if you begin feeling like the one you’ve chosen is either too breezy or too difficult.</p><h2 id="h46387"><a id=""></a><strong>Yes, all of the yellow items are worth picking up</strong></h2><p>You’ll see glowing yellow item pickups all over every zone you enter, which may begin to feel a bit overwhelming. It may get a bit tedious at times, but if you’re wondering if all of these items are worth picking up, the answer is unequivocally <em>yes</em>. Pick them up. Pick all of them up.</p><figure id="" data-id="5b07d3a76f9c30cefbe10e3688c62cd3" data-recommend-id="image://5b07d3a76f9c30cefbe10e3688c62cd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A yellow glowing item!

But most of all, these spots frequently provide you with Golden Clovers, which are an immensely important item for upgrading your characters and making them more powerful in battle. More on that further down.<br></p><h2 id="h46388"><a id=""></a><strong>Those colored crystals have a use later in the game</strong></h2><p>As you make your way through each zone, you’ll no doubt notice small crystals of various colors that seem to have no use. Don’t worry—as you unlock new Elemental Vessels, these will become obtainable, granting you Elemental Points for use in leveling up your Elemental Plot. Unfortunately, yeah, this means you’ll want to backtrack throughout the game to areas with crystals that match your freshly-unlocked Elemental Vessels, in order to gain as many Elemental Points as possible.</p><h2 id="h46389"><a id=""></a><strong>Collect all the Grizzly Syrup you can find</strong></h2><p>Very early in the game, you’ll discover Grizzly Syrup is, well, <em>everywhere </em>in the zones you’re exploring. This syrup can be traded with Dudbear shops—the first of which will unlock a few hours into the story—and are very much worth your time to collect. Dudbears often sell extremely helpful items, including elixirs that permanently boost the stats of whichever character you give them to.</p><figure id="" data-id="0428fa279eb310bdb1d539539698acac" data-recommend-id="image://0428fa279eb310bdb1d539539698acac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yum, grizzly syrup." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yum, grizzly syrup." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0428fa279eb310bdb1d539539698acac" data-recommend-id="image://0428fa279eb310bdb1d539539698acac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yum, grizzly syrup." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first Dudbear shop offers a nice selection of these elixirs (up to three of each!), so finding every Grizzly Syrup in the opening zones can help you to quickly power up a few of your early game characters. The stat boosts may not seem like much on paper, but they will certainly offer a slight edge in battle.<br></p><h2 id="h46390"><a id=""></a><strong>Convert your Golden Clovers into Elemental Points</strong></h2><p>It can take a lot of Elemental Points to unlock a full Elemental Plot tier for each character. If you have certain unlocks you’re looking to score, you can convert the Golden Clovers you’ve found into Elemental Points to earn those extra opportunities to expand your Elemental Plot. See, didn’t I tell you how important picking up all of those yellow items can be?</p><h2 id="h46391"><a id=""></a><strong>Conserve your healing items by breaking pots instead</strong></h2><p>If you’ve been picking up all of the items in the overworld (are you seeing a pattern here?), you’ll have numerous healing items on hand during the opening hours of the game. Even so, there’s no need to use them if you don’t absolutely have to—especially on higher difficulties—so keep an eye out for pots scattered all around each area.</p><figure id="" data-id="b82ac9ec1cb8f40b05bf43f1eabe28e7" data-recommend-id="image://b82ac9ec1cb8f40b05bf43f1eabe28e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pots to smash!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pots to smash!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b82ac9ec1cb8f40b05bf43f1eabe28e7" data-recommend-id="image://b82ac9ec1cb8f40b05bf43f1eabe28e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pots to smash!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Breaking these pots will often provide a quick heal that can keep you prepared for upcoming battles without having to deplete your stock of restoratives. You will frequently even find these within boss arenas, helping you to stay in the action while healing up a bit.<br></p><h2 id="h46392"><a id=""></a><strong>Beware of high-level foes in starter areas</strong></h2><p>As you’re exploring some of the initial zones of the game, you’ll stumble upon ruins that you can explore to snag things like treasure chests, Grizzly Syrup, or yellow item spots. However, you may notice some of these areas will have packs of level 50+ enemies standing around. You’ll be able to come back and fight these much later in the game, but for now, keep your eyes peeled for them so you can stay on the outer perimeters of the ruins to avoid triggering a battle you’re not yet prepared for.</p><hr><p>Okay—you’ll hopefully be slightly more prepared for what’s coming your way in <em>Vision of Mana</em>’s opening hours, so here’s hoping your time with the game is absolutely wonderful. And hey, you know what I’m going to say next: pick up all of those damn yellow items. Don’t make me remind you again.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Anticipated 3D platformer due out on September 6.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [4,878 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Team ASOBI [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-interactive-entertainment/team-asobi">Team ASOBI</a> have released the launch trailer, first of five “behind the scenes” episodes, and new information for 3D <a title="Genres > Platformer [522 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/platformer">platformer</a> <em><a title="Games > ASTRO BOT [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/astro-bot">ASTRO BOT</a></em>. <span id="more-911272"></span></p><p>Get the details below, via Team ASOBI studio head Nicolas Doucet on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/30/meet-astro-bots-new-monkey-friend-and-go-behind-the-scenes-with-team-asobi/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>New Launch Trailer Gameplay</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ASTRO-BOT_2024_08-30-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><p>Let’s start up with new worlds and new gameplay, introducing Handy-D, a cheeky monkey on Astro’s back that lets Astro climb, swing, and slam using its giant hands. This is a returning mechanic we’re taking to a fuller level by mixing it with the core platforming. </p><p>You will also find Muteki (which means invincible in Japanese), a fitting name for Astro’s iron armor that lets him roll around spiky areas, fit inside tight spaces or get blasted like a cannonball! Finally, you’ll also catch a glimpse of Astro turning into a tiny weeny mouse which makes the world, and every surrounding stomp feel huge through the DualSense wireless controller. One of our favorites right there!</p><!-- AD: content -->

There are 300 total bots to rescue in <em>ASTRO BOT</em>, of which 150 are <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,888 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> cameos. We put a ton of love into animating these characters, so they re-enact funny moments from their respective games. So, no matter who your favorite PlayStation characters are, you’re bound to have a laugh with them. Once rescued, these little guys can combine to perform group <a title="Genres > Action [2,134 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s that let you explore more of the hub planet. In the video, you can see a few of the PlayStation characters working together to make a running wall for Astro to get to higher places. </p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ASTRO-BOT_2024_08-30-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>And finally… the part that a lot of you have been wondering and asking about ever since sharing our first trailer: The hero gameplay! So, yes, at a very few key moments in the adventure, Astro will get to borrow some special abilities from some PlayStation heroes. In this video, we can see how Kratos shares the amazing Leviathan Axe for Astro to use in a <a title="Games > God of War (2018) [175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-2018">God of War</a>-infused level. We won’t talk more about this because we believe it is one of the nicest features to discover by yourselves. We simply hope you find it to be both a faithful and fun tribute to the original material. We’d like to take this chance to thank all the game teams out there who gave us their trust and support to make this big PlayStation celebration possible.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ASTRO-BOT_2024_08-30-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>There are still many other things we have not talked about! So we are very excited to see your reactions when Astro lands on September 6.</p><p>Before going, we have a few more announcements to make:</p><p>Please remember to collect your four special Bots in <em><a title="Games > ASTRO's PLAYROOM [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/astros-playroom">ASTRO’s PLAYROOM</a></em>, pre-loaded on your <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,838 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>. Once rescued, you will be able to take these bots to the new game and add them to your starting crew. And in the last few hours preceding the <em>ASTRO BOT</em> launch, we will hold a special celebration countdown inside <em>ASTRO’s PLAYROOM</em>. Please come and check it out.</p><p>Talking of the final countdown, as we approach <em>ASTRO BOT</em>‘s launch on September 6, you still have time to pre-order the game and receive early unlock of costumes and paints for your DualSpeeder as well as the Digital Soundtrack and Digital Artbook if you opt for the Digital Deluxe Edition.</p><p><strong>Behind the Scenes of <em>ASTRO BOT</em></strong></p><p>And finally, we also invite you to check out our behind-the-scene series. These are quite short and snappy videos and a fun moment for us to sit down and reflect after many months of continuous work. We hope you enjoy these videos too. They will roll out as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Episode 1: Crafted Gameplay</strong> (August 30) – Members of Team Asobi discuss what it takes to make a platformer feel good.</li><li><strong>Episode 2: Techno Magic</strong> (TBA) – Discover how Team Asobi uses technology to create magical moments.</li><li><strong>Episode 3: PlayStation Fiesta</strong> (TBA) – Learn how the PlayStation cameos came about, and the level of collaboration needed with other PlayStation Studios to bring this celebration to life.</li><li><strong>Episode 4: <a title="Companies > Overflow" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/overflow">Overflow</a>ing Charm</strong> (TBA) – We focus on the fun features of Astro Bot, from graphics to animation and all other charming touches.</li><li><strong>Episode 5: Being an Asobi</strong> (TBA) – An insider’s look at what it means to be working at Team Asobi and features some of the young talents from the studio.</li></ul><p>And that’s about it!</p><p>The only thing left for us is to thank you for all the months of care and support leading to this launch. It has been a fun ride to go from a pre-loaded demo to taking Astro to the big stage. But it would never have happened without the encouragement from you, the players. </p></blockquote><p><em>ASTRO BOT</em> is due out for PlayStation 5 on September 6.</p><p>Watch the trailer and first behind the scenes video below.

                <p>Earlier this week, the Kingdom Hearts Union χ Dark Road application was unexpectedly delisted from the Apple and Google Play stores.</p><p>The Kingdom Hearts Union χ Dark Road mobile game contained pivotal lore, key story details, and an in-depth plot for the basis of much of the Kingdom Hearts series. Unchained X--previously known as Union X--and Dark Road did receive a cutscene compilation people can watch to experience the story, but playing the game seems to now be a bygone pasttime for Kingdom Hearts fans.</p><p>This delisting poses great problems since one of the main characters introduced in the mobile game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-announced-watch-the-first-trailer/1100-6502347/" data-ref-id="1100-6502347">Strelitzia, also appears in the first Kingdom Hearts 4 trailer</a> and is teased to play a major role in the new installment alongside Sora.</p><p>Delisting games abruptly without an announcement is nothing new.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-25-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher HoYoverse has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.5 release date, and the turn-based gacha RPG's latest content drop officially arrives next month, bringing new characters and more with it.</p>
<p>Following on from the (roughly) monthly release cadence that saw&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-24-release-date">Version 2.4 arrive in late July</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-23-release-date">Version 2.3 before it launch in mid-June</a>, Version 2.5 will arrive on September 10th across PC, PS5, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's bringing a continuation of the ongoing&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>story, and this time, you'll be uncovering "long-buried secrets within the Shackling Prison", bringing what HoYoverse calls a "trailblazing silkpunk saga" to a climax.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.5-release-date-feixiao.jpg?itok=ieDTxMuk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.5-release-date-feixiao.jpg?itok=eGryzDlB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.5 will introduce new characters like Feixiao into the mix.</figcaption></figure><p>This new Version also brings the Wardance event, which gives you the chance to net a Tuskpir pet, as well as the opportunity to explore other exciting events hosted by the Xianzhou.</p>
<p>As ever, new five-star characters are also joining the fray in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.5. The first of these is Feixiao, a warrior trained in "all forms of martial arts" who can deal heavy damage with her gunblades or her axe.</p>

		<p><em>Recently, Rob and Patrick found themselves </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/articles/the-old-internet-was-better/" rel="noreferrer"><em>remembering what it was like on The Old Internet</em></a><em>, a period of loud dial-up modems and sketchy but surprising ways of <s>pirating</s> discovering music. In the same way, it's never been easier to "discover" movies and television shows, but doesn't it feel overwhelming and weird, too?</em></p><p><em>This conversation was prompted </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/podcasts/episodes/my-turn-o-brother-where-art-thou/" rel="noreferrer"><em>by our recent My Turn episode covering O Brother, where art thou?</em></a><em>, a movie Rob, Patrick, and Cado hadn't watched since it came out more than 20 years ago. There's plenty of movies, and plenty of reasons, to go a  long time before revisiting a film, but back in the day, the cycle was different. You had less choice of what to watch, but it also meant a world of curated entertainment by an invisible had of TV executives, or the local video store clerks.</em></p><p><em>Different doesn't mean better, but this week, we tried sitting with what we found attractive and interesting about that time, and considered ways to introduce movie spice into our lives. A little friction, so to speak.</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Now that's a damn movie. Image Credit: Touchstone Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Rob, there’s a moment in the latest episode of My Turn where I ponder why it took me more than 20 years to return to <em>O Brother, where art thou?</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Part of my explanation—or theory—is that it’s not a movie where I sit down at the end of a long day and go “okay, time to watch <em>O Brother, where art thou? </em>It’s a weird, charming movie that I’m glad to have spent a few hours revisiting, but upon reflection, what I was most taken by was discovering I hadn’t rewatched it within the confines of, say, a hotel room looping Starz or because it accidentally came up while browsing cable channels a decade ago and going <em>huh</em>.</p><p>We talked about this in the context of music recently, but it’s got me thinking about movies, too. I miss the days of flipping on cable, landing on a movie I’d seen before and getting sucked into a scene, only to find another 90 minutes had gone by and I’d rewatched. Heck, if it was airing on something like TNT, there’s a good chance I watched it with commercials <em>and</em> it was edited up. I discovered new films by renting them at the store and revisited old films chopped up on cable.</p><p>The difference between movies and music is that I keep up with the newest movies. I listen to several movie podcasts with spoiler discussions that I keep in the podcast chamber until I’ve had a chance to see it myself. This combination of internal and external factors are useful motivation for seeing Alien: Romulus but less useful for revisiting O Brother, where art thou?&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite holiday is Halloween, and thus, one of my favorite traditions is coming up with a list of movies for my wife and I to watch over the course of the month. The list is important, because it serves as a guiding post and a checklist of shame for movies that we planned to see in October. (But if we’re being honest, the horror movie watching begins in earnest sometime in September, since it’ll take me nearly two months to watch more than 20 movies, anyway.)</p><p>That list ends up being a combination of films I hold dear that I want to revisit, movies with a significant historical milestone like a 30th anniversary, older movies I’ve overlooked, and new movies that are timed to drop around Halloween time. But one of the core services of the list is an opportunity—a push—to rewatch old movies! It’s my own curated cable channel of horror, in a world where I’m otherwise always looking forward and rarely find myself in situations where I’m revisiting a classic. Actually, let me amend that. Part of the reason I miss cable surfing is because it was full of <em>stuff, not</em> just <em>classics</em>. It’s easy to find reasons to rewatch a movie that holds a special place in your heart, but much harder to find reasons for, well, everything else.</p><p>Do you have a different method for revisiting older movies? Is your relationship to movies different from music, too?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Hellraiser is one of the movies we rewatch every year.

It was a live-service game that players and critics thought lacked substance, and the memes began to pour forth poking fun at the “AAAA” statement. Now, <em>Skull and Bones</em> has launched wide, releasing on Steam to the masses. While the reception hasn’t appeared significantly better many months after its initial release, there is still potential for the game to improve and win over more players.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,195805,196406" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That said, many genuinely enjoy the game, and a few took to the Steam reviews section to voice their opinions. Of course, they’re intermingled with extremely loud negativity. There’s even a bit of faux objectivity, as one reviewer included Ubisoft Connect, a boring story, and lackluster ship battles among the game’s cons and left their list of its pros completely blank. And, despite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/valve-joke-meme-reviews-unhelpful-steam-update-changes-1851622567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/valve-joke-meme-reviews-unhelpful-steam-update-changes-1851622567">Valve’s best efforts</a></span>, there are the usual joke reviews.

Others have genuine concerns about its gameplay, pacing, and numerous bugs or quality-of-life features.<br></p><p>If you’re curious about how Ubisoft’s live-service pirate adventure has turned out

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rocket-league-leak-teases-possible-%E2%80%98urban-legends%E2%80%99-event.968319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rocket-league-leak-teases-possible-urban-legends-event/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1829504366086123873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new post</a> on X today, reliable leaker SamLeakss claimed that Rocket League devs could be planning an event featuring Urban Legends.</p>



<p>Both SamLeakss and SpushFNBR state that this information is based on a leaked blog post from the devs. They claim the blog is titled “Rocket League Season 16 Urban Legends Emerge from the Arenas Darkest Depths.”</p>



<p>SamLeakss adds that “This Blog might go live this week, or could be the name of the upcoming Halloween event.” The Halloween season is quickly approaching, so the timing would certainly make sense. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Rocket League will soon be getting an "Urban Legends" Event, according to an upcoming leaked Blog Post 👀 </p><p>This Blog might go live this week, or could be the name of the upcoming Halloween event! Slenderman and Bigfoot are extremely likely for collaborations, as Season 16 is set… <a href="https://t.co/Fl4DyJrhMa">pic.twitter.com/Fl4DyJrhMa</a></p></div>— Sam (@SamLeakss) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamLeakss/status/1829504366086123873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>The leaker also lists a few potential urban legends, such as Bigfoot, Mothman, and Slenderman. While this only appeared to be speculation, SamLeakss points out that the corresponding season will be set in a forest.</p>



<p>Notably, SamLeakss and SpushFNBR also suggest that the event’s themed cosmetics could end up in Fortnite, too. That’s based on previous events similarly coinciding with Fortnite.</p>



<p>At this time, the devs did not officially confirm the Urban Legends event or release the leaked blog.</p>



<p>Most recently, Rocket League just released a new Season Rush for Season 15 this week. Psyonix also revealed some competitive rewards, ahead of Season 15 concluding on September 4, 2024.</p>



<p>Rocket League recently appeared at the Esports World Cup 2024, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-bds-wins-the-rocket-league-esports-world-cup-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team BDS won against Team Falcons</a> for the championship. The team earned $200,000 in prizing for their victory.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-debuts-the-princess-sword-fighter-form<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Nintendo has released another trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, giving us our first look at the princess embracing her inner-Link, and wielding a sword and shield.</p>
<p>On the game's release, Zelda will find a mysterious sword hidden within the lands of Hyrule, which will allow her to transform into her sword fighting form. She will be able to fend off enemies and clear obstacles that block her path. However, while certainly handy, this form isn't permanent, and Zelda will need to replenish the sword by collecting energy for it from the Still World.</p>
<p>And, what is the Still World? I hear you ask! Well, this is the world found within those strange, purple aura rifts that now litter the kingdom. The land in this world is "distorted", and Zelda must work with Echoes of Wisdom's companion Tri to negotiate the many twists, turns and dungeons within.</p>

<p>Of course, when not using her sword to overcome any ordeal in her way, she will be able to use her Tri Rod, which allows her to copy and paste items she finds in the world. This can be seen again in the most recent trailer, when Zelda mid-battle whips out a bed to have a little lie down on. I mean, why not. Also, it sure does look like she is going to face off with Volvagia at some point during Echoes of Wisdom. I am sure I recognise <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>'s Fire Temple dragon.</p>
<p>Speaking of returning characters, Dampé will also show up in Echoes of Wisdom, as an "engineer of clockwork gizmos", who has a "knack for creating automatons". The automatons can be used in battle. But, enough from me. You can check out the latest trailer for Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom in the video above. And, I have thoughts on that final frame...</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's launch on 26th September, fans have been busy trying to work out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-react-to-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reveal-with-timeline-speculation-and-adorable-artwork">where in the series' timeline Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> sits.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gearboxs-first-risk-of-rain-2-dlc-is-apparently-a-complete-disaster.968292/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gearbox-risk-of-rain-2-dlc-review-bomb<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gearbox has released its first&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2&nbsp;</em>DLC since acquiring the IP almost two years ago, and it's safe to say that the release has not gone well for the studio at all.</p>
<p>Former owner Hopoo Games sold the&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain&nbsp;</em>IP to Gearbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gearbox-acquires-risk-of-rain-ip-from-hopoo-games">in November 2022</a>, and the game's first DLC since that transfer,&nbsp;<em>Seekers of the Storm</em>, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306620/Risk_of_Rain_2_Seekers_of_the_Storm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">out now</a>. Unfortunately, it's also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306620/Risk_of_Rain_2_Seekers_of_the_Storm/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">attracted a Mostly Negative rating</a> on Steam in the three days since its release.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/gearboxs-first-risk-of-rain-2-expansion-gets-hammered-on-steam-as-developer-admits-the-pc-version-is-in-a-really-bad-place/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a PC Gamer report</a>, Gearbox's woes began when players pointed out that the price of&nbsp;<em>Seekers of the Storm&nbsp;</em>was disproportionately expensive when compared to previous expansion&nbsp;<em>Survivors of the Void</em>. To Gearbox's credit, it did <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632360/view/4575181680239699091" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post an update on Steam yesterday</a> addressing this issue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/risk-of-rain-2-dlc-gearbox-disaster-combat.jpg?itok=y9SrxE-J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/risk-of-rain-2-dlc-gearbox-disaster-combat.jpg?itok=7uCrTAzU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's not going well for Gearbox when it comes to the&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2&nbsp;</em>DLC&nbsp;<em>Seekers of the Storm</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, that's not where Gearbox's woes end with regards to&nbsp;<em>Seekers of the Storm</em>. As noted by PC Gamer, an update released with the expansion has effectively broken the base&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2&nbsp;</em>game, whether you've bought the DLC or not.</p>
<p>According to PC Gamer's report, said update has "tied&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2</em>'s physics systems to its frame rate", essentially breaking a number of elements in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These elements include an <a href="https://x.com/FunyonD/status/1828666364036346029" rel="noopener" target="_blank">entire character seemingly failing to function</a>, an issue which Gearbox head Randy Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1828917052955922737" rel="noopener" target="_blank">subsequently referred to</a> as "jank we've just sort of tolerated", pledging to "have another look". How magnanimous of you, Randy.</p>
<p>Per PC Gamer, a Gearbox developer told those in the&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2&nbsp;</em>Discord server that "all the ramifications on balance/physics/attack speed/movement/etc. were not intentional", advising that players lock the game to 60fps to prevent further issues.</p>

<p>This is an issue Gearbox will likely want to fix as soon as it can. Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/632360/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB's charts</a>,&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2&nbsp;</em>hit an all-time player high of 75,406 when&nbsp;<em>Seekers of the Storm&nbsp;</em>launched, so it's clear this DLC has attracted lots of new and returning players to the game.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, Pitchford himself <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1828916842200740113" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> he's "super, super proud" of what Gearbox accomplished with&nbsp;<em>Seekers of the Storm</em>, inviting players to "blame [him]" for any problems they experience. Then again, he does also sign off with "whatever the case, don't be a hater", so make of that what you will.</p>
<p>We'll have to see what happens next with regards to&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2</em>, but if you do want to check the game out (and don't mind that it appears to be broken), you can do so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">on PC via Steam</a>, as well as on consoles.</p>

After finding the blade, Zelda will gain the ability to shift into a very Link-like swordfighter form that’s timed to a magical energy gauge. In her swordfighter form, Zelda seems to be a bit more nimble and able to block enemy attacks with a shield, but she can only maintain the form for a limited amount of time before needing to refill her magic with mysterious energy found throughout the game.</p><p>While Zelda’s new form will give players a way to hack and slash their way through enemies, the new trailer really spotlights how sword fighting is just one of the skills you’re meant to cleverly deploy while exploring the world. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom </em>hits the Switch on September 26th, 2024.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Clearly, you should set all of these to whatever difficulty you feel most comfortable with, and very impressively, none of them impact things like trophies or achievements.</p><p>Remember:<strong> the entire goal of a video game is to have the most fun possible</strong>, and only you can decide what that looks like for you.</p><h2 id="h123658"><a id=""></a><strong>Access for everyone</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1c17baa933f15b0d3a077f029ae736ea" data-recommend-id="image://1c17baa933f15b0d3a077f029ae736ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nix, looking up from the floor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nix, looking up from the floor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c17baa933f15b0d3a077f029ae736ea" data-recommend-id="image://1c17baa933f15b0d3a077f029ae736ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nix, looking up from the floor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> has an abundance of accessibility-focused settings, too, including Cognitive, Colors, Vision, and Hearing.

Some of these options cross over with the general difficulty settings mentioned above, but you’ll find that there’s more granular control over those features under their respective settings.</p><p>Each person’s accessibility needs are different, obviously, but some settings we’d recommend <em>everyone</em> look over are related to mini-games. While slicing and lockpicking can be fun on their default settings, you can opt to adjust their intensity, or have them autocomplete if needed. Additionally, turning on “fast mode” for the Kessel Sabacc card game will speed matches up considerably, while swapping the card headers to “simple numerals” will make the cards much easier to identify (at the very minor cost of a bit of authenticity, perhaps).</p><p>Regardless of the accessibility needs you have, though, here’s an idea of what to expect when you dive into <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>’s detail settings.</p><h2 id="h123659"><a id=""></a><strong>Gameplay settings</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="b2697abeb757a1a86c48b39ea66e4dac" data-recommend-id="image://b2697abeb757a1a86c48b39ea66e4dac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gameplay settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gameplay settings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2697abeb757a1a86c48b39ea66e4dac" data-recommend-id="image://b2697abeb757a1a86c48b39ea66e4dac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gameplay settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As mentioned above, it’s possible to change the difficulty such that you can boost your own health and lower that of enemies, or if you prefer, reverse than and make the challenge far harder.

<p>According to a <a href="https://puck.news/how-the-wbd-fire-sale-could-play-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a> via Puck, WB could be working on a new game based on the Penguin that is set in Matt Reeves’ popular The Batman universe. </p>



<p>The report claims that “various WBD divisions are beginning to collaborate more closely on properties like the upcoming Penguin HBO show and game, both seeded in the 2022 The Batman movie.”</p>



<p>They add that “when Zaslav took over, many advised him to offload games,” but Zaslav “still sees the games unit as strategic.”</p>



<p>At this time, official sources did not confirm anything about the potential Penguin game nor issue a statement about the report. Also, Insider Gaming has yet to independently verify the rumor.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Further, Puck’s own report mentions that Zaslav’s “assessment could change soon” regarding Warner’s games unit. So, nothing is concrete about the Penguin game.</p>



<p>HBO plans to premiere its limited series based on Matt Reeves’ iteration of the Penguin in late September 2024. It will run for eight episodes, through November 2024.</p>



<p>HBO has already released a couple of trailers for the anticipated show. Many praised Colin Farrell as a highlight of Reeves’ The Batman film, and could certainly enjoy a game based on that version of the character.</p>



<p>Just last week, Meta Quest 3 exclusive Batman: Arkham Shadow also got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/batman-arkham-shadow-gameplay-and-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new gameplay trailer</a> and an October 2024 release window.</p>



<hr>



<p>For more of the latest gaming industry news, you can read about a new report claiming that NetEase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-developer-ouka-studios-reportedly-facing-possible-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans to shut down</a> Visions of Man developer Ouka Studios, and sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming newsletter</a>.</p>

    <p><span>Introducing the Still World, Swordfighter form, and the engineer Dampe.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,732 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> has released a new trailer for <em><a title="Games > The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a></em> introducing the Still World, Swordfighter form, and the engineer Dampe. <span id="more-911247"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>The land of Hyrule has been torn apart by mysterious <a title="Platforms > Rift" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/rift">Rift</a>s. In search of Link and the king of Hyrule, both of whom were stolen away, Princess Zelda must borrow the power of an ethereal creature called Tri. Together, they enter the tears that scar the land in order to save her kingdom. On her journey, Zelda will explore what lies within the Rifts.</p><p><strong>Navigating the Still World</strong></p><p>This is the Still World. Here, trees, fragments of land, people, and other items that were swallowed up by the Rifts float in the void. It’s said they will eventually vanish completely. Exploring the farthest reaches of this world is no easy feat. To do so, Zelda will have to traverse eerie floating terrain. Because the path is broken up, the Echoes you’ve learned can come in handy. Forge your own way forward by creating Echoes to use as platforms to bridge the gaps.</p><p>Massive dungeons can also be found deep within the Still World. Zelda will use her wisdom and Echoes to take on enemies and puzzles that stand in her way, then confront challenging bosses who await her arrival. What to do though? Overwhelm the boss with Echoes? Or combine them to find unique ways around the situation? The strategy is yours to devise.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The Still World can be accessed through Rifts scattered across Hyrule, and each entry point leads to a location with its own defining features. On her <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,726 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, Zelda must overcome dungeons within the Rifts and the mysteries they hold. Without Link or the king, Hyrule’s fate rests squarely in Zelda’s hands.</p><p><strong>Swordfighter Form</strong></p><p>When Zelda finds and picks up a mysterious sword, she takes on the Swordfighter form, allowing her to attack directly. With its mighty power, she can forge ahead when her path is blocked, strike down enemies on her own, or battle alongside Echoes. However, she can only stay in Swordfighter form for a short period of time. When or where you choose to wield this power is up to you. The sword’s gauge can be replenished by collecting energy found in the Still World, so be sure to grab any you find.</p><p><strong>Inhabitants of Hyrule</strong></p><p>This is Dampe, an engineer who crafts clockwork gizmos in Hyrule. His extravagant creations are called Automatons, and they can be activated by winding them up. They can unleash powerful effects that differentiate them from Echoes, but be careful—they’ll break apart if they take too much damage. You’ll meet many other quirky characters during your travels, and there’s no doubt they’ll be of great help to the princess.</p><p>On a journey to traverse and save Hyrule, Princess Zelda’s wisdom is key to undertaking this adventure.</p></blockquote><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,919 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> on September 26.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p><h2><span>Into the Still World, a Journey Continued</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom — Into the Still World, a Journey Continued — Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wUdJF8gyO4A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="ゼルダの伝説 知恵のかりもの | ハイラルのあるきかた3 無の世界篇" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xHALE0nvhl0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/civilization-vii">Civilization VII</a> is coming at a really interesting time for the historical 4X genre, with a bunch of rivals having sprung up in the last few years, and everyone trying to explore similar concepts to better translate the passage of time and evolution of nations into video game form.</p>
<p>We got to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/hands-on-civilization-vii-preview-one-for-the-ages/">hands on with the opening few turns at Gamescom 2024</a>, and alongside a breakdown by Firaxis for the overarching concepts and changes, it feels like an exciting new chapter for the storied franchise. But there’s always more to ask and to find out, and we had the opportunity to sit down with Creative Director Ed Beach to dive into what’s new, different and what’s staying the same in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/civilization-7">Civ 7</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><strong>TSA: So, change is very difficult for people to accept…</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed Beach:</b> We’ve noticed! Our forums are abuzz with that!</p>

<p><strong>TSA: [laughs] I mean, we’ll obviously talk about what’s different with Civ 7, but what kind of security blankets are there for people? What’s staying consistent and staying true to Civilization?</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> The number one change that seems to have thrown our community, and that we were expecting to throw our community, is that your civilization changes are you get to each age. I think the security blanket that they’re going to realise is there, is that they’re thinking “I’m starting as Egypt, and the game is asking me to switch to India.”</p>
<p>They saw that in some of our competing products, and it was very jarring, but we have a historical pathway system that’s really going to make a lot of those choices much more logical within history. So certain areas of the world, like India and China, that have their own ecosystem of dynasties that evolved over time, a lot of people are thinking there’s one India in the game, but that’s not necessarily true anymore. We are not revealing our whole lineup of civilizations, because that’s part of our marketing campaign to roll that information out, but in an area where it makes sense for us to have a representation of, say, India in all three ages, that’s very much what we might want to do.</p>
<p>So that’s not that much different to playing India before, but now its much richer, because you might have not just abilities through one slice of the game. Like all of our empires before, you’d get to play America or England and have to wait for your abilities to come online, and you’re hoping in a multiplayer game that you don’t get crushed and wiped off the map before you’re relevant – now you have this much richer portrayal of a particular historical pathway, because you’re playing through three layers and they all have bonuses.</p>
<p>I think players will realise that’s actually very cool and very much improved over what was there before. Obviously there’s going to be cases where players can unlock a strange pathway, and some players will love doing that, while players who love the historical immersion may shy away from that. And that’s fine. Everyone should play the game the way that they want. But it should cater to both those historical enthusiasts who want it to be more traditional…</p>
<p><strong>TSA: Like those who want Egypt to always be exactly how it was…</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> But even then, Egypt ended up getting entirely conquered by the Ottoman Empire later in history, and how should that be represented?</p>

<p><strong>TSA: I think another part that might not be grasped on a surface level is that it’s called Egypt in the game, but obviously Egypt now is very different from Ancient Egypt.</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> And if you look at something like Rome, Rome had influence everywhere and there’s a lot of modern empires that can say they did start with a big Roman influence, and that makes sense for me.</p>
<p>We’re launching the game with more civs than we’ve ever had before, because the more civs we have, the more of these pathways we can have, but it’s going to benefit even more as the mod community and our DLC packs start pumping even more into the game. It’s going to be really interesting all the ways you can navigate your way through history.</p>
<p><strong>TSA:&nbsp;</strong><strong>You alluded to your competitors, the rivals to your crown let’s say, and it’s a really interesting time for the historical 4X genre. Is it encouraging that so many minds are exploring a similar direction to yourselves? Especially as everyone has their own particular way of representing ages and evolving cultures.</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> I feel like there was a catalyst to this, and maybe it’s slightly egotistical on our part to think that Civ 6 was a driver, but it was very successful, and obviously we sold lots of units, we have a big install base, and that’s the kind of situation where anyone with business sense is thinking “We can grab a piece of that pie and it’ll be very profitable for us too!”</p>
<p>There’s tons of activity in this space, which is good for everybody.</p>
<p>As we developed this product, we didn’t know we were going to have four competitors when we started. We had actually gotten very used to, the first ten years I was at Firaxis, we didn’t have competitors and they stayed away from the historical space. Like “We don’t want to take Civ on, so we’ll go and do Sci Fi or Fantasy”, and they did some very good jobs at those other genres, but the competition directly in the historical space was limited.</p>
<p>What we saw was one by one those competitors were popping up, and we were like, how much attention do we have to pay to them? We knew we wanted to break the game up into chapters to make it more manageable for players to get through to the end, because we had data on how many people bail out, and we wanted to address that problem directly.</p>
<p>We ended up being distracted a couple times by some of these competitors, but we ended up in the final analysis was that we stick to our plan. […]
</p><p>You can tell that we’re all poking at the same problems, because the name Ages is in our game as it is in Millennia, Influence is in our game and i think in Humankind. So we’re coming up with the same solutions, we’re trying to name things the same, even if they’re slightly different things, so we’re all poking at this idea of what makes a great historical strategy game and how to structure it. We had the advantage that Civ 6 was out there and still performing well, so we didn’t have to rush, so we could iterate on things quite a bit, and I think that’s been helpful.</p>

<p><strong>TSA: The Civ 6 expansion Rise and Fall tried to deal with this kind of, well it’s in the name really, rise and fall of empires. What can you say about how those ideas morphed into the Ages here.</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> It’s a really good observation, because the thing we wanted to do with Rise and Fall was to not represent human progress as this ever-ascending ramp where players or empires are never being challenged and they can just keep on getting bigger and stronger. That’s traditionally what a Civ game has been, but it’s not really the way history works.</p>
<p>It’s much more, you grow so big that you don’t know how to control your empire anymore, outside invaders see that you have weaknesses and poke it, and so there’s some kind of crisis. You typically end up having to retrench, regroup and push forward again, but you’ve taken a step back.</p>
<p>Rise and Fall we experimented with that. We had the loyalty system where if you went into a dark age, you would lose cities at the edge of your empire. We’re taking inspiration from that idea, we have a Crisis system so there is a challenge at the end of each Age, and a natural reason why your empire starts to fall apart.</p>
<p>We have historians on the team and they’ve looked at when those time periods across the world, where there was a Dark Age everywhere, not just in the Roman Empire, but in the East where none of the big empires were surviving. So we’ve tried to slot the times that the crisis happens in, so there’s a historical story to tell there.</p>
<p>But there were a few things about Rise and Fall that we didn’t like, and you’ll notice in this game that a couple things have disappeared from Civ 6. The points system to get just enough Era score to evaluate if you go into a dark age or a golden age, and the tech and civic boosts –&nbsp;those systems did some good things, but they made players chase mini objectives almost to a level that was distracting from their strategic vision as an empire, so we’ve backed off that.</p>
<p>There’s still quests in the game – advisors give you quests, you can get quests from the narrative system –&nbsp;and there’s always the need to explore the map more to find discoveries, so we think we have enough short term objectives in the game without making the players keep track of all these little scores.</p>
<p><strong>TSA: I was also going to ask diplomacy and how some games will present all the numbers and how stats add up, other games will try to obscure it a little bit, and these mini objectives</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> You can just get an overload of too many little numbers and trackers and progress bars to fill up, and I don’t think that’s a fun game.</p>

<p><strong>TSA: I’ve mentioned it now, so let’s talk about diplomacy and if there any key ways that you’re shifting this side of the game?</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> I didn’t feel quite as passionately about it as some members of my design team, but i agreed with them: the one thing they felt was unrealistic about Civ games all the way back to Civ 4… 3 actually, was the deal table. If you’re a great leader, you’re Augustus Caesar, you shouldn’t be haggling over the price of figs when you’re trying to trade them to your neighbour! That just didn’t feel right.</p>
<p>The diplomacy systems in Civ games had this weird incentive where the more time you spent going around to different leaders and trying to negotiate those deals with them? That was the best way to play, because you could go, “Oh this guy’s a little friendlier to me, he’ll give me a better deal. I just got this new commodity, let me get as much gold as possible.” There was this weird min-maxing game that A) took a lot of time, and B) didn’t feel like something a world leader should be doing.</p>
<p><strong>TSA: It’s more like a space trading game where you go from one port to another.</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> Exactly, and then the third thing about it was you were trading your luxury goods to other leaders through that interface, but we also had a trade route system and you establish routes to other players, but there was no connection between them. We always wanted them to be unified.</p>
<p>We have unified those, and when you set up a trade route to another player, that’s how you get their resources. There’s no deal table where you’re haggling over prices, now your merchants go out and bring commodities back. Everything you buy from another player, they’re going to earn gold from, and you get one free trade route with everybody, but if you want more trade routes with somebody, you need to be friendly enough that they’ll allow it. So diplomacy and trade are very tightly tied together, but it’s a brand new system that unifies a lot of what we felt needed to be unified.</p>

<p><strong>TSA: Finally, you’re keeping the unpacked city style from Civ 6, which was so visually arresting, but with the new transitions between civs, how are you evolving it for Civ 7?</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> There’s three big changes. The first one is that each urban tile is not assigned a specialty –&nbsp;it’s not a science district or a culture district –&nbsp;you get two building slots there and you can put whatever building you want there.</p>
<p>There second thing is cities have to grow out from the centre. It used to be that you had the centre of your city here, and your first district could be way out on the edge of the [city’s area], and players were like, “That doesn’t feel like the same city, that feels like little suburbs.” So now your city has to grow out from the centre.</p>
<p>The third thing is that as you go from one age to the next, the city buildings from the previous age lose their power. The new buildings from the new age are much, much better, and you want them to be in the choice spots where you put the earlier buildings for adjacency bonuses and things like that, so we have this system where you over-build. In the presentation we talked about how London was built in layers, and that’s very interesting because now the same part of the map you’ll get to figure out how you want to lay out your cities on it multiple times through a game, and that gives you all sorts of opportunities for this building gameplay to evolve and improve as you’re working on it.</p>
<p><strong>TSA: Extending from that, is there anything where you visually merge the civilisations together?</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> If you play as Egypt and you get the special necropolis mortuary complex built on a tile, that’s permanent, and so even if you move on from Egypt to another empire, that Egyptian quarter remains. Think about cities that have, you know, Latin quarters, Jewish quarters and that was an inspiration to have these old quarters that are vestiges of the empire that used to live there, and as you go through the ages, your whole lineage starts to reveal itself to you on the map.</p>

			<p>The developers at GSC Game World are in the final stretch of development for STALKER 2 after going through lots of hardships. At Gamescom 2024, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> PR Specialist Zakhar Bocharov and Lead Producer Slava Lukyanenka to discuss what's left before launch, and the optimization of the Xbox Series S version (with the help of the Xbox team) stood out.</p>
<p><em><strong>Slava Lukyanenka:&nbsp;</strong>Well, our team is mature enough to take care of many aspects of the game themselves. Yet, the Xbox team knows best how the Xbox performs and what's better to do in a case like we need to go deeper into the optimization. The Microsoft team visited several times, providing essential expertise on what else we could do that we didn't think of. It's not over yet. Aside from Xbox Series X, we're still working on optimization for Xbox Series S. It's going well, and the Xbox team is contributing a lot.</em></p>
<p><em>On Xbox Series X, we have two available modes. One of them is Performance Mode, where STALKER 2 is running with 60 FPS and slightly different graphics than in Quality Mode, which looks super awesome with all the reflections and high-resolution textures, but runs at 30 FPS. We are trying to achieve a similar experience on Xbox Series S by combining these two approaches. So far, we have it at 25ish FPS on the Xbox Series S, but we still have space to optimize.</em></p>
<p>I also asked about the Game Pass partnership with Xbox, and GSC Game World expressed gratitude for all the support they've received from Microsoft during the making of STALKER 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong>&nbsp;That's right. That's a Game Pass partnership and Microsoft is not pushing us in any way to release on any date or just put the content out of the game or something like that. Actually, Microsoft, they are super supportive of us. We didn't exactly ask someone from Microsoft to be our friends, but Sarah Bond is obviously a friend of the game. Phil (Spencer) was super supportive, all the teams from Microsoft were. They didn't put any additional pressure on us.</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is out November 20 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, available on Game Pass from day one. Based on info from the Epic v. Apple legal fight, the game should be a console <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-a-3-month-console-exclusive-microsoft-will-increase-revenue-share-for-xbox-games-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive</a> for Microsoft's platform for three months, although this was never acknowledged by either Microsoft or GSC Game World.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/visions-of-mana-studio-hit-by-huge-layoffs-on-release-day-per-report.968259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has alleged that&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>developer Ouka Studio has been hit by layoffs on the very day the game launched across the world.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/tencent-netease-rethink-japan-approach-as-game-strategy-stalls" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg's Takashi Mochizuki</a> (who, in turn, cites the old chestnut "people familiar with the matter"), Ouka's owner NetEase has "cut all but a handful of jobs" at its Tokyo studio, with a view to eventually closing the company completely.</p>
<p>Mochizuki goes on to say that NetEase's plan is to "shut the Shibuya outfit" (i.e. the Tokyo branch), with a handful of employees remaining to oversee the rollout of Ouka's final games before it "winds down".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-layoffs-report-creatures.jpg?itok=9HC3IuSP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-layoffs-report-creatures.jpg?itok=jblHS9oF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana</em>'s developer has reportedly been hit by huge layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>What makes this layoff report particularly cruel is the timing.&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-release-date">launched just yesterday</a>, earning itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/visions-of-mana-review-exceptional-venture">a very favorable review</a> from our very own Brittany, so the studio behind the game suffering layoffs feels especially unfortunate in light of that.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Ouka's owner NetEase hasn't officially confirmed these layoffs; in a statement given to Mochizuki and Bloomberg, NetEase said it had "nothing to announce" with regards to Ouka's closure.</p>
<h2>Ouka's layoffs are reportedly part of a wider trend</h2>
<p>Per the Bloomberg report, the layoffs at Ouka are part of a wider trend concerning Chinese companies pulling out of Japanese investments amidst a resurgence of the Chinese game market and a lack of success in Japan.</p>
<p>Mochizuki says that both NetEase and gaming giant Tencent are reconsidering investments in Japanese studios. The report gives the example of&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-canceled-west-japan-service-ending">recently canceled in the West</a>; Tencent was to develop and publish the mobile version of that game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-protocol-tencent-netease-report.jpg?itok=u_bUauwB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-protocol-tencent-netease-report.jpg?itok=e5DenCQ4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>is one of the games that has frustrated Chinese companies like Tencent with regards to Japanese investments, according to Bloomberg.</figcaption></figure><p>Bloomberg quotes analyst Robin Zhu as saying that while Tencent and NetEase have no intention of pulling out of partnerships with big studios like Capcom and Bandai Namco, the gaming giants are perhaps "scrutiniz[ing] their returns more closely".</p>
<p>Zhu says that Tencent and NetEase may be following a wider industry trend of scaling back headcounts or investments, and also that "anecdotally", Japanese studios' "desire to tightly control" their IP has been a "source of friction" between Japanese outfits and Chinese companies.</p>
<p>The Chinese gaming market has also opened up in recent months. GameScience's&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-sales-10-million">topped 10 million sales</a> just a few days out from release, and HoYoverse games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>have also seen success.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-boss.jpg?itok=k3gcAklc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-boss.jpg?itok=J7yGO_I8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is spearheading a Chinese gaming industry resurgence.</figcaption></figure><p>In recent years, NetEase has made big investments in Japanese industry legends like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netease-launches-new-studio-pincool-led-by-former-dragon-quest-producer-will-work-on"><em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>producer Ryutaro Ichimura</a>, former Capcom exec <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-producer-founds-new-studio-at-netease">Hiroyuki Kobayashi</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Yakuza&nbsp;</em>creator <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-creators-team-up-to-create-nagoshi-studios">Toshihiro Nagoshi</a>.</p>
<p>Whether this reported shift in the company's strategy will make a difference to these investments remains to be seen, but NetEase told Bloomberg it's always "making necessary adjustments to reflect market conditions". Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/tencent-netease-rethink-japan-approach-as-game-strategy-stalls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a> via Bloomberg, NetEase could potentially shut down Visions of Mana developer Ouka Studios.</p>



<p>The report says that NetEase possibly “intends to shut the Shibuya outfit.” It adds that NetEase “has cut all but a handful of jobs at its Ouka studio in Tokyo.” </p>



<p>Bloomberg later elaborated <a href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1829342570042048776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a> that NetEase has issued these staff reductions “since this spring at least.”</p>



<p>Both Tencent and NetEase are also reportedly reconsidering a variety of investments in Japanese studios. This may be because “years of spending yielded few hit games.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: Tencent and NetEase are rethinking their Japan investment as Japanese developers failed to produce hit games. NetEase cut many staff at Ouka Studio with a plan to shut it down while Tencent backed off from funding commitments on several projects.<a href="https://t.co/89nXAwVFYa">https://t.co/89nXAwVFYa</a></p>— Takashi Mochizuki (@6d6f636869) <a href="https://twitter.com/6d6f636869/status/1829320388817686780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>At this time, neither Tencent nor NetEase issued official confirmation that there are plans to shut down Ouka Studios. However, the new report does include statements from each company.</p>



<p>Tencent said that it “remains committed to its partner studios and developing its business in Japan.” NetEase stated that it has “nothing to announce” regarding Ouka Studios closing down. </p>



<p>However, a NetEase spokesperson said that “we craft our strategy based on our goal of providing better gaming experiences to local and global players.” They added that NetEase is “always making necessary adjustments to reflect market conditions.”</p>



<p>Ouka Studios only just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-launches-on-august-29-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released Visions of Mana</a> a day ago, and it already has solid critic reviews on Metacritic. Visions of Mana is available now on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It is not currently available on Xbox Game Pass, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-not-releasing-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as previously announced</a>.</p>
