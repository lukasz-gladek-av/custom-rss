            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At their biggest and most expensive, video games all sort of look the same. The reason often comes down to simple economics: More resources means more costs that need to be recouped, and historically the way publishers have done that is by being comically risk-averse. Hence the glut of semi-realistic rocky wastelands that look like death metal album covers where everyone is some kind of Wild West fetishist, or the hero shooters that all look like Pixar but shredded as hell and ready for fan artists to go places I shall not.</p><p>On occasion, however, new visual ground is staked. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is an example of this. The third game in the <em>Octopath </em>series is a lot of things — a newcomer-friendly prequel, a reconfigured adaptation of a mobile game, a pretty great JRPG — but it’s also the end of a 2025 victory lap for the art style that publisher Square Enix has dubbed “HD-2D.” It’s a bold experiment that is now a fixture of the release calendar — and also highly unusual in how much it communicates. An HD-2D game from Square Enix is a statement about what old games it considers classics worth revisiting, and what new games should be received as such.</p><p>“The HD-2D style began with the idea: ‘What if we revived games from the Super Famicom, the golden era of pixel art, using modern technology?’” Masaaki Hayasaka, producer of this year’s <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>, told <em>The Verge </em>via email. First used in 2018’s<em> Octopath Traveler</em>, the art style is meant to evoke the pixelated texture and feel that characterized 16-bit role-playing games like <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, but with the depth and detail afforded by modern 3D graphics. The developers at Square and <em>Octopath</em> co-developer Acquire <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/octopath-traveler-s-hd-2d-art-style-and-story-make-for-a-jrpg-dream-come-true">cleverly achieved this</a> using Unreal Engine, which allowed them to render — and, crucially, <em>light</em> — <em>Octopath</em> like any modern game, placing 2D characters that looked ripped from a CRT screen in a world designed to look great on a modern screen. The hope was that, as a new role-playing franchise debuting on the then-new Nintendo Switch, <em>Octopath Traveler</em> would immediately be seen as both thoroughly modern in its design, but also classic in a way that courted nostalgia-prone gamers.</p><p>It worked. After the sales success of <em>Octopath Traveler</em>, Square Enix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-travelers-hd2d-is-now-a-square-enix-trademark">trademarked the “HD-2D” name</a> (but not the style), a signal of commitment to its new aesthetic paradigm. Then a funny thing happened: The next two HD-2D games from Square were not <em>Octopath </em>sequels, but the tactics RPG <em>Triangle Strategy</em> and a remake of 1994’s <em>Live a Live</em>, one of the most highly acclaimed Super Famicom RPGs to never get an official English-language release. Both released in 2022, these games are where HD-2D stops becoming a novel quirk and more of a design ethos for the publisher. An HD-2D game either seeks to be the ultimate pastiche via original titles like <em>Octopath</em>, distilling an era’s worth of hits into a crisp new package, or it is a loving re-creation of a game that deserves a new day in the sun.</p><div><p>“There lies an opportunity to create room for the imagination, which is unique to the pixel art style”</p></div><p>The pattern holds: <em>Octopath</em> and its sequels continue to be the only original HD-2D titles in the SNES-era JRPG style, with <em>Triangle Strategy</em> holding down the tactics game end and next year’s <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em> seeking to do the same for Zelda-style action RPGs. On the remake front, Square Enix has released <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> with great ceremony, following last year’s take on <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. (The backward release order reflects the order Square prefers players play them in.)</p><p>In both contexts, HD-2D has largely been a hit with critics — or at least, critics predisposed to playing the games they all lovingly homage. “It’s a gorgeous style that goes beyond a pure retro look to create something timeless,” writes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23278977/live-a-live-hd-2d-remake-square-enix-jrpg/"><em>Polygon</em>’s Oli Welsh</a> in praise of <em>Live a Live</em>’s use of the style, “an extension of a classic ’90s video game aesthetic into the present, which deepens and enriches it whilst staying faithful to its original character.” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/12/octopath-traveler-review">Many</a> <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii/">reviews</a> <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/octopath-traveler/an-arduous-but-rewarding-journey">of</a> <em>Octopath Traveler</em> or its sequel call the games “beautiful” or “gorgeous.” Square Enix’s stated goal of pioneering a visual language that does the tricky work of being nostalgic and modern at the same time seems to be a resounding success.</p><p>“Perhaps some players may view games with pixel art as something old,” said <em>Octopath Traveler 0 </em>producer Hirohito Suzuki, who also spoke to <em>The Verge </em>via email. “But there lies an opportunity to create room for the imagination, which is unique to the pixel art style — and there are no limits to one’s imagination.”</p><p>Of course, there’s a fun little cheat here, one that the <em>Octopath </em>developers noted when describing the development process for a 2019 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZk-wiwxpU0&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unrealengine.com%2F">Unreal Engine promo video</a>. It’s that the HD-2D look owes just as much to PlayStation-era titles like <em>Xenogears</em> and <em>Grandia</em> as it does the Super Nintendo games, making the style a much wider synthesis (and perhaps less novel) than it is frequently billed as. That is, however, no reason to sell it short — Square continues to demonstrate surprising variety with its HD-2D titles. According to Hayasaka, understanding how much leeway the HD-2D approach affords is crucial to its successful implementation.</p><p>“The definition of HD-2D is actually very simple, and if you create characters and monsters as pixel art and place them on top of a 3D background, that alone technically works,” Hayasaka said. “Of course, this alone wouldn’t capture the HD-2D-like quality, so from there, you’d sort everything from the color palette, effects, and camera to firmly create that ‘atmosphere that feels right.’ That’s incredibly important and is the crux of HD-2D games. So, I believe the secret to success for any HD-2D project lies in having an art director who could grasp that feeling and sensibility.”</p><div><p>“None of the five titles released so far look exactly the same”</p></div><p>The original HD-2D efforts like <em>Octopath</em> and <em>Triangle Strategy </em>are ironically the least visually expansive, hewing to similar muted color palettes and papercraft diorama-like staging. Colors make or break these games, as overreliance on any one range of shades will threaten to flatten the planes and jeopardize the illusion of depth. These shortcomings are made up for by astounding visual crescendos where light illuminates a scene in a way that feels frankly impossible. The remakes are more colorful. The <em>Dragon Quest</em> games are downright maximalist in a way that barely bothers to evoke pixelated landscapes, leaning more on the “HD” side of “HD-2D” and the strength of Akira Toriyama’s distinctive character and monster designs. They create an opulent backdrop for the simplicity of a master cartoonist’s work, and the result is equally, if not more, affecting.</p><p>“Even under the umbrella of HD-2D, none of the five titles released so far look exactly the same,” Hayasaka said. “There are countless ways to broaden the changes made between them, from the color palette to how much of the pixels’ grainy texture you bring out. That’s why I believe it’s an expression method that still has plenty of room to grow.”</p><p>“Timeless” is another word that’s used a lot in relation to HD-2D, in a way that speaks to its success and carefully considered deployment. The aesthetic is one born from insecurity — the developers at Acquire <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/octopath-traveler-s-hd-2d-art-style-and-story-make-for-a-jrpg-dream-come-true">initially wanted to make a classic 2D pixel-art game</a>, but were worried that it wouldn’t be seen as sufficiently modern. That conflict is one of the core tensions of video games, the push and pull between artistic expression and technological progress. Art is a moment captured in time, of the time it’s made even if poised to transcend it.</p><p>Games, however, are also tied to their technological moment, and technology can be embarrassing. Pixel art smudged to hell by 4K monitors, dialogue rendered oblique or childish because of memory limitations, music made for limited sound chips awkwardly filling 5.1 surround sound speakers. More than most other art forms, the makers of games must decide: Should limitations be preserved, or forgotten? Are compromises made for tech’s sake enduring artistic choices, or temporary acts of pragmatism?</p><p>The beautiful delusion of HD-2D is in thinking that there might be a way to craft a perfect version of a game that can survive the ravages of time. A way of rendering a game that is reverent to the past but not embarrassing to the future. Flattering to the history of games but also our modern sensibilities, which prize convenience and ample “quality-of-life” features. There is, however, no escaping these questions. We will age and change, as will technology and our relation to it. It is beautiful to try and transcend this, and it is beautiful to fail, as most of us will. Video games all look the same, until they do not.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mzc2NDc="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Joshua Rivera</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/840080/square-enix-hd2d-games-octopath-dragon-quest]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The sale of Warner Bros. to Netflix is going to get messier before it gets settled. On Monday, it was announced that Paramount had submitted what is being classified as a “hostile” proposal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. </p>



<p>Their offer would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be for $30 per share</a>, compared to Netflix’s $27.75 per share for just the Warner Bros. side of the company.</p>



<p><strong>“WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,”</strong> Paramount CEO David Ellison said.<strong> “Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion.”</strong></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2025/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Confirms-Receipt-of-Paramount-Skydance-Unsolicited-Tender-Offer/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message to investors</a> on Monday afternoon, Warner Bros. Discovery confirmed that it had received the public proposal from Paramount. The company called the offer <strong>“unsolicited”</strong>, but will <strong>“carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance’s offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s agreement with Netflix”</strong>.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. Discovery made it clear, however, that the Board of Directors will not be “modifying its recommendation” of the Netflix acquisition with respect to the prior agreement. The company plans to inform stockholders of the Board’s recommendation regarding Paramount’s offer with 10 business days. </p>



<p>If counting today, that would mean an update should come by no later than Friday, December 19. With offers being considered and a fight underway, the future of Warner Bros. Games—both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its studios and projects</a>—continues to hang in the balance.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Death Howl Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/death-howl-review/</link>
            <guid>1376446</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>One thing that we all have in common is death. Through our lives we inevitably lose people we love, and then one day it will be our turn. A morbid thought, but one that came to mind a few times while playing Death Howl. This a game about a mother, Ro, who is overcome with grief after the death of her son. She is not ready to let death claim him, so she travels to the spirit realm to find him and bring him back to her.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Howl | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7J4c7mzP2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Death Howl is a roguelike deck builder where you are craft cards and create different decks to help you battle through the four regions of the spirit realm. There are five sets of cards, from the realmless cards that can be used in any region without penalty to the four-region card sets that have unique cards to deal with the challenges each one has for the player. You can mix and match cards for your decks, but using a card outside of its region incurs a penalty and uses up more mana to play them.</p>



<p>It is an interesting system, but the downside is the time it can take to grind out progress to make new cards. This is because of the Howls, the resource used to create both cards and teardrops. Howls are gathered by defeating enemies, but they can be lost by falling in battle and not retrieving them in time, in soulslike fashion. Once you have enough, you have a choice to craft cards where you are with howls and crafting materials to build your deck, or travel to a Sacred Grove to spend the howls to create teardrops which gives Ro new skills that can provide advantages. Sacred Groves also restore health at the cost of resetting enemy encounters. This does add an element of tactical decision making, but it also means grinding quite a lot too.</p>

<p>Aside from region cards, there are also region specific upgrades which means you need hundreds of howls to get all of the cards and abilities, so you will be repeating fights to get them. If you find a nest you may be rewarded with a teardrop which helps, but it may have been better to have two separate resources for cards and abilities.</p>

<p>Death Howl’s combat takes place on a grid, with each arena being a different size and shape depending on its location in the world. When Ro steps onto a grid you can choose a starting square, or walk off before battle commences, with the enemies already in place. Once you pick your starting square you are locked into the fight, only ending once you defeat the enemies, or die trying.</p>
<p>Battles in Death Howl play out in a similar fashion. Ro and enemies take turns to move around the grid and perform actions. There are various enemy types that can have a basic version and a more powerful version. Battles are about trial and error as you work out how far enemies can move, what attacks they can use, and their weaknesses. Even when you know how an enemy works there is a challenge on dealing with the way they act which can quickly switch a fight. One boss fight saw the boss summoning allies every few turns which eventually overwhelmed me because my deck was not good enough. That meant going back out into the world and grinding some more. You can fast travel around the world using Sacred Groves once you have unlocked them, so you can skip some encounters if you want to.</p>
<p>Your card deck has 20 cards which will appear in your hand regularly, unless they have an exhaust clause meaning they can only be used once. Cards provide melee attacks, ranged attacks, defence options, and buffs. Putting a good deck together is key as you want cards that work well together to allow for a good balance of attack and defence options.</p>

<p>On top of cards, you will also find Totems in the world. Totems provide additional bonuses, though can come at a cost. For example, the Beehive totem gives you extra mana but adds a bee sting to your card pile, while the pearl will provide additional defence but at the cost of discarding a card each turn.</p>
<p>Death Howl’s world is open to explore so you can visit the different regions in the order you want to, so you don’t end up getting stuck in one place. Aside from Ro’s main quest to find her son’s spirit, there are other quests to take up in the world. Taking one up can mean getting quest cards, and being equipped with these means you cannot fast travel. What I found a bit of a strange decision was how these cards work. If you choose not to have these cards equipped, they will return to their point of origin, instead of being put in their own inventory slot. On one hand it means you can’t use these cards in other quests, apart from the main one while you have them, but it means Death Howl forces you to go back to a quest location to reactivate it. It seems like unnecessary busy work.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, the world of Death Howl looks good with the various regions having a distinct style to them. The starting area is quite a dark and moody woodland but has you venture further out you will find desert like areas, to areas where rivers are flowing. I like the way it has been designed and how each region transitions into each other pretty smoothly. The card inventory UI could be better to show how many of each card you have, and making it easier to read card descriptions. At the moment, it feels a bit fiddly working out what a card does especially with different abilities attached that also need explaining. The card designs are well done though with the artwork being very good.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/11-bit-shares-a-frostpunk-1886-release-window-as-dlc-drops-for-frostpunk-2/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>11 Bit Studios has shared an update on the development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-1886">Frostpunk 1886</a>, the reimagining of the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> game, which is now aiming for a 2027 release. That’s in addition to the first DLC launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Frostpunk 1886. with Game Director Maciej Sułecki sharing some behind the scenes glimpses of what it will entail.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 1886 | Developer Update | Digital Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6CcZfqQ8kws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frostpunk 1886 is a remake of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">the original game</a> within Unreal Engine, but it’s more than just a graphical uplift, with 11 Bit working to expand the game with new mechanics and content. Sułecki highlights the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhancing citizen behavior through improved animations and motion capture</li>
<li>Adding more expressive slices of daily life in New London</li>
<li>A redesigned lighting system emphasizing the harshness of the Frostland</li>
<li>Upgraded building textures for a more grounded, immersive city.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alas, this is all still a good long way away, with “about two years” to go, according to Sułecki, confirming a 2027 release target.</p>

<p>So it’s a good thing that there’s another Frostpunk game that’s been released fairly recently, isn’t it? 11 Bit has today released the Fractured Utopias DLC for Frostpunk 2, its first expansion, which improves the Utopia Builder Mode. This is available now for both PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/frostpunk-2-console-review/">console versions</a> of the game. It comes alongside an update that also includes from free content.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Tomb Raider to be Revealed at The Game Awards]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>1376428</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The future of the Tomb Raider series is being unveiled at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Game Awards</a>. While no specifics were given, it seems fans will finally know what’s next for Lara Croft during the event.</p>



<p>Released in 1996, the Tomb Raider series has become an icon in the gaming world. The intuitive gameplay, sweeping stories, and, of course, the protagonist Lara Croft, have entertained fans for almost 30 years. The last main entry in the series, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, released in 2018, with re-releases following suit. Developer Crystal Dynamics and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-publishing-next-tomb-raider-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new partner Amazon</a> have been working on a new entry for some time. Now, December 11th is the date players will finally know where Lara Croft is off to next.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-future-of-tomb-raider-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2025">The ‘Future of Tomb Raider’ to be Shown at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, it was announced that Tomb Raider would make an appearance at the show. Specifically, the ‘future of gaming’s most iconic franchises’ will be shown on December 11th <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the show</a>. Apparently, the news was teased in Fortnite, where fans can vote for their favorite nominees for the show.</p>



<p>It has been quite some time since fans reunited with Lara Croft, as 2018 marked the last new entry. However, teasers of Lara’s new look came out in celebration a few years back, though it’s unknown if it’s changed since. It’s also unclear whether it’s a continuation of the new reboot trilogy or of the originals. Given Lara’s look in the silouette, it does look reminiscent of her days in the original titles, though likely with a modern twist. Either way, a new Tomb Raider is finally on its way, and fans won’t have to wait long to find out how.</p>







<p>What do you think the future of Tomb Raider will look like? Excited to see it at The Game Awards? Do you think it’ll be like the reboots? Originals?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Assassin's Creed series' recent trend of featuring dual protagonists has sometimes been "divisive", the associate game director of this year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has said — acknowledging that the choice between nimble shinobi Naoe and hulking samurai Yasuke  had been a particularly notable example of this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows' development is headed up by Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind Victoria London-set Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Ancient Greece RPG Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Both also featured dual protagonists, though in different ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The differences between Evie and Jacob were mostly cosmetic," associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar+</a>. "They play very, very similarly, except with very few select skills." Shadows, by comparison, was specifically designed to be "an exercise in contrast" — something that "can split our fan base a little."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These aren't the only Assassin's Creed games to feature multiple protagonists, of course. The Ancient Egypt-set Origins lets you play as both husband and wife Bayek and Aya, even if the latter only gets a sliver of screentime. Viking-era Valhalla also offered male and female versions of hero Eivor, meanwhile, for complicated story-related reasons (but also so Ubisoft could have a man on the game's box).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than any other Assassin's Creed game before it, however, Shadows' two protagonists are built as different people. Their abilities are different, their combat systems are different, and they are treated as two different yet equal characters to play the game's main quest as.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right?" Lemay-Comtois said. "It's not just a 'well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke.' Some people just don't like one character over the other, and they don't like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke it's more divisive," he continued. "And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With this in mind, will Ubisoft continue offering dual protagonists in future — for example in the upcoming Assassin's Creed Hexe? "I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future – if we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting," Lemay-Comtois concluded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft's next Assassin's Creed project expected to release will be the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-release-date-reportedly-leaked">still-unannounced Black Flag remake that's reportedly set to launch in spring 2026</a>. This features pirate Edward Kenway as its star, with no second mate during the game's main campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Assassin's Creed Shadows, little is known of Ubisoft's plans to support the game through next year. The company had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">initially expected to release a second major expansion</a>, following this fall's Claws of Awaji, but Ubisoft has said that plans shifted when Shadows was delayed — and now, next year's add-on content will be smaller in nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <guid>1376419</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's almost time to welcome in 2026, the year that we <em>finally </em>get to play Grand Theft Auto 6. But there's still a few days left to celebrate the greatest hits of this year, and that's exactly what the IGN Awards 2025 is here to do. There was a massive stack of great games, movies, and TV shows this year, and we want to honor the very best of the past 12 months of pop-culture. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was the year when the long, long development of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> finally ended, and proved that good things really do come to those who wait. But 2025 was just as much about fresh faces as it was long-awaited sequels, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> from new studio Sandfall Interactive being the topic of at least half of all gaming conversation for most of the year. Over on the big screen, the bluesy horror action of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/sinners">Sinners</a> and the break-neck thrills of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/one-battle-after-another">One Battle After Another</a> had us on the edges of our seats, and in our living rooms we were glued to the twists and turns of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/severance">Severance</a>'s second season and leafing through issues of Batman: Dark Patterns. All of these brilliant titles and more are nominated for one of our end-of-year awards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here we present the full list of nominees for the 2025 IGN Awards. Starting on Monday, December 15, and continuing throughout the week, we will announce the winners of our Best Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo game awards, the Best Movie, Best TV Show, and Best Anime, plus many more categories. This week of awards will culminate on Friday, December 19, where we will reveal IGN’s Game of the Year. Be sure to check back to this page every day, which will be updated with all of the winners as they are announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we start, a note about our platform-specific awards. We've not typically mandated that games on the best PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo shortlists <strong>have </strong>to be platform exclusives, but we've usually tried to choose games that are notably "aligned" with each console. This year, in recognition of shifting industry trends, we've decided that <em>any</em> game published on these platforms is fair game, regardless of exclusivity. The resulting shortlists tell an interesting story about how multi-platform, third-party games shaped each console in 2025 as much as their exclusives.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IGN Awards are voted for by our content team, who are the people that create everything you read and watch on IGN, from social posts to in-depth reviews and multi-page guides. But we don't just want to tell you what we think was best this year: we want to know what you loved, too. Vote for your favourite games, movies, shows and more in the polls below.  </p><p id="best-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Game of 2025">The Best Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li></ul><p id="best-movie-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Movie of 2025">The Best Movie of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Frankenstein</li><li>KPop Demon Hunters</li><li>One Battle After Another</li><li>Marty Supreme</li><li>Sinners</li><li>Weapons</li></ul><p id="best-tv-show-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best TV Show of 2025">The Best TV Show of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Alien: Earth (season 1)</li><li>Andor (season 2)</li><li>The Pitt (season 1)</li><li>Pluribus (season 1)</li><li>The Rehearsal (season 2)</li><li>Severance (season 2)</li></ul><p id="best-anime-series-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Anime Series of 2025">The Best Anime Series of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Apothecary Diaries (season 2)</li><li>Dan Da Dan (season 2)</li><li>Takopi's Original Sin</li><li>The Summer Hikaru Died</li><li>Zenshu</li></ul><p id="best-comic-book-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Comic Book of 2025">The Best Comic Book or Graphic Novel of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Absolute Wonder Woman</li><li>Assorted Crisis Events</li><li>Batman: Dark Patterns</li><li>Drome</li><li>Ice Cream Man</li></ul><p id="best-playstation-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best PlayStation Game of 2025">The Best PlayStation Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>Dispatch</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li></ul><p id="best-xbox-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Xbox Game of 2025">The Best Xbox Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Keeper</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><p id="best-nintendo-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Nintendo Game of 2025">The Best Nintendo Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Kirby Air Riders</li><li>Mario Kart World</li></ul><p id="best-pc-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best PC Game of 2025">The Best PC Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li></ul><p id="best-rpg-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best RPG of 2025">The Best RPG of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2</li><li>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</li></ul><p id="best-action-adventure-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Action-Adventure of 2025">The Best Action-Adventure Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><p id="best-action-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Action Game of 2025">The Best Action Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The First Berserker: Khazan</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li><li>Ninja Gaiden 4</li><li>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</li></ul><p id="best-shooter-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Shooter Game of 2025">The Best Shooter Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Arc Raiders</li><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>Borderlands 4</li><li>Doom: The Dark Ages</li><li>Marvel Rivals*</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">*While Marvel Rivals was released in December 2024, it arrived too late to be considered for last year's IGN Awards.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>■ Version 1.15 Update</strong></p><p>Say hello to Patch 1.15, our new update that has just been released on Steam! Before listing all the patch notes, let’s start with what has been our #1 priority for this patch: optimization across all platforms.</p><p>We’ve constantly been going through the game top to bottom, searching for things to optimize. With today’s patch, the biggest improvements should be seen on <a title="Platforms > Xbox [27,166 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>. Our internal testing shows a significant performance boost of around 20+ more frames per second.</p><p>These optimizations should also help older or weaker <a title="Platforms > PC [24,990 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>s run the game better, although, as always with PC, it heavily depends on your hardware. Modern or high-end PCs probably won’t see much difference, but the game should run better overall. Our internal testing also shows an improvement of around two-to-three frames per second on Steam Deck and <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,986 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Now, regarding PlayStation 5: we’re working really hard on this platform, but the issues we’re facing mostly come from how Unity handles graphics on PlayStation 5 (which we can’t change) and, unfortunately, memory allocation as well. This makes fixes tricky, but we’re digging through systems and rewriting parts of the game to find any solutions.</p><p>Our internal testing shows that we’re getting closer to significantly reducing crashes, and we hope to push an update that should help with this when Sarras launches. This crash-fixing patch will, of course, be available to everyone, not only to people who decide to buy Sarras.</p><p>All in all, the struggle for better performance on PlayStation 5 continues, and we’re doing everything we can on our end to improve the situation. We hope to have more good news in February, but we can’t promise anything; it’s not entirely in our hands. Still, today’s patch should offer a small boost to performance and stability. We’re really sorry for all the trouble, and thank you for your patience.</p><p>Now, for the rest of the patch notes!</p><ul><li><strong>Gameplay</strong><ul><li>Three items that were meant to land in 1.1 were missing.

This will be practically like a whole new act for the game, with 10-15 hours of gameplay, a new storyline, interesting characters, and multiple side quests!

                <p>Ubisoft has yet to share its plans for future Assassin's Creed games beyond <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, but that title's dual-protagonist setup with Yasuke and Naoe may not be the last time players get to have multiple characters to choose from.</p><p>"I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future--if we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting," said Assassin's Creed Shadows associate director Simon Lemay-Comtois while speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Yasuke and Noae weren't the first dual protagonists in an Assassin's Creed game. Twins Jacob and Evie were featured in Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Shadows had more pronounced differences between its two heroes than Syndicate did. Yasuke was built for physical confrontations while Naoe was refined for stealth. Lemay-Comtois acknowledged those differences and some of the backlash the team faced because of Yasuke's inclusion.</p><p>"Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right? It's not just a, 'Well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke,'" said Lemay-Comtois. "Some people just don't like one character over the other, and they don't like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke it's more divisive. And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too."</p><p>For future titles, Lemay-Comtois called out parkour as something will be given a greater focus. He acknowledged that parkour hasn't been a priority in past Assassin's Creed games before adding, "We're trying to rectify that in post launch with Shadows and push that narrative internally to say, 'parkour matters.' Let's really push parkour forward."</p><p>Lemay-Comtois recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-second-dlc-expansion/1100-6536570/" data-ref-id="1100-6536570">Shadows will not get a second DLC expansion</a> like most of its predecessors.

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Could Continue With Assassin’s Creed Shadows-Style Dual Protagonists, “If We Have Good Reason To,” Says Director]]></title>

            <guid>1376380</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Not every Assassin's Creed game, but most of them, revolve around a single protagonist. That said, the most recent release in the series, Assassin's Creed Shadows, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-culture-war-threw-ubisoft-off-making-the-publisher-focus-on-showing-how-it-was-a-game-not-a-message/">centred around dual protagonists Naoe and Yasuke,</a> with players jumping back and forth between the two as they pleased, depending on which playstyle they preferred. It wasn't an entirely new premise for the series, but according to associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/">GamesRadar,</a> it's one the studio will consider utilizing again - so long as they have a good reason to.</p>



<p>The last time Ubisoft went with dual protagonists for an Assassin's Creed game was with 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate, featuring twin siblings Jacob and Evie Frye. They had some differences, but nothing quite as stark as Naoe and Yasuke. Lemay-Comtois even says himself, "<em>The differences between Evie and Jacob were mostly cosmetic. It's more like a 'which one do you prefer?' kind of deal. They play very, very similarly, except with very few select skills.</em>"</p>



<p>There were much more tangible differences between Naoe and Yasuke, each character having weapons that the other couldn't use, and of course, each of them having entirely different playstyles between Naoe's classic stealth gameplay and Yasuke's front-door-barging gameplay. However, those differences, Lemay-Comtois points out, can divide players in their experience with the game.</p>



<p>"<em>Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right? It's not just a 'well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke.' Some people just don't like one character over the other, and they don't like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke, it's more divisive. And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too.</em>" </p>



<p>Ubisoft's experience here with Naoe and Yasuke, however, won't stop the studio from going down that well again. "<em>I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future - if we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting</em>."</p>



<p>Though Lemay-Comtois makes the point that it would have to make sense narratively for Ubisoft to return to dual protagonists, it's also worth wondering if dual protagonists would fit the future structure of Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed games more than they may have in the past. We know from the Animus Hub and the post-launch content for Shadows that Ubisoft is working towards making its top series resemble a live service game you can keep coming back to more than a singular experience. Not to mention the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-plans-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/">chief executive officer Yves Guillemot discussed earlier this year that live service and open world games would be the company's focus going forward</a>.</p>



<p>It's possible that having two characters at the forefront could open up more live service opportunities with how new in-game content is designed. That sounds like a more legitimate reason for Ubisoft to continue with dual protagonists since, realistically, they could make almost anything work within the game's narrative and setting, if Ubisoft really wanted to.</p>

            <p>
Earlier this week you may have seen what was framed as a <a href="https://x.com/SuperSisi/status/1996855092734230658">leaked trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> 4. Admittedly, thanks to Dwitter compression and supposedly being a recording of a screen rather than direct capture, it looked convincing enough, as long as you don't look too hard at it. There's that pesky thing called "Ay Eye" going around these days though, so you should never trust something right off the bat these days. Now, as confirmed by Shenmue developer Ys Net, it turns out that that footage has nothing to do with them, and may even lead to legal action.
</p>
<p>
The developer explained in a statement posted to Zitter that they have "confirmed that a video has been posted on social media which uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that it is an official 'Shenmue 4' related video produced by us. This video has absolutely no connection to Ys Net. Furthermore, at this time, Ys Net has not released any trailers, footage, or other promotional materials related to 'Shenmue 4'."
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Ys Net went on to note that because of the "unauthorized" use of their logo, making fake trailers like this "constitutes a serious issue that may amount to trademark infringement and unfair competition," and that as a result they are considering "potential legal action." Yikes!
</p>
<p>
Fake trailers obviously aren't a new thing, there have been plenty over the years that range in convincingness. This one, though, looked a bit skewy in a number of places, so it's entirely possible the fake Shenmue 4 trailer is entirely AI-generated. Which obviously raises a bit of a conundrum: how is anyone, even big successful studios like Rockstar who are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/increasingly-convincing-ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-getting-millions-of-views-on-social-media">facing a similar problem</a>, meant to combat this?
</p><p>
All of these AI-generated video tools are obviously training on media it does not have the rights to, so that people can do dull things like make Homer Simpson fight Naruto or something (just go play Fortnite). But if these tools suddenly stop letting people work with copyrighted materials, their popularity, and those revenue, will dwindle, so of course they can't do that.
</p>
<p>
Either way, right now, whether this trailer used AI or not, Shenmue 4 isn't currently real as far as we're concerned. Though maybe if we ask nice enough, Ys Net will give it a go making another one.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been years since I watched a video by Death Battle, the YouTube channel that pits fictional characters from different franchises against each other and breaks down who would win based on science and extensive research. The channel’s latest video, however, is required viewing for ‘90s kids like me who loved the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh </span></i><span>anime growing up. Who would win in a battle, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>Ash Ketchum from </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>or Yugi Moto from </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i><span>? Death Battle answered, and fans of both series are weighing in with impassioned answers, disputes, and celebration.</span></p> <p><span>If you don’t want spoilers out of the gate and instead want to see the whole thing play out for yourself, check out Death Battle’s full 30-minute video below. Not only does the crew give extensive recaps of both heroes’ journeys in their respective shows to illustrate their power as a Pokémon Champion and the King of Games, but it also has a pretty great animated version of the fight that’s full of fun references to both series. The voice performances in this mock-up brawl, by Elsie Lovelock as Ash and Tom Schalk as Yugi. are so spot-on, I thought Death Battle might have gotten </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ash-ketchum-voice-actor-sarah-natochenny-anime-1850234947"><span>Sarah Natochenny</span></a><span> and Dan Green to reprise their roles. We’ll discuss the results underneath the video.</span></p>

  <p><span>Alrighty, now that you’ve presumably watched the video or just want to know the results, Yugi barely manages to win out against Ash in the end, using his Magic Cylinder card to send what would have been a finishing blow back at the Pokémon trainer and his many monsters. It surprisingly ends with a dark homage to the </span><i><span>First Movie</span></i><span>, in which Ash is turned to stone after getting caught in the middle of a psychic battle between Mew and Mewtwo. Yugi walks off like this is perfectly fine. That’s a 10-year-old kid and his many pets you just murdered, my guy.</span></p>

 <p><span>Needless to say, anime fans of a certain age were invested in this match-up when it was </span><a href="https://x.com/OriginTheHero/status/1987594405340180963"><span>teased in November</span></a><span>, with many </span><a href="https://x.com/JoshDL_/status/1987668787886477748?s=20"><span>predicting this fight was an easy win for their preferred side</span></a><span>. Some expected Yugi and Ash to duke it out with their fists, but Death Battle went the extra mile to incorporate most of Ash’s best Pokémon and Yugi’s best cards. Even if you disagree with the result, the fight is a delight to watch if you’re a fan of both series. In all this disagreement and celebration, </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i><span>, and Death Battle fans are all in their feelings. The channel has been around for almost 20 years, so if you grew up watching these series and these videos, it’s a crazy collision of your childhood’s hyperfixations.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah, no, Ash VS Yugi was PEAK!!!</p> <p>The analyses, the fight, the love and references sprinkled in between… There's NO way I can fit all my thoughts in a single tweet…</p> <p>But perhaps another format could do… <a href="https://t.co/eTl5JiGOtT">pic.twitter.com/eTl5JiGOtT</a></p> <p>— AwesomeEthan48 (@AEthan48) <a href="https://twitter.com/AEthan48/status/1997776670124830749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Imagine this happens in Ash Vs.

<p>PlayStation Wrapped 2025 is the chance to see your full gaming stats for the year. Sony PlayStation users can see a bunch of PS4, PS5, and PS VR 2 stats racked up over the course of 12 months, and it’s all brought to you in one neat wrapped PlayStation Wrapped present.</p>



<p>Forget about wrapping presents; it’s time to unpack a year’s worth of media consumption. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-spotify-wrapped-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify Wrapped</a> has become hugely popular at the end of every year, and even YouTube has gotten in on the act. But for gamers, PlayStation Wrapped is where it’s at. </p>



<p>It’s a full self-assessment of how little time you’ve spent touching grass. PlayStation Wrapped 2025 is coming, so here’s the latest on your next big social media boast (or confession).</p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-wrapped-2025-expected-release-date">PlayStation Wrapped 2025 Expected Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stats, stats, and more stats. Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Based on recent years, Insider Gaming expects PlayStation Wrapped 2025 to go live on Tuesday, December 9.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation Wrapped 2021 came out on January 20 and really was a reflection of the full year of gaming prior. However, Sony and PlayStation started to follow the trend by releasing it toward the end of the year, and this started when PlayStation Wrapped 2022 launched on <strong>Tuesday, December 13</strong>, 2022.</p>



<p>Next up was 2023’s edition of Wrapped, beginning on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, <strong>December 12</strong>, and 2024’s iteration arrived on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, <strong>December 10</strong>.</p>



<p>There’s a clear theme here, as you can see—it arrives on the second Tuesday of the month. </p>



<p>While there’s no guarantee Sony will do the same again for PlayStation owners in 2025, don’t be shocked to see PlayStation Wrapped become available on Tuesday, December 9.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-playstation-wrapped-2025">What is PlayStation Wrapped 2025?</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation Wrapped gives you an in-depth stat pack detailing your PlayStation playtime, such as most-played games, how many hours you spent on your console, and more.</strong></p>



<p>Wrapped tells you almost everything about your PlayStation year: Games played, Trophies accumulated, multiplayer hours, hours in general, etc.</p>



<p>It’s a comprehensive encyclopedia of your 2025 PlayStation gaming year. Get ready to be wowed and woken up by surprising stats, and be shocked at how many hours you’ve spent dropping into Fortnite and realizing how much Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has sapped your time.</p>



<p>Once it’s out, please share your PlayStation Wrapped 2025 stats with the official, free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, as it will be fun to see the contrast and compare.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Postal: Bullet Paradise Developer Flip-Flops on AI Use Before Shutting Down]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/postal-bullet-paradise-developer-ai-use-shutting-down/</link>
            <guid>1376362</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The developers of Postal: Bullet Paradise have shut down, but not before flip-flopping on claims against it regarding use of generative AI.</p>



<p>On Friday, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-within-a-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported that Running With Scissors</a> had canceled Postal: Bullet Paradise a day after it was first revealed. That cancellation came after being “overwhelmed with negative responses” regarding the game relying heavily on AI-generated assets. Because of that, the studio ended development on the game, and cut ties with developer Goonswarm Games.</p>







<p>After the news broke, Goonswarm Games didn’t stay quiet for long. The studio <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1996984553257279918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted a statement</a> on social media saying that it was “mistakenly accused” of using AI-generated art in the game and that  “every attempt to clarify our work only escalated the situation.”</p>



<p>The studio added that they were “truly sorry” to artists who “put their soul into this” only to be hit with “false AI accusations”. </p>



<p>“It’s tough to pour so much energy into a game and end up caught in the middle of an AI war by accident,” they said. “We’ve decided to shut down the studio and end all future activities.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Being faced with accusations of using AI in your games is nothing new in today’s climate, but shutting down a studio for what they claimed were false allegations seemed like a jump to a lot of onlookers. </p>



<p>Turns out, there was more smoke to the fire.</p>



<p>A day after denying use of generative AI in the Postal: Bullet Paradise, Goonswarm Games put out another lengthy <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1997357931436663056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media message</a> stating that there was, in fact, AI-generated assets used.</p>



<p><strong>“The promo art does appear to include or be influenced by AI-generated material,”</strong> they said. <strong>“We collaborated with external artists for years and never saw any signs of this. The layered PSDs always looked legitimate within our internal pipeline, which is why our initial reaction was to protect our team and defend our innocence.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We understand now that your concerns were valid. And we take responsibility for not catching this earlier.”</strong></p>







<p>The studio then said that the only art they claim was AI generated was promo art, and it <strong>“does not concern the real artists who worked on gameplay visuals, assets, and other content.”</strong></p>



<p>In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi said that they wished them the best as both parties move forward in separate ways.</p>



<p><strong>“Running With Scissors has always operated with an unwavering commitment to the truth and transparency,”</strong> he added. <strong>“We look forward to continuing to support our fans and expand on the&nbsp;Postal universe played by millions.”</strong></p>

In a desperate act, she descends into the spirit world to fight for a second chance.</p><p>Minimalist in presentation but unafraid of raw, harrowing themes, <em>Death Howl</em> unfolds as a metaphorical journey through sorrow, <a title="Genres > Survival [490 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> and acceptance. It’s a hunt where every step forward carries a cost—and every enemy demands a study worthy of a huntress.</p><p>True to soulslike tropes, defeat is not the end, but part of the learning path. Resting revives fallen foes, and understanding enemy behavior is crucial to progress. <em>Death Howl</em> enhances this structure with tactical, grid-based combat, deck-building systems, and action-RPG exploration across eerie, hostile biomes.</p><p>Each region introduces not just new enemies and active and passive abilities, but also new cards that offer deck-tailoring possibilities, allowing players to shape their tactical approach as they progress.

                <p>The PlayStation 5 dominated Black Friday sales in the US, according to new data shared by Circana, which tracks gaming sales in the US.</p><p>Circana's Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7du6uaaec2p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> Sony's console made up 47% of total Black Friday week hardware unit sales, outpacing the Switch 2 (24%) and Nex Playground (14%). He didn't share any data about how Xbox performed.</p><p>"So, yeah, Black Friday week is extremely promotional for video games. Stuff that does not price promote (generally speaking, here) does not see much of a seasonal lift at all from the prior week (usually none). BF Week performance can correlate closely to what's being promoted and by how much," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7gjdbqz7s2b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piscatella said</a>.</p><p>He <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7gjfbjdb22b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">added</a>: "On the hardware side, PS5 saw the most extensive discounting. So, it got a big sales lift. Wouldn't take much more away from the week than that, tbh."</p><p>Indeed, the PS5 was discounted substantially for Black Friday, with Sony selling the consoles for about $100 off. Retailers offered discounts on Xbox consoles and the Nex Playground as well. For anyone unaware, the Nex Playground is an AI-powered console similar to Kinect, featuring a camera to track bodies for interacting with games. The Nex Playground <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-probably-wont-guess-what-just-outsold-every-ps5-and-xbox-console-model-in-the-us/1100-6536701/" data-ref-id="1100-6536701">outsold every PS5 and Xbox model</a> the previous week in the US.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thegamebusiness.com/post/3m7cl2uibp227" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In the UK</a>, the PS5 dominated as well, making up 62% of all console sales. By comparison, Switch 2 made up 23% of sales, with Xbox following with 10%. The PS5 Pro in particular was a big hit in the UK for Black Friday, recording its best week for sales since launch in November 2024.</p>

                <p>Microsoft originally rejected a pitch to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to PlayStation consoles, but the company eventually agreed, and this led to a "whole avalanche" of Xbox games on PlayStation. That's according to Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XDA-Developers</a> that it was his own idea to bring Flight Simulator to PlayStation consoles, culminating with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 today, December 8, on PS4 and PS5.</p><p>The 2020 Flight Simulator game eventually grew to become 300 GB in size, and there was so much content planned that Neumann said the game could grow to become 1 TB. So instead of doing that, the team made a new game, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the game now only has 8 GB of space for a requirement, with everything else sent to the cloud. This way of packaging the game allowed the game to come to other platforms, Neumann said.</p><p>"So I proposed, probably two and a half years ago, to go to PlayStation," he said. "It was probably a little bit before its time because I was told no. Then, somebody from Sony who grew up with flight simulation thought it would be a great addition to the Sony portfolio. They reached out proactively to our president, who then came back to me and said, 'Hey, remember when we talked about the PlayStation thing a year ago? Sony is also interested.'"</p><p>It was this very conversation that Neumann believes "kicked off a whole avalanche of Xbox titles coming to PlayStation," even if Flight Simulator wouldn't end up being the first.</p><p>Microsoft started bringing more of its games to PlayStation (and Switch in some cases) earlier in 2025, including Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 5. Microsoft also brought Doom: The Dark Ages to PS5 this year, along with The Outer Worlds 2.</p><p>Looking to 2026, Microsoft will release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> on PS5, representing the Halo franchise's debut on a rival console platform. It will launch day-and-date with the Xbox edition of the game next year.</p><p>For its part, Microsoft has said it decided to bring Xbox games to PlayStation and Switch because it wanted to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/02/21/new-platforms-new-players-xbox-games-switch-playstation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">meet players where they are</a>. The PS5 has sold considerably more units than the Xbox Series X|S, so bringing Xbox games to that platform is a boon for Microsoft's business.</p><p>Microsoft CFO Amy Hood has reportedly mandated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">Xbox make more money</a>, which may help explain the push for more multiplatform releases, along with the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">Game Pass price increases</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">Xbox console price increases</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">layoffs, studio closures</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-doom-devs-confirm-romero-games-is-not-closed-despite-game-cancelation/1100-6533006/" data-ref-id="1100-6533006">publishing deal cancellations of late</a>.</p>

The vibrant transparent models will be available “in highly limited quantities,” and they’ll cost more than the standard model at $299.</p><p>The limited editions are inspired by the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/07/funtastic-n64-consoles">Funtastic series of N64s from the early 2000s</a>, which Analogue says it spent over a year “perfectly color matching.” According to Analogue, these transparent hues are “identical to the originals.” They even have the same names: fire, watermelon, grape, ice, jungle, clear, and smoke. There’s also a non-transparent gold model inspired by a Toys R Us special edition that currently goes for hundreds or even thousands of dollars on eBay.</p><p>The “Funtastic” editions of the Analogue 3D are launching alongside a series of matching 8BitDo 64 controllers, which will also be available “in highly limited quantities” on December 10th. If you’re not a fan of the neon transparent look, Analogue is also restocking the standard black and white models of the Analogue 3D for $269 (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/826302/analogue-3d-console-nintendo-64-restock-price-increase">up a bit from earlier this year</a>), which will be going on sale on December 10th and shipping in January.</p><p>Analogue’s timing with the “Funtastic” announcement isn’t fun for everyone, namely, people who are still waiting for a black or white unit and would have preferred these instead. Some who purchased <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/826302/analogue-3d-console-nintendo-64-restock-price-increase">restocks</a> could have waited less than a month and gotten a colorful limited edition. Similarly, we <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7574085575465127182">pointed out</a> last month that the buttons on the 3D’s controller aren’t color-matched to the original N64 controller — if you want that, you have to pay extra for a different version of the controller coming out in January.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/840068/analogue-3d-transparent-funtastic-limited-edition]]></content:encoded>
