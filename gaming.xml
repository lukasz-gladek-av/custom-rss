			<p>Although very little is known about <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-announced/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a></em></strong> other than that it is in the works and it is coming out at some point, the community is obviously excited about the next entry in the series. However, as it's already been almost 15 years since the launch of the celebrated <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, expectations are incredibly high, so much so that they have put the game in a <em>"no-win"</em> situation, according to a former Bethesda employee.</p>



<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://esportsinsider.com/2026/01/nate-purkeypile-world-builder-skyrim-fallout-interview">Esports Insider</a></strong>, former <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda Lead Artist&nbsp;Nate Purkeypile</strong>,&nbsp;who worked on&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3,&nbsp;4,&nbsp;76,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Skyrim</em>, commented on the next entry in the series and the challenges it is already facing during development. Expectations for both the game and Fallout 5 (which is <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care-fallout-new-vegas-lead-chris-avellone-comments-on-series-direction/">unlikely to return to the series' roots</a></strong>, according to Fallout New Vegas lead developer Chris Avellone) are very high, and Purkeypile believes they have put both games in a <em>"no-win"</em> situation, alongside Skyrim being widely considered as one of the best games of all time.</p>



<p><em>"How do you beat that?"</em> he said. <em>"And I hope it’s a great game, but even if it’s just as good as Skyrim was, you’ll still get so many people throwing out hateful comments. I’m sure there will be more death threats again. All of that stuff. It’s really unfortunate that that’s the way things have gone,"</em> <strong>Purkeypile</strong> continued.</p>



<p>The massive fan expectations are putting major pressure on <strong><em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em></strong>, and, according to <strong>Purkeypile</strong>, <strong>Bethesda</strong> will take all the time needed to deliver the best possible game. <em>"I think there is less economic pressure to just get Elder Scrolls VI out on a date, but there is more economic pressure to actually make sure it’s good, and I think that’s a good thing. That’s healthy so long as they’re also honest with the team about that,"</em> the former <strong>Bethesda</strong> lead artist elaborated.</p>



<p>The long time it's taking for the game to launch, however, has nothing to do with waiting to see <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a></em>'s</strong> reception. <em>"I’m sure there’s plenty of audience overlap and all, but just because one game flops doesn’t mean another will necessarily. There can be a whole bunch of reasons that happen."</em></p>



<p>Although a slightly different game, there's no denying that the reception <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em> received when it launched in 2023</strong></a>, which hasn't really improved over time with the release of free updates and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space expansion</a></strong>, could definitely be putting more pressure on the development team to deliver the best possible RPG, and the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-ultimate-fantasy/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"ultimate fantasy simulator"</strong></a></em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Todd Howard</strong> himself teased last year.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-3-0-update-prep-restart-island-resetti-2000658987</link>
            <guid>1404373</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It wasn’t April Fool’s Day when Nintendo announced a big, new update for </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>—but mid-20s programmer Lemmy still thought it was a joke. His girlfriend sent him a link on Instagram, and he thought it was a fake announcement. He went straight to the source: Nintendo, where he realized that yes, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118"><span>Nintendo </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> releasing a new update for the five-year-old game</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Nintendo’s 3.0 update and Switch 2 upgrade for </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>will be released on January 15, the first big update to the game since 2021. </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> is far from a dead game, but its massive playerbase—which swelled during the COVID-19 pandemic—has, naturally, fell off. Those of us who spent hundreds of hours on our </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> islands for a year and a half have moved on; many of us haven’t visited our islands since. We’ve left messes on our islands, and remain forever indebted to Tom Nook. With the economy inevitably stalling after we took our “go get ‘em!” industriousness with us, the villagers we left behind have spent the last couple of years fending for themselves.</span></p>

 <p><span>“[My girlfriend and I] played </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> when it released and then I pretty much played it every day for a year, and maybe a little less often for another six months,” Lemmy said. “I think I fully stopped playing it summer 2023.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The new content and quality-of-life improvements it introduces make Nintendo’s 3.0 update the push many players needed to return to the game. But that raises a big question: To nuke or not to nuke? For some players, like Lemmy, the </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> 3.0 update was the perfect excuse not only to return to the game, but also to make a fresh start. “When I saw and heard about the update it persuaded me to restart,” he said. “I did that just before the new year.”</span></p>

  <p><span>Morri Koester, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf8BqWN05p7W_TOoFB7d9oA">a YouTube creator</a> who has played</span><i><span>&nbsp;New Horizons</span></i><span> for more than 5,000 hours and built a dozen or so islands, told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> that they aren’t making a new island, but are still using the new update “as an excuse to do things differently”—”new year, new me sort of vibes,” they said. Koester has been working on their current island for two years at this point, and unlocked nearly all of the DIYs and catalogue items. The big reason they’re not doing more to totally overhaul their island or start anew is because the 3.0 update has a feature that’ll essentially do that itself—Resetti. Resetti’s Reset Service is a quality-of-life feature intended to clear up big swaths of an island; it’ll remove flowers, decorations, and fencing from a specific area. (Everything, including flowers, shrubs, and trees, will go straight into inventory.)&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“My island is a mess because I refuse to do the man’s work for him, but I can’t wait to see that mess just poof into a blank canvas to start my new island theme,” Koester said.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of completely restarting, Koester spent the time between the 3.0 announcement and the update’s release day working on a series of different goals—primarily, prepping to complete the Nook Miles goals they set for themself. The 3.0 update’s bulk crafting mechanic, which lets players craft in bulk straight from their inventory, means it’ll be easier to finish some of the harder Nook Miles tasks. One of the Nook Miles challenges that’s notoriously hard to complete is crafting 3,000 furniture items. Koester is looking to reach this goal in a day when the update is released; they’re collecting coconuts so they can craft nearly a thousand Coconut Juices—a furniture item in </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>, which requires only coconuts to craft—in a day.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I know everyone has a specific opinion or strategy for preparing for the update, whether it’s cataloguing items or gathering resources, but my personal opinion is to prepare for what is going to give you the most joy in the game,” Koester said. “If that means restarting your island on update day to get the full 3.0 experience on a new island, do that. If that means cleaning out your inventory on your five-year-old forever island, do that! If that means collecting a crapton of coconuts like an obsessive gaming gremlin, do that. Prep is all in the mindset, not in specific gameplay.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Lemmy, meanwhile, has spent the time between the update announcement and January 15 working through the early hours of any new island—opening the museum, saving resources.</span></p> <p><span>“I just wanted a fresh start, especially to experience some of the changes and the DLC with a clean canvas, making use of the new items and features without ripping everything up first,” he told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “My preparation is kind of just that—restarting. But also I’m just saving resources, not worrying about decorating my island or anything yet, and just progressing through the early parts of the game with as little planning as I can.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000659000" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659000"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659000">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Players that are restarting don’t have to go it alone, though: Lots of players on social media and forums are offering to help support players looking to start over. “I’ve been going on and off mystery islands to collect materials for restart care packages,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1pqbpn7/comment/nut7toc/"><span>one person on Reddit wrote</span></a><span>. There’s no right or wrong way to experience a new update, but some players, indeed, do feel pressure to do things the “right” way; lots of players have spent a lot of time on their islands, perfecting every little detail, or rushing to gobble up all the new content.</span></p>

 <p><span>But Koester wants to remind players that even the most seasoned players, like them, don’t necessarily feel prepared.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s a big change to the game, with new mechanics, new buildings, new NPCs, and new items,” they said. “Seasoned and new players alike will experience it at the same time for the first time, which in itself is a pretty magical feeling to share. If you’re worried, just know that everyone is going through the ‘new’ feeling, and take it slow. Not everything has to be experienced at once. So no matter what, whether you’re starting a new island, had your island for years, stopped playing for a time, there is no being late to experiencing joy. You’re fashionably on time.”</span></p>

<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is now available to play in full on PC following release, and symptoms are a crucial mechanic that can make or break your playthrough.</p>



<p>Available on PC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quarantine-zone-the-last-check-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including with a Game Pass subscription</a>, Quarantine Zone: The Last Check puts you in charge of the entry of survivors into a camp during a zombie apocalypse, and it’s down to you to decide whether a survivor is showing signs of being infected.</p>



<p>Remembering all the symptoms can be tricky, but Insider Gaming is here to help with a breakdown on what survivors can show, and the action you should take as a result.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-symptoms-in-quarantine-zone-the-last-check">All Symptoms in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Check them out. Image via Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Symptoms in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check are a crucial stage of the game, and processing a survivor incorrectly can quickly lead to disaster, so it’s important to know what each symptom indicates.</strong></p>



<p>You can uncover symptoms by using a variety of tools that are at your disposal, though you won’t have access to all of these immediately upon entering the game, as others are unlocked through progression.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the symptoms available in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, and the action you should take with those displaying them.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Symptom</th><th data-align="center">Survivor Status</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Yellow Eyes</td><td data-align="center">Good to Go</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Freckles</td><td data-align="center">Good to Go</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bruises</td><td data-align="center">Good to Go</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Conjuctivitis</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">37 to 41 Degrees</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">120 to 180 Pulse</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hyper Reflex</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sneezing</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hiccups</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Coughing</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sick Breath</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Necrosis</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bite Mark</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Red Eyes</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Above 41 Degrees</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Above 180 Pulse</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Cross Reflex</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-deal-with-symptoms-in-quarantine-zone-the-last-check">How to Deal With Symptoms in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</h2>



<p><strong>There are three approaches to dealing with survivors in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check. You can either allow them to pass, send them to quarantine, or deny their entry.</strong></p>



<p>The correct choice is uncovered by discovering the symptoms a survivor is showing, highlighting whether they’re safe to pass or risk spreading an infection. If an infection is confirmed, entry should be denied, and if it’s suspected, but not guaranteed, the safe choice is to send them to quarantine.</p>



<p>Here’s an easy breakdown of what to do with each survivor based on the symptoms they show.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Good to Go: </strong>Safe to allow the survivor to pass through the checkpoint.</li>



<li><strong>Possibly Infected: </strong>Send the survivor to quarantine to monitor their symptoms further.</li>



<li><strong>Infected: </strong>Deny entry. </li>
</ul>

                <p>When single developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone officially released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> in 2016, the farm-life sim wasn't intended to have any voiceovers. That hasn't stopped a dedicated fan from creating a Stardew Valley mod that adds vocal performances to the game.</p><p>Voice actress and software engineer Shannon Hobby released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22550?tab=description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Stardew Valley voice over mod</a> as a proof of concept in 2024. But this week, Hobby has updated the mod with vocal performances for all of the romanceable characters in the game. Hobby's intent is give every character in the game a voice, but it's still a work in progress.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1f9o67Y5dM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z1f9o67Y5dM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I'm a voice actor and software engineer and I've combine these skills to make something wonderful for a game that I really care about that's super important to me and I know is important to a lot of people," said Hobby in her initial announcement video. "I think this was a perfect opportunity to combine those skill sets and make something that I'm proud of for a game that I really care about and give back to the community a little bit."</p><p>Hobby went on to explain that she is not using generative AI for the game's voices. Instead, all of the voices are provided by real people whom Hobby has paid out of her own pocket. She also shared the cast list below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JanFuzzball" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ariel Michelle</a> as Emily</li><li><a href="https://heiditabing.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heidi Tabing</a> as Penny</li><li><a href="https://thatdamvoice.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">David Meyers</a> as Sebastian</li><li><a href="https://youtube.com/@saiyanserenityv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kemi Haydee Stanton</a> as Haley</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aiden_dawn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aiden Dawn</a> as Leah</li><li><a href="http://www.eamonkinsmanvo.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eamon Kinsman</a> as Alex</li><li><a href="https://x.com/hopkinsjacob5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jacob Hopkins</a> as Sam</li><li><a href="https://www.gmhakim.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GM Hakim</a> as Harvey</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/TPOTcos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nia Celeste</a> as Maru</li><li><a href="https://twitch.tv/animenji" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emmanuel "Menji" Menjivar</a> as Elliott</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DianaJurand" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diana Jurand</a> as Abigail</li><li>Jonathan David Bullock as Shane</li></ul><p>Audio Editing Assistance was provided by Victoria Cheng.

According to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a> co-creator Nick Kaman, $8 is the ideal price point for a $5 game.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/peak-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, Nick Kaman explained that the team had a $5 "joke" that actually ended up informing Peak's standard pricing. "We had this joke of, like, how much is a game really?" he said. "In a player's mind, what does it mean to spend five bucks? Well, that’s five bucks. But six bucks? Well, that's still five bucks."</p>

<p>"Four bucks is also kind of five bucks. Three bucks is two bucks. And two bucks is basically free," Kaman continued. "So we've got these tiers: You know, twelve bucks... that's ten bucks. But thirteen bucks is fifteen bucks. And we found that eight bucks is still five bucks. It doesn't become ten bucks. Seven ninety nine, that’s five bucks, right? So, eight bucks going to five bucks is the biggest differential we could find in pricing, so we found it very optimal."</p><p>This "eight bucks is five bucks" joke originated in conversations between developers at Landfall and Aggro Crab, when developers from both studios were working together to create Peak. While Peak originally launched at a reduced price of $5, its standard price is $8, or more specifically $7.99, based on the pricing of Landfall's indie horror hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/content-warning/" data-ref-id="5000-624337">Content Warning</a>.</p><p>Even though Kaman's whole joke is kind of confusing and hard to follow, psychological pricing is a very real science in the business world, and the strategy seems to have paid off for Peak. The offbeat co-operative climbing game was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/arc-raiders-and-more-dominated-steams-holiday-sales-chart/2900-7387/" data-ref-id="2900-7387">third best-selling game on Steam</a> over the holiday season, moving almost 800,000 copies in just two weeks.</p><p>Peak is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on sale on Steam</a> for $4.95--basically $5--which is the cheapest price the indie hit has sold for since it released in June.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, Lego fully unveiled its official Pokémon sets, which include the rather chonky Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model. This chap was notable not only for its size and price tag (it is retailing for £579.99), but the fact that if you pre-ordered it, you would also get your hands on the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection as a gift with purchase while stocks lasted.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chsnos.bsky.social/post/3mcabspu3rs2s">many soon took to social media</a> to say they would actually quite like to just buy the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection, please and thank you, rather than being made to shell out close to £600 (which is more than a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>) for a set they don't really want, just to get the freebie.</p>

<p>Now, and unsurprisingly, the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection is popping up on resale sites such as eBay. And while Lego itself said the set is worth roughly £25 here in the UK, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=pokemon+lego+kanto&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;_sop=16">many of those listings already marked as sold have gone for over £100</a>. It is a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=lego+kanto&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;_sop=16">similar story internationally</a> as well.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/page/lego-offers-promotions/latest-terms-and-conditions">Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection's terms and conditions</a>, the gift offer was only valid for the first 8500 pre-orders of the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise set here in the UK. In the US, that number was for the first 21,840 pre-orders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while the set itself was available for pre-order yesterday when the collection was first announced, sales pages in the UK and internationally now simply state that the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise set is "coming soon", and interested parties are currently no longer able to secure themselves a model ahead of release through Lego.</p><p>It should be noted here, that even though the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection is appearing for sale on the likes of eBay, the sellers will not yet have the set in their hands, as it is not due to be shipped until 27th February.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-announced-coming-2026">Lego x Pokémon partnership was first teased back in March,</a> before getting fully revealed yesterday. As well as the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-unveiled-but-catching-em-all-will-cost-you">this collection also includes a Pikachu and Poké Ball set</a>, and a smaller, cheaper model of Eevee with posable features.</p>
<p>Other Nintendo-themed Lego sets also released so far include the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">The Legend of Zelda's Great Deku Tree</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-taps-into-nostalgia-with-1980s-inspired-lego-game-boy-trailer">Lego Game Boy model</a> and the fiery <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-big-bowser-lego-set">Lego Bowser</a>, to name a few.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Capcom has announced a Resident Evil Showcase for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is coming this week, airing on Thursday 15th January at 10PM GMT. For those of you outside the meanest of timezones, that’s 2PM PT, 5PM ET, 11PM CET, 7AM JST (16th Jan).</p>
<p><iframe title="Teaser Trailer - Resident Evil Showcase | January 15, 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXQveAdzC74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The showcase tamely promises “<span dir="auto">brand new gameplay and news for Resident Evil Requiem”, which definitely sounds plausible to me, but what new details are there to know? And how delicately will Capcom have to avoid getting too spoilery?</span></p>
<p>We already know a decent amount about the game. This ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft who is sent out into the field to investigate murders at a spooky hotel… which also happens to be where her mum was murdered.</p>
<p>Back at the game’s announcement, Capcom talked up having a new character who wasn’t so well versed in handling the horrors unleashed into the world. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/leon-was-considered-for-resident-evil-requiem-lead-heres-why-capcom-created-grace-instead/">As Director Koshi Nakanishi said</a>, “We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>But then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/new-resident-evil-requiem-trailer-leon/">they’ve made Leon a playable character anyway</a>! What this means practically is that Grace is put front and centre, facing off against horrors and monstrosities that she’s got no chance of overcoming, and Leon gets to do all the fun gun-slinging action stuff.</p>
<p>There’s also rumours of another returning character as well, and Capcom do have a tendency to throw in a random multiplayer game mode with their Resi games. I guess we’ll see if those appear in this showcase.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on 27th February 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2 and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just two days before the end of 2025, <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/gog-acquired-by-co-founder-from-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had sold its digital video game distribution platform <strong>GOG</strong></a> (formerly <strong>Good Old Games</strong>) to <strong>Michał Kiciński</strong>, who had co-founded the company (and CD Projekt RED itself), for $25 million.</p>



<p>Now, GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-owner-of-gog-discusses-taking-on-steam-the-devil-of-drm-and-following-in-nightdives-footsteps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has published an interview with Kiciński</a>, who had retired after leaving CD Projekt RED on the very day that the company shared the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99qJGrPNLs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original Cyberpunk 2077 teaser trailer</a>, on January 10, 2013. After several years out of the gaming industry, Kiciński appears eager to dive back in and is unafraid of the proverbial elephant in the room: <strong>Valve's Steam</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-reaches-new-concurrency-record-42-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just surpassed a new user concurrency record this past Sunday</a>. </p>



<p><em>I see opportunities more than negatives, that's my nature, and I see huge opportunities for GOG to grow. And somebody might say that having a competitor like Steam with 80% of the market share is a huge obstacle, but to me, it's the opposite. I see: 'Oh, there is one big competitor, it'll be difficult for them to defend the market, because they already have 80%, so it should be easier to take the market from them.' GOG has its own strengths and really should focus on maintaining them and even strengthening them. There is no need to try to be like the others. GOG has its own identity and its own uniqueness, which is very much appreciated by gamers.</em> <em>Steam is winning with its ease of use. In that regard, I think much can be done in GOG without losing its core values and the way it operates in general.</em></p>



<p>In any case, Kiciński <strong>clarified that he does not plan to directly challenge Steam on triple-A game offerings</strong>, as Epic Games Store did, instead favoring deals with smaller developers and publishers. However, the platform <strong>will continue to sell CD Projekt RED's games at a rate favorable for the Polish developer</strong>, so fans who'd like to support CDPR should still pick GOG over other platforms if they want more of their money to go directly toward the studio.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> recently concluded its first Expedition, this being a voluntary, narrative-led character reset achieved by hoarding and donating resources over a set period. The idea is vaguely that you’re funding a mighty caravan to the boondocks. In return, you’ll get tiered rewards such as faster progression, bonus skill points and a larger stash. Participation in Expedition is split across various stages with different completion requirements – the final leg of the first one saw players amassing non-specific items worth hundreds of thousands of coins.</p>
<p>Being opt-in, Expeditions are designed to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embark-dishes-on-all-the-goodies-youll-get-in-arc-raiders-if-you-choose-to-prestige-later-this-month">a gentler alternative</a> to the playerbase-wide seasonal ‘prestiging’ mechanics or progression wipes of other online games. Developers Embark say just over a million people took part in the first Expedition – Arc Raiders has sold around 12 million copies to date – with "something close to about 35% or 40%” of those players bagging the full set of Expedition skill points, in the words of design director Virgil Watkins.</p> <!--more--><p>
I am no StatWhisperer and cannot say whether this is an amazing success, by the standards of games with progress resets. Watkins feels it’s a good start, but also says there’s room for improvement. Specifically, he thinks the closing stage of the inaugural expedition was too much of a slog for pennies.
</p><p>"One of the bigger topics [of feedback] was the requirements for the final stage to get the skill points,” he told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/first-expedition-wipe-statistics">PCGamesN</a> in a new interview, “and probably going out a bit too late with that information, because we wanted to hold off until we could calibrate it around the actual economy of the player base, rather than trying to guess really early on."</p>
<p>"So then, when we chose the number, which was the five million credits for the full thing, [we set] that as an aspirational goal that some players might achieve. But then I think a lot of players took that as like, 'Well, now I have to do that to get it.'"</p><p>Watkins would like future Expeditions to be about more than amassing huge amounts of cash. "We completely acknowledge that it isn't the most engaging thing to just go for money,” he continued, “[and it has] the potential outcome of disincentivizing using your gear, which is kind of what people look forward to towards the end of a reset cycle. So yeah, we're looking at revisions on that." </p>
<p>Aside from going over reactions to the Expedition rewards in themselves, the developers are studying player data to see if they can "bring a little more variety" to the process for more casual Expedition participants. They don’t want these players to “feel as though they're being left [behind]," Watkins said.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m rarely enticed by opportunities to ‘prestige’ a character. I don’t find grinding for the privilege of giving it all away very prestigious. I’d be more interested if there were some degree of mystery involved – perhaps it could be less about building percentages, more about solving an oblique puzzle that requires a resource investment of some kind.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge that designing what are broadly exercises in rebalancing an in-game economy takes a lot of skill - Embark have elsewhere talked to us intriguingly about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-hardest-part-of-making-arc-raiders-was-creating-a-meaningful-item-meta-so-that-your-loot-doesnt-just-feel-like-cash">the dark art of creating a “meaningful” item meta</a>. Anyway, did you join the Expedition? How did it go?</p>

            <guid>1404325</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="5578d516-004a-443d-9021-2e45e479675c" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-2">
<p data-start="0" data-end="554">For many people today, space is a luxury. City living often means smaller apartments, compact desks, and the constant challenge of fitting everything you need into a limited footprint. When it comes to computers, that reality can make a bulky PC tower feel impractical, if not impossible. You want something powerful enough to handle work and play, but small enough that it doesn’t dominate your workspace. This is where mini PCs step in—and KAMRUI’s Hyper H1 mini gaming PC is a compelling example of how much performance can be packed into a small box.</p>
<p data-start="556" data-end="985">KAMRUI has been steadily building a reputation for compact computing solutions, and the Hyper H1 is designed with gamers and power users in mind. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6735/">Right now, the Hyper H1 is seeing a significant discount, with savings of up to 31% off its original $549 price. Depending That drops the price down to just $379 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6735/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="987" data-end="1503">At the heart of the Hyper H1 is an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor. This is an 8-core, 16-thread mobile CPU capable of boosting up to 4.7GHz, which gives it plenty of horsepower for demanding everyday tasks. Paired with 32GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, the system is well-equipped for multitasking, productivity, and moderate gaming right out of the box. For users who want more headroom, memory can be upgraded to 64GB, and storage can be expanded up to 4TB with a compatible SSD.</p>
<p data-start="2040" data-end="2558">Connectivity is another strong point. The compact chassis houses six USB-A 3.2 ports, making it easy to connect a mouse, keyboard, controller, or external drives. There’s also a USB-C port, along with HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, allowing support for up to three monitors simultaneously. The Hyper H1 can drive displays at up to 4K resolution and 60Hz refresh rates, which is impressive for a mini PC. On the networking side, it includes dual-band Wi-Fi, Gigabit Ethernet, and Bluetooth 5.2 for flexible connectivity.</p>


<h2 data-start="2560" data-end="2870">Why Go Mini?</h2>
<p data-start="56" data-end="447">Although many TVs now include built-in streaming apps and affordable devices like Fire TV and Roku are widely available, a mini PC can still be an excellent choice for powering your home theater. A mini PC supports a broad range of video formats and allows you to play media stored locally. Its compact design also makes it easy to tuck away behind your TV or inside an entertainment center.</p>
<p data-start="449" data-end="738" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Many users choose mini PCs as the foundation for a PLEX server, giving them access to their media libraries from virtually anywhere. They’re also well suited for retro game emulation, since older games require minimal processing power. Just make sure any ROMs you use are obtained legally. I’m sure you would never consider downloading a ROM you don’t own…</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/13/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-4-star-wars-zero-company/</link>
            <guid>1404307</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Whatever you might think of Disney’s handling of George Lucas’ sci-fi universe, it’s clear that we still can’t get enough of Star Wars. From the premiere of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-casey-hudson/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a> at 2025’s The Game Awards, to the appearance of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-galactic-racer-speeds-us-back-to-a-galaxy-far-far-away/">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-10-to-6/">a little earlier on this list</a>, the future of a galaxy, far, far, away, seems assured, and certainly so with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-zero-company">Star Wars Zero Company</a> making it to number four on our list of 2026’s most wanted games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Zero Company | Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can stick your Cal Kestis lightsaber swinging, and your Sebulba-bashing pod-racing, Zero Company is Star Wars by way of XCOM. By that virtue, this is a tactical, strategic series of skirmishes through the darker, more serious side of Star Wars, with a turn-based combat style that will feel familiar to fans of games like XCOM, Baldur’s Gate 3 or Marvel’s Midnight Suns.</p>


<p>Coming from Bit Reactor, with support from Respawn and Lucasfilm Games, Zero Company is set during the twilight of the Clone Wars, the announcement trailer showcased an intriguing mix of characters, including a clone trooper, Mandalorian warrior and at least one rogue Jedi padawan. Your team is led by Hawks, a former Republic officer, who pulls the Zero Company together to complete a series of shadowy missions that look to have huge implications for the Star Wars universe. Quite how that plays out in terms of fitting into the wider canon, we’ll have to wait to find out.</p>


<p>The team at Bit Reactor have said that they want decisions to feel important, but that might be more to do with the customisation options for your characters and tactical choices on the battlefield, rather than overly impactful narrative moments. Either way, it’s hugely exciting to be able to explore the wider Star Wars universe from a new perspective, and there’s a huge range of possibilities with this period. Maybe you’ll complete a mission alongside Rex? Or come up against Maul as he works his way towards his takeover of Mandalore?</p>
<p>Bit Reactor definitely have the chops to pull this one off, not least because they’re a team made up of former XCOM alumni. XCOM, and its sequel, remain the benchmark for tactical strategy, so that bodes extremely well for Star Wars Zero Company’s gameplay, and with the XCOM license seemingly encased in Carbonite somewhere within 2K’s IP dungeons, this could well be the spiritual successor that fans have been waiting for, dressed up in one of sci-fi’s best and most beloved universes.</p>

<p>Star Wars Zero Company is coming to PS5, PC and Xbox Series consoles in 2026.</p>

<p>"This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time,” the publishers say in a statement passed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted">IGN</a>, who "understand" that the aforesaid Voluntary Leave Program didn't do numbers sufficient for management.</p>
<p>"These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries, or the quality of the work produced by the teams," the statement continues.</p>
<p>Ubisoft add that “the long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged”, dangling hints about “an unannounced innovative tech project with a refined team setup”. For context, Ubisoft Stockholm <a href="https://stockholm.ubisoft.com/">currently state on their website</a> that “we’re working hard on something new and ambitious, and we can’t wait to share with you what it is”.</p><p>Ubisoft say that the impacted studios will continue to “play a central role” in development of Ubisoft’s Snowdrop engine – also used by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/settlers-2022">The Settlers: New Allies</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> - and the digital distribution service Ubisoft Connect.</p>
<p>IGN report that development of The Division series “will still continue as a matter of priority”, based on conversations with Ubisoft. The publishers announced that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-building-a-team-to-make-tom-clancys-the-division-3">“building a team” to make The Division 3</a> back in September 2023, alongside updates for The Division 2 (which will get a time-limited DLC Realism Mode in March, amongst other trinkets, as part of the series’ 10 year anniversary festivities). There’s also an upcoming extraction mode, The Division 2: Survivors, and most recently, reports of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-division-definitive-edition-looks-like-it-may-be-thing-assuming-this-poster-in-japans-the-real-deal">Definitive Edition of the original game</a>.</p>
<p>This is the second major round of cuts Ubisoft have announced in the whole entire two first weeks of 2026. Last week, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-close-the-studio-behind-assassins-creed-rebellion-days-after-the-developers-vote-to-unionise">closed Ubisoft Halifax</a> shortly after the studio voted to unionise, insisting that there was no connection between these events. Best of luck to everybody affected.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-all-in-on-galaxy-s25-ultra-clearance-at-a-record-low-as-the-new-s26-launch-approaches-2000658989</link>
            <guid>1404301</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now that’s its 2026, Samsung is likely to announced a refresh to its flagship lineup of smartphones with their anticipated S26 versions. Though a goods way to save some cash while staying mostly up to date with the latest tech is to pick up the previous year model whenever you’re looking to upgrade. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, S25+, and S25 aren’t going anywhere and still remain some of the best choices for Android users.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6734/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</h2>
<p data-start="30" data-end="301">The high-end Galaxy S25 Ultra comes in several configurations with different storage options. Samsung has eliminated the 128 GB model from the prior generation, streamlining the lineup into a 256 GB version ($1,300), a 512 GB version ($1,420), and a top-tier 1 TB option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6734/">Right now, Amazon has the 256GB model on sale for as low as $1,020 which is a discount of 22% saving $280.</a> Likewise, the 512GB model has come down to as low as $1,100. That’s 23% discount, saving $320. Amazon currently isn’t offering the 1TB model.</p>

<h2 data-start="303" data-end="319">What You Get</h2>
<p data-start="321" data-end="512">The S25 Ultra stands as Samsung’s latest flagship smartphone, packed with premium features throughout. Driven by Galaxy AI, many capabilities see notable upgrades compared to its predecessor.</p>
<p data-start="321" data-end="512">If you’re finding yourself increasingly relying on AI, Gemini Live allows you to speak freely and naturally with the onboard AI to attain information in real time like you would a regular person.</p>
<p data-start="321" data-end="512">The 6.9-inch display delivers sharper imagery and more vibrant colors than ever before. The camera system features a 50MP Ultra Wide lens designed to capture the full scope of your surroundings. With the help of Galaxy AI, the camera intelligently detects ambient lighting to produce accurate skin tones and detailed textures, bringing portraits to life without the need for extra editing. Video recording is smoother than ever with Night Video and Audio Eraser, allowing you to shoot vivid footage in low-light environments while reducing unwanted background noise using Galaxy AI.</p>


<p data-start="1099" data-end="1368" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Across the Galaxy S25 Ultra, S25+, and S25 lineup, you can choose from a handful of sleek color options. The S25 Ultra specifically comes in a titanium metal case, including the colors Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silverblue, and Titanium Whitesilver. The discounts are not equal between each color, though all are on sale for at least a couple hundred off. The most affordable of each storage size are the Titanium Black for the 256GB model and the Titanium Gray for the 512GB model.</p>
<p data-start="1099" data-end="1368" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">These phones comes unlocked, meaning you can use them with your cellular provider of choice. No contracts locking you down at point of purchase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A former veteran Bethesda developer has said the studio may end up with “hateful comments” even if <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> ends up just being as good as Skyrim, which he considers to be one of the top 10 games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2026/01/nate-purkeypile-world-builder-skyrim-fallout-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esports Insider</a>, former Bethesda lead artist Nate Purkeypile, who worked at Bethesda Game Studios from 2007 before leaving in 2021, agreed with the assertion that the development teams behind The Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout are in a “no-win situation” because of the expectation fans have placed upon both games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes, and that definitely factored into me leaving because Skyrim being one of the top 10 games of all-time, how do you beat that?” Purkeypile, who founded solo indie dev Just Purkey Games after leaving Bethesda, replied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If they do, great! And I hope it’s a great game, but even if it’s just as good as Skyrim was, you’ll still get so many people throwing out hateful comments. I’m sure there will be more death threats again. All of that stuff. It’s really unfortunate that that’s the way things have gone.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In January last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement became as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced</u></a>. Skyrim was released on November 11, 2011, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-elder-scrolls-vi-announced-at-bethesda-press-conference"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 was revealed on June 10, 2018</u></a> — 2,403 days afterwards. It is now seven-and-a-half years since the announcement, and we’re no closer, it seems, to the release of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the six-year anniversary of The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement arrived in June 2024, even Bethesda chief Todd <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>Howard paused to say, "oh wow, that has been a while."</u></a> The Elder Scrolls 6 is at least in production, with Bethesda confirming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-officially-in-early-development-but-dont-expect-to-hear-about-it-soon"><u>it had entered "early development" in August 2023</u></a> and "early builds" were available in March 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, amid increasing pressure from fans for some information on the game, Howard said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 wouldn’t be out for some time yet</u></a>. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GQ magazine</u></a> to celebrate the release of Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, Howard said The Elder Scrolls 6 is “still a long way off,” adding: “I’m preaching patience. I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, speaking to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Informer</a>, studio design director Emil Pagliarulo pointed to GTA 6’s high-profile delays as the “smartest thing they could do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What do fans really want?” he asked. “Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn’t meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know? That’s what I think people are going to want. So, we’re going to take our time and as long as it needs to be great.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purkeypile said he assumed Bethesda announced The Elder Scrolls 6 so early because the studio was announcing Starfield at a time when it had already been so long since Skyrim came out, so “we needed to make sure people were not just pissed at us.” He continued: “it’s a very expensive way to do that, though. Those trailers are not cheap.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purkeypile added that Bethesda’s experience with the divisive Starfield shows it’s happy to delay games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would imagine that they will take a while to deliver it because there’s so much pressure behind that title, and I think it’s been proven with Starfield that they’re finally okay, actually delaying stuff,” he said. “That was not really the case early on. On Skyrim, it was like, ‘It’s coming out on 11/11/11’ and we were like, what?! Oh boy, no pressure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think there is less economic pressure to just get Elder Scrolls 6 out on a date, but there is more economic pressure to actually make sure it’s good, and I think that’s a good thing. That’s healthy so long as they’re also honest with the team about that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the GQ article, Howard once again admitted that it had taken too long to get The Elder Scrolls 6 out the door, but did tease a The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered-style shadowdrop — without confirming anything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do like to have a break between them, where it isn’t like a ‘plus one’ sequel,” Howard said of making The Elder Scrolls games again. “I think it’s also good for an audience to have a break — The Elder Scrolls has been too long, let’s be clear. But we wanted to do something new with Starfield. We needed a creative reset.” Bethesda is currently playtesting The Elder Scrolls 6, Howard revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like to just announce stuff and release it,” Howard continued. “My perfect version — and I’m not saying this is going to happen — is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear.” The Oblivion Remastered shadowdrop was “a test run,” Howard teased. “It worked out well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year it was confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-will-feature-a-memorial-character-for-a-much-missed-fan-following-85000-donation-to-make-a-wish"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 will include a character designed in memory of a much-missed fan</u></a> after a remarkable charity campaign that raised more than $85,000 for Make-A-Wish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

It adds the Abyss cosmetic set along with some fixes and balancing changes to the Trigger ‘Nade and Kettle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These key nerfs to the Kettle and Trigger ‘Nade address some of the biggest complaints from Arc Raiders players in recent weeks. On the Kettle, Embark said it had reduced fire rate from 600 to 450. “The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favors using third-party software,” Embark said in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/527616545148373537" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And on the Trigger ‘Nade, Embark admitted it had come to dominate PvP encounters, and “players favour picking it over all our other grenades.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This nerf aims to make it less usable as a “trigger-in-air” grenade, while keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb. Damage falloff has been rebalanced to concentrate the damage closer to the center of the explosion, and deal less damage farther away. The delay between triggering the grenade and it detonating has been increased from 0.7s to 1.5s, giving players more time to react, and making it harder to time the detonation in air.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the update fixes a key card exploit that allows players to keep room keys after using them, and lighting has been lowered in some areas on Stella Montis Night Raid, making flashlights and listening more relevant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Extraction shooter Arc Raiders is one of the biggest games around, selling over 12 million copies since its launch at the end of October. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-keeps-on-going-as-it-tops-124-million-copies-sold-gifts-all-players-a-gilded-pickaxe">Embark just announced a free gift to all players to celebrate</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, we’ve got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-like-a-whole-new-world-arc-raiders-players-are-using-aggression-based-matchmaking-to-retire-from-pvp">ongoing coverage of its ‘aggression-based matchmaking,’</a> as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/whoever-has-the-better-pc-wins-arc-raiders-players-second-guess-cheating-allegations-after-discovering-link-between-aim-assist-and-fps">the current debate about aim assist</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arc Raiders update 1.11.0 patch notes:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Kettle<ul data-cy="list"><li>Dev note: Reduced fire rate from 600 to 450.

            <p>"AI is bad, game will be deleted 30.1" reads the headline of the latest a Steam update post about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3435450/Hardest/">Hardest</a>, a rock-paper-scissors-themed roguelike card battler which includes AI-generated assets. "AI is evil, and game will be deleted 30.1" adds the sub-heading of that same update post, just in case the first line didn't make the situation clear enough.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Developer Eero Laine, who also looks to go by Rakuel, then kicks off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3435450/view/525364745339929910?l=english">the post</a> in earnest by emphasising for a third time that their game - released in July last year - will disappear from the storefront on January 30th. The reason is a change of heart from Laine on the use of AI generation tech.</p>
<p>"I made this game during the summer in a couple of months and thought to use AI because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free, so I could generate unlimited images for free and so," they continue. "But I have realized the AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment. Some AI companies can use this game just existing as a reason they get more investment for their AI companies, that benefit no one, but rather suck resources from the economy from hard working people."</p>
<p>Towards the end of the post, the dev credits "the girl I've been dating for a month" as having helped them come to this conclusion. As much as 'person meets woman, woman makes good points about the ethical concerns surrounding generative AI, person pulls game which uses generative AI from store' is a romantic tale worthy of big screen adaptation, I'm both slightly concerned and put off by Laine laying some of the blame at the feet of their university's alleged AI-positive brainwashing. I'd argue that by the age people typically go to uni, they should be mature enough to at least be somewhat prepared to make their own decisions and scrutinise things before committing to using them.</p><p>Regardless, Laine's come to this decision now. As for Hardest's future, they added: "I coded everything myself, so I can in the future make a new game with real assets if I feel like it, but the game existing in its current form is a disgrace to all game makers and players." So, a return without the AI-generated bits sounds like it may be on the cards down the line.</p>
<p>You'd hope this kind of update post is something we'll keep seeing from time to time going forwards, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">developers as prominent as Larian</a> facing vocal scrutiny from players regarding the use of generative AI in game development.</p>

            <p>No matter how you feel about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Arc Raiders</a>' use of AI for NPC voices, it's hard to deny the game has been a massive success that's "cracked open" the extraction shooter subgenre for casual players and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-games-performed-really-well-on-steam-last-year-shaking-the-dominance-of-the-same-old-live-service-games">even harpooned some older live service whales</a>. Now, it's hit a new milestone which positions it as one of the new online shooters to watch out for.</p>
<p>On 13th January, developer Embark Studios announced <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2010985172632797620?s=20">via its social channels</a> that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has recruited over 12 million players to date. That means over 12m copies of the game sold, as the studio made a "premium entry" bet which has paid off big time. <a href="https://www.gamesmarket.global/arc-raiders-sold-over-12-4-million-units-in-just-ten-weeks/">GamesMarkt</a> shared a more specific number: 12.4m copies sold in just 10 weeks. Moreover, the game reached "960,000 concurrent players on all platforms in January 2026."</p>
<p>For Embark Studios, the most important fact might be that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#max">player retention has been notable</a>, with the game holding its ground against <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players">Battlefield 6's massive success</a> and capturing much of the attention that normally would've gone towards Call of Duty after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a> was a disappointment that many longtime fans feared.</p>
<p>To celebrate, Embark Studios is gifting everyone "who logged in since launch till 23:59 CET, 13th Jan" a Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool that will be added to their inventory upon logging into the game. The update is rolling out today.</p>

<p>We could also argue Arc Raiders is partially responsible for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">Steam setting a new concurrent users record earlier this month</a> as it's managed to comfortably sit among olden heavy hitters like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/counter-strike-2-update-wipes-nearly-2-billion-off-skin-market-value-by-making-fancy-knives-and-gloves-easier-to-get">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">DOTA 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a>. That's no small feat.</p>
<p>With PlayStation and Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-months-after-being-delayed-indefinitely-bungies-troubled-marathon-finally-gets-release-window-and-price">Marathon</a> seeking to capture at least part of the same crowd's attention come March, more players being into PvPvE shooters after Arc Raiders could be a surprise blessing for the beleaguered game.</p>
<p>So, what's the next stop for this newborn franchise? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollywood-sure-sounds-keen-to-make-an-arc-raiders-film">A movie, probably</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="58c7791c4661c"><a title="Pokémon Lego" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/58c7791c4661c/pokemon-lego.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Lego</em></figcaption></figure><p>Lego recently revealed its new <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fthemes%2Fpokemon&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Pokémon collection</a>, with 'Eevee', 'Pikachu and Poké Ball', and 'Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise' all up for grabs.</p>
<p>The latter set, which costs a whopping <strong>£579.99</strong>, has already been removed from pre-sale, suggesting that the initial allocation has already been met. As such, listings are popping up on <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=pok%C3%A9mon+lego&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1313&amp;mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;siteid=3&amp;campid=5336736927&amp;toolid=10001&amp;mkevt=1" rel="sponsored noopener">eBay</a>, and when we filtered these out to 'items sold', it seems people are already paying stupid amounts of money for the collection's flagship set.</p>
<p>One listing for Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise sold earlier today for a ludicrous <strong>£1000</strong>, which yes, is getting close to double the RRP. Other unsold listings have it at a slightly lower price of around <strong>£785</strong>, but this is still eye-gougingly expensive.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fnyivsj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Similarly, Lego offered customers an additional 'Kanto Region Badge Collection' set for free with pre-orders. At the time of writing, however, we can't see any mention of this on the official site, so it seems reasonable to assume that it's sold out.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/scalpers-are-already-trying-to-sell-the-free-lego-pokemon-pre-order-gift-for-up-to-300/">VGC</a>, then, this set is currently being sold on eBay for roughly <strong>£150</strong>, though unsold listings are still available for as much as <strong>£250-300</strong>.</p>

<p>All three sets will launch on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. It seems likely, given the initial popularity, that Lego will want to expand the collection with new sets in the coming months and years. We'll be sure to let you know of any announcements when they happen.</p>
