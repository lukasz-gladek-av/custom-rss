		<p>Star Trek: Voyager –&nbsp;Across The Unknown gives you the chance to do things a little bit differently. Stranded on the other side of the galaxy with who knows what lying between them and a return to Federation Space, some 70,000 light years away, it’s a journey that tested the crew of the Voyager no end, challenging their ideals, their willingness to do the right thing by Federation standards, and to overcome the dangers in their way. But what if you were slipped into the Captain’s jumpsuit, instead of Kate Mulgrew? It’d probably be a different fit, and you might make some rather different decisions.</p>

<p>Let’s be honest, Star Trek: Voyager wasn’t the best of 90s Star Trek – that’s Deep Space 9 by a country parsec – and the writers hitting episodic reset button each week on the TV series didn’t let them deliver on the idea of being trapped decades from home and needing to do everything just to persist – something that Battlestar Galactica’s reboot did quite a bit better. But it absolutely had its moments. The strength of Kathryn Janeway’s leadership shone through, the eventual addition of Seven of Nine, and heck, I’m sure there’s a number of strong narrative arcs with the Borg, Species 8472, and more, all building up to a blockbusting conclusion.</p>


<p>Across The Unknown starts at the very beginning of the journey, presenting the entirety of the opening two-part episode, Caretaker, to act as an introduction and tutorial for the game’s take on the story and how Gamexcite has built the narrative around new decision points, ship management and space exploration.</p>
<p>The first element here is really how the narrative is told to you, distilling the original screenplays and episodes into dialogue text boxes and back and forth scenes in the ship’s bridge, amongst other locations, as well as quick narrative paragraphs alongside painterly stills from the TV series. Within that, you’ll often get the ability to choose how to proceed, whether it’s with optional extra dialogue to dig deeper into a subject, a decision on what path to take, or simply coming up to a key story moment and needing to say if you’re ready to go ahead or not –&nbsp;you’re seemingly given plenty of time to prepare instead of being forced into encounters.</p>


<p>Beaming an away team down to the Array, and later on down to the dustbowl planet at the behest of Neelix, you’re able to choose the composition of the group. Tuvok is great as a Security Officer, providing leadership and the ability to blast in and out of a situation with phasers, while Harry Kim is better for science, and Neelix or Kes might bring more local knowledge and options in some situations. You’re clued in on the particular character traits that will be valuable through a series of skill checks, but then at each stage you need to decide which character (or characters) to lean on, aware that they will then be fatigued and less useful for the next story point.</p>
<p>Failure on any of these skill checks comes with consequences big and small. Early on in an away mission it might just be thematic – the Kazon choosing to fire in your direction before backing off if you defy them – but later on it could be that a heated phaser fire exchange sees a character wounded and needing to rest up in the sick bay. Of course, through this opening story section, it feels like the stakes are lowered, but it was interesting that, given the option to try and rescue some of the Maquis from the Caretaker, I ended up with Kim and Torres coming back to Voyager, with Paris and Chakotay kept hostage.</p>

<p>Much of the ship is deactivated and damaged in the opening events of the story, alongside many other parts of the ship, as life support is knocked out across a bunch of decks. Where that can be hand-waved away with some plotting in the TV series, here it’s an integral part of the survival experience. The ship is viewed from the side on like an ant farm or the base view in XCOM, and one of the first priorities for you is to assign maintenance crews to repair existing mission critical rooms, clear debris, and build some emergency crew quarters.</p>
<p>This all takes time and resources, so you’ll be scouring each star system for some of those Star Trek-y elements and compounds. Deuterium is plentiful, but your Warp Core absolutely chews through it to provide power to ship systems, and running out leaves you on battery power alone. Then there’s a few elements needed for construction and repairs, science points for research, and eventually some Borg points.</p>
<p>Even as you’re getting things like phaser banks and the shuttle bay back up and running, you can already start to research improvements and new rooms. Hydroponics will help feed your crew without draining the replicator, an additional cargo bay that’s upgraded can seriously boost the amount of resources you can bank for when you need them, there’s hull upgrades, cycling shields, and more.</p>

<p>You can choose to rebuild Voyager in multiple ways, either looking to embrace science, discovery and research, or arming yourself to defend in combat, and then using this to feed into your decision making through narrative points. I’ve no doubt that the Holodeck taking up a whopping nine spaces on the ship will be a sore spot, when battling for space against</p>
<p>Combat presents you with a pausable abstraction, where you issue commands for who and what part of a ship to target, and make use of your named characters’ abilities. You can set three of these to be active, with Tuvok doubling phaser blasts and Harry Kim able to disrupt enemy shields being a good starter combo. As you chip away at enemy shields, you’ll then be able to manually blast with torpedoes.</p>
<p>This section felt a bit woolly to me, partly because the camera felt a bit too close, and the ship movements a bit too rapid –&nbsp;they should feel like naval ships, gliding past and making graceful arcs, a la The Wrath of Khan – but also because defeating the Kazon fleet didn’t actually cause the ships to blow up or retreat. I just got a victory screen at the end. Hopefully this is cleared up for the full game.</p>
<p>In general, I also feel like the UI needs a bit of sprucing up and rationalising. The ship, system and galactic maps are all quick and easy to flick between, but research is separate in a lightly annoying way and you can only back out by hitting Escape. The success predictor for skill checks also uses two shades of yellow to mean critical success and mild failure in different situations. I also just wish that work crews would be freed up as soon as they’ve finished construction, instead of needing me to acknowledge a room has been cleared. Oh, and can I not just relocate a room, instead of scrapping it?</p>

<p>I think it will be fascinating to see just how much of the show’s seven seasons has ended up being recreated for this game. I expect that most of the highlight episodes found across the many watch lists found online will have been captured, while most of the filler and utter dross like Threshold is left behind. Alright, so it would be pretty funny to leave lizard Janeway and Paris to their new lives as lizard parents, but then who would be Chakotay’s first officer? Harry Kim? Are we sure we really want that?</p>
<p>All in all, I enjoyed this first look and demo for Star Trek: Voyager –&nbsp;Across The Unknown and am certainly intrigued to see how it takes the strong concept and the series’ high points, and forms them into something new and potentially rather different.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov-spoof-escape-from-duckov-sells-500k-copies-in-first-weekend.1329343/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie extraction shooter and <i>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</i>spoof <i>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</i>has managed to sell a pretty impressive number of copies since launching on Thursday, developer Team Soda and publisher bilibili have announced.</p>

<p>According to a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3167020/view/617681009992795859" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>sales have hit 500,000 since last week's release, an achievement Team Soda says has its developers "quacking with joy and flapping [their] wings in excitement".</p>

<p>The studio promises that every subsequent update for&nbsp;<em>Duckov&nbsp;</em>will "live up to your expectations" and reminds everyone who hasn't bought the game yet that it's still available at a 12% discount, so if you are at all interested in&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em>, now's the time to pick it up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/escape-from-duckov-sales-500k-inventory.jpg?itok=qzLl0DHj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/escape-from-duckov-sales-500k-inventory.jpg?itok=LxVuLG2v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>has hit a pretty big sales milestone since launching on Thursday.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Duckov</em>'s achievement puts it on par with "anxiety horror" game <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">No, I'm Not a Human</a>&nbsp;</i>and cozy RPG&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>&nbsp;</em>in the sales stakes, although it's a very different prospect to either of those games.</p>

<p>It's not a bad figure at all for a game that almost certainly started out as a joke based on its title, so kudos to Team Soda and bilibili for seeing this one through. I'd say they deserve to reap the benefits, especially if the game's Overwhelmingly Positive Steam <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rating</a> is anything to go by.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em>, it's a top-down extraction shooter openly inspired by Battlestate's popular&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>, although it's obviously a good deal less realistic than that game.</p>

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Duckov&nbsp;</em>bases its core gameplay loop, inventory management system, and general atmosphere on&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>, it's not a multiplayer game; this is a strictly single-player PvE affair, so if you're put off from&nbsp;<em>Tarkov&nbsp;</em>by other players (and its lack of ducks), this one's for you.</p>




<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> if you're interested in checking it out. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/try-out-the-apple-airpods-pro-2-at-a-32-discount-over-at-amazon-2000636706</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Okay, people. Listen here. Amazon has the Apple AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds on sale for a good 32% off.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/"> It’s not too often we see Apple stuff getting a discount, so now’s a great time to upgrade your earbuds or pick up an extra set as the pair has come down to just $170</a>. These AirPods are usually set at $249 so you’re looking at a $79 discount. The model here is the second generation of the Pro 2, which support a wide range of useful features with the new iOS. So if you plan on listening with these behind your computer at work, sitting on the train, or pumping iron at the gym, these everyday best-selling premium earbuds can help you make that time much more enjoyable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Rich Audio Experience</h2>
<p>Now, this specific set of AirPods Pro 2 have been engineered with the Apple H2 chip. The computational power it provides allow the earbuds to perform intelligent noise cancellation with deep immersive sound. The ANC is twice as powerful as comparable earbuds from other brands. For you, that means less unwanted noise and better focus on what you want to hear. They can drown out the sounds of a plane engine or just keep muzzled the noisy sounds of a busy office. Along with that, you can also watch and listen to select songs, shows, and movies with support for Dolby Atmos. Enjoy high quality and immersive spatial audio.</p>
<p>When the time comes you need to hear your surroundings again, simply flip your AirPods Pro 2&nbsp; over to transparency mode. This will allow outside sounds to come in so your can stay aware of what’s around you. This is great for when stepping outside and walking through a busy street. It’s usually good to here the cars and trucks in that kind of environment for your own safety.</p>



<p>You can choose to use Adaptive Audio which is able to blend between both active noise cancellation and transparency mode seamlessly to give you the best listening experience for whatever your particular situation is.</p>
<p>The AirPods Pro 2 have been made to be able to fit any ear size. In the box, you’ll find additional silicone tips marked as XS, S, M, and L. This way no matter how large or small your ears are, the AirPods Pro 2 will be able to snugly fit, staying firmly in place. This also created an acoustic seal which, in unison with active noise cancellation, keeps out the unwanted sounds.</p>

              <p>Someone definitely unplugged something they shouldn’t have. This morning the worldwide internet saw some major outages after Amazon’s AWS server farms suffered a whoopsie, taking down big-name games like <em>Fortnite</em> and&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-and-fortnite-are-down-and-so-are-many-of-the-worlds-most-popular-games">as <em>Eurogamer</em> spotted</a>, <em>Palworld</em>, <em>Clash Royale</em> and various Nintendo online services. Most of these have since recovered.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> Fortnite has recovered, with multiplayer matches working once again. <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/netinfo/en_US/index.html">Nintendo is also back online</a>, after both Switch and Switch 2 network services went offline for about four hours this morning.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">✅ The service provider outage is resolved and Fortnite is back online! Players should again be able to log-in and matchmake without issue.</p> <p>We'll continue to monitor this to ensure service remains stable. 🫡 <a href="https://t.co/5hhpG5UKfj">https://t.co/5hhpG5UKfj</a></p> <p>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1980249794502082948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>For fans of brainrot, it seems <em>Roblox</em> is now back online, albeit chugging a little. Er, yay?&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1980232723060211958"><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is also reporting that it’s back online and multiplayer is working as normal.</a></p>

 <p>However, the most serious outage is still affecting me: I cannot get&nbsp;<em>Connections</em> to run on my&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> puzzle app, and frankly I’m struggling to cope.</p> <p>It seems the issue has taken place in Northern Virginia, <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">where Amazon reports</a> “multiple services” are down following “increased error rates and latencies.” This all started about four hours ago in Amazon’s US-EAST-1 region, specifically the “DynamoDB endpoint,” which sounds painful. The 4.26 a.m. ET update explained, “Engineers were immediately engaged and are actively working on both mitigating the issue, and fully understanding the root cause,” later noting that the cause was related to “DNS resolution” of said endpoint. Throughout the early hours of the morning, Amazon has continued to update, explaining that issues are being resolved and everything is slowly getting back online, but it’s a slow process.</p>

 <p>Given the speed with which things are being recovered, this doesn’t look like a significant attack or long-term problem, but rather yet another useful example of how just a couple of corporations now control access to the vast majority of the internet we usually take for granted.</p>

 <p><strong>Updated: 10/20/2025, 9.15 a.m. ET:</strong> The post has been updated to say that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> is back online.</p> <p><strong>Updated: 10/20/2025, 9.32 a.m. ET:</strong> The post has once more been updated to report that Nintendo is now back online, and to reframe the post and headline to reflect that the issues are now mostly fixed.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-might-be-on-ice-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-9-remake-might-be-%E2%80%98on-ice%E2%80%99-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1329331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable insider has speculated that development of the Final Fantasy 9 Remake may have been put on hold for the time being. </p>



<p>Final Fantasy 9 Remake’s development has gone through several significant hurdles since we first heard about it. Most recently, we were told earlier this year that the game’s development is ‘in trouble’ and there’s a chance of it being cancelled. Now, more news that fans will not be happy about has surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-9-remake-s-future-is-unknown">Final Fantasy 9 Remake’s Future is Unknown</h2>



<p>Recently, NateTheHate was asked on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1979261183820431479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) whether he had heard anything new about Final Fantasy 9 Remake’s plans. The insider replied that, for now, he assumes “the game is on ice” and that development may have been paused for the title. Moreover, the post states that it is “unknown” whether Square Enix will decide to “return to it or not.” Seems like Final Fantasy 9’s remake is in real trouble. </p>



<p>Things seemed to be looking bright for Final Fantasy 9 Remake earlier this year, when rumours started to heat up with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-rumors-heat-up-with-new-ff9-website-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new website launch</a> for the 25th Anniversary. A few days later, it seemed like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-seemingly-teased-by-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix was also teasing the title</a>, as they posted a quote from the original game’s ending. However, since then we have only been receiving bad news, with it seeming like FF9 remake will never see the light of day. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Twin Pack Physical Edition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-twin-pack-physical-edition-pre-orders-now-available-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-orders are now available</a> for PlayStation 5. Additionally, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part’s development <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-development-unaffected-by-xboxs-lack-of-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains unaffected</a> by Xbox’s lack of memory.

<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a trending topic online. </p>

<p>The remake is supposedly real and currently operating under the codename 'Chamber', which is presumably a blatant reference to protagonist Rebecca Chambers. Voice and performance capture work had reportedly begun in 2024, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/marvels_guardians_of_the_galaxy_cloud_version">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> actor Jon McLaren taking on a key role.</p>
<p>McLaren's <a href="https://resumes.actorsaccess.com/jonmclaren">resume</a> makes reference to a 'lead' role in 'PROJECT CHAMBER (Upcoming AAA Video Game)' with Beyond Capture Studios, which had also worked with Capcom on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> remake and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>. While not a definitive lead at this time, it seems possible that McLaren may be taking on the role of RE0's Billy Coen.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067prgotz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Mp1st also goes on to say that "the remake is expected to expand upon the source material, although the core story will remain the same". Pretty standard for RE remakes, as far as we're concerned. They then dive briefly into a couple of potential new scenes, but we won't relay those details here. You can click through to the article if you'd like to find out more.</p>
<p>According to prominent Resident Evil leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963192470768128362">Dusk Golem</a>, Capcom's current timeline has a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_code_veronica_x">Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a> remake launching in 2027 with Resident Evil 0 following in 2028. As we know, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the next mainline entry in the seres, will launch on Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>As always, we won't treat this as gospel until Capcom itself provides official confirmation. If the timeline is even remotely accurate, it's likely we won't hear about Resident Evil 0 for a couple of years, at least.</p>

			<p><span>The new PlayStation 5 Pro CFI-7121 model, no</span>w available across Europe, comes with some improvements over the original model, a new teardown conducted by&nbsp;Austin Evans&nbsp;confirmed.</p>



<p>The most significant difference between the PlayStation 5 Pro launch model and the CFI-7121 model is better power efficiency for the 2025 model. In tests conducted running Astro's Playroom and Gran Turismo 7, the CFI-7121 model proved to be 2 to 3% more power efficient, even running replays in Gran Turismo 7 which push the system the most with full ray tracing support. Thanks to the better power efficiency, the new system also runs slightly cooler than 2024's launch model.</p>



<p>The CFI-7121 model is also noticeably quieter. In the tests, the new unit proved to be 20% quieter than the launch model, representing a 2-decibel difference. The new fan's slightly lower-pitched sound profile further enhances this reduction.</p>



<p>The differences between the two PlayStation 5 Pro models are minimal for the rest. Changes like slightly different fan from another manufacturer, a plastic fan grid in place of a metal grid, a lighter rear heat sink, the removal of some VMMs from the motherboard and a lighter, possibly more efficient power supply, result not only in the enhanced power efficiency, but also in a lighter weight - 3016 grams against the 3103 grams of the launch model.</p>



<p>The changes for the new DualSense controller revision are even smaller. Aside from some small internal changes and parts produced by a different manufacturer than those in a launch controller, the new DualSense only saw the removal of the back microphone. This is a rather small change likely made to keep manufacturing costs down without significantly impacting the controller's performance and functionality.</p>



<p>You can see the full breakdown of these hardware changes, including the fan and heatsink revisions, in Austin Evans' complete teardown video below.</p>

<p>While it was expected that the new PlayStation 5 Pro model would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">around 3% more power efficient than the launch model</a>, the new DualSense V3 controller revision is minimal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">which is not what earlier reports suggested earlier this month</a>. While this may be disappointing for some, the fact that the changes made to the controller don't impact its functionality and keep its price down should still be welcome amidst consistent price increases that have made both<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/"> the regular PlayStation 5 </a>and the<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/"> Xbox Series X|S systems more expensive</a> since their launch in 2020.</p>

              <p>Halloween is a great time to catch up on some Wizarding World magic, or even better, bring your favorite moments home. Lego has quite a few Harry Potter sets for the fans out there, and right now, you can pick one up for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/">The Harry Potter Hagrid’s Hut: An Unexpected Visit set is currently going for just $47 on Amazon, after a steep 37% off its regular price of $75</a>. This is the lowest we have seen this set drop to in a long while, but the deal is going to wrap up soon. Whether you’re treating yourself to some weekend fun or introducing your kids to the classics, now’s the time to jump in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Build Both the Insides and Outdoors</h2>
<p>This set gets you a total of 896 pieces, and it’s designed for children ages 8 and up. You will build Hagrid’s cozy hut, plus the dog house. The hut itself opens up and has a removable roof. The insides have Hagrid’s foldout chair, an umbrella stand, and even a dragon egg. There are also two collectible Hogwarts portrait tiles, which are randomly selected from a set of 14. You can display these inside Hagrid’s hut, or add them to your collection if you’re building one.</p>
<p>Mini figures include Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, and Hagrid, along with Norbert the dragon and Hagrid’s Dog Fang. You can recreate multiple scenes; maybe have Hagrid relax on his chair inside, while the curious kids look for trouble, or have them all outside preparing to fight the unknown.</p>



<p>The set comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. If that sounds too complicated, you can also download the Lego app on your phone for 3D instructions. You can also track your progress through the app to get started right where you left off.</p>
<p>Altogether, this set is a great option if you want to keep some of your favorite Harry Potter memories close. It’s not just fun to build, but also a little nostalgic, especially for those who grew up watching the movies. The mini figure selection is impressive; you’re getting most of the key characters. You could treat yourself to it, or gift it to a fellow fan this Halloween! Just be sure to grab the set fast, as we don’t expect this offer to last long. It could wrap up anytime now.</p>

            <p>Xbox president Sarah Bond has confirmed Microsoft is working on "next-gen hardware", following rumours it was no longer in console development.</p>
<p>Bond spoke with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/">Variety</a> to mark the release of the new handheld ROG Xbox Ally, but was also asked about the future of Xbox.</p>
<p>"We are 100 percent looking at making things in the future," said Bond. "We have our next-gen hardware in development. We've been looking at prototyping, designing. We have a partnership we've announced with AMD around it, so that is coming. What we saw here was an opportunity to innovate in a new way and to bring gamers another choice, in addition to our next-gen hardware. We are always listening to what players and creators want. When there is demand for innovation, we're going to build it."</p>

<p>Rumours had been circulating on social media that Microsoft would no longer be developing console hardware, rumours which began shortly after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">price hike to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p>
<p>It certainly appeared to tie in with not only the forthcoming release of the new handheld in collaboration with Asus, but with Microsoft's own campaign slogan of "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">This is an Xbox</a>" and a mission to ensure its games are available on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Yet this statement from Bond confirms hardware remains in the pipeline.</p>
<p>"We want to make sure that people have a choice," Bond told Variety. "We want to make sure there's an option for the power players who want the latest innovations, that want to push the edge of what's possible, the most demanding players. And then, if someone is looking for PC gaming on the go, they're a casual gamer, they're a gaming enthusiast, then there's Xbox Allys for them. Giving multiple choices for people, so we can actually meet people where they are."</p>
<p>That said, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-rog-ally-handheld-now-available-to-pre-order-but-its-pricier-than-a-home-console">steep price of the handheld</a> suggests it's not particularly suited to casual gamers either.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">ROG Xbox Ally X review</a> from Tom Orry states it's "an impressive handheld PC wearing an Xbox mask". Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson, meanwhile, has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whatever-it-is-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-makes-me-pine-for-xboxs-distant-heyday">pining instead for Xbox's "distant heyday"</a>.</p>
<p>There's certainly been some confusion over the messaging from Xbox recently and speculation on its future, which hasn't been helped by the Game Pass price hike following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">multiple game cancellations</a> off the back of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">mass layoffs</a>.</p>

It's predictably called Futurama: Hit &amp; Run and has a demo out now.</p>
<p>For free, of course, so attempts to deploy the 'shut up and take my money' meme here are thoroughly misplaced. If you've already said it while reading that first paragraph, please submit to death by snu-snu. No wait, that makes it sound like I'm going to be the one doing the-</p>

<p>Getting back on track, <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48">Futurama: Hit &amp; Run</a> devs Slurm Team's recreation of New New York consists of new 3D models built "from scratch". There are four fresh story missions to sink your teeth into while playing as formerly freezered delivery boy Fry, plus a bonus mission. Naturally, the 30th century also has three new street races and a wager-based one. Prepare to eat some dust, pantless space ranger Zapp Brannigan.</p><p>There are six cars with which to bump cartoon pedestrians into t-posey ragdoll falls. four costumes to don, and 25 wasps to awkwardly jump-kick. Amusingly, the modders specify that their work contains exactly ten side-gags, including one elusive secret gag to hunt down. I assume all of them are buttons you press so that Ralph Wiggum says a thing, as all Hit and Run jokes should be.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that while a full custom soundtrack's up and running, Slurm Team have made clear they've used "AI-generated dialogue as temporary placeholders" in the demo. "Please note that these synthetic voices are included solely for demonstration purposes," the modders wrote. "Professional voice artists are already engaged, and their recordings will replace the placeholder content in a future update."</p>
<p>Personally, I think I'll wait for that update to materialise before I think about giving the mod a go (I'll also need to acquire a non-PS2 copy of Hit &amp; Run). In a fun twist, the trailer's seemingly caught the eye of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/97899/joe-mcginn/">Joe McGinn</a>, a senior game designer on the original, and he's left a comment indicating he's keen to try the mod out.</p>
<p>To get Futurama: Hit &amp; Run hit and running, you'll need a copy of Hit &amp; Run for PC, plus <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/6">Lucas' Simpsons Hit &amp; Run Mod Launcher</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple%E2%80%99s-clearing-out-airtag-4-pack-before-black-friday-practically-free-at-this-price.1329280/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are times buying in bulk is a super smart move, and then there are times when you wonder if filling your basement with 600 buckets of survivalist food was really worth the money. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">This Amazon deal, thankfully, is one of the super smart moves, since it’s offering you a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for just $65</a>, just half a buck more than the all-time low price for a 4-pack. The math says that nets out to $16.25 per tracker tag, while the price of an individual AirTag at Amazon is $25 even while it’s also on sale.</p>
<p>Considering just how many uses there are for AirTags, buying just one would be a little odd to begin with. Even if you travel with just one carry-on bag, your backpack, purse, or wallet would benefit from an AirTag as well. And there are so many third-party AirTag holders available now that you can track anything from your car keys to your cat. (No, really,&nbsp;<em>your cat</em>.) Finding uses for four AirTags is a cinch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Simply the Best</h2>
<p>If you’re an iPhone or iPad user, you absolutely cannot beat the AirTag for keeping track of your stuff. With one-tap setup, the AirTag goes from unboxing to fully running and linked to as many as five users in minutes. The disc shape and compact size mean you can put it basically anywhere, either with one of those specially designed keychains, wallets, or other holders, or just loose if you’re placing it in a suitcase or backpack.</p>
<p>When it’s time to call upon the AirTag to locate a lost item, it gets the job done whether the missing object is wedged between the couch cushions mere inches away from you, or if it’s thousands of miles away. In close range, you can use the Find My app to have the tag play a sound for you to locate, or use the app to lead you to the AirTag with accurate measurements down to the foot. At long range, the millions-strong Find My network can locate your AirTag and show its current location, even if it’s on the other side of the world.</p>



<h2>Safety All Around</h2>
<p>Not only is the ability to quickly locate a missing item a good safety feature, there’s also the fact that even the Find My network is deployed to help find your missing item, it’s done with complete anonymity. The whole network is encrypted for privacy, and the AirTags themselves never store location data or history.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">This Amazon deal on a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for just $65 comes at a great time</a>, probably just as you’re thinking about or actively planning your holiday travel. It’s a great price and a small investment for the ability to track not only your own stuff, but also to help keep tabs on the family’s bags as you brave the holiday crowds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is anything but a pushover. Team Ninja has once again concocted another brutal affair, sure to have you pulling out your hair for hours. If you’re wondering how many hours exactly, we can run through Ninja Gaiden 4’s game length and expected playtime for you.</p>



<p>Team Ninja finally returned to its legendary franchise after a few years away. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> carries on Ryu Hayabusa’s journey and brings back the PTSD instilled by over 30 years of almost hilariously difficult NG games. Don’t get it twisted, we welcome the challenge, and NG games offer a level of challenge not even some Souls games can match!</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 looks to be a violent return to form. If you’re curious as to how much content is in the game, we’ve got all the answers you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-ninja-gaiden-4">How Many Hours To Beat Ninja Gaiden 4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How long can you endure? Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Ninja Director Masakazu Hirayama has said an initial playthrough on normal difficulty should take you “15 to 20 hours.”</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, Ninja Gaiden 4 on a ‘normal’ difficulty is the equivalent of other games essentially being on hard—on steroids. Your mileage will vary when it comes to Hirayama’s window—through <a href="https://next-play.com.au/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-preview-and-development-team-interview-meeting-yakumo-ryus-return-new-weapons-dlc-plans-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NextPlay</a>. If you’re well-versed in hack ‘n’ slash games and used to the difficulty of every combat encounter, then this is a realistic timeframe.</p>



<p>If you’re unfamiliar with Ninja Gaiden and intense action games such as these, your runtime might lean toward the 20-hour window, and <em>beyond</em>. Whereas if you make use of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-disgusting-levels-of-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NG 4’s difficulty settings</a>, you might even clock in at just under 15 hours!</p>



<p>There’s plenty of choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-ninja-gaiden-4-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Ninja Gaiden 4 Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>A completionist run of Ninja Gaiden 4 could feasibly take you 50-100 hours-plus, and there’s a good chance that most people will never be able to complete Ninja Gaiden 4 at all!</strong></p>



<p>If we’re talking about doing everything in Nnja Gaiden 4, this means beating all the extra Missions, Challenges, achieving full weapon mastery, and beating all difficulty levels.</p>



<p>The reason this can take upwards of 100 hours—borderline until the end of time itself—is because of Master Ninja mode. If you go through the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4 trophy list</a>, you’ll see that “Way of the Master Ninja” requires you to “Complete the game on MASTER NINJA difficulty.”</p>



<p>If this is anything like previous games, expect enemies to kill you in barely any hits, insta-kill you with grab attacks, and attack you whilst you’re attacking other enemies—and even if you’re in the air! It’s beyond brutal. It’s sadistic, but a sickeningly good time for Ninja Gaiden enthusiasts.</p>



<p>Please, please let us know if you intend to do everything. Have you beaten any Ninja Gaiden games on Master Ninja difficulty (or the equivalent setting) in the past? Now’s the time to brag through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

                <p>It's been an interesting month at Ubisoft, as the vice president executive producer of Assassin's Creed, Marc-Alexis Côté, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-two-decades/1100-6535413/">left the company after nearly two decades</a>, and Côté made it clear that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-boss-says-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/1100-6535519/" data-ref-id="1100-6535519">it wasn't his choice to leave</a>.

The play test peaked at 189,668 concurrent players, and stayed in the top ten most played Steam games all weekend.</p><p>The weekend's open play test was designed as a stress test for the game's servers ahead of its official release on October 30, and it looks like the studio got what it was looking for. The test involved just one map, the Dam Battleground, and allowed players to try out the game's progression, crafting, and quest mechanics.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ARC Raiders | Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Arc Raiders is being developed by Embark Studios, who were also behind 2023 arena shooter The Finals. Embark was founded by a number of industry veterans, including former Battlefield executive Patrick Soderlund. While The Finals was released as a free-to-play title, Arc Raiders is following the premium model and will release with a $40 price tag.</p><p>Arc Raiders is a PvPvE extraction shooter set in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity has been forced to shelter underground after deadly Arc robots have taken over the surface. The player takes on the role of the titular raider, venturing topside to collect valuable resources. Players have generally had good things to say about the playtest across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1o9ng4s/arc_raiders_just_became_steams_most_popular/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a>, praising the game's level of polish pre-release, and the implementation of its strong PvE threats.</p><p>Arc Raiders is launching into a busy period for shooters--Battlefield 6 had its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-already-doing-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535398/" data-ref-id="1100-6535398">massively successful</a> release on October 10, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is due out</a> in November. Arc Raiders' main competition in the extraction shooter genre, Escape from Tarkov, is also gearing up for its full version 1.0 release on November 15.</p><p>Arc Raiders will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-locked-and-loaded-for-an-october-launch/1100-6532163/" data-ref-id="1100-6532163">released on October 30</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox One.</p>

<p>It's no screenshot button, mind</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="e4eb2c32faacd"><a title="Nintendo Today" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4eb2c32faacd/nintendo-today.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> has scored a tiny update, pushing the app up to ver. 2.0.10 with the addition of a brand new share button.</p>
<p>Yep, a share button. It's hardly the most groundbreaking fresh feature, but considering how the company previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-today-update-prevents-users-from-recording-promotional-videos">removed the ability to take in-app screenshots</a> or nab screen recordings, it's a welcome one.</p>
<p>You'll find the new share button in the bottom right corner of any news item in the app. Giving it a tap will bring up your phone's usual share screen, giving you the chance to spread the news directly to another app via a link.</p>
<p>We should also point out that the person you're sharing the news with will <em>also need to have Nintendo Today! downloaded</em> to see the content, which feels... about right for this app, honestly.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the patch notes are pretty short for this one, but here they are, nonetheless:</p>
<h2>Nintendo Today Ver. 2.0.10 (20th Oct 2025)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Share news<br></strong>You can tap the Share Button within Nintendo Today! news content to share it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo continues to roll out both major and minor announcements via the Nintendo Today! app. Most of the time, it's a piece of key art or a closer look at a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> vehicle, but then sometimes we'll be surprised with the announcement of a new game like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a> or an exclusive peek at a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-updates-animated-short-film-close-to-you-with-some-familiar-faces">short film</a>. Hey, maybe this share button will come in handy after all!</p>

            <p>Is that you, RPS readership? It's me, Edwin. I'm back from last week's unscheduled spell of Maw mastication, and regrettably, I still have possession of all my typing fingers. James was kind enough to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-next-fest-demo-excess-and-double-fines-sentient-lighthouse">do the round-up post in my absence</a>, but the experience has clearly taken a toll, as he is now in India. James, if I fled to another country everytime the Maw ate a colleague I'd have run out of other countries to flee to. But hey, knock yourself out. It's not like there are any big brands getting fresh instalments this week. It's not like... oh good gravy.

Can't you see I'm trying to free my ankle from the jaws of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a>? Go play Rock Shuriken Shotgun with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/">Painkiller</a> remake while I check out this neat and relatively non-corpo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2053910/Isopod_A_Webbed_Spinoff/">isopod platformer</a> recommended by Mark.

The water covers the lawn outside, which disgorges a wrathful bouquet of rapid-firing daffodils. It must be Popcap remake <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3654560/Plants_vs_Zombies_Replanted/">Plant vs Zombies: Replanted</a>.

Time to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3905630/Tower_Lords/">build towers</a>, idly. I won't end the week by running off to India like that lily-livered James, but I might pay a quick recuperative visit to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3566840/Bleak_Haven/">Bleak Haven</a>. They wouldn't have called it a "haven" if it weren't wholesome. I refuse to look up "bleak" in the dictionary.
</p><p>Do you have your eye on any particular games out this week? If I have embarrassingly neglected to mention a major release, please respect my chronic shortage of self-esteem and give me no sign. With James away, it's just me and Mark cranking the handles of non-guides editorial till Friday, plus evening freelance news from Oisin, so there might be the odd break in postage. Hope things are good at your end.</p>

It was designed to help Embark "challenge and fortify the game’s servers before launch," which hopefully means everything will work as it should on release day. All participants earned an exclusive 'Server Slammer' backpack cosmetic reward, unlocked when the full game launches. Progress from the Server Slam does not carry over, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios' previous game, free-to-download competitive shooter The Finals, is still going, although its concurrent player numbers on Steam are a far cry from those during its explosive launch back in December 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka wants to continue the trend of spotlighting different Sonic characters each year, following the success of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-declares-2024-the-year-of-shadow-the-hedgehog">Year of Shadow</a>.</p>
<p>Shadow the Hedgehog was celebrated last year to build anticipation for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film, alongside the release of Sonic x Shadow Generations.</p>
<p>It seems this was a success for Sega. In an interview at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGVWVq8cJPI">Brasil Game Show</a> earlier this month (thanks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/sonic-teams-boss-wants-to-put-more-sonic-characters-in-the-spotlight">NintendoLife</a>), Iizuka stated he'd like a new theme each year, based on characters in future films.</p>

<p>"Last year, we promoted The Year of Shadow, influenced by the movie, but I'd like to choose a theme each year and spotlight different characters," said Iizuka. "I think we can predict which characters will appear in the upcoming movie, so I'd like those characters to play an active role."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-film-sequel-on-the-way">Sonic the Hedgehog 4 film has already been greenlit</a>, announced shortly after the release of the third film last year. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-gets-a-release-date-but-its-still-a-few-years-away">release date was then provided</a> shortly after: 19th March 2027.</p>
<p>What's more (<strong>spoiler warning!</strong>), the post-credits scene in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 reveals that Amy Rose and Metal Sonic will appear in the new film - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whats-next-for-the-sonic-films-after-sonic-the-hedgehog-3s-post-credits-scene">could it be based on Sonic CD</a>?</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, we could see a Year of Amy celebration to build hype for the next film. Could whatever's coming after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a> be included?</p>
<p>And could other Sonic characters feature in future? The Year of Big the Cat? The Year of Cream the Rabbit?</p>
<p>This year, Sega has a <a href="https://www.sega.com/sonic-the-hedgehog/racing-around-the-world">Racing Around The World</a> campaign to celebrate the release of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. That resulted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-joins-mclaren-racing-in-historic-partnership-with-sega">collaboration with the McLaren Racing team</a>, among other events.</p>

			<p>We’re nearly a decade on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/24/lumo-review/">the original Lumo</a>, a game that, while it was clearly filled with love for old school isometric puzzling, came up a little short. Lumo 2 looks to better that game, bringing greater fidelity, new tricks and genres, and with hundreds more rooms and puzzles, platforming and adventuring.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Love Letter to the Golden Age of Gaming - Lumo 2 - Coming 17th October" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/McB44aIx8sc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can immediately appreciate that Lumo 2 is more detailed and visually varied than its predecessor, drawing on many more influences for its rooms and minigames, from puzzles that requiring perspective shifts to genre inserts like a side-scrolling shooter. There is no doubt Lumo 2 is a homage to the 8-bit era as a whole, with references to a lot of different games, many of which I admit passed me by, and is clearly intent on honouring the developers who pioneered those games.</p>



<p>The world of Lumo 2 is split into three distinct areas, one in space, one in a desert, and one in a spooky castle. In each of these worlds the main point is to collect the scattered paint to fill the cauldron related to that world back at the hub area, and to do this you need to explore every nook and cranny. You will start with a fixed view of rooms and can only move to where the camera allows you to see, but borrowing from the metroidvania, exploration will eventually unlock a double jump and ability to rotate the camera, offering new perspectives in rooms and showing new paths to take. You will also have a light for your wand which when lit will show hidden paths and doorways.</p>

<p>Puzzles can be fairly simple to overcome, or be much more complex and require precise timing to land on platforms and avoid obstacles. In the original Lumo, platforming was clunky and inaccurate. Unfortunately, the same applies to Lumo 2. The jump is just a bit too floaty, and there’s only a light hint of a drop shadow to show where you might land, and even that isn’t always accurate.&nbsp;It got to a point where in some rooms I was questioning my own depth perception (which according to my optician is fine), seeing the wizard missing platforms that he should have landed on. It is most frustrating in rooms with moving platforms where misjumps have you dropping down, and that could mean in some rooms falling to a lower level and trying to find your way back. There is no map in Lumo 2, so your choices are to memorise the layout or draw it out.</p>

<p>The wizard’s movement is also a bit slow. It isn’t that noticeable in the smaller rooms, but in wide open areas the running speed seems incredibly sluggish as you move between the puzzles. This really does drag down the experience, and combined with the inaccurate and frustrating platforming,</p>
<p>Lumo 2 becomes a game you are fighting against to play through, instead of taking in the various inspirations and nods that inspired the game. And that is part of the disappointment, because Lumo 2 really shines when it throws non-platforming levels at you, and you can absolutely feel the love and joy that was put into those creations. If this was a collection of minigames that you jumped between without the platforming, Lumo 2 would be fantastic.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Nine years on from the original, Lumo 2 writes another love letter to 80s gaming. While it branches out from isometric gaming with its many enjoyable diversions and asides, they're connected by too many rooms and sections that suffer from your sluggish movement and imprecise platforming.	</p></div>

			<p>Fromsoftserve, the developer behind the Bloodborne PC Remaster project, is fixing one of the PlayStation 4 release's most significant graphical shortcomings, making the emulated version of the game the definitive way to experience the FromSoftware action RPG.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, the project's developer confirmed they have figured out how to replace the low quality distant meshes that Bloodborne uses frequently to optimize performance on PlayStation 4. </p>



<p>At 1080p resolution and with the vanilla game's depth of field, these low-quality meshes are hardly noticeable, but at higher resolution on PC, they definitely are. As even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-4gb-vram-rx-580/">low-end machines have no trouble running the game with solid performance</a>, there's no need for these low-quality meshes anymore, which are being replaced with the full-fat version of the model. Judging from the video, the results promise to be stunning, enhancing the haunting beauty of Yarnham's central locations considerably with enhanced detail.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>When these improvements will be added to the Bloodborne PC Remaster project has yet to be determined. However, those who wish to experience the game developed by FromSoftware with a slew of visual improvements can <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files">download the project's current version from Nexus Mods. </a></p>



<p>The latest version of the project, version 0.93, was released on October 14 to restore baked lighting for better visuals while retaining some of the project's best improvements, including dynamic shadows. For a game relying so much on its eerie atmosphere, these additions vastly improve the Bloodborne PC experience made possible by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shadps4/">ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amid the busy halls of the Makuhari Messe during this year’s Tokyo Game Show, we were able to carve out a brief fifteen minutes to talk with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Director Naoki Hamaguchi as Square-Enix was showing off the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series S|X releases of the first title in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy</a>. With questions being handled through an interpreter, we might not have gotten time to answer everything we wanted to know about the upcoming releases, but we were able to touch on some of the bigger questions on our readers’ minds.<a href=""></a></p>



<p><strong>In a <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt">recent interview</a>, you talked about how Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be on a Game Key Card rather than a physical cartridge. Do you see Nintendo ever increasing the speeds on these Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges so that this would not be a requirement in the future?</strong></p>



<p>Personally, I feel that the loading speed issue for the game cartridge is more about the hardware spec of the Nintendo Switch 2. I’m not with Nintendo, so I can’t really speak to that side. That said, I do feel that the Game Key Card format that Nintendo created for the Nintendo Switch 2 is a really amazing new idea that they had offered for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t personally see Nintendo working towards trying to improve the loading speed for the cartridges. Rather, I feel that Nintendo will put more effort into popularizing the Game Key Card format which again is a really fantastic idea for us developers. Also, we hope players familiarize themselves with what that costs them. That obviously is something we can help out with as well, from the developer side.</p>



<p>I think that the collaborative effort between Nintendo and publishers trying to promote the Game Key Card will be the best way forward for all players in the future.</p>



<p><strong>These new versions of Final Fantasy VII Remake have several accessibility options, like Easy mode or infinite health, available through the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-dev-streamlined-progression-players-should-have-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Streamlined Progression feature</a>. Are these in reaction to the original release's too-difficult reception?</strong></p>



<p>Those features are not really about balancing the game. We’re actually quite confident about that because we did fine-tuning until the very end of development, so I think the balance itself is very good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason why we wanted to implement those features is to address the way modern audiences play video games being so diversified these days. Originally, with console video games, people would play on their TV in the living room, then we saw more players playing in their bedroom or on a PC. Now, we also see more players on handheld devices outdoors. In general, the way people approach and play video games is just so diverse, so we wanted to bring an idea that reflects that. It’s not just the way you play games in general, but we wanted to bring a diversified way to play <em>our</em> games, which is why we implemented those features.</p>



<p><strong>Would you ever consider developing a mobile version of the Final Fantasy VII trilogy?</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, we do want to bring our games to a wider audience. When we look at the market landscape of the mobile side, particularly iPhone and Android users, we don’t really feel that there’s quite the demand to justify us creating a mobile port of the Final Fantasy VII Remake project. If there is a demand, we would definitely want to look forward to hearing that.</p>



<p>As of this moment, I don’t think the demand is quite there yet from a business perspective. We will continue to look at the market trends and if there is the right opportunity at the right moment, that’s when we will revisit this topic.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any plans for a DLC to bridge the gap between Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and the third title in the Remake project, similar to Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade?</strong></p>



<p>There were definitely some ideas to create a Rebirth DLC and that was the plan at a certain point in time, but when we revisited this topic and we thought about what our priorities should be and what the fans are looking forward to the most. We figured that what fans want the most is to bring the third installment as soon as possible. That would take priority over the Rebirth DLC, so we decided to take that approach.</p>



<p>With that being said, once we release the third installment, there is the possibility of having a DLC for that third installment. With the conclusion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, there’s probably going to be a much wider audience for Final Fantasy as a whole.&nbsp;Whether we bring another new DLC or a full title, that’s something we are actively considering.</p>



<p><strong>If enough fans ask for it, would you consider a standalone Queen’s Blood game to be a priority?</strong></p>



<p>As I mentioned in my previous response, the utmost importance right now is to work hard towards that third installment and make sure it gets released as soon as possible with the highest quality achievable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, the solo Queen’s Blood title is probably not in the list of our priorities. We actually haven’t determined any priorities after the release of the third installment, so things are really up in the air right now. If there is enough demand, a solo Queen’s Blood title is definitely something we can consider.</p>



<p><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has a massive soundtrack. My last question to you: is there one specific song that you’ve had on repeat or listened to the most out of the whole soundtrack?</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, there’s the staples like the Final Fantasy main theme that we’ve heard over and over, but for me personally, I do like the Stamp song Bow Wow Wow (Chuken Stamp).</p>



<p><strong>It’s very catchy.</strong></p>



<p>I hope a lot of people like that track too.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There are plenty of Pokémon to encounter in Pokémon Legends: Z-A across Lumiose City, with Wild Zones having different spawns for Pokémon. For all the details on Wild Zone 2, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<p>Wild Zone 2 may be accessible very early in the story, but it’s well worth hunting for new additions to your party here as there are three Pokémon that can be evolved to unlock Mega Evolutions later on, so adding them to your ranks early on is advised to increase their levels in anticipation for battles.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for a specific Pokémon, here are the details on everything you can find in Wild Zone 2 in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Fishing time. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Wild Zone 2 in Pokémon Legends: Z-A is available to explore after you complete Main Mission 5, and is one of the earliest areas you will be able to explore.</strong></p>



<p>There are six Pokémon species in total to find and catch to earn the golden crown for fully discovering the Pokémon in Wild Zone 2, earning a chunk of points towards Mable’s Research rewards.</p>



<p>The table below shows all Pokémon that spawn in Wild Zone 2, the time of day required, and notes on the specific location where they can be found.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon </th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Binacle</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Central island &amp; left side</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Budew</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Left side</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kakuna</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">On trees</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Magikarp</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Water</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Patrat</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Central island &amp; left side</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Staryu</td><td data-align="center">Night</td><td data-align="center">Water</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>There is one spawn point for Alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 2, with the Pokémon that appears depending on the time of day.</strong></p>



<p>The locked spawn point for the Alpha Pokémon is located on the right-hand side of the zone from the fast-travel point, accessible via stepping stones from the top-right of the zone.</p>



<p>Other Pokémon in Wild Zone 2 can spawn as Alpha Pokémon, however, as every spawn has a chance of appearing as an Alpha. However, there are guaranteed spawns that can be farmed for valuable resources like EXP Candies.</p>



<p>All the details you need on alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 2 are below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon </th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Alpha Magikarp</td><td data-align="center">Day</td><td data-align="center">Far-right from fast travel point</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Alpha Staryu</td><td data-align="center">Night</td><td data-align="center">Far-right from the fast travel point</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<ul>
<li>We've adjusted the alarm clock in "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" to make it easier to see.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues and improved stability.</li>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> might have bagged more headlines, but it's far from the only ambitious modding project being worked on for a Bethesda game with the goal of putting a fresh spin on a classic. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>: Project Arroyo arguably has an even tougher task, with its team aiming to reimagine the turn-based and isometric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-2">Fallout 2</a> through Fallout 4's 3D action lens.</p>
<p>In a fresh interview with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDvULKQCbmQ">AVV Gaming</a> that also sheds light on how the team are hoping to incorporate aspects of an original Fallout remake mod that was mothballed last year, Project Arroyo lead Damion Daponte has discussed how they've approached the difficult task of deciding how much to tweak as they reinterpret the 90s RPG.</p>

<p>"I would say the hardest part is walking the thin line of not making a completely different game than Fallout 2, but also not keeping it exactly [how it is]," Daponte said in response to being asked about the project's biggest challenges. "Because we could easily just keep it exactly the same, but I will say, especially in this engine, it will be a worse game if we do keep it exactly the same. Even if people don't realise that. I'm sure some people will get angry that we've changed anything. There's really no winning when it comes out. I think most of the changes will be for the better."</p>
<p>As you might expect given the nature of the two games, Daponte outlined that most of the changes the Project Arroyo team are making are related to how Fallout 2's tales and locations are best packaged in a Fallout 4-style game. For example, rather than putting together one big open world space to house everything, as was originally the plan, the modders have opted to break things up into hub worlds that are better at translating Fallout 2's broader geography. So, you won't be able to see San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge from everywhere, but the aim's to have enough custom locations and encounters in and around each hub to give folks their exploration fix.</p>

<p>As for adapting individual missions or levels, Daponte outlined the process as follows:</p>
<blockquote>We will block out the area very similarly to how Fallout 2 blocked out the level. However, there will be some minor changes [that] I'll know immediately [to make] with certain areas. For example, the church at the den area in Fallout 2. I wanted more options to enter. If you have a stealth build, I wanted the player to be able to lockpick the door in the back and come in through the back. And then on the inside there's crates and stuff. So, we laid out the crates in a way that the player could sneak in and hide behind the crates and loot them while there's people inside.</blockquote>
<p>In line with that, a lot of the changes stem from accounting for how the player's movement differs, and also elements like adding verticality to Fallout 2's fairly flat isometric sprawls. Presumably, they'll be taking a few cues from how Bethesda themselves reinvented Fallout as a 3D first-person action-RPG with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>.</p><p>It's a challenge that another Fallout 4 modding project, original Fallout remake project Fallout: Vault 13, also faced prior to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-4-fallout-1-remake-mod-fallout-vault-13-development-suspended">its development being suspended after releasing a demo</a> last year. Those modders were working closely with Project Arroyo's devs, and as such, the latter's team are hoping to incorporate an updated version of the NCR-heavy region around Shady Sands designed for Vault 13 into their creation. Daponte said its inclusion is contingent on how it affects performance, but if it's doable, it'll help speed up work towards an eventual release.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm keen to see what Daponte and co's project looks like whenever it comes out. As the modder acknowledged in this chat, there are plenty of folks who're aware of Fallout 2's contributions to the series' worldbuilding, but that don't get on well with how it plays mechanically. Even for those who do, it'd be another excuse to delve back in and see how Frank Horrigan's doing.</p>
