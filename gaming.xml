            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Following a whiplash-inducing 50-percent price hike for Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">the Xbox brand overall are in a funky place</a>. That nauseating price increase is likely the loudest adjustment being made to the once-decent Game Pass subscription service, but it’s far from the only one. Old tiers have been overhauled and renamed, with tighter restrictions on when you can access certain games and how many of them you’ll have access to, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">discounts and deals subscribers once enjoyed</a> are but ash scattered to the wind.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">The Enshittification Of Game Pass Is Here</a></p> <p>While the Ultimate plan now has a few more features than it once did, the sting of paying 50 percent extra has caused serious damage to the Xbox brand, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-lina-khan-ftc-microsoft-activision-merger-2000631611">progressive lawmakers saying “told ya so</a>” after Microsoft gobbled up a bunch of studios and publishers. This is all going down while <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-streaming-free-ad-supported-report-price-increase-2000631520">rumors of an ad-supported version of Xbox Game Streaming</a> are swimming around. That last point shouldn’t be surprising as <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ad-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-game-pass-1850987502">Xbox consoles have routinely been home to various ads</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/4i1LCVSdD7k?t=277">taking up your full screen</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/consoles/comments/1nw5so9/xbox_consoles_are_now_getting_a_fullscreen_xbox/">on boot</a>.</p>

 <p>As is customary for the first quarter of the 21st century, <a href="https://craphound.com/category/enshittification/">we’re all quoting comrade Doctorow</a> in response to these wild changes. But in case you’re looking to shrug off that late-stage-capitalism ennui with some gaming on Xbox, let’s break down what Game Pass now costs, and how you can still get it for pre-hike prices, for now.</p>

 <h2>How much does Game Pass cost now?</h2> <p>Following last week’s changes, Xbox Game Pass presently offers three tiers:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Essential ($10/month)</li> <li aria-level="1">Premium ($15/month)</li> <li aria-level="1">Ultimate ($30/month)</li> </ul> <p>All of these tiers let you play online multiplayer on Xbox, though <b>the number of games available and when you get access to them varies</b>. Essential and Premium don’t offer day-one access for new Xbox games. Premium, however, lets you play recently released Xbox titles “within 12 months of launch.” Ultimate (which will run you a ridiculous $360/year if you hang on to your sub all year) grants you the most games with the fastest access: Day-one availability on first- and third-party games, plus all the games in EA Play and Ubisoft+ Classics.</p>

 <p>You can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass#join">check out the full details on Xbox’s site</a>, but it’s clear that Game Pass isn’t only more expensive than it once was, it’s also become far more complicated than just throwing a modest sum of money at Microsoft per month to be sure you can play the new <i>Gears</i> or <i>COD</i> at launch.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-game-pass-price-xbox-ally-leak-marvel-rivals-cross-platform-2000631038">GameStop Hits Back At Massive Xbox Game Pass Price Hike</a></p> <p><b>There’s also a PC-only plan for $16.49/month</b> which promises day-one availability of Xbox-published games, as well as some third-party ones. It also includes EA Play.</p>

 <h2>Hang on to Game Pass for Console if ya got it</h2> <p>There’s a select group of Game Pass subscribers who will be happy to know they just dodged a bullet (for now, anyway). As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox-game-pass-console-grandfather-accounts/">confirmed by our comrades over at <i>Polygon</i></a>, if you are presently subscribed to the now-phased-out Game Pass for Console and automatic payment is still set up and functioning, you will be grandfathered in with all of the benefits of the old subscription.</p>

 <p>Should you cancel payments, however, you’ll lose access to that retired plan and will need to choose among the three poison pills of a service Microsoft is selling you. Checking which plan you have is as simple as logging in to Game Pass’ website, clicking on “My Microsoft Account” and checking what active subscriptions you currently have.</p> <h2>GameStop is still selling subs at the older prices (for now)</h2> <p>In an unlikely turn of events, GameStop of all companies has lol’d at Xbox by continuing to sell Ultimate subscriptions for just $20/month. It may be worth checking out other retailers, probably in brick and mortar stores, to see if you can snag a subscription card for a cheaper price as well.</p> <h2>Discounts got the ax. Now it’s all about “Rewards”</h2> <p>One of the cooler things about the Game Pass of Old™ was that you’d regularly get access to exclusive discounts on games and DLC. That’s obviously no longer in Microsoft’s interests to offer you as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-it-scrapped-the-xbox-game-pass-discount-on-all-games-and-dlc-purchases-gives-subscribers-more-rewards-points-instead">Microsoft has confirmed to <i>IGN</i></a> that instead of getting a 10-percent discount on DLC, you’ll now just earn more Rewards.</p>

 <p>“Rewards” are a non-Xbox-exclusive program that basically lets you earn money to spend on various Microsoft products. You can earn points otherwise by browsing the web with Bing while using Microsoft Edge (lol what are we doing here, ya’ll?), and now by playing games with an active Game Pass subscription.</p> <p>If that sounds confusing, I regret to inform you that it’s probably that way by design. Essential will net you up to $25 in rewards per year, Premium allows for up to $50, and Ultimate will let you earn up to $100. You can read all of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/rewards/about">nitty gritty details about the Microsoft Rewards program here</a>.</p>

 <h2>What are other gaming subscription services charging?</h2> <p>Pricier subs, the death of discounts, it all sounds painful and it is! That might have you wondering what’s going on with other subscription services, especially if you value an ongoing service over just straight-up purchasing and owning your games.</p> <p><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions">PlayStation has a similar three-tier structure</a> (no options for PC gamers though). The most costly version of these will only cost you $160 for the full year, which is a full $200 less than what Xbox is charging for Ultimate. The most basic version of its subscription service will only cost you $80/year, but it doesn’t come with a game catalog. You’ll need to buy the middle-tier option at a minimum for that, which will run you $15/month or $135/year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/online/">Nintendo has two subscription services</a> but doesn’t offer any Switch games via a Netflix-style, download-on-demand service. Its most basic service costs $20/year, lets you play online among other benefits, and lets you play from a library of NES, SNES, and Game Boy games whenever you want. At $50/year, a pricier tier expands that retro library to include select GameCube, GBA, N64, and Sega Genesis games (yes, really!).</p>

 <h2>A reminder: No company can increase the cost of games you fully ‘own’</h2> <p>I put ‘own’ in quotes there because, especially on PC, there’s debate as to whether or not our Steam libraries (or any digital library) is made up of the games themselves, or is just a collection of licenses granting us access to the games. (There’s always GOG if you want to be sure you’ll just get straight up .exe files of your games, though it is a more limited collection.) But that argument aside, if you plunk down $60-70 bucks to snag a new game that doesn’t have a perpetual monetization scheme baked into it, you will continue to have access to that game without needing a corporation to charge you every month.</p> <p>Maybe you’ll have a smaller library of games available to you at any given moment, but at least they’ll be yours. Period. Consider it.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-console-leak-rumor-costco-sams-club-2000632026">Xbox Still Swears It’s Not Giving Up On Console As Fan Morale Craters</a></p> <p>Subscriptions make sense for many folks, no doubt. But having direct access to your games keeps you away from these kinds of shenanigans, and I shudder to think there’s a generation of gamers growing up right now that think more about getting an Ultimate Game Pass card for their birthdays or holidays than an actual copy, digital or physical, of a game that they’ll own for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Coming 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Revolution Software has unveiled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_the_smoking_mirror_reforged">Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged</a>, an enhanced rerelease of the second game in the Broken Sword series. And it's coming to Switch, alongside other platforms, in early 2026.</p>
<p>Originally teased <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/broken-sword-reforged-team-teases-another-remaster-might-be-on-the-cards">much earlier this year</a>, The Smoking Mirror appropriately follows on from the excellent 2024 enhanced release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_shadow_of_the_templars_reforged">Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</a> and brings with it the same bells and whistles. Though it <em>is</em> getting a 4K release this time — perhaps a free patch for Switch 2 owners, then? We hope so...</p>
<p>The Smoking Mirror is perhaps equally as beloved as the first game, so we're sure fans are extremely excited to dive into this rerelease. Plus, for those who want an extra dose of nostalgia, you can swap between the 1997 visuals and the new 'reforged' ones here, too.</p>
<p>Taking place six months after Shadow of the Templars, George Stobbart reunites with his friend Nico Collard in Paris; she's been researching Mayan history after receiving a Mayan stone tablet. But this path takes the pair on the road to unravelling a deadly conspiracy, all across Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America.</p>


<p>Not only will you be able to swap between the old and new visuals, but you'll once again have the chance to play 'traditional mode', where puzzles are harder, or a 'story mode' if you need a few hints along the way.</p>
<p>Right now, we've got to wait until next year to get our hands on The Smoking Mirror, but if you haven't checked out Shadow of the Templars, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged">we highly recommend it</a>.</p>

Better yet, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6D8BR?object_uuid=6034817e-26e6-4737-83e4-709a58b40a4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>a bundle of all four is discounted at Amazon right now</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fallout Commander Decks: Under $40 Each With This Bundle Deal</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has all four decks for $144.99, a reduction of 11% on the $162.99 list price. That might not sound like a huge amount, but consider what that value represents when the Mutant Menace deck is selling for $70 and upwards on its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the decks, the good news is that they’re all pretty great. Mutant Menace is one of the best, powering up its spooky Mothman Commander with counters as you deal radiation to everyone else at the table, while Hail Caesar is all about being aggressive and sacrificing cards to power up Caesar himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Science! offers something a little different since it leans into energy counters and powering up the board with artifacts, while Scrappy Survivors is definitely popular since it’s helmed by the adorable Dogmeat and has the series’ four-legged star rummaging through your graveyard for equipment and tokens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a reminder, each of these decks comes with a Collector Booster Sample Pack, too. They contain two cards each, but it’s better than getting irradiated, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you already have any of these, Amazon has discounts on a couple of them, too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have previewed some of the gameplay tweaks and balance changes coming with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> day one patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Information about the first patch for this week’s long-awaited back-to-basics Battlefield game was outlined in a post on <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-play-your-way" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its official website</u></a> today. It comes with a breakdown from the team explaining how their pre-release Battlefield Labs and beta tests helped them prepare for launch, with the first Battlefield 6 patch set to provide an even more stable foundation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who played the Battlefield 6 open beta in August will notice several fundamental changes to how the DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive-developed game feels after its day one patch is downloaded. Today’s first look at the Battlefield 6 launch update is only a taste of what's to come, with full patch notes for the more than 200 changes set to arrive later this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Topping the list are tweaks the BF Studios team says will make movement feel more responsive, including fixes for “several movement issues” and changes to pacing. Weapon attachments should also display correctly across the Battlefield 6 experience, with the day one patch also promising rebalanced automatic weapons that make long-range gunplay more rewarding for tap firing and burst control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beta players will also be happy to hear Rush and Breakthrough have been reworked to improve balance between both the attacking and defending teams. Gadgets in Battlefield 6 will also be changed for the day one patch. The MBT-LAW, for example, is now set as the default Engineer launcher, while the MAS 148 now behaves more realistically, and Deploy Beacons have been updated to limit one spawn per player.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Battlefield 6 day one patch also promises updated UI and HUD elements, cleaner audio, improved network stability, and more, today’s post also comes with an update on one of the most hotly contested topics in the community: Open vs. Closed Weapons. Closed locks guns to specific classes, while Open allows each class to utilize a variety of different weapon types. Despite waves of fans hoping to see the BF Studios team lean on Closed classes for Battlefield 6, the team insisted in today’s post that Open classes were preferred by “the vast majority of players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lastly, another key insight from the Open Beta was that the vast majority of players, after trying both playlist types, chose to stick with Open Weapons,” BF Studios says. “This reinforces our belief that Open Weapons is the right path forward for Battlefield 6. At the same time, we recognize that some players prefer the Closed Weapons experience. To support them, official Closed Weapons playlists will be available at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Additionally, Closed Weapons mutators will remain part of the Portal toolset, so players can create and share their own custom experiences.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 has a release date of October 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.

<p>One of the primary reasons Microsoft purchased COD publisher Activision Blizzard was to get new exclusive titles for Game Pass and drive the growth of that subscription service. However, Bloomberg's report notes that Game Pass' subscriber growth has slowed significantly since 2020, and Microsoft hasn't shared its subscriber numbers since it hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-is-not-coming-to-ps5-or-switch-memberships-rise-to-34-million/1100-6521132/" data-ref-id="1100-6521132">34 million in February 2024</a>.</p><p>Microsoft recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">price hikes for Game Pass</a>, including a $30 monthly fee for Game Pass Ultimate to get titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> on day one. Lina Kahn--the ex-commission chair of the Federal Trade Commission who opposed Microsoft's Activision buyout--<a href="https://x.com/linamkhan/status/1974192096841265511" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently wrote</a> that "Microsoft's acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers."</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will be on Game Pass Ultimate when it launches on November 14 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After a pretty abysmal live stream where Bungie defeatedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">confirmed that one of its developers had lifted the work of another artist and put it in its new shooter</a>, Marathon, without permission, attribution, or compensation, you could practically taste the delay announcement incoming. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-rumor-of-no-marketing-plans-suggests-potential-delay/">A sudden lack of any marketing</a> for Marathon further pushed the rumour of a delay, and a month later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">by June 2025, it was official</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, we've not seen hide nor hair of Marathon (though Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-star-wars-expansion-renegades-bungie/">has been active with new Destiny 2 content</a>), and you would absolutely not be the first to have speculated that the game was never going to come back. Not so, it would seem. Bungie proved, at least to some degree, that Marathon is not dead, and has opened a new round of sign-ups for a Closed Technical Test taking place later this month.</p>



<p>The test is invite-only, and players wishing to participate will have to sign an NDA in order to do so. The test will run later this month, from October 22-27, 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/techtestapply">blog post on Bungie's website,</a> the studio adds that it has been running closed tests since June, and this is the first one it is looking to open up to more players. The test will include three maps, proximity chat, a solo queue, and "<em>re-tuned</em>" combat.</p>



<p>Bungie claims it'll talk more about what's next for Marathon at some point after the conclusion of the test. The last we heard about Marathon's release window is that it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/">currently set for sometime in March 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>
In the late '90s, early 2000s, there were two distinct flavours of aesthetics: boomer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>, and Y2K girlypop vibes (for the sake of this argument we will ignore every other aesthetic that existed at the time). Boomer shooters like Doom and Wolfenstein were bloody, gory, and had a real "video games are gritty and cool now kind of vibe." Conversely, products aimed at young girls were often glittery, pink, featured leopard print, and were often about love and harmony. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/incolatus-dont-stop-girlypop">Don't Stop, Girlypop!</a> is a game that combines these two vibes, and it is very good (and stressful).
</p>
<p>
Quite specifically, Don't Stop, Girlypop is a self-described "Y2K arena movement shooter where standing still is not an option." You really do have to be constantly on the move, there's even a combo meter that raises higher and higher letting you go faster and subsequently damage more. I had a go at its new demo that just came out today, and let me tell you, I felt like I was having a heart attack, in as positive a way as I can put that.
</p>
<p>
This is a game where calling it maximalist would be an understatement. There's flip phones, you can customise your arms to have funky patterns, you can put little bows on your guns, enemies are constantly coming at you from all angles, and you need to be ready to take them down quickly, because everything moves fast in this world. The thing is, I'm not very good at shooters, so in my experience of its demo, I quickly got overwhelmed. Even still I could find myself learning the ropes as I went along, and I'm sure more experienced shooter aficionados could get to grips with it pretty quickly.
</p>
<p>
Outside of loving its vibe, I'm into the equally over the top story - "Mining corp Tigris Nix wants to drain your world of The Love, a natural force keeping your planet alive. Lay waste to its robot drones to heal the Oasis!" That's all ridiculous! Yet it matches the tone of its look, and has a healthy amount of corporation frustration, always an added bonus in my eyes.
</p>
<p>
Don't Stop, Girlypop! doesn't have a release date just yet, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2610650/Dont_Stop_Girlypop/">but you can wishlist it and try out its demo on Steam now</a>.

The creative direction, permeating enemy designs, architecture, and even the language of signage outside facilities of interest are all rooted in the cultural influences that the team grew up within.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This identity, as CEO and co-founder David Carrasco told Game Developer at Tokyo Game Show, was a hard sell for some when searching for a publisher.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Without saying names, some mentioned it, but one specific publisher asked us to translate the signage to English," Carrasco said. "To us, that was almost untouchable, because if we're trying to propose a game with Hispanic folklore and with such a strong traditional component, doing so would dramatically decrease its veracity. It's like making a game with Samurais where everything is in English."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even amidst visual references and signage in Spanish, Carrasco said the team worked on the concept of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crisol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with an international audience in mind. For example, if a player approaches one of these signs, an in-game caption translates them. But some publishers expressed zero interest in this, or in the cultural aspect altogether.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There was one publisher who said, 'but who's gonna be interested in Hispanic culture, in Spanish culture?,' to which we said, in God of War, who's gonna be interested in Vikings? You don't need to be knowledgeable of Hispanic philosophy or art history to want to play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crisol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But you put these things in there and there'll be people who will be interested."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/indie-hit-megabonk-moves-over-a-million-copies-in-two-weeks" target="_self" data-discover="true">Indie hit Megabonk moves over a million copies in two weeks</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vermila has been working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crisol </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">for over five years, with the game slated for launch in early 2026. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/thq-parent-company-embracer-has-purchased-i-metro-i-dev-4a-games-and-others">Embracer Group acquired</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the studio in August 2020 for €0.9 million (around $1.06 million at the time), and according to the official site, the team also received a MegaGrant funding from Epic Games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The survival horror of scope creep">The survival horror of scope creep</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As time passed, Carrasco explained that the studio's debut project considerably grew in size. For reference, the team is composed of 20 people and some contractors. Vermila then reacquired itself, and spent what Carrasco called a considerable time looking for a new publisher.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We've already suffered in the desert, but given the chance to do it all over again, I'd have probably made a smaller project, something we could have tackled in two to three years," he said. "But in the end, with this being such a big project with a small team and such a high production level, it had a strong impact when we started looking for funding and [to] garner publisher interest. You're not saying, 'I need a small amount of money,' you're saying, 'not only do I need a much bigger amount, but instead of projecting this game six months from now, it's going to take two years.'"</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/funcom-is-closing-metal-hellslinger-developer-the-outsiders" target="_self" data-discover="true">Funcom is closing Metal: Hellsinger developer The Outsiders</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Carrasco said Vermila signed with Blumhouse Games around a year and a half ago, and that the publisher has granted the team "tremendous" creative and artistic freedom. The developer had a second "finalist" in mind that offered a similar approach, but as Carrasco explained, finding publishers willing to grant this autonomy is far from easy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are publishers who take a look and say, I want this graphics quality, I'm very interested in the mechanic about using blood to reload weapons, and I see you build levels well, but I really don't care about those Spanish things," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Carrasco recalled a publisher's suggestion to center </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crisol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> around an undisclosed country's civil war. He argued that it's better to speak about what you know and what you grew up with, as opposed to another country's culture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But some of the proposed changes sought to alter the game almost entirely. According to Carrasco, Vermila was asked to replace the game's religious statues with zombies or soldiers. When he tried to counter that doing so would drain the meaning from the story and original concept, he was told that "it has the meaning that I want, because I'm the one who has the money."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cloverpit-has-sold-500-000-units-in-eight-days" target="_self" data-discover="true">CloverPit has sold 500,000 units in eight days</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Publisher pressure can crush authenticity">Publisher pressure can crush authenticity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As anecdotal as these conversations are, Carrasco emphasized the serious pressure of having to make decisions to keep the lights on, and how that can sometimes compromise a project's creative vision.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As you search for publishers who give you more freedom, the closer you're getting to the end of your capital, the less you start caring, because what you want is for the company to stay alive and to at least release the game in the best possible state," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While he wouldn't call it a common occurrence, he said there are many companies who see an opportunity to make money with a game, and feel entitled to ask for changes because they can offer five, 10, or 20 million dollars. Going back to the example of the publisher asking to translate the signage to English, Carrasco said he would have made the compromise if he didn't have another choice, even if he wouldn't have been happy about it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Accepting certain fundings is dependent on the current situation of a studio and the state of a project," Carrasco said. "In many cases, they can turn your game into something much more generic or simplified that is drowned in a sea of projects with a similar style or genre. But perhaps that publisher makes the most sense and, well, if you have the financial need and don't have the money to stay afloat, then you have to start making decisions that oppose your artistic goals."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.

<figure data-uuid="8c96ac7ff2dc7"><a title="Sonic x Olympics" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8c96ac7ff2dc7/sonic-x-olympics.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA / International Olympic Committee</em></figcaption></figure><p>SEGA and the International Olympic Committee have today announced that they are teaming up on a new "co-branded merchandising programme" featuring none other than Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>The multi-year deal will see the blue blur cropping up alongside the Olympic rings in a whole range of merch planned for release next year. According to the <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-and-sega-announce-multi-year-licensing-agreement-featuring-sonic-the-hedgehog">official announcement</a>, SEGA and the IOC will now "explore opportunities to license the new designs for select merchandise collaborations", and we got the following first look at the 'Five Rings' collaboration to boot.</p>

<p>To be clear, the only specific that we've got so far is that the collaboration will feature <em>merchandise</em>. Importantly, that's not games. But come on, you know where everyone's mind went...</p>
<p>The collab announcements on the <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1975184289622065600">official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sonic-official.bsky.social/post/3m2jo6phzuk2k">BlueSky</a> accounts have been awash with replies hopeful of an '<strong>at the Olympic Games</strong>' comeback. Of course, Nintendo — and therefore, Mario — doesn't appear to be on board yet, but let's not pretend that Sonic hasn't had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/05/sonic_ditches_mario_in_his_very_own_olympic_games_tokyo_2020_release">solo Olympic adventures</a> in the past too.</p>




<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/rumour-mario-and-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-finished">last we heard</a>, the Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games series was dead in the water after the IOC apparently chose to end its partnership with Nintendo and SEGA to focus on NFTs and esports. That was according to series veteran Lee Cocker, who, after working on each entry in the franchise, claimed that it was "finished" after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_sonic_at_the_olympic_games_tokyo_2020">Tokyo 2020</a> instalment.</p>
<p>Whether the series actually returns or not remains to be seen, but at least the IOC and SEGA are back on speaking terms. We'll be keeping an eye out over the coming year for more information.</p>

Not thousands, millions,” he said during an interview this weekend. “And most of it is shit.”</p> <p>The choice comments came during a retrospective on his career at the BFI Southbank in London, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/ridley-scott-hollywood-drowning-in-mediocrity-1236570875/"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a>. Scott, whose 2024 blockbuster <em>Gladiator II</em> at one point featured a mostly green-screened sea battle within a colosseum with massive sharks, lamented that too many bad films are “saved” with digital effects added in post-production instead of relying on solid scripts.</p>

 <p>Scott was asked if he has any movie comfort foods. Why yes, yes he does: his own movies.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I watched Alien with his commentary last night and every other scene he said something along the lines of “damn that’s good” or “it hasn't aged at all” and I just nodded in agreement every time. <a href="https://t.co/iYnYyBpZaj">https://t.co/iYnYyBpZaj</a></p> <p>— Barto (@bartonovopolis) <a href="https://twitter.com/bartonovopolis/status/1975050651299426475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Well, actually, right now, I’m finding mediocrity–we’re drowning in mediocrity,” he said. “And so what I do–it’s a horrible thing–but I’ve started watching my own movies, and actually they’re pretty good! And also, they don’t age.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “I watched&nbsp;<em>Black Hawk</em>&nbsp;[<em>Down</em>] the other night and I thought, ‘How in the hell did I manage to do that?’ But I think occasionally a good one will happen, [and] it’s like a relief that there’s somebody out there who’s doing a good movie.”</p> <p>It’s unclear if he went on to mention what those “good ones” are. It would be hard to top 2023’s <em>Napoleon</em>, after all. Scott’s next movie is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller called <em>The Dog Stars</em>. It’s out March 2026.</p>

<p>The release, which comes either as a bundle or separately via the eShop, has garnered a fair bit of attention for its price over the last few weeks, but the simple fact remains that these are, in our opinion, two of the finest platformer games ever created, and they've never looked better.</p>
<p>In fact, our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2">recent review</a> ended with a coveted score of <strong>9/10</strong> in which we praised the boundless creativity on display along with the thoughtful visuals upgrades, but noted that the gyro controls don't quite stack up next to the original Wii controls. It's also currently sitting at a healthy 88 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2/">Metacritic</a> too, so that's nice.</p>

<p>If you don't agree with us though, that's absolutely fine! That's exactly what this poll is for. So feel free to apply your own score to Galaxy and Galaxy 2 below. And if you haven't played it yet, or you feel like changing your mind at a later date, then fear not, you can always come back later – we'll be here waiting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Pearl Abyss's upcoming Crimson Desert finally has a release date after being<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/"> delayed this past August (at least publicly) for the second time</a>. Its<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/"> first major delay in 2021 was an indefinite delay </a>with no new release date in sight, and since then, we've seen it appear <a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">at annual shows like Gamescom</a> with gameplay demos that did not lead to release date reveals, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">including this year's Gamescom show</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, we only got its release date reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">last week during PlayStation's State of Play event</a>, confirming that it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming March 19, 2026. Now that we have a release date though, we can look forward to its arrival and look at gameplay showcases with a more engaged eye, since we know it'll be in our hands within the next six months.</p>



<p>As part of IGN's First preview series, a new 11 minute gameplay video showcases one of the many quests you'll encounter in Crimson Desert, though for the most part it features a fairly bombastic boss fight, one of the many you'll have to face in the open-world action-adventure game.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, we've been waiting on and hearing about Pearl Abyss's upcoming open-world title for six years. It'll be seven by the time we actually have the game in our hands next March. For even more context, back when <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">Wccftech spoke to Pearl Abyss in 2019</a>, the studio said it was "<em>very positive</em>" about Google Stadia, as we were starting to learn more about Crimson Desert and where it would be playable.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we've seen the last delay Crimson Desert is going to get, and can just look forward to its launch on Mach 19, 2026. </p>

                <p>The latest Pokemon event at GameStop hasn't gone as many would like, to say the least. The retailer distributed physical cards containing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-a-free-shiny-koraidon-and-miraidon-in-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet/1100-6534715/" data-ref-id="1100-6534715">codes for Shiny Koraidon and Shiny Miraidon</a> to be redeemed in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet beginning September 26. But after the well of codes quickly ran dry, GameStop announced that a second wave of codes arrived this past weekend, albeit with a catch.</p><p>GameStop has approximately 50 codes per store, according to a statement on X. These codes will be printed on receipts instead of the usual cards with unique art. The statement emphasizes the limited nature of this second round, adding that the retailer is committed to distributing every code it receives and providing more if The Pokemon Company makes them available.</p><p>This event has drawn outcry from Pokemon fans, who point out the scarcity of the codes and the prevalence of scalpers on platforms such as eBay who are selling code distribution cards. Many also believe that 50 codes per store is still not enough to meet demand. GameStop appeared to shift blame toward The Pokemon Company, responding to complaints of the limited supply by tersely <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1974637403609718984" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stating on X</a>: "Not our decision."</p><p>According to GameStop's initial <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1974565308112445874" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announcement of the additional codes</a>, the company "bugged" The Pokemon Company for them until the company "gave in." The Shiny Koraidon and Shiny Miraidon event is scheduled to end on October 15.</p><p>Some distribution events for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet have utilized the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-how-to-get-these-shiny-legendary-pokemon/1100-6533355/" data-ref-id="1100-6533355">games' Mystery Gift feature</a>, which allows players to claim items or Pokemon. Mystery Gift only requires an internet connection to receive any gifts and doesn't require any codes, let alone codes that players must obtain in physical form.</p><p>Next up for the franchise is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, which releases on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 16. The action RPG will also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-paid-dlc-and-two-shocking-new-mega-evolutions/1100-6534700/" data-ref-id="1100-6534700">receive post-launch DLC</a>, along with its own distribution events in the future. Here's hoping that those ones go a lot smoother.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Outsiders, the Swedish studio behind the rhythm-based heavy metal shooter <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metal-hellsinger/a-rhythmic-symphony-of-destruction">Metal: Hellsinger</a>, is closing its doors as a result of layoffs at developer/publisher Funcom.&nbsp;</p><p>“Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting,’ says The Outsiders’ founder and creative director, David Goldfarb, who took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/locust9.bsky.social/post/3m2jumlqlmc2m">social media</a> to announce the closure of the 10-year-old studio. You can read his full statement below.&nbsp;</p><p>Friends,</p><p>I have not had much time to process the news but all of us at The Outsiders and Funcom Stockholm have been affected by the layoffs at Funcom and our 10 year old studio will be closing. Many of us had survived a near-death studio experience years back when Darkborn was cancelled, and because of this team’s loyalty and refusal to quit, Metal Hellsinger was born. It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen.&nbsp;</p><p>We had hoped to do something even better this time--</p><p>--Things don’t always go the way you hope.&nbsp;</p><p>But we are not giving up, and we are going to try to continue on in some new form. If you think you can help in any way, with business leads, placement for employees, guidance, whatever it is, I would be genuinely grateful if you reach out here. Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting. Thanks so much.</p><p>The Outsiders, which was acquired by Funcom in 2021, is another casualty of layoffs across Funcom following last week’s news that the internal development team behind this year’s Dune: Awakening <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies">was also impacted</a> as part of a “studio restructuring.” The Norway-based Funcom was acquired by Chinese megacorporation Tencent in 2020 and has studios operating in Romania, Portugal, and the US via North Carolina.&nbsp;</p><p>The now-defunct studio is best known for Metal: Hellsinger, a rhythm-based first-person shooter that was released in 2022. Set in Hell, players wielded a variety of weapons to blast demons to the beats of a heavy metal soundtrack. The game received positive reviews and scored a 9 out of 10 here at <em>Game Informer</em>.&nbsp;Reviewer Wesley LeBlanc wrote, "What the game gets right far outshines what it doesn’t, and the developer, The Outsiders, has created what I hope is just the start of a new FPS franchise set in Hell."</p><p>The Outsiders joins the list of shuttered studios this year, which includes Monolith Productions (Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor/F.E.A.R.), Player First Games (MultiVersus), <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/28/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-its-developer-cliffhanger-games">Cliffhanger Games</a> (Black Panther), and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-lays-off-thousands-of-employees-cancels-perfect-dark-everwild-and-more-xbox">The Initiative</a> (Perfect Dark).&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/06/metal-hellsinger-developer-the-outsiders-is-shutting-down]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-tracing-qa-fsr4-omm-ser-support-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest tech-focused interview with Gaijin Entertainment</a>, we asked the programmers behind the War Thunder game and the Dagor Engine whether Sony's PS5 Pro can support the new path tracing global illumination technology <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-traced-global-illumination-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently introduced on PC with the game's Leviathan update</a>. Here's their response:</p>



<p><em><strong>László Perneky (Lead Programmer):</strong>&nbsp;Technically, it could; the only question is with performance. It is a decision for the future, though. First, we focus on releasing RT support for consoles, with all the effects except PTGI (hopefully very soon). Then, we will have a better picture of how much GPU budget we have to include PTGI and if we can make changes to it to fit that budget.</em></p>



<p>You might recall that about a year ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we asked a similar question to PS5 Pro Lead System Architect Mark Cerny</a>, who was very cautious about committing one way or another:</p>



<p><em>One difficulty in answering your question is that there are so many strategies for doing ray tracing or path tracing. Just to give an example, the engine that drives Alan Wake 2 is very, very different from the engine that drives Cyberpunk 2077. I really hesitate to say that PlayStation 5 Pro can or can't do path tracing, but you need to have a highly optimized strategy for doing it if you're going to do it on PS5 Pro.</em></p>



<p>To this day, no game has introduced path tracing support on PS5 Pro. War Thunder might be the best chance the console has to pull it off, since it is not a full-fledged path tracing but just PTGI. However, it is more likely that console users will have to wait for the PS6 to get proper path tracing support.</p>



<p>In the aforementioned interview with Gaijin, we also inquired about the Nintendo Switch 2 and whether there would be any port of War Thunder and/or Enlisted for the new console. Here's what CEO Anton Yudintsev told us:</p>



<p><em><strong>Anton Yudintsev (CEO:</strong> We’re always eager to be among the first to support new devices, so we’re definitely considering Switch 2 versions of our games. Unfortunately, right now we’re still waiting for the requested Switch 2 dev kits.</em></p>



<p>If a developer the size of Gaijin is still waiting for their Switch 2 devkits, it seems like the situation hasn't improved much since <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-devkit-developers-access-nintendo-driect-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our previous report on the devkits shortage in July</a>. This is unfortunate, as many developers would be very eager to port their games to the highly successful console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released a Psion UA update for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. This new version of playtest material for the popular fantasy TTRPG introduces tweaks and changes to the Psion class, a casting class that focuses on psychic powers.</p>



<p>In a blog post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2072-designer-insights-from-unearthed-arcana-psion#the-updated-psion" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a> the design team discussed the changes in the Psion UA update. It covers the fundamental parts of the Psion, like its class features and its Psionic Energy dice, as well as tweaks to three of its subclasses. The fourth subclass, the Psi Warper, has been unchanged from the previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-class-introduced-in-new-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a>.</p>

Telekinetic Propel and Telepathic Connection are now baseline abilities; you can use them at will as a Bonus Action. They can also be enhanced with Psionic Energy dice. Certain effects have been reworded so you only lose energy dice if your target fails a saving throw. Psionic Modes have been removed, and you have more means of regaining energy dice.</p>

<p>The Metamorph subclass has received some buffs across the board. Now, whenever you use a Psionic Energy dice, you gain temporary hit points. The Life-Bending Weapons feature deals additional damage without spending Psionic Energy dice. Curiously, the UA specifies that if the Psion shows up in a future book, it will include magic items that enhance the subclass' Organic Weapons feature.</p>

<p>The Psykinetic is another subclass that has been bumped up. It has a new feature called Stronger Telekinesis, which enhances the Mage Hand spell, letting it carry up to 20 pounds of weight. The reworked level six feature, Destructive Trance, adds bonus damage to spell attacks. And certain mid-to-late features like Rebounding Field and Heightened Telekinesis either don't use dice, spell slots, or provide temporary hit points.</p>

<p>The most significant changes are reserved for the Telepath subclass. New spells have been added to its spell list, The Potent Thoughts feature greatly extends the use of telepathy to 60 feet. The Scramble Minds feature has been simplified to where enemy behavior is dictated by the caster and not by random dice rolls. This helps add more utility to the subclass without dragging down the pacing of a fight.</p>

<p>The feedback form for the Psion UA update playtest material opens October 9.</p>

            <p>I dunno about you, but I usually dig a big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">mod</a> that threatens to make my number of hours spent padding around Tamriel even more ludicrous. Lordbound is the latest danger to the free time of poor folks like me, having just soft launched after ten years of development spent creating a fresh region bigger than the Dragonborn DLC's Solstheim and filling it with stuff to do.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160493">The mod</a>'s set in the Druadach Valley between Skyrim and Daggerfall's setting of High Rock, and so offers a chance to mix it up with tribal orcs, Imperial legionnaires, and highfalutin Breton lords. Think The Reach, but with a few less plant-hearted warriors and weird bird-ladies. Those three factions form the pillars of "the biggest main quest you've ever played in Skyrim, with choices and consequences that change the state of the valley". Here's a synopsis of the situation you'll walk into:</p>
<blockquote><p>The drums of war are beating inside the Druadach Valley. After two hundred years of isolation the valley has restored its severed connections to the provinces of Skyrim and High Rock, exposing its withered remains to the rest of Tamriel. Chief Gorek of Garshakur refuses to surrender his mountain fortress to the Imperial Legion, denying them control of the highly-valued trade route between the cities of Jehanna and Solitude.</p>
<p>As the war wages on, the people of Druadach are forced to seek protection within the walls of Highreach, home of the young Lord Haelan - but even the last bastion of Druadach is threatening to fall at the hands of a mysterious knight of unknown origin, leaving only death in its wake. Whatever the choices are in the end, the fate of the valley rests in the hands of champions both new and old.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a nice Elder Scrolls lore knot to unpick by shouting at things and also slapping things with your sword. The modders reckon that, plus the 40 or so new quests and 50 or so new dungeons that help flesh out the valley, will keep you occupied for around 60 hours. Damn, that's about 1/8th of the time it usually takes me to sort my Skyrim load order out at any given moment.</p><p>That said, I'm slightly concerned that the mod cites "surprising consumables" alongside its fresh gear. What could be shocking to consume in the estimations of someone who's hung out with Sheogorath for at least five minutes during that one quest? Call dibs on which bodily fluid you reckon below. Anyway, the NPCs are fully voiced, so I'll be able to ask one of them to spill the beans.</p>
<p>Do expect some teething issues if you dive in at this soft launch stage to enquire for yourself. "We're still actively completing features of it, and there will be bugs," Lordbound's devs wrote. "While everything is largely playable, we still have work to do on the voice acting side of things. Additionally, our final checks have of course revealed more issues than anticipated. We scrambled to get the worst offenders fixed, but be fully prepared to encounter bugs through your adventures (not the chaurus kind)."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379">Skyrim Script Extender</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15109">Fuz Ro D-oh - Silent Voice</a> are requirements to get it running.</p>

<header><section>
<p>But why?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="fe3dadf3e45d7"><a title="Horipad Turbo 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fe3dadf3e45d7/horipad-turbo-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Hori has introduced another budget-friendly alternative to the official Switch 2 Pro Controller, with a new pad coming in at roughly $54 when converted from Japanese yen (thanks, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/791438/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo-nintendo-switch-2-controller">The Verge</a>).</p>
<p>This means it's priced significantly lower than the $89.99 Nintendo itself is asking for with its official offering, but a few sacrifices have been made to bring costs down. So crucially, the Horipad Turbo controller cannot wake the Switch 2 remotely, there's no headphone jack, and it doesn't sport any NFC functionality for your amiibos.</p>
<p>What it <em>does</em> do, however, is let you lock the buttons in the middle – like the home, capture, +, and - buttons – via a small toggle located on the back. Why? Well, who knows, but there you go.</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, there are plenty of arcade controllers these days that include tournament lock toggles to disable any inessential inputs while in the heat of battle. It's possible Hori might want to capture some of that niche, but these new pads don't particularly strike us as the go-to option for fight fans.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the joysticks utilise TMR technology to minimise any potential stick drift, while there are two additional inputs on the back of the pad to rival those found on the Pro Controller. Finally, Hori has seen fit to allow remapping across pretty much the entire suite of buttons, so that should come in handy if you like to tinker around with that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>There's no word on when (or even if) these new pads will make their way to the West, but we'll be keep a close eye on them regardless. Even if they don't sport all the features you're looking for in a Switch 2 controller, it's always nice to have options.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Lacerator</em> is a gory indie survival horror chock full of love and respect for the classics, but should it be your Halloween play? Or is it grindhouse garbage? Our <em>The Lacerator</em> review should give you a good idea if this is gore greatness or a failure of a flick.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is <em>The Lacerator</em>?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-bright-blue-inventory-screen-with-a-bandage-as-the-only-item-it-contains.jpg?itok=O0Vx7htW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-bright-blue-inventory-screen-with-a-bandage-as-the-only-item-it-contains.jpg?itok=G1FdTWK7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The actual content of the inventory screen is familiar, but the high-contrast '80s microcomputer interface is a nice touch.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve not had a chance to check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2339330/The_Lacerator/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">game’s Steam page</a> yet, let me fill you in. <em>The Lacerator</em> is an old-school survival horror game from developer Games from the Abyss and publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/dread-xp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dread XP</a> in the <em>Resident Evil </em>mold.</p>

<p>In fact, it would be fair to say that this game is an homage to <em>Resident Evil</em> in many ways. It does both of the two different camera styles that the series has used, namely, over-the-shoulder and fixed, and is about escaping from a house filled with gory humanoids bent on your death. Oh, and you spend most of the game being chased by a huge, muscular monster. You could have told me this was an unreleased tongue-in-cheek Resi spin-off and I’d have believed you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You play as Max, The man Who Loves Sex, one of the most popular porn stars of the 1980s. After spending a night doing what you do best, you wake up to find that you, your co-star, and your cameraman have been kidnapped and locked in some sort of basement dungeon.</p>

<p>As you explore your location, it’s clear that you’re in some sort of snuff den, and you need to try your best to get out without losing any of your extremities, and I do mean any of them. Let's just hope that this isn't giving DreadXP 'nam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">flashbacks to their last slightly sexual horror game</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Let’s Get Lacerator-y</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-an-over-the-shoulder-shot-of-a-man-over-a-grungy-catwalk-holding-a-hatchet.jpg?itok=YUa2L_vE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-an-over-the-shoulder-shot-of-a-man-over-a-grungy-catwalk-holding-a-hatchet.jpg?itok=prHCtQjq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't think it's technically possible to 'aim' an axe that you have no intention, nor ability, to throw.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The way that <em>The Lacerator</em> plays will be completely different depending on your set-up. If you choose to go with the classic ‘fixed’ camera, you’ll be controlling your character with tank-controls and sudden camera angle shifts. If you choose the more modern, over-the-shoulder style of camera, you’ll actually be able to play the game.&nbsp; In either case, the bulk of the rest of the gameplay revolves around killing zombie-like enemies, finding items, and solving puzzles to unlock further progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If that last paragraph wasn’t clear enough, I found the fixed camera angle a pain. Not only does it make certain puzzles based around timing very frustrating, but it also makes the already janky combat nearly impossible to wrap your head around. I understand that combat in a survival-horror game like this is supposed to feel chaotic to keep things tense, there’s only a certain level you can hit before the experience becomes genuinely unpleasant.</p>

<h2>Fight the Power, and the “Zombies”</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-an-old-tv-and-an-original-atari-2600-but-with-crt-scanlines-over-the-top-of-it.jpg?itok=ouVv_lbR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-an-old-tv-and-an-original-atari-2600-but-with-crt-scanlines-over-the-top-of-it.jpg?itok=aLUfzUVc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Max has some interestingly negative attitudes towards various things throughout the game, but that is almost certainly part of the point.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The combat in <em>The Lacerator</em> isn’t without merit at all. Generally, it functions fairly similarly to the <em>Resident Evil </em>standards. You ready your weapon by holding one button, then press another to attack. With ranged weapons this is pretty easy to get a hang of, though the game starts out incredibly reticent to dole out ammo. However, melee weapons take a decent amount of getting used to, made all the harder if you’re attempting this on fixed-camera mode. Part of the reason for this is a slight issue with the game’s controls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During melee combat, you have to try and dodge incoming attacks, but you don’t really have a dodge move. All you can do is back up as quickly as possible, avoid the incoming damage, then swing with your melee weapon again. This sounds fine, but the game won’t let you keep the run button held between attacks, so you have to get used to the very specific timing window that you have after landing an attack to quickly press run again before you start moving backwards if you want to avoid damage. It’s easily doable after a bit of practice, but it also results in melee combat feeling formulaic once you’ve got it down. Either way, by the latter half of the game, you have better access to guns, so melee becomes less of an issue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Splintering Pathways</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-standing-in-a-hallways-that-looks-like-its-made-out-of-rusted-iron-and-human-flesh.jpg?itok=AYoj9JcF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-standing-in-a-hallways-that-looks-like-its-made-out-of-rusted-iron-and-human-flesh.jpg?itok=EBl_1zQl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guys, does this place look familiar to you?&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Combat aside, there is a decent amount of fun to be found in <em>The Lacerator</em> for fans of old-school survival horror. You have the same style of room-clearing gameplay, but weirdly without the map that you might normally find in such games, it feels a lot creepier exploring each new area that you come across.</p>

<p>At least, it does the first time through. This is also the sort of game that is made with replays in mind thanks to multiple endings being available, so on your second visit the creep factor is definitely lessoned, though it’s not the only draw either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s also an irreverent tone, and the '80s-style aesthetic to a lot of the environments you’ll come across makes you feel like you’re playing a parody exploitation movie, and that is also borne out in the storyline too. Playing a porn star called Max in the '80s is already pretty grimy, but add the extravagant gore and you could be forgiven for thinking that this is some stupid edgelord game with not much interesting to say.</p>

<p>Keep playing and paying attention and you’ll come across an interesting narrative that alludes to a lot more going on beneath the surface with Max’s character and backstory.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Getting Gored &amp; Bugged</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-mostly-nude-man-standing-with-his-back-to-the-player-who-is-in-a-pool.jpg?itok=fjLS4hOv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-mostly-nude-man-standing-with-his-back-to-the-player-who-is-in-a-pool.jpg?itok=kwD7YsEN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm almost 100% sure that he is not supposed to be stood there like that.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest mechanics in <em>The Lacerator</em> is the ability for you to get several bits of yourself chopped off. If you're not paying attention to obvious traps, or the 9-foot naked guy chasing you down, then you're likely to end up losing an arm, or worse, your junk. Depending on what you lose, the gameplay changes accordingly.</p>

<p>So, lose an arm, and you'll begin to find combat a fair bit harder with most weapons. Lose a leg, and you'll move slower as you get around by hopping, or drag yourself around by your arms, if you lose both of them. This is an interesting mechanic, as it does mean you can only access certain areas or abilities by having certain things chopped off, but you'll also want to avoid doing it if you can help it, since finishing with nothing chopped off is the only way to unlock some of the best endings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While you're going back through for the other endings or just to check out what else there is to see, you'll need to keep your eye out for a couple of bugs. I'm not sure how it triggers, but sometimes when you're reading a note or picking up an item, the game will get the overlay stuck on the screen while you're still able to move around the world.</p>

<p>It's not game-breaking, unless the item you were trying to pick up is a key item, but it's certainly annoying. I also had a really weird bug where The Lacerator himself seemed to get stuck staring into a wall, though in fairness, this did just add to the eerie feeling a bit.</p>

<h2>Sound &amp; Visuals</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-in-pink-boxers-standing-in-a-dilapidated-building.jpg?itok=Z5sUs_kU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-in-pink-boxers-standing-in-a-dilapidated-building.jpg?itok=IChu5Jph 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Max was also known as one of the hairiest porn stars of the '80s, though there is a lot of stiff competition.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the old-school gameplay, <em>The Lacerator</em> uses an old-school PS1/N64-style aesthetic. So, we’re talking blocky 3D polygonal characters with slightly blocky textures laid on top. While a lot can be said about this being ‘nostalgia bait,’ it’s a really effective aesthetic when you’re working with a grungy, and gory, grindhouse story like this. The distorted visuals and audio being used add to the eerie feeling of the game, and that distortion also helps to keep you guessing more about what each new sound you here might mean, until you discover the horrific source.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s also more of a game about the sound design than the soundtrack. When you’re wandering around exploring new areas and trying to solve puzzles or make progress, you’re generally listening mostly to your own footsteps. Occasionally, you’ll get some diagetic sound from an in-game stereo or record player, but other than that, it’s only during monster encounters when you get any music. It’s a style of gameplay that works best in an explorative horror game, and it’s right at home here.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Lacerator</em>&nbsp;Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

The slight jank to the controls make the melee combat tough to get into, a fact that isn’t aided by the fixed camera mode, but thankfully a lot of what the rest of the game has to offer is great. There is the heart of soul of a great game here, but it’s buried beneath layers of minor bugs and QoL fixes that need to happen first. Until then, only the horror-dedicated will find entertainment within.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Oh boy. Unfortunately, it's one of those days. You might remember that last week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> developer Funcom laid off an unspecified number of staff. Yep, that same Dune: Awakening that appeared to be doing pretty well for itself. Go figure! Today, there's more bad news, as it turns out that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-hellsinger">Metal: Hellsinger</a> studio The Outsiders will be shutting down completely as part of said layoffs at parent company Funcom.
</p>
<p>
Founder of the studio David Goldfarb should word of the studio's shuttering in a statement posted to his own X account, explaining, "I have not had much time to process the news but all of us at The Outsiders and Funcom Stockholm have been affected by the layoffs at Funcom and our 10 year old studio will be closing.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
"Many of us had survived a near-death studio experience years back when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkborn">Darkborn</a> was cancelled and because of the team's loyalty and refusal to quit, Metal: Hellslinger was born. It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen."
</p>
<p>
Goldfarb did try to offer a bit of hope amongst the gloom, as he did say the team is going to try and continue in "some new form." He also noted that if anyone reading the statement could offer help, from business leads, to helping employees find new work, anything would be appreciated. Fingers crossed that the team is able to find their footing.
</p>
<p>
For what it's worth, former editorial director Graham <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-hellsinger-review">thought Metal: Hellsinger was bloody good</a>, so if you've already got it in your library but not tried it out yet, might as well give it a go.

              <p>Any creator that wants to be taken seriously needs to start focusing a lot more on their audio. It doesn’t matter if your doing simple vlogs from your couch or conducting those man-on-the-street styled videos. Your viewers, whether they are conscious of it are not, are going to notice your sound quality. Cheap audio reduces the production value of your work, even more so than poorly shot or low quality video does, at least in my opinion. The good news is that it’s easy to take your audio up from sounding bad to sound pretty good. The DJI Mic Mini is a wireless lavalier microphone that is easy to use and far from expensive.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/"> It normally goes for $60, but right now, Amazon has it listed for 29% off. That saves you $17, bringing the price down to just $42 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable on You and in Frame</h2>
<p>The DJI Mic Mini is an ultra-light miniature wireless transmitter that can be worn comfortably and is aesthetically pleasing on camera.</p>
<p>This mini microphone for creators can be placed on the speaker’s person in three different convenient ways. It can clip onto the collar of their shirt as well as the inside of a button-up. You can choose to magnetically adhere it. Just slap the mini clip magnet behind the shirt with the DJI Mic on the front. And then lastly, you can use a simple lanyard and have it hang around the speakers neck like a necklace.</p>
<p>All you need is the one transmitter. When fully charged, it has a maximum operating time of up to eight hours. That should give you plenty of time to record interviews, selfie videos, on-stage events, or whatever it is your looking to capture.</p>



<p>The mic utilizes intelligent noise cancelling at two separate levels. The basic mode is made for indoor settings that are relatively quiet but still has some background noise that’s better off removed. Strong mode is ideal of outdoor noisy environments where you really need to separate the sound of your person speaking from the crowds.</p>
<p>The DJI Mic Mini uses an algorithm to makes sure the audio it picks up is good to use. It’s automatic limiting feature will lower the volume on its own if it detect audio input is too high. This can help prevent clipping.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/">For a limited time, you can grab the DJI Mic Mini wireless lavalier for the reduced price of just $42. Save $17 and upgrade your audio recording today.</a></p>

As is tradition, we’re kicking off a month of exclusive content with a brand new gameplay video. Above, you can watch a playthrough of The Captured Fortress, one of Crimson Desert’s faction quests, in which you help Duke Wells retake his castle from rebel forces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This 11 minute-long video showcases a number of Crimson Desert’s key features. First and foremost, of course, is combat. Ever since we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-is-like-god-of-war-and-dragons-dogma-had-a-baby-gamescom-2024">first played Crimson Desert at Gamescom 2024</a>, we’ve known that developer Pearl Abyss has been assembling something special when it comes to battle, and here you can see protagonist Kliff making use of a wide array of abilities. Among our favourites is using a spear to pole-vault into an enemy, and the incredibly powerful, magically-charged heavy attacks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this demonstration mission covers more than just combat. You’ll also see how Kliff can explore the environment using magic leaps, a Spider-Man-like swing, and his Crow Wings ability, which allows him to glide through the skies towards far-off objectives. You’ll also see him using his sword to reflect light, a skill that highlights points of interest in the world and guides you towards interesting discoveries. By following the shining lights, Kliff is able to infiltrate the Duke’s captured fortress in a more stealthy manner… and discover some extra loot along the way, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, a Crimson Desert showcase wouldn’t be complete without a boss battle, and so this video concludes with a full, violent clash against Fortain, the Cursed Knight. This armour-clad bad lad wields a sword with a mighty, supernatural ability that you don’t want to miss. You might even be able to claim it for yourself…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And remember, this video is just the first drop. Throughout the month of October, IGN First will take you on a journey into the world of Crimson Desert. You’ll get to see many more bosses, regions, combat abilities, and two or three exciting new things you’d never guess would be part of a medieval fantasy game. For all that, stay tuned to IGN over the next few weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-gameplay-ign-first]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grabbing Prismatic Evolutions cards at a good price has felt like a lost cause for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop"><u>Pokémon TCG</u></a> collectors, but Walmart has confirmed that its upcoming <a href="https://zdcs.link/9217my?object_uuid=d56a5e2b-c154-4101-a604-be23c787ddf5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">October Deals event</a> will include a significant offer that seems too good to be true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beginning on 6 October, from 7 PM ET, paid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/walmart-plus"><u>Walmart+ members</u></a> will have early access to purchase the highly sought-after <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4PlZ?object_uuid=d56a5e2b-c154-4101-a604-be23c787ddf5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Elite Trainer Box for $59.99</a>, a 50% reduction from its "regular" $119.99 price.</p><div catalogid="33f87b44-ee72-4240-98ad-021acd5d3806" id="192311"><div id="192311" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ Membership</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>30-day free trial available. Then it's $12.95/month, or $98/year.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not already a member, it’s admittedly a slight drag that you’ll essentially have to add $12.95 onto that $59.99 price tag; it’s still better than the $200 minimum you’ll currently find on other marketplaces like <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxLBp?object_uuid=d56a5e2b-c154-4101-a604-be23c787ddf5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer</u></a> for the same set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, this is going to sell out FAST, and I highly doubt there will be any remaining for the general non-Walmart+ shoppers looking for a bargain. Not only that, but you're going more for your money if you're looking to grab the brand new and upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-most-expensive-cards"><u>Mega Evolution</u></a> expansion, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-where-to-buy"><u>Phantasmal Flames</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walmart is doing a repeat of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4PlZ?object_uuid=d56a5e2b-c154-4101-a604-be23c787ddf5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions deal preview drop</a>, but this time with preorders for the upcoming set featuring Mega Charizard X during Walmart Collector Con. The preorders will drop at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET on October 9, so you better bookmark those links and be ready to go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a big deal, and even worth dropping the $13 on Walmart+ alone, considering just the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqReJ0?object_uuid=d56a5e2b-c154-4101-a604-be23c787ddf5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box is going for $160+ right now resale</a>, and Walmart will be selling for just $55! Holy smokes! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're after Prismatic ETBs or elusive preorders at MSRP for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-where-to-buy"><u>Phantasmal Flames</u></a>, picking up a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/walmart-plus">Walmart+ membership</a> is undoubtedly the move this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also important to know that whilst Walmart+ does have a 30-day trial available, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9213Ay?object_uuid=d56a5e2b-c154-4101-a604-be23c787ddf5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Walmart+ hub page</u></a> states that only paid members will have access to its early deals on 6 October. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The annoying part of the Walmart+ subscription process, if you want to buy early access items right away, is that you're only given the initial option to claim the 30-day trial. <strong>However, you can get around this by starting your free trial, cancelling it, and resubscribing for paid access. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Walmart Deals event, scheduled for 7-12 October, is designed to compete directly with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-prime-day"><u>Amazon’s Prime Day</u></a>. However, Walmart+ members will benefit from exclusive early access starting the day prior, on 6 October. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea is that after that early access day, the deals will then be made available to the wider public who don’t have Walmart+. However, given how quickly almost any MSRP-priced stock for new sets in the Pokémon TCG is selling out at all retailers, we’re certain this particular ETB will be sold out within hours, if not minutes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Walmart+ subscription is priced at $12.95 per month, or $98 annually, and offers a range of benefits beyond early shopping privileges. Members receive free delivery with no order minimum, savings on fuel, access to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/paramount-plus"><u>Paramount+</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/peacock"><u>Peacock</u></a> at no extra cost, and additional perks such as pharmacy delivery and discounts at selected partners. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although we are expecting Amazon Prime Day and the upcoming Black Friday sales to offer some decent Pokémon TCG deals of their own, this is still quite frankly one of the best we’ve seen this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t expect Walmart to repeat this kind of deal for the foreseeable, or Walmart to match it. Even so, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to beat out all the other keen collectors, scalpers, and their bots who might be trying to nab one before you can. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we’d advise is to have your paid Walmart+ subscription set up and you be logged in on 6 October, and if you get the chance to add one of those half-priced Prismatic Evolutions ETBs to your basket, you take it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime. Follow him on Twitter/X <a href="https://x.com/BenLevelTen" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@BenLevelTen</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note: Pokémon TCG pricing is incredibly volitile and any mention of sale pricing is indicative of the current market rate for the aforementioned products. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Pokémon Elite Trainer Boxes are meant to sell for around $50-$60 MSRP, but instead retailer at around $100+ post launch.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 6, 2025 4:00 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-prime-day-elite-trainer-box-discount-walmart-plus-early-access]]></content:encoded>
