<p data-characters="405" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/vampire-survivors/">Vampire Survivors</a></em> DLC, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/vampire-survivors-operation-guns-is-better-value-than-a-laundromat-wash-cycle/">Operation Guns</a></em>, lives up to its name with a slew of guns and other weapons. While each of them is fantastic for slaying undead and aliens alike, obtaining the weapon evolutions is your winning ticket for completing levels and tasks. To do so, players will need to make use of the new Weapon Power-up items in addition to the usual combos. Here’s how to evolve each weapon.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-upgrade-each-weapon-in-vampire-survivors-operation-guns" data-injectable="false">How to upgrade each weapon in Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vampire-survivors-operation-guns-weapon-upgrades.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vampire-survivors-operation-guns-weapon-upgrades.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vampire-survivors-operation-guns-weapon-upgrades.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vampire-survivors-operation-guns-weapon-upgrades.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vampire-survivors-operation-guns-weapon-upgrades.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vampire-survivors-operation-guns-weapon-upgrades.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Long Gun -&gt; Prototype A</strong> <ul> <li>Long Gun + Weapon Power-up</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Homing Miss -&gt; Multistage Missiles</strong> <ul> <li>Homing Miss + Weapon Power-up + Duplicator</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Blade Crossbow -&gt; BFC2000-AD</strong> <ul> <li>Blade Crossbow + Weapon Power-up + Clover</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Sonic Bloom -&gt; Wave Beam</strong> <ul> <li>Sonic Bloom + Weapon Power-up + Armor</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Short Gun -&gt; Prototype B</strong> <ul> <li>Short Gun + Weapon Power-up + Bracer</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Spread Shot -&gt; Prototype C</strong> <ul> <li>Spread Shot + Weapon Power-up + Empty Tome</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>C-U-Laser -&gt; Pronto Beam</strong> <ul> <li>C-U-Laser + Weapon Power-up + Tirajisu</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Firearm -&gt; Fire L3GS</strong> <ul> <li>Firearm + Weapon Power-up + Candelabrador</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Diver Mines -&gt; Atmo-Torpedo</strong> <ul> <li>Diver Mines + Weapon Power-up + Attractorb</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Metal Claw -&gt; Big Fuzzy Fist</strong> <ul> <li>Metal Claw + Weapon Power-up + Hollow Heart</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">After getting the initial weapon upgrade, I haven’t seen a need for the Weapon Power-up on subsequent runs in terms of being a necessary ingredient. Once it’s in the grimoire, you should be good to go with other characters, maps, etc. That being said, it’s still a good idea to collect them as they’ll give +1 to a random equipped weapon in addition to a Revive.</p> <p data-characters="520" data-current-count="906" data-injectable="true">As for procuring the upgrade, I found it easiest to pick the corresponding <em>Contra</em> character that starts with the weapon you want to upgrade and load into the “Attack Aggressively” level. There are two Weapon Power-ups fairly close by you can pick up. As for the Passive Power-up, make sure to save a slot for the item you need, and don’t be afraid to use your Rerolls or Banishments. Once the weapon and passive item are upgraded, it’s only a matter of getting a chest to drop with the evolution.</p>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">It shouldn’t take too long to find each weapon evolution this way, and you’ll then be set up for success in other modes. One last tip is to avoid collecting too many of the base <em>Operation Guns</em> weapons when trying to unlock the evolutions. This way, you’ll avoid the chance of burning a Weapon Power-up on an evolution you didn’t want.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-info-surfaces-on-former-deviation-devs%E2%80%99-sony-backed-studio.868416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has been claimed on social media that Sony has established a brand-new studio within the confines of PlayStation stocked to the rafters with former Deviation Games employees. It was further reported that Jason Blundell, one of the co-founders of Deviation, is involved with the project at a senior level.</p>



<p>The latest info that was recently revealed follows rumours that first popped up in December 2023.</p>



<p>In March, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deviation-games-closes/">Deviation Games was shut down</a> without shipping a single game. Backed by a flock of former Call of Duty veterans, Deviation Games was reportedly working on a AAA shooter when it was shuttered amid ongoing industry-wide struggles. That shutdown came following a mass layoff wave that wiped out as many as 90 employees.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-class-new-ip">‘Top-Class New IP’</h2>



<p>In a post from former Deviation Games employee Michael Anthony, which surfaced on LinkedIn (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-reportedly-forms-studio-with-former-deviation-games-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thanks to VGC</a>), the news is all but confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I hear that a lot of previous Deviation Games employees have setup their own studio at Sony working on an undisclosed new IP.<br>All the people I see working there that have signed up are top class developers and hope that you can create a top class new IP with your studio that hopefully gives you all the time you need to create a quality product and not have to deal with red tape from previous projects.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following that comment, Anthony wrote, ‘Go go JB and do what you do best’. </p>



<p>In December 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-possibly-building-new-studio-of-ex-deviation-games-talent/">rumours started surfacing</a> about the new studio, with Jason Blundell stating that he is ‘Leading the design for an unannounced project’. If that’s the case, the studio has been cooking in the background for several months with nothing announced. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The first two proper episodes (discounting the Christmas special) of Doctor Who season 14, starring Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor, have reached Disney Plus and BBC iPlayer, meaning that viewers are now able to dig deep and overanalyze everything for clues about what’s to come.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">If there’s one thing that Whovians do really well, it’s looking beneath the surface to find foreshadowing. This week, there’s one thing that’s got a few fans talking—The One Who Waits. This as-yet-unknown character was mentioned during The Giggle, which aired back in December, but the moniker comes back up during this week’s second released episode, The Devil’s Chord.</p> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="710" data-injectable="true">I’m going to hedge my bets and say that The One Who Waits is not a confirmation that Amy and Rory (the Doctor’s companions from the time of the Eleventh Doctor, portrayed by Matt Smith) are about to return. Yes, Rory was known as “the boy who waited”, which is a very similar moniker, but not quite the same.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rory.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Rory, the boy who waited, in Doctor Who" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rory.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rory.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rory.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rory.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">Now that’s out of the way, there is a theory floating around Twitter and other corners of the internet about the identity of The One Who Waits. Buckle in because this one is a bit of a ride.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">During The Devil’s Chord, during a discussion with Ruby on a London rooftop, the Doctor talks of his Granddaughter Susan, who he says is currently living with a previous version of himself on the other side of the city. He also admits to Ruby that he currently doesn’t know what became of Susan after the Genocide, which took the lives of all Time Lords except himself.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">At the end of The Devil’s Chord, before we’re assaulted by a slightly out-of-place song and dance number, the Doctor breaks the fourth wall and winks at the camera after saying, “There’s always a twist at the end.” Still with me? Good.</p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Now, if you dig a little deeper into the casting of this series, you’ll find that there is actually an actress called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0878610/">Susan Twist</a> in the cast, and this is where things start to get really interesting. Susan Twist has had a very short cameo appearance in every single one of Ncuti’s episodes so far, one of the 60th Anniversary Specials with David Tennant, and, according to the sneak peek clip that is available for the next episode, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NUtlh2I2qE">Boom</a>, she’s in that one too.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/susan-twist-characters.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Characters that have been played by Susan Twist in Doctor Who" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/susan-twist-characters.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/susan-twist-characters.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/susan-twist-characters.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/susan-twist-characters.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="92" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">I’ve raked through all of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-season-14-premiere-release-date-trailers-cast-episode-list-and-more/">episodes</a> so far and pinpointed her character in all of them:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Wild Blue Yonder&nbsp;</strong> <ul> <li>Twist plays Mrs Merridew, who speaks to Isaac Newton before he heads down to the apple tree&nbsp;</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>The Church on Ruby Road&nbsp;</strong> <ul> <li>She appears in the crowd at the pub where Ruby is playing the keyboard, saying, “give it some welly!” before asking for Gaudete, a Christmas carol from the 16th century, which would make sense if she was around at the time of Isaac Newton.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Space Babies</strong> <ul> <li>She plays Comms Officer Gina Scalzi, who appears on the monitor inside the room where Jocelyn is hiding</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>The Devil’s Chord</strong> <ul> <li>Twist appears as one of the tea ladies in EMI Studios, which would later become Abbey Road Studios. She says she wishes she could be “Margaret Lockwood”. What a woman, indeed.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">According to the cast list for Boom, which is written by Steven Moffat, Twist will appear again, though her role is simply called “Ambulance”.</p> <figure data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone anonymously pointed me in the direction of this. It was implied we will see Mrs Merridew again in the form of Susan Triad. Russell T Davies has a "Union Jack ICON" magazine mockup cover featuring her in his office. Triad Technology from 2024 series filming reports. <a href="https://t.co/SRqtmZhu9p">pic.twitter.com/SRqtmZhu9p</a></p>— Doctor Who Production News (@DoctorWhoPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/DoctorWhoPN/status/1737050144603095101?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">There are unconfirmed rumors that Twist will play a bigger part in the future of the series, taking the also unconfirmed role of Susan Triad. She will be the head of a company named Triad, which has already been name-dropped during the 60th anniversary special, The Giggle when Mel Bush is attempting to align the satellites. Remember, this is an unconfirmed rumor, but I’m counting nothing out of possibility.</p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">So what’s the theory here? Well, we know that The One Who Waits has some connection to both the Toymaker and Maestro, considering the apparent relation between the two and the fact that they both issue a warning to the Doctor about The One Who Waits. It’s also been revealed, though in the Doctor Who audiobooks rather than the TV show, that the Toymaker has a sister who goes by the name of Hecuba.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toymaker-and-maestro.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Maestro and the Toymaker in Doctor Who" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toymaker-and-maestro.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toymaker-and-maestro.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toymaker-and-maestro.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toymaker-and-maestro.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="793" data-injectable="true">Hecuba, otherwise known as “The Queen of Time”, would be able to traverse through time in order to appear at any moment, which would explain why Twist’s characters never look as though they’ve aged, regardless of how many years in the past or future she appears. It would make sense, then, to assume that Hecuba, if that’s who this turns out to be, has been waiting a long time to confront the Doctor for whatever reason, likely in retaliation for what happened to her brother.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="false">Whether or not this theory turns out to be true remains to be seen, but it’s definitely interesting to dive deep into Doctor Who and find the connections or even just speculate. There’s no telling what could happen in the coming episodes, with Russell T Davies (who is responsible for writing the vast majority of this season’s episodes) well known for putting twists and turns in his writing.</p>

<p data-characters="225" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Polar Patriots Warbond launched in <em>Helldivers 2</em> this week, bringing with it new armor, weapons, and cosmetics, though some gear is lacking a feature that many of us were hoping would make it easier to reverse icy worlds. </p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">There are two sets of armor in the Polar Patriots Warbond in <em>Helldivers 2</em> that have cleats on the boots. The CW-36 Winter Warrior, which is a lovely white number, and the CW-22 Kodiak, a much more understated gray camo affair. Unfortunately, both actively work against the idea of function over fashion, with functional footwear that’s all for show. </p> <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-s-polar-patriots-armor-won-t-stop-you-slipping-on-ice" data-injectable="false">Helldivers 2’s Polar Patriots armor won’t stop you slipping on ice</h2> <figure data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Warbond: Polar Patriots Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jcnzI0gN7z4?start=7&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">Two armor sets from the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-everything-in-the-polar-patriots-warbond-and-their-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polar Patriots Warbond</a> in <em>Helldivers 2</em> have cleats on their boots. In real life, these are designed to help mountain climbers and those exploring icy parts of the world have sure footing by penetrating ice and holding fast when other footwear would slip. Sadly, these in-game counterparts don’t do anything, and players are still slipping and sliding across the ice as they battle Terminids and Automatons for Super Earth. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">Players on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cnxoxd/ice_cleat_boots_for_the_new_armor_doesnt_work_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit</a> picked this up on the same day the Warbond was released. I’m really quite cross about this because when I first saw the trailer for the Warbond, I thought the armor might have a hidden perk that helps you run across the ice on worlds where you’re normally slipping around, mostly into enemies. </p>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">Sadly, I was mistaken, and it doesn’t look like I’m the only one who is disappointed. User spinyfever sums it up best: “I don’t understand why they would release a snow/ice-themed Warbond and not have the armors provide any advantages in snow/ice. Two of the new armors have crampons designed into the boots. Their literal purpose is to stop you from slipping and sliding on ice.”</p>
 <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">Ice planets might be the worst environment to fight in because there are plants that explode and slow you down with an area of effect debuff, and enemies can rush you across lakes of frozen water while you skid into a rock and welcome them with open arms. </p> <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true">In fact, the Warbond doesn’t really include anything designed to help players deliver democracy on icy planets. The Booster, Motivational Shocks, is designed to negate the slow effect Terminid acid causes, not the explosions from plants on icy worlds that do the exact same thing. The armor certainly looks the part, though, and I can’t deny that I love the idea of this ice-themed Warbond <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-polar-patriots-warbond-will-heat-things-up-next-week-with-spicy-new-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">packing in a new incendiary grenade</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="539" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="false">However, these cleats not working somehow manage to fit extremely well with the game’s lore. Super Earth has a habit of throwing new tech out there without testing it and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/termicide-just-made-helldivers-2s-terminids-stronger-and-stranger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blaming others for the problems it causes</a>. It’s also known for pulling just the right tool out of nowhere right after Helldivers have been pushed to their limit without it. If I were living in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, I’d expect cleats to start working after thousands of Helldivers had lost their lives to broken necks or deaths all linked to slipping on ice. </p>

<p>Following a turbulent time for Escape from Tarkov fans, Battlestate Games’ head of the studio, Nikita Buyanov, has tried to push the water under the bridge by leaning on the community for suggestions. He appeared on Twitter prompting players to ‘shoot their ideas’ at him before mentioning a proposed change that would remove the ‘Found in Raid’ requirement from the in-game flea market as a ‘test event’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes-on-the-horizon">Changes On The Horizon</h2>



<p>Buyanov’s thread regarding ideas and suggestions was built off the back of a comment made by a popular Escape from Tarkov streamer, Velion. He noted some key changes he’d like to see in the game, which spurred Nikita into action, and within a few hours, he’d picked up more than 1000 comments – many of which were loaded with suggestions for improvements and amendments.</p>



<p>Following the last week or two of ‘Tarkov drama’, which included the emergence of Arena Breakout: Infinite, a well-received Tarkov clone from a Tencent subsidiary, Buyanov wrote on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s been a rough couple of weeks. We wanted to keep it quiet but it’s up to you to decide if you would like to support this kind of things and stick to the games that not only entre the genre but do not hesitate to copy what has been done. Believe me we are focusing no matter what.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One idea that Nikita is willing to at least test is removing the ‘Found in Raid’ requirement from flea market items. Typically, players can only use the fleamarket to sell things that they’ve found and recovered from a raid – but that might change with this test. It’ll return Escape from Tarkov to a time gone by, as this was once the standard. With this change being applied, players would be able to loot the PMCs that they kill and sell their equipment to other players through the flea market.</p>



<p>It would also make top-tier ammunition and meta items readily available – if massively expensive.</p>



<p>That garnered a mixed response from the community, with some suggesting ‘tweaks’ on the test, such as this comment from ‘John B’:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Maybe allow selling of non FIR stuff (like other ppls gear) only immediately after the raid – similar to when you're on a scav and selling to fence. Would stop people flipping stuff but still incentivise PVP.</p>— John B (@johnbbeta) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnbbeta/status/1789296158537326596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>It’s expected that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/">Escape from Tarkov will ‘wipe’ next month</a>. That’s the event wherein the game is globally reset, putting players back to a level pegging and forcing them to restart at the bottom-most level. It’s likely Nikita and his team will roll out any such tests before then, as the run-up to the wipe is typically a proving ground for mini-events like this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Crow Country features only a handful of weapons, but about half of them can be easily missed. The flamethrower, a late-game unlockable that relies on gasoline for fuel, is no exception. Let’s quickly go over what you’ll need to unlock it, 100% spoiler-free.</p> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">First, you’ll need to be sure you’ve obtained the <strong>Data Disk</strong>. This is a mandatory late-game item, so if you haven’t found it yet, you don’t need to worry about missing out on the flamethrower. Just come back to this guide once you’ve got your hands on it.</p> <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Next, head to the Train Room:</p> <figure data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-room-map.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-room-map.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-room-map.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-room-map.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-room-map.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">Once inside, access the terminal at the back left of the room by using your Data Disk. You’ll be met with a screen that asks you to assign a letter to each of a train’s cars. The train on display in the room is your rubric, while the two plaques and buttons will give you clues as to which letter to assign to each car. </p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">The first plaque says the cars it activates are done in the <strong>A</strong>rabella and <strong>B</strong>ernadette styles, while the second says its cars display the <strong>A</strong>rabella and <strong>D</strong>elilah styles. These are the letters you’ll need to punch in the terminal, and the “styles” they refer to are the shapes found on the top of the cars (not their color, as I initially assumed). </p>
 <p data-characters="41" data-current-count="41" data-injectable="false">The solution to the puzzle is as follows:</p> <figure data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-solution.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-solution.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-solution.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-solution.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-solution.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true">And if you want to see exactly how these are determined, here’s a quick breakdown of each “style” that appears on the two running trains (C is entered by process of elimination). The trip-up here is that “A” can appear as either a single rectangle or as two rectangles next to each other:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Crow-Country-Train-Puzzle.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Crow-Country-Train-Puzzle.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Crow-Country-Train-Puzzle.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Crow-Country-Train-Puzzle.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Crow-Country-Train-Puzzle.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Diagram by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="false">Just punch these in, and one of the cars in the display train will open containing your prize! By this point in the game, you’re likely flush with fuel, so get out there and scorch some flesh.</p>

<p data-characters="349" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>BitLife’s</em> Seaman Challenge has you living as someone familiar with the ocean. From working as a fisherman to joining the Navy, you’ll experience the sea in all forms, ending the challenge with relaxing times on a boat. Or, at least, we hope it’s safe and relaxing. Here’s how to complete the Seaman Challenge in&nbsp;<em>BitLife</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-bitlife-seaman-challenge-guide" data-injectable="false"><em>BitLife</em> Seaman Challenge guide</h2> <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="64" data-injectable="false">The Seaman Challenge in <em>BitLife</em> has five objectives to complete:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false"> <li>Be born a male in Alaska</li> <li>Get an honorable discharge from the Navy</li> <li>Become a crab fisherman</li> <li>Purchase a boat worth $2,000,000</li> <li>Sail on your boat worth $2,000,000 three times</li> </ul> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true">For the most part, you can complete the middle three tasks in any order you wish. However, going through them in the order they appear is the easiest way to finish the Seaman Challenge, especially since you’ll need time to raise money for your boat.</p>
 <h3 id="h-be-born-a-male-in-alaska" data-injectable="false">Be born a male in Alaska</h3> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Your first objective is to be born a male in Alaska. To do this, create a new character whose starting gender is male, whose&nbsp;country is the United States, and whose starting place is Anchorage. Anchorage is the largest city in Alaska, making it a great place to start for this challenge.</p> <figure data-current-count="592" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bitlife-alaska.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="BitLife Alaska starting screen" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bitlife-alaska.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bitlife-alaska.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bitlife-alaska.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bitlife-alaska.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="129" data-current-count="129" data-injectable="false">Once you create your Alaskan character, age them until they turn 18, avoiding any and all crime so they can easily join the Navy.</p> <h3 id="h-get-an-honorable-discharge-from-the-navy" data-injectable="false">Get an honorable discharge from the Navy</h3> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">After your character turns 18, head into the Occupation tab and select Military. Here, you’ll find the Navy, which you’ll have to enlist and perform well for at least four years. Once you have worked hard and have lasted at least four years in the Navy, you can request a discharge to receive an honorable discharge, knocking out the second task.</p>

To do this, head into the full-time job list and continue searching until you spot the Greenhorn position. You’ll know you’ve found it when you see a job with a crab emoji icon next to its name. If you don’t see it, close and reopen the&nbsp;<em>BitLife&nbsp;</em>app or age up your character and recheck the list.</p>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">Once you spot the Greenhorn job, apply for the position and pass the interview to become a crab fisherman. Three tasks down, two more to go.</p> <h3 id="h-purchase-and-sail-a-boat-worth-2-000-000" data-injectable="false">Purchase and sail a boat worth $2,000,000</h3> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">The last two tasks of the Seaman Challenge require you to have plenty of money to buy a boat and a boating license. You can get a boating license by heading into Activities, choosing Licenses, and taking a quick boating license test. After getting your license and making some money, head into Assets, choose Shopping, and scroll through the boat vehicle dealer until you spot a boat worth at least $2,000,000. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="263" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Many games these days tend to have a predictable and run-of-the-mill plot. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to find a unique and well-told narrative, but Sunset Visitor has taken that challenge and fired on all cylinders with its debut title<em>1000xRESIST</em>.</p> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">On the surface, <em>1000xRESIST</em> is a story about surviving an apocalyptic alien incursion. But in unraveling its approximately 1,000-year timeline, <em>1000xRESIST</em> delves into numerous meaningful themes including family, humanistic nature, and the adaptivity of the mind. I even learned a thing or two about myself along the way. It’s still a sci-fi tale, but it’s not afraid to get a bit deep as the story unfolds.</p>
 <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">Those expecting intense or difficult gameplay in any form won’t find it here. In fact, for the most part, <em>1000xRESIST</em> is mostly an adventure game with some light gameplay elements sprinkled throughout. But those elements serve the exact purpose you’d hope for in an experience like 1000xRESIST: to enhance the narrative. After experiencing this roughly 15-hour journey, I don’t think I’d want it any other way.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="1000xRESIST Out Now Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISmiWUpiDs4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="133" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true"><strong><em>1000xRESIST</em> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1675830/1000xRESIST/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a></strong> <strong>[reviewed], Switch)<br>Developer:&nbsp;Sunset Visitor<br>Publisher: Fellow Traveller<br>Released: May 9, 2024<br>MSRP: $19.99</strong></p>
 <h2 id="h-game-of-clones" data-injectable="false">Game of Clones</h2> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">The story of 1000xRESIST starts over 1,000 years after an alien species known as The Occupants visits Earth, bringing with it a weapon; a disease that leads to the near-extinction of the human race. The disease is brutal. People start to cry, before all their bodily fluids are eventually forcefully expunged from their bodies. Certainly not a pleasant end for humankind.</p> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="858" data-injectable="true">A group of six sister clones, all named after their purpose—Principal, Knower, Fixer, Healer, Bang Bang Fire, and Watcher—reside in an underground bunker serving their creator, the ALLMOTHER. We play as the Watcher, who has the especially unique role of being able to observe the memories of the ALLMOTHER through a process called Communion. We can observe the memories and learn more about life before the Occupants arrived, as well as the last 1,000 years since they got to Earth. </p>
 <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">At the time of the Occupant invasion, ALLMOTHER—whose name was Iris—was in high school. In your first communion as Watcher, you experience the trials and tribulations of Iris, going about her high school life. The Occupants appear and the disease starts infecting everyone at her school, except her. But before you can finish your first Communion, Fixer finds a way to interfere with the memory; to alert you that things in the bunker, and more specifically with ALLMOTHER, may not be as they seem.</p>
 <p data-characters="578" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true">For a narrative-driven experience like <em>1000xRESIST</em>, the story is the most important part. And thankfully the story here does not disappoint. <em>1000xRESIST</em> utilizes a variety of forms throughout the telling of its story, mixing laughs, cries, scares, and confusion. The early chapters drip-feed you enough to satiate your appetite for answers, while also prompting more questions about what’s going on in this world. In the end, you get the answers to most of the questions, and the unanswered parts feel intended for the player to fill in the cracks with their own theories.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-2.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="1000xRESIST Review Screenshot 2" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-2.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-2.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-2.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-2.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-clonesome-dove" data-injectable="false">Clonesome Dove</h2> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">I usually struggle a bit getting through dialogue-heavy games. It’s not that I don’t like them. Who doesn’t love a good story? But whether I want to or not, I eventually find my mind wandering a bit. <em>1000xRESIST</em> finds multiple ways to prevent that from happening. </p>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">From a story perspective, there are tons of comical laughs and subtle third-wall-breaking segments that keep it feeling fresh. Sunset Visitor’s writing had me genuinely looking forward to each and every line. To make it even better, each line of dialogue from every character is fully voiced with a superb cast of voice acting whose stellar performances only make the narrative even more surreal.</p>
 <p data-characters="675" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">Then there’s the gameplay. For most of the game, each chapter goes through a similar cadence. You’ll start in the underground bunker in the present day. You’ll walk around and talk with the other sisters, then perform a Communion where you experience a memory of Iris. During the Communion, you’ll walk around solving very light puzzles with a handy technological device that allows you to jump forward and backward through various times on demand. For example, you may want to enter a room that’s blocked off in your current time. You can simply jump to another time where the entrance is open, walk in, and then jump back to your current time.</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">None of the puzzles are difficult in any regard, and mostly just serve as a fun little gameplay element between the storytelling. There are also several <em>Gravity</em> <em>Rush</em>-style segments where you must look around you and right-click on specific highlighted points of the area you are in, jumping from one to another to quickly climb to high areas or cover larger distances quickly.</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="750" data-injectable="true">Gameplay is supplemental to the actual drive here, to progress the story and explore the narrative in detail. You can’t fail or get a game over screen, and you probably won’t find yourself searching for a difficult puzzle solution on your phone or anything like that. But it does offer a nice change of pace between the sometimes hard-hitting narrative at play.</p>

The character design of all of the sisters is really well done. Each sister’s namesake describes their purpose in the Guarden, which also molds their personality based on what they are tasked with doing in the bunker.</p>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">You’ll only scratch the surface at the start. Each sister will start to open up and show you more and more of their personality as you progress through <em>1000xRESIST</em>. Even though the sisters are clones, they all have their own personalities. It’s a lineup of characters I didn’t expect to care much for when I first met them, but by the end, I appreciated each of them for different reasons.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-sword-in-the-clone" data-injectable="false">The Sword in the Clone</h2> <p data-characters="560" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">Though small in the grand scheme of things, there are some minor issues I had with <em>1000xRESIST</em>. First is how the save system works. At the end of each chapter, you’re presented with the option to save. However, you can also save during the game as well—right in the middle of the chapter, for example—as long as you aren’t currently in a dialogue segment. Simply open the menu and click Save Game. But that save doesn’t seem to save the actual point you’re at. Instead, it just creates a save point at the beginning of that chapter.</p>
 <p data-characters="546" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">The first time I experienced this, I had no clue. I was a couple of hours into a chapter, nearing the end, when suddenly I had something come up and had to step away for a while. I went into the menu and saved my game, only to come back later, and upon loading the save had to start over at the beginning of the chapter. I tried this several more times just to see if it was a fluke, but every save just loaded at the beginning of its respective chapter. It’s an unclear option that could lead to some annoyances for players taking a break.</p>
 <p data-characters="723" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">I also had a bit of frustration trying to navigate the Guarden, which you spend a lot of time in. It’s pretty massive in size, which is important, seeing as it’s the last bastion of the apocalypse. But you only get a simple compass-style indicator at the top of your map to find certain characters to interact with. Even after exploring the corridors and multiple levels of the Guarden throughout my 15-ish hour playthrough, I still found myself running around lost, trying to figure out how to get somewhere due to the somewhat maze-like flow of it. It’s a cool setting and I can certainly appreciate the detail that went into it, but traversing it (which you will do often) can be quite a pain at times.</p>

It’s a testament that games can be light on the gameplay, but still tell a story that rivals all other types of media if done properly. It’s <a href="https://twitter.com/1000xResist/status/1787939091515899966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clear</a> that Sunset Visitor drew inspiration from other sci-fi story-heavy titles like <em>NieR: Automata</em>. Narratively,<em> 1000xRESIST </em>holds its own and tells a captivating, intriguing, and thought-provoking story, paying homage to the titles that inspired it as opposed to relying on them.</p>
 <p data-characters="523" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="false">If you enjoy a good story that can make you laugh one minute, hold back tears the next, then audibly mumble “WTF?” right after that, do yourself a favor, and check out<em>1000xRESIST</em>. I’m incredibly impressed with Sunset Visitor’s ability to tell a story with its debut title. It’s one that will stick with me for a while, and I’ve already caught myself still thinking about it, despite having finished it a few days ago. I can’t wait to see what Sunset Visitor does next.

<p data-characters="258" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">What’s a survival horror game without a magnum that you’ll never fire a single time because there might be an even bigger, badder boss in the next room? Crow Country has its very own boss-killer, and you can get it about midway through the game. </p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">There’s only one prerequisite item: the <strong>silver key</strong>. If you don’t have this yet, then there are actually <em>several </em>prerequisite items, but at the risk of spoiling the experience, you can revisit this guide once you’ve got your hands on it to get your shiny new gun as soon as possible.</p> <p data-characters="68" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">First, head over to the Gift Shop, located just off the main square:</p> <figure data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-gift-shop-map.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-gift-shop-map.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-gift-shop-map.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-gift-shop-map.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-gift-shop-map.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Inside, you’ll find several items for sale, each of which you can inspect to check the price. Near the cash register at the back of the shop is a note from Mr. Crow himself, which lists several items he’s planning on picking out for his daughter Natalie. By adding the price of these items and entering the result, <strong>$19.75</strong>, into the register, we’ll claim our prize:</p> <ol data-found-items="3" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true"> <li>Haunted Hilltop stuffed toy – $5.50</li> <li>Classic Crow Country rubber doll – $10.00</li> <li>Fairytale Town action figure – $4.25</li> </ol>
 <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">The items aren’t labeled exactly as they appear in the shop, and there are many to choose from, so some deductive reasoning goes a long way in finding the right ones. Once you have your hands on the magnum, all that’s left is to find some ammo for it. And that’s a puzzle even I’ve struggled with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="212" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">During my time playing <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, I’ve overcome a lot of anxiety. Not just in the game but also outside of it, and certain things that I’ve experienced within Eorzea have transferred into real life.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">Of course,, the story and characters stay with me; their words echo around my mind during times when I’m struggling. But things that I’ve managed to achieve during my game time have given me pause for thought in the real world as well. If I can overcome things that terrify me and push me in Eorzea, surely I can push myself in real life.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">I’ve already talked about my experience <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/overcoming-tank-anxiety-in-ffxiv-made-me-a-better-player-and-a-dark-knight-main/">overcoming tank anxiety</a> in <em>FFXIV</em> before going on to be a Dark Knight main. That experience, in a strange way, taught me about taking life by the horns and doing things that push your boundaries. Healing, on the other hand, is something that I once found truly terrifying and had zero confidence doing.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-2.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Playing as a White Mage in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-2.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-2.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-2.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-2.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">Except now, all of my healer jobs are sitting at level 90, and I’m actually excited to increase them all to level 100 when Dawntrail drops at the end of June. I’m more than happy to jump into any content as a healer, though I might fumble my buttons to start with if it’s been a while. Getting to this point, though, was not easy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">I actually started playing <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> as a healer. A Conjurer, to be precise. The trouble was, I had never played an MMO before and I had no idea that playing that job would place me in a party as the healer for everyone else involved. The green icon didn’t give me any clues, either. Like I said, I had no idea what I was doing. I didn’t even take the hint when I started to gain healing spells, simply thinking, “well, that might come in useful one day,” while going about my day using Stone and Aero to take down foes I encountered, like an idiot.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-1.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Playing as a White Mage in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-1.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-1.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-1.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-1.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="763" data-injectable="true">It wasn’t until I queued, on my own, for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-final-fantasy-xiv-dungeons-ranked/">Sashtasha</a> that I discovered the weight that I’d taken upon myself by choosing the Conjurer class. I didn’t know I was supposed to be healing, I didn’t know that was my role, but it quickly dawned on me when the party died and everyone blamed me. I’m not ashamed to admit that I dropped the dungeon and all but ran to the first city-state on the teleport list to pick up a new class, which ended up being Rogue.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">And so it went on, I leveled Rogue and all of my other DPS classes, including ones which unlock later like Samurai and Dancer. My Conjurer remained at around level 19 for over a year, untouched and feared. Then, and if you’ve read my tank anxiety article, you’ll know what’s coming: my FC at the time got involved and pushed me to pick up Conjurer again. Thankfully, this was before the tanking experience, and they were much gentler with me than they went on to be with the whole Paglth’an debacle.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-3.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="White Mage in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-3.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-3.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-3.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-3.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="799" data-injectable="true">It started with FATEs, something that I could do without worrying too much about those around me. We ran up and down Western La Noscea, taking on every FATE we encountered, which not only gave me experience but also levels and new spells to go with them. I very slowly started to actually heal the people around me, though learning how to juggle DPS and healing was definitely a learning curve. Pretty soon, I was level 30 and able to go and pick up my <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-equip-soul-crystal-job-stone-in-ffxiv/">Job Stone</a>, turning myself into a White Mage.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">By this point, the notion of healing wasn’t horrifically scary to me anymore, though I was far from good at it. But I still avoided it as much as I could. Eventually, I left that FC for one reason or another and set out on my own for a long time, not healing but also not fearful of it, until I saw someone with a specific weapon which I absolutely fell in love with — Canopus Lux.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-lux-1.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Canopus Lux Astrologian weapon in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-lux-1.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-lux-1.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-lux-1.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-lux-1.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">This weapon is beautiful; there’s no denying that. Like the Amaro mount, which eventually drove me to tanking, this weapon was the driving force behind my finally overcoming the barrier that was keeping me from healing—my own lack of confidence.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true">And I did. I swallowed my pride, I picked up Astrologian, and I apologized to everyone I ended up with in a dungeon, telling them that they would likely die and they were welcome to kick me if they wanted to. I wasn’t griefing, I was just terrible at healing. Those first dungeons were hard, but I never got kicked. Like with my tanking journey, most people were very understanding, and some even gave incredibly helpful advice. Slowly, I gained confidence, but also skill.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-2.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Manderville Sage weapons in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-2.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-2.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-2.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-2.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="498" data-current-count="798" data-injectable="true">Eventually, I started to crave the rush that healing gave me. I’m not saying that I enjoy having people’s lives in my hands, but I enjoy being able to keep people alive and prolonging the battle long enough to win. It’s a thrill, and I’ve since learned that, like tanking, the different healing Jobs aren’t all that dissimilar to each other. Of course, each has its own nuances, but they follow the same pattern – if people are dying, you heal. If people are good, you do DPS.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">With all that said, I’m never going to be a particularly good healer. I know what I’m doing, and I can keep people alive while doing some damage, but I still get confused between green and pink cards while playing Astrologian (I’m not looking forward to having to relearn the Job after its Dawntrail overhaul), I still accidentally spam Cure sometimes when playing White Mage and I’ll admit that I fall into the trap of over-reliance on Holy.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-1.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Playing as Sage in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-1.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-1.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-1.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-1.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="747" data-injectable="true">Sage is my strongest healer, and if I have to heal, it’s the Job I will always choose. If you asked me to play Astrologian or White Mage right now, I’d have to ask for 10 minutes with a training dummy to figure out what I was doing, and if you wanted me to play Scholar, I’d be clueless because I’ve always leveled it through Summoner. Like I said, I’m not a good ‘all-around’ healer, but if you want a Sage, I can do that for you.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">I also introduced my fiancé to Sage, which is now his main Job alongside my Dark Knight. He, too, was terrified of healing, but thanks to my own experience overcoming that fear, I could help him overcome it, too. I’ve helped others beside him, as well, thanks to my <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-become-an-ffxiv-mentor-and-unlock-the-mentor-roulette/">Mentor</a> status. Talking of which, I was playing as a healer when I finally gained enough Commendations to pick up the crown, which makes the role pretty special to me.&nbsp;</p>

Well, I’ve learned that while new things might be scary at first, there’s a lot of enjoyment that can be gained through learning how to do something. Gaining the confidence to try and ultimately do pretty well at something that absolutely terrified me in <em>FFXIV</em> showed me that learning something new doesn’t have to be something that I fear. I don’t need to shy away from something just because I don’t fully understand it. Figuring out how to do something isn’t just rewarding, but the experience of learning itself can be fun.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">While my healing experience in <em>FFXIV</em> hasn’t caused me to go out and train to be a doctor in real life, it has given me a new perspective. I stopped shying away from bettering myself and took on training courses and new opportunities, including writing, which previously scared me to death.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="false">Fear is natural, but it doesn’t have to define your actions, and you shouldn’t let it. What was it that Eleanor Roosevelt said? “Do one thing every day that scares you”. Your comfort zone may be cozy, but going beyond it is what helps us to grow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Xbox's decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close down three studios</a> (Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog Games) and roll Roundhouse Studios into ZeniMax Online, <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-in-very-rough-state-rumor-redfall-big-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Grubb's rumor</a> that the Perfect Dark reboot was in rough waters made things look even more dire for Xbox fans.</p>
<p>Grubb said the game hasn't really come together in any meaningful way, even after experienced studio Crystal Dynamics (Tomb Raider) <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-a-collaborative-effort-between-the-initiative-and-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially partnered with The Initiative</a> in September 2021. Needless to say, that didn't sound very enticing to anyone interested in the reboot of the stealth first-person shooter game series.</p>
<p>Today, though, fellow insider Nate the Hate countered Grubb's report on the topic. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rygk-rcOogM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">During the latest episode of Spawncast's DirectXbox</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>If it doesn't show next month, I think you could begin to have just some conversation about what is happening with the game, but I wouldn't sound any alarms until the end of the year. If we go the entire year without seeing Perfect Dark in any form, then I think that conversation of concern has to come up, but at this point, I fully expect that we will see Perfect Dark next month and that some of the more recent rumors may have been outdated information perhaps. I have been hearing things this week that Perfect Dark is not in that bad of a state.</em></p>
<p>To be fair, Grubb was not the only insider to speak in a pessimistic fashion of this reboot recently. Even <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jeff-grubb-on-perfect-dark-it-sounds-like-its-in-a-very-rough-state-it-doesnt-sound-like-its-really-come-together-in-any-way.864672/post-122651448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miller Ross</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Doctor_Cupcakes/status/1787973283486515599" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liam Robertson</a>, and VG247's <a href="https://twitter.com/APZonerunner/status/1787865521251139813" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Donaldson</a> shared negative rumblings.</p>
<p>If Perfect Dark does show up on the Xbox Games Showcase slated for June 9, it better be very good. As MIDiA Research Games Analyst Rhys Elliott put it <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-likely-sees-studio-closures-as-eggs-broken-to-make-omelet-situation-an-impressive-showcase-could-mostly-eclipse-anger-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">while talking to Wccftech</a>, Microsoft desperately needs a strong showing to win back at least some of the many disgruntled fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="246" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While exploring <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a></em>‘s pretty expansive underground world, you might not realize that you could be marking the map every time you find a puzzle you can’t solve or a collectible just out of reach to make your life easier later. </p> <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true">Following a successful launch, players are diving headfirst into <em>Animal Well</em>, the first game from <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bigmode-videogamedunkeys-indie-publisher-announces-their-debut-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Videogamedunkey’s publisher Bigmode</a>. The game is designed to challenge you with puzzles you won’t understand or even find until you’ve completed other tasks elsewhere. However, one important note players are sharing as they discover it is that you can mark the map to give yourself pointers for areas where you’ve still got something to do. </p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-find-and-use-the-stamp-in-animal-well" data-injectable="false">How to find and use The Stamp in Animal Well</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/marking-map-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="marking map in animal well" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/marking-map-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/marking-map-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/marking-map-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/marking-map-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true">To mark the map in <em>Animal Well</em>, you need to open the map in-game and press the button that corresponds to the time you want to use to mark it. You can use a pencil to draw on the map, but you can also find an item called The Stamp. <strong>The Stamp allows you to stamp icons on Animal Well’s map to help you remember bosses, enemies, or just something you noticed that might be important later.</strong> </p>
 <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false">You’ll find The Stamp up and to the left from where you found the map. Climb the ladders in the room with the green penguins and head left to find a room with four doors. The Stamp is in the chest you find in this room.</p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true">The game is built so that if you get stuck on certain parts of it, such as the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-beat-chameleon-boss-in-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chameleon boss</a>, you can come back later because there’s so much else you could be doing or a new area to explore at the same time. This type of open-ended gameplay really benefits from the map-marking mechanics because you’re encouraged to get out there and go anywhere. </p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true"><em>Animal Well</em>‘s world is dense and surprisingly large by the time you’ve explored most of it. The map seems to go on and on, even when you think you’ve found every secret, item, and collectible. Marking the map makes your life so much easier in the long run because you can open it and instantly see areas you haven’t explored or where you noticed something you need to return to. </p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">For your own sanity, please don’t neglect this feature. I did, and when I saw others using it, I had to put the game down, cradle my head in my hands, and let the waves of emotion, mostly humiliation, wash over me before I could get back to exploring. </p> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="false">Map markers were a great help when it came to noting the parts of rooms with openings to other rooms that I couldn’t reach with my current equipment. Items you acquire after a certain point allow you to explore previously unreachable areas, so having these marked made my next session of exploration so much easier. </p>

            <p>Sony and Lego are collaborating on a "well-known" IP, and rumour has it, it's Guerilla's Horizon franchise.</p>
<p>Earlier today, noted leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1789233776456872005">Kurakasis</a> suggested that "Sony is preparing something in collaboration with Lego", adding that it was "related" to a well-known series and that an announcement is "expected soon".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Digital Foundry takes a deep dive into Phantom Liberty's visuals in their roundtable.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv9SLtojkTU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Tom Henderson – a "Tier 1 / very reliable source" as determined by the Gaming Leaks and Rumours <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1cpek98/kurakasis_sony_and_lego_are_planning_to_announce/">subreddit</a> community – chimed in to concur with Kurakasis' claim, cheekily adding "an announcement is on the horizon".</p> <div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Sony is preparing something in cooperation with LEGO, it is related to their well-known IP, the announcement is expected soon</p><p>I'm trying to find more details</p></div>— Kurakasis (@Kurakasis) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1789233776456872005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p>In an additional tweet, Henderson said he wasn't "particularly fond" of the "I know something, and you don't obligatory vague insider BS" and clarified his tease with: "But from what I know, there's a Lego Horizon trailer that's ready to go".</p>
<p>Interestingly, Henderson also added: "It also suggests that the rumours of a showcase soon are accurate".</p> 
<p>As for whether this refers to a Lego-ified Horizon game or Lego sets based upon Guerilla's franchise remains unclear for now, but hopefully we'll find out more at the not-yet-confirmed State of Play later this month. Watch this space.</p>
<p>"There are issues to address then, but ultimately, Horizon Forbidden West has landed in fine form on PC (with a new patch addressing HDR issues) and we can highly recommend it," Digital Foundry's Alex said when he put <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-horizon-forbidden-west-the-best-pc-settings-look-a-lot-like-guerrillas-choices-for-playstation-5">Horizon Forbidden West through its paces when it released earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="310" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The days when <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s player base was mainly concerned with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-devs-blue-laser-remarks-fuel-speculation-of-imminent-new-enemy-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spooky in-game events</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-automatons-take-things-to-the-next-level-with-massive-at-at-weapon-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise content drops</a> are now—at least temporarily—in the past. These in-universe problems have been replaced by more substantial problems, and the sheer quality and usability of new content is one of them.</p> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true">To be more specific, <em>Helldivers 2</em> is still reeling from <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-bringing-back-mandatory-playstation-accounts-for-pc-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent PlayStation Network account situation</a>, which left the community fragmented and the game unpurchasable in almost 200 countries. Even Arrowhead Games CEO Johan Pilestedt believes that <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s balancing is now in a spot of bother, saying that he understands why players might feel like “<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/despite-a-hefty-nerf-the-quasar-cannon-is-still-the-best-helldivers-2-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every</a> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-eruptor-nerf-was-deliberate-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time</a> someone finds <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-community-bemoans-railgun-changes-due-to-a-particularly-annoying-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something fun</a>, the fun is removed.”</p>
 <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="336" data-injectable="false">These problems, when put together, don’t paint an awfully pretty picture. In some respects, the situation is fairly dire, albeit one would still be hard-pressed to call it unfixable. Arrowhead will need to respond to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cozzpy/what_youre_all_witnessing_here_is_burnout_this_is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the community’s concerns</a> sooner or later, however, and it’s obvious which option would be preferable.</p> <figure data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true"></figure>

However, I cannot shake the feeling that Arrowhead is simply trying to juggle too many balls at the same time.</p> <p data-characters="550" data-current-count="884" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-season-pass-explained-how-does-premium-warbond-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Premium Warbonds are coming in at a brisk pace</a>: one a month, containing almost half a dozen weapons and gear that often come with all-new features and functionality. In between, Arrowhead has also maintained a steady supply of engaging stealth releases, including <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/abandoned-usable-mechs-now-spawn-on-helldivers-2s-tien-kwan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mechs</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-terminids-can-now-officially-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mutated enemies</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-how-to-airburst-rocket-launcher-educates-players-on-the-dos-and-donts-of-the-latest-stratagem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Stratagems</a>, with the end result being a live-service experience where there’s always something new going on. Worst-case scenario, the community “only” gets a Major Order to contend with, with an enemy mutator thrown in for good measure.</p>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">Obviously, this whole schtick is a non-trivial development setup. Pushing <em>so much</em> content live so often is absolutely taking a toll on the developers, this way or the other, and the community is all but certain that this is why the subjective quality of the recent content releases hasn’t been stellar.</p> <figure data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="650" data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true">It’s entirely possible that the studio has prepared dozens of weapons, armor sets, Stratagems, and features in the years preceding Helldivers 2’s release, and it’s only now going through the motions pushing it all live. Even if this really is the case, though, the brisk release pipeline is having an effect on Helldivers 2’s community through a death by a thousand cuts. The latest Polar Patriot Warbond, for example, is <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cnsu6i/polar_patriots_warbond_now_available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overall a disappointment</a> outside of the new incendiary contact grenade and a new sidearm. There’s reason to believe that some of its offerings were balanced for an entirely different combat sandbox.</p>
 <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true">I’ll concede that this may be the wrong takeaway, depending on how Arrowhead is handling balancing in the backend, but the surface-level conclusion is that the combat sandbox grew too plentiful and varied in too short a time for the balancing team to keep up with everything in an appropriate manner. This, in turn, has resulted in a situation where there’s a <em>massive</em> disconnect between Arrowhead and the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community when it comes to balance, in particular.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">Balancing has become a sore topic in the Helldivers 2 community. In fact, there’s been a <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cobatg/developers_want_a_poll_release_warbonds_monthly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-insignificant amount of friction</a> between vocal players and Arrowhead developers on the game’s Discord. As of right now, it’s not clear what the studio will do next and whether it aims to alleviate the onset of issues in the short term at all.</p>
 <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">Pilestedt’s apparent agreement with <em>Helldivers 2</em> players that the studio has taken things too far is a good sign, at the very least. None of the problems so far are beyond fixing. Slowing down the release of new content and polishing things up would be a major boon to the game at large, from a layperson’s point of view. The vast majority of Helldivers 2’s currently underperforming gear could be tweaked back into relevance relatively easily, even without touching its literal damage output. Pilestedt himself said this is the way to go. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A bit too much balancing using damage as well instead of other measures such as recoil, reload speeds, accuracy, projectile speeds and equip speeds. Just tweaking damage numbers is a blunt tool.</p>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1788292885651001491?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">The question we should all be asking is whether this is an option for Arrowhead from the perspective of contractual obligations with Sony, the publisher. It’s entirely possible that Arrowhead has to keep pushing out monthly Premium Warbonds. If that’s the case, balancing will only become more problematic as we receive 3-4 all-new weapons every single month.</p>
 <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">Just to put that into perspective, if <em>Helldivers 2</em> keeps up its currently established content scheduling, this means the game will have received all of the following items in a single year of live-service support:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false"> <li>48 new weapons</li> <li>12 new grenades</li> <li>12 new Boosters</li> </ul> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">It’s just short of mind-boggling, really. Is this level of continued support feasible if Arrowhead wants to keep <em>all</em> of these items fair, fun to use, and relatively balanced among each other? </p>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">For what it’s worth, it’s all but obvious that Arrowhead Games <em>knows</em> this can’t go on as it currently stands. Something is going to have to give, and either the community continues to grow more unhappy as new items are released in a subpar state, or the studio takes a step back to slow things down and focus more on quality rather than quantity.</p> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true">There’s another layer to this problem, too: can a live-service title afford to slow down or postpone its content pipeline? Is the community going to stick around if a Warbond misses its scheduled release date once, twice, or thrice? Or is everyone going to move on to the next flavor of the month?</p>
 <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true">I do feel that <em>Helldivers 2</em> has more staying power than that. The game could easily support a more forgiving content release pipeline, with a substantially larger balancing buffer than just a month’s worth of attention. Arrowhead Games certainly has what it takes to keep this game on the straight and narrow, but it’s going to take some rethinking of how to deal with it as it balloons to its <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-helldivers-content-is-missing-from-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">true, gargantuan proportions</a>. </p>

            <p>Cyberpunk 2077 associate game director Paweł Sasko has thanked the game's community for the thousands of positive Steam reviews it has received in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>The open-world action-adventure game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-is-super-rough-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-the-memes-have-already-begun">had a release so </a>disastrous, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-investors-may-sue-over-cyberpunk-2077s-materially-misleading-information">CD Projekt investors considered suing the studio</a> for "materially misleading information", and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-begun-refunding-unhappy-cyberpunk-2077-fans-playing-on-ps4">Sony refunded Cyberpunk 2077 players unhappy with the game's performance</a> on PS4 even beyond the typical two-hour playtime limit before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-cyberpunk-2077-from-the-playstation-store">pulling the game from sale completely</a> shortly after it launched.</p>
<p>Now, in the wake of its acclaimed Phantom Liberty DLC, 95 per cent of the 7000+ reviews left in the last month are positive, something Sasko said they "always believed" but "never thought [he] would actually see it".</p>

<figcaption>Digital Foundry takes a deep dive into Phantom Liberty's visuals in their roundtable.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv9SLtojkTU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"You can't imagine how much it means to me," Sasko wrote on Twitter/X, appending a crying emoji. "I have never been close to giving up and always believed this could be somehow possible, but never thought I will actually see it."</p>
<p>"Thank you so much for the second chance chooms."</p>
<p>Sasko then retweeted a screengrab taken by CDPR's global community director, Marcin Momot, which immortalised the moment.</p> <div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>You can't imagine how much it means to me 😭 I have never been close to giving up and always believed this could be somehow possible, but never thought I will actually see it. </p><p>Thank you so much for the second chance chooms🥺 <a href="https://t.co/HLr1Ykphu1">https://t.co/HLr1Ykphu1</a></p></div>— Paweł Sasko (@PaweSasko) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaweSasko/status/1788868832607486099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p>Earlier this year, narrative designer Anna Megill joined CD Projekt Red as lead writer on the studio's upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, codenamed Project Orion.<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fables-narrative-lead-leaves-playground-games">Megill left Fable reboot developer Playground Games last year</a>.</p>
<p>Megill has over 20 years of experience in the industry, and has previously worked on games such as Control and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playgrounds-fable-has-a-new-narrative-lead">upcoming Fable reboot</a>. She will be joined on the narrative team by Alexander Freed, whose previous work includes serving as lead writer on Star Wars: The Old Republic at BioWare.</p>
<p>While Project Orion is still in the "early stages" of development, CD Projekt confirmed it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiplayer-being-considered-for-cyperpunk-2077-sequel-says-cd-projekt">"considering" multiplayer elements for its Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p data-characters="268" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If there’s one thing you’re always going to be in need of in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, it’s Gil. It’s the main currency in Eorzea and whether you’re shopping for gear to increase your iLvl, glamour items, or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-final-fantasy-xiv-minions-ranked/">minions</a>, you’re going to need it and a lot of it.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">It’s fair to say that some things, especially sought-after things like mounts and minions, are ludicrously expensive to buy. It’s also fair to say that crafting is, as it’s widely acknowledged, the best way to make piles of Gil very quickly.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true">I’ve wracked my brain, thought back to my early in-game experience and I’ve come up with some ways to make Gil without crafting in<em> FFXIV</em>. It’s worth remembering that none of these are likely to make you a Gillionaire, unless you get very lucky, and some of them are more effective than others. But hey, any money is good money, right?</p>
 <h2 id="h-treasure-maps-are-good-for-making-a-quick-buck" data-injectable="false">Treasure Maps are good for making a quick buck</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/treasure-map.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="A door within a Treasure Map dungeon in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/treasure-map.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/treasure-map.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/treasure-map.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/treasure-map.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">If you’re wanting to make a quick buck in <em>FFXIV</em>, one of the best ways to do it is by running Treasure Maps, especially high-level ones such as Kumbhiraskin and Ophiotauroskin Maps.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">While you won’t always spawn a portal upon using a Map or get lucky in the dungeon itself, there’s always a chance that you’ll get a rare minion or sought-after material from a chest inside. They also give hefty sums of Gil as a reward on their own, as well, so they’re definitely worth exploring.</p> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="true">Before you can take part in the Treasure Hunt, you’ll need to complete the level 36 quest “Treasure and Tribulations”, which can be picked up by talking to H’loonh in Eastern La Noscea (X:21.1, Y:21.1).</p>
 <h2 id="h-work-towards-your-weekly-challenges" data-injectable="false">Work towards your weekly challenges&nbsp;</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/challenge-log.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The Challenge Log in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/challenge-log.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/challenge-log.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/challenge-log.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/challenge-log.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="true">After completing the level 15 quest “Rising to the Challenge” (head to Limsa Lominsa Upper Decks and talk to I’tolwann (X:11.4, Y:11.0) if you haven’t done this yet!), you’ll gain access to the Challenge Log.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">This log is split into different categories, including Battle, Crafting &amp; Gathering, and Levequests. While some challenges reward other currencies upon completion, such as Wolf Marks or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-way-to-get-mgp-ffxiv/">MGP</a>, most will provide you with a nice chunk of change (either 1,000 or 2,000 Gil) when completed.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">The Challenge Log refreshes at the same time as the general <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-reset-timer-explained-when-does-the-daily-and-weekly-reset-happen/">weekly reset</a>, 2 a.m. on a Tuesday, so make sure you get them completed before this happens or you’re missing out on free Gil.</p>
 <h2 id="h-be-the-adventurer-in-need" data-injectable="false">Be the ‘adventurer in need’</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/adventurer-in-need.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The Duty Finder window showing Adventurer in Need in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/adventurer-in-need.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/adventurer-in-need.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/adventurer-in-need.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/adventurer-in-need.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">When running daily <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-become-an-ffxiv-mentor-and-unlock-the-mentor-roulette/">roulettes</a>, it’s always a good idea to check which type of player is classed as “in need”. If you queue for a Duty as this type of Job (Healer, Tank, or DPS), you’ll not only gain a significant boost of EXP, but also Gil as well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="204" data-injectable="false">You’ll only receive this boost if you queue for a duty with less than the required number of people in your party. If you are queueing with three friends for a Dungeon roulette, this buff won’t apply.</p> <h2 id="h-levequests-are-repetitive-but-they-come-with-monetary-rewards" data-injectable="false">Levequests are repetitive, but they come with monetary rewards</h2> <figure data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/levequests.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="A Large Scale Levequest in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/levequests.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/levequests.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/levequests.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/levequests.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false">I’m the first person to admit that doing Levequests is not my idea of a fun time, however, some of the higher level Levequests offer a comparatively huge amount of Gil when you consider how little effort is involved.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">This is especially true for Large Scale Levequests, available in Foundation. Some of these Levequests offer a reward of more than 10,000 Gil per completion, so they’re definitely worth doing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="263" data-injectable="false">You get three Levequest Allowances every 24 hours of real time up to a maximum of 100 and what you do with them is up to you. I’d suggest using them if you have them, though, because otherwise, you’re just missing out on free Gil for very little effort.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-hoard-and-sell-everything" data-injectable="false">Hoard and sell everything</h2> <figure data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/selling-items.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Selling items to a vendor in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/selling-items.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/selling-items.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/selling-items.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/selling-items.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Whether you’ve been grinding out dungeon runs, tackling FATEs in the overworld, or your retainers have returned from a venture with items in tow, almost everything can be sold for a profit in <em>FFXIV</em>. It’s unlikely that you’ll gain anything of significant value by any of these methods, though it does happen, but you will be able to amass a lot of items.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true">If you don’t want to mess around with the Marketboard, you can simply head to any vendor who sells items for Gil and select the “Buyback” tab in the pop-up window. Either click and drag items from your inventory into the vendor’s pop-up window, or right click the item in your inventory and click “sell”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">If you’re comfortable using the Marketboard, it can be a good place to sell stacks of items, especially high level items that you’ve gathered yourself. Even if you’re opposed to Crafting, you should definitely look into Gathering. It can be quite relaxing to zone out, listen to music, and pile up the materials in your inventory.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">And if you’re up for a little bit of dodgy trading, keep an eye on item prices on different servers by utilizing tools such as <a href="https://universalis.app/">Universalis</a>. Items can often be purchased cheaply on other servers and sold for a profit in your home world. I know it feels scummy, but you’ve gotta do what you’ve gotta do, sometimes.&nbsp;</p>

 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li>Stock up on GC seals by trading in usually untradeable dungeon gear and, as long as you’ve reached the rank of Captain, you’ll be able to buy Materiel Crates. These contain minions and mounts which can sometimes be pretty valuable.&nbsp;</li> <li>Use your FC credits to purchase items from the OIC Quartermaster. These items can then be sold on the Martketboard for Gil. Miniature Aetherytes are a pretty safe bet, here as Estate owners need them in order to teleport to their house.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p data-characters="121" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">You can also purchase some materials which will be needed by Crafters, some of which can also be sold on the Marketboard.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Keep an eye on Moogle Treasure Trove events</h2> <figure data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/itinerant-moogle.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Itinerant Moogle in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/itinerant-moogle.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/itinerant-moogle.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/itinerant-moogle.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/itinerant-moogle.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">Invariably, Moogle Treasure Trove events offer at least one popular item which can then be sold on the Marketboard for Gil. Usually, this is a minion or mount, so keep an eye on which are available in each event. </p> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">Take the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/moogle-treasure-trove-the-second-hunt-for-genesis-launches-may-14-in-final-fantasy-xiv/">Hunt for Genesis II</a>, for instance, which begins on May 14. One of the rewards is the Ufiti Horn, which is selling for between 500,000 and 600,000 Gil at the time of writing. These are good items to purchase using Tomestones, set aside, and then sell at a later date when demand increases again. </p>
 <h2 id="h-side-quests-might-not-make-you-rich-but-at-least-it-s-something" data-injectable="false">Side quests might not make you rich, but at least it’s something</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/side-quests.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="A map with side quests in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/side-quests.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/side-quests.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/side-quests.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/side-quests.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">Let’s be honest, there are quite literally hundreds of side quests in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> and every single one of them rewards at least a handful of Gil upon completion. While it might only seem like pennies, clearing out an entire zone of side quests will increase your coffers by a pretty hefty sum.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">Yes, they’re tedious at times and, if you’re not careful, you’ll spend more teleporting around the map than you earn by doing them. However, if you’re really stuck and dedicate yourself to flying rather than teleporting, you can earn enough to buy yourself something pretty when you get back to a city state.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="dfWX6A">I spent a lot of time contemplating the title of Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s new film <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em>. It still echoes in my brain, as I watch and rewatch the film. It’s a puzzle to turn over, a bitter lozenge lodged in my cheek. It’s almost farcical, how banal the movie’s premise is: a talent agency wants to set up a glamping site in a remote Japanese village, and sends two hapless PR reps to sell the community on the plan. Most of us don’t contemplate the nature of evil when considering <em>glamping</em>, you know? But maybe we should.</p>
<p id="0z71gd">At its most obvious, <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em> is an environmentalist fable. Hamaguchi, who previously directed <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22947711/drive-my-car-deserves-best-picture-oscar"><em>Drive My Car</em></a>, moves at a languid pace, and the sparseness of his script means that, on a plot level, few things happen in this movie. The film is built around <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/05/evil-does-not-exist-ryusuke-hamaguchi-movie-drive-my-car.html">a 20-minute town-hall meeting</a>. Otherwise, it mostly follows Takumi (Hitoshi Omika), a widower raising a young daughter, Hana (Ryô Nishikawa) and earning a living doing odd jobs in his mountain village. He collects water from a spring for a local restaurant, splits firewood, and does whatever else needs doing. Hamaguchi is happy to have the camera follow Takumi at a comfortable distance as he goes about his day. </p>
<p id="0mbzaS">Through Takumi’s eyes, the audience gets a clear point of view on the community reaction to the agency’s plans for a glamping development, as the locals articulate their relationship with the environment and how the project would destroy that. It’s quite clear, though, that the agency’s interest in community input is solely for optics. No one actually cares what the villagers think.</p>
<p id="t1v3TY">And the agency’s owner — who can’t be bothered to show up to the town hall himself — doesn’t even seem that invested in the glamping endeavor. The company’s stated goal isn’t in branching out into recreational services, but in obtaining pandemic subsidies from the government to boost its bottom line. You could call that evil. </p>

<p id="g6Kv75">Hamaguchi began work on <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em> with the intention of creating a visual art piece to accompany the work of musician Eiko Ishibashi, who also composed the score for <em>Drive My Car</em>. Even expanded into a 106-minute feature film, <em>Evil Does Not Exist </em>retains the feeling of an abstract tone poem, more about what the viewer has to say in response than about anything the filmmaker puts on screen. The moral obviousness of the film’s central conflict, therefore, feels like a trick — a sleight of hand, a dare to watch more closely.</p>
<p id="mdEVuZ">It’s easy to idealize Takumi’s life, the way Takahashi (Ryûji Kosaka), one of the agency reps, does upon meeting him. Takahashi and his colleague Mayuzumi (Ayaka Shibutani) return to the village after the town-hall meet goes poorly, with instructions to offer Takumi a job at the glamping site so he can convince the other villagers to support the development. Takahashi, however, fantasizes about running off and just living in Takumi’s village, gushing about how good it feels to chop wood, to do something with his hands. </p>

<p id="LUvVQa">Both Takumi and Takahashi — like everyone in the village, like you or I would be, were we to find ourselves in front of Hamaguchi’s camera — are still strangers to the natural world that this fictional village is built around and depends on. It is possible to be respectful to that world, as a village elder says during the town hall, noting the community’s responsibility to think of everything downstream of them. But it’s arrogant to think we truly <em>understand</em> the wilds around us. To behave as if we belong. </p>
<p id="zITvJ0">In this, <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em> leans toward a folk-horror tradition, as Hamaguchi slowly pivots away from dispassionate naturalism, building to an impressionistic, opaque finale. The provocation of the film’s title echoes through the woods, which the film begins and ends by regarding from below. Maybe that’s what the title is getting at. Maybe it’s a whisper echoing through and from the ground itself, about how foolish it is to believe that the earth, even in its stillness and beauty, has any regard for our moral attitude toward it. Maybe we ought to tread more carefully, and be fearful in our taking. Maybe evil only matters because we’re here to think about it, and when we’re gone, it will be too. </p>

<p data-characters="451" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Lately, there has been chatter of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, everyone’s favourite mash-up of Disney magic and <em>Final Fantasy</em>-esque action, getting a movie adaptation. These rumours come courtesy of Disney fan site <a href="https://thedisinsider.com/2024/04/24/the-disinsider-mailbag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The DisInsider</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/HollywoodHandle/status/1785802352898793534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">film industry insider DanielRPK</a>, but I’m not here to discuss the validity of their claims. Rather, I want to talk about how if Disney really does want a <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> movie, it faces an incredibly steep uphill battle.</p> <p data-characters="713" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="true">I can imagine pitches for a <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> movie adaptation have floated within Disney for a while, especially in more recent years. After decades of embarrassments, video game movies have been popping off lately, with the likes of <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, the <em>Uncharted</em> movie, and both <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> movies proving profitable for their respective IP holders. <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is a big name, big enough for non-fans to recognize it, and its inclusion of beloved Disney characters would undoubtedly attract people who don’t even know what a Sora is. However, I do not think you can meaningfully translate <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> from a video game into a movie; not without some audience-alienating compromises.</p>
 <p data-characters="871" data-current-count="871" data-injectable="true">You’d have to assume any <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> movie would be based on the original 2002 game which, despite the series’ reputation for having extremely complicated lore, does feature a fairly simple storyline. A young boy named Sora sets out on an adventure spanning multiple Disney worlds, alongside Donald Duck and Goofy, to save the universe from dark monsters while searching for his missing friends. I’d say that’s an apt and easy to understand summation of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>‘ story, but it also barely scratches the surface. There is a lot going on in <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>; too much to condense into even a two-hour movie. Movie adaptations typically and understandably cut out chunks of their source material in order to fit their runtime, but when it comes to <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, there’s nothing you can cut without it feeling incredibly jarring.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Part-of-Kingdom-Hearts-2-is-a-Christmas-game.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Part of Kingdom Hearts 2 is a Christmas game" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Part-of-Kingdom-Hearts-2-is-a-Christmas-game.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Part-of-Kingdom-Hearts-2-is-a-Christmas-game.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Part-of-Kingdom-Hearts-2-is-a-Christmas-game.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Part-of-Kingdom-Hearts-2-is-a-Christmas-game.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="1044" data-current-count="1344" data-injectable="true">One of the main draws of the series is getting to visit all these faithful recreations of worlds based on beloved Disney movies. The first game alone is full of gems, from the madcap world of Wonderland from <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> to the gothic streets of Halloween Town from <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>. Besides some of its outlandish story beats, this is what general audiences know <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> for, so you’d think a movie would make this a big focus. The problem is you wouldn’t be able to fit all of the first game’s nine Disney worlds into a rough runtime of two hours. Plus, with how self-contained most of these worlds are, only occasionally nudging the main plot forward, jumping from one to the next would feel incredibly jarring, even if Disney cut the number down to, say, only three worlds. It’d feel like one of those old direct-to-video Disney sequels, like <em>Atlantis 2</em>, which claimed to be movies but were clearly hastily stitched together standalone episodes of a TV show that never got off the ground.</p>
 <p data-characters="621" data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true">On top of that, making the Disney visits the priority risks giving little time to the elements original to <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>. In the game, the opening hour is spent introducing Sora, his friends, and his island home before it’s all taken away from him. This is followed by his meeting with Donald and Goofy and learning about their quest, the threat of the Heartless, and the magical weapon known as the Keyblade. It’s the kind of set-up you can’t condense into the first 20 minutes of a feature-length film, not without it being haphazardly rushed or confusing to anyone who’s not touched the games.</p>
 <p data-characters="892" data-current-count="892" data-injectable="true">So, is the answer to prioritize those elements and maybe skip over the Disney world stuff? Well, no, because then you’re eliminating an easy way of getting non-fans to watch the movie. I know some game fans wish the series would ditch the Disney element completely, but it’s a key part of its identity. Take that away, and you have another typical Square Enix RPG. Even if a movie were to put less emphasis on them, Disney characters would still be present, but would your average Disney lover be willing to sit through a <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> movie if the only characters to make an appearance were Donald, Goofy, and maybe Mickey Mouse himself? I don’t think so. Perhaps the only other alternative would be to completely overhaul the first game’s story to better fit it into the style of a movie, but then you’re left with something completely unrecognizable to fans.</p>

It’s why I think the smartest thing to do would be to follow Amazon and Bethesda’s example with their <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/first-fallout-reviews-say-its-one-of-the-best-game-adaptations-ever-made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fallout</em> TV show</a>, and have a completely original plot set within the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> universe. That way, you can craft a story that’s perfectly suited to the medium of film, rather than awkwardly truncate roughly 30 to 40 hours of video game. Unfortunately, that’s not entirely viable either, since it’d only really appeal to established fans. The average movie-going audience is far less likely to be intrigued, especially if it requires a deep understanding of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> lore. Knowing this series, I can absolutely see a potential movie incorporating important plot points mandatory for understanding <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-date-characters-and-everything-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 4</a></em> or something, like Square Enix did with the mobile games.</p>
 <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">If anything, the structure of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> would be a much better fit for a Disney+ TV show. In the games, each world acts like their own story arc, and can quite easily be condensed into one or two episodes. A show could even expand upon each world with new story elements. Die-hard fans already know there was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/12a4ef1/kingdom_hearts_lost_pilot_episode_of_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pilot for such a TV show back in 2003</a> that obviously never got the greenlight. If Disney wants to bring a new audience to the games, a Disney+ series would be a smart way of doing it.</p>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">I would not be surprised if this rumoured movie is real, but ultimately gets shot down before any actual progress is made for whatever reason. Some pitches simply never get off the ground. However, the current climate could embolden Disney to give it a shot. Cross-promotion works as evidenced by Amazon’s aforementioned <em>Fallout</em> show <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-tv-show-sparks-a-surge-in-popularity-for-the-games-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased sales and player counts</a> for Bethesda’s games. </p>
 <p data-characters="571" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="false">That’s not the only example; Nintendo’s enjoyed a boost in sales thanks to the <em>Mario</em> movie (per <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240507e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this financial report</a>), and <em>The Last of Us</em> saw <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hogwarts-legacy-and-last-of-us-were-the-most-searched-for-games-on-google-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">renewed interest thanks to its own TV adaptation</a>. A well-made movie combined with the launch of <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, whenever that is, could be huge for Disney and Square Enix. I do not envy whoever is put in charge of such a project, though, because it is far too easy to get catastrophically wrong, resulting in a product that fails to sell <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> to potential new fans while angering the ones it already has.</p>

<p data-characters="242" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">According to information shared by users online, major internet service providers in Vietnam are now blocking Steam in what appears to be an effort to better support the local games market and control which games are released in the country. </p> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false">Users in Vietnam across social media platforms and forums are reporting that their access to Steam has been blocked. One thread on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/0/4362376335340911703/?ctp=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam’s forums</a>, in particular, shows a user who has also lost access to Xbox Game Pass. </p> <h2 id="h-users-are-reportedly-losing-access-to-steam-and-other-marketplaces-in-vietnam" data-injectable="false">Users are reportedly losing access to Steam and other marketplaces in Vietnam</h2> <figure data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screen_GTA501.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="Grand Theft Auto GTA 5 pointing from behind cover" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screen_GTA501.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screen_GTA501.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screen_GTA501.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screen_GTA501.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Steam</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false">A report on the situation was initially published on a <a href="https://vietnamnet.vn/nen-tang-steam-phat-hanh-game-khong-phep-vao-viet-nam-2271136.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vietnamese website</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/steam-suddenly-banned-in-vietnam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Developer</a> was quick to confirm the news using a translated version of the article. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/steam-currently-banned-in-vietnam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesIndustry.biz</a> was told by a spokesperson for a local Vietnamese publisher that Steam sidesteps Vietnamese compliance by launching games without local approval. </p> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true">The comments on compliance are likely in regard to a <a href="https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnam-moves-to-tighten-legislation-on-video-game-industry-insights-for-foreign-investors.html/#:~:text=Restrictions%20on%20video%20game%20content&amp;text=Under%20Decree%2072%2C%20the%20following,distort%20and%20undermine%20history%3B%20and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2023 piece of legislation</a> that tightened censorship rules in Vietnam. Steam has its own guidelines for what can and can’t be included in games, but it distributes those games worldwide. This means Vietnamese games have to adhere to the Vietnamese guidelines, but games released on Steam don’t.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">Vietnamese Helldivers 2 players are also reporting they lost access to Steam on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cn5hro/its_been_an_honor_my_friends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit</a>. A fun but fairly poignant post highlighted the efforts players had made when a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-backpedals-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-plans-after-3-days-of-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSN account requirement</a> was about to lock many players out of the game. The sad reality is that after all that, the player’s government had blocked Steam and made it impossible for them to play anyway. </p> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">Reddit user thesilentwizard explained, “Starting yesterday, the Vietnamese Government has decided to ban access to Steam on all ISPs. The main store page has been blocked. This move is a part of their 200IQ strategy to ‘support the local gaming market’ by forcing us to play shitty pay to win mobile games.” </p>
 <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">Other users in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1cmb5tv/steam_storepage_has_been_blocked_by_viettel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments on Reddit</a> are mentioning how Vietnamese publishers want more players for their free-to-play mobile games. Blocking one of the world’s largest game marketplaces would certainly force users to turn to whatever games are available. </p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">Based on the information from GamesIndustry.biz’s source, this may be more of an effort to protect the local game publishers that rely on the Vietnamese market instead of forcing people to play a specific set of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-mobile-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mobile games</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="59" data-current-count="59" data-injectable="false">Valve has yet to comment on the matter as of this writing. </p>

While rolling one dice at a time gives you two to three points, raising this to 10, 20, or even 100 will multiply these points at the cost of using extra dice. In other words, while doing this is the key to finishing the event, it makes it much easier to burn through your entire dice supply in no time, especially if you’re using powerups like High Roller to increase your maximum roll limit.</p>

  <p id="lJndSl">Spoiler warnings have become a polite way to signal to the internet that you’re about to discuss some aspect of a movie they might prefer not to know before seeing the film. People online have argued endlessly about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8IAhI-B6UU">what constitutes a spoiler and what needs a warning</a>. But the question gets more complicated when a studio’s marketing for a movie is handing out the spoilers.</p>
<p id="jYdzQN">It happens surprisingly often. Trailers are designed as sizzle reels, and trailers for action- or effects-oriented movies in particular frequently include footage from the finale, to sell a film around its biggest, splashiest moments. Marketers often think of a movie’s big twist as a similarly splashy draw: Recently, all the trailers and even the poster for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24133463/abigail-review-horror-comedy-vampires-scream">the horror movie <em>Abigail</em></a><em> </em>gave away a reveal the movie had clearly designed as a major narrative twist. Looking further back, marketers for James Cameron’s <em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em> were so eager to showcase Arnold Schwarzenegger’s role that they built an entire marketing campaign around <a href="https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/670-terminator-2-and-the-worlds-biggest-spoiler/">what Cameron clearly intended as a huge mid-movie surprise</a>. </p>
<p id="Qn9oWQ">The marketing for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24152022/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review"><em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em></a> doesn’t feel as overtly spoilery as those examples, until you actually watch the movie. But in pursuit of a poster-worthy image, the movie’s marketing team hugely undermined what director Wes Ball and his writers were trying to do with the film’s story.</p>
<p id="P6uwL9">[<strong>Ed. note: </strong>Spoilers for <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes </em>ahead — or at least, context that’ll make it clearer how you’ve probably already been exposed to the spoiler.]</p>

<p id="oHbc86"><em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em> opens with the funeral of Caesar, the chimpanzee at the center of the ape revolution that started in 2011’s Apes series reboot <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24150403/watch-planet-of-the-apes-movies-streaming-hulu-starz"><em>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</em></a>. Then the action jumps forward “many generations” (300 years, according to 20th Century Studios), to an era when humanity is scattered and sparse, former human cities have become lush jungles, and clans of apes live in distinct communities. The protagonist, Noa (Owen Teague), and his close friends Soona (Lydia Peckham) and Anaya (Travis Jeffery), belong to the Eagle Clan, a tribe of apes whose small society revolves around the raptors they raise, train, and bond with.</p>
<p id="gXdQxQ">Noa, Soona, and Anaya start the movie by trying to gather eagle eggs for an upcoming ceremony where they’ll get their own bonded birds. But after disaster hits, Noa ends up separated from the others, and traveling with Sun, the eagle belonging to Noa’s father, Koro. Noa previously had a strained, yearning relationship with both Koro and Sun. He believes Sun is traveling with him only to mock and judge him for his perceived failings.</p>
<p id="fulXDF">Repeatedly throughout the film, Noa either attempts to interact with Sun, with violent results, or vocally rejects Sun’s presence, out of guilt and shame. Noa literally spends the <em>entire movie</em> trying to engage positively with this giant eagle, whose approval represents Koro’s approval and his legacy. It’s clear Noa associates his assumption of manhood and his place in the tribe with his attempts to bond with his father’s raptor. Their connection is the center of Noa’s entire character arc, and it ties intimately into the film’s climactic action scene.</p>
<p id="00I3Kt">And yet we saw how that arc ended 30 seconds into the very first teaser for <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>, released a full six months before the movie.</p>

There’s no way you’re going to miss it, if you’ve been paying any attention to this movie at all. Their bond has been a selling point for the movie since the very beginning. And that’s unfathomable once you start watching the movie, and seeing how much weight the story puts on the question of whether they can ever connect.</p>
<p id="pgJzs5">The odd thing about this particular spoiler is that it doesn’t read as one when you’re looking at the poster or watching a trailer. It just reads as a world-building detail: This particular band of apes engages in falconry with eagles, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_with_eagles#:~:text=Their%20falconry%20custom%20involves%20hunting,colored%20foxes%20against%20the%20snow.">certain human tribes have in the past</a>. It’s a mildly interesting reflection of how one post-humanity species has taken up some of humanity’s habits, while purposefully dropping others.</p>
<p id="gHpgMB">But by half an hour into the movie, it becomes clear that Ball and the writers expected the audience to emotionally invest in the drama around Noa and Sun’s relationship, and in Noa’s hurt and confusion about whether Sun will ever accept him. For those of us who watch trailers or look at movie posters, that question was answered six months ago.</p>
<p id="Ruihof">Did we know all along that these two crazy kids would finally get back together? Of course. This is a four-quadrant action blockbuster, after all, and it’s designed to let the audience walk away with a sense of triumph and catharsis. There was no version of the world where the hero of this movie never gets a payoff to his journey, never completes his arc, and never finds fulfillment in the wake of all his losses and changes. We certainly all could have anticipated that eventually, Noa and Sun would make peace.</p>

<p id="dtz7QW">If they were even in conflict in the first place. A mildly sad aspect of this entire arc is that Noa clearly thinks Koro finds him disappointing and looks down on him, but nothing in Koro’s behavior suggests that’s true. He seems to authentically love his son and want him to be happy. Koro isn’t a bully or a distanced, domineering ape, he’s just a clan elder with a lot of other youngsters and eagles to look out for. Their disconnect appears to be entirely in Noa’s head.</p>
<p id="40i3MY">His troubles with Sun seem similarly to come from shame and self-doubt rather than reality: It seems clear from the beginning that Sun shares Noa’s grief, that Sun leads the chimp to his lost tribe, and keeps trying to approach him for comfort and connection. But Noa’s fear, uncertainty, and anger are barriers to their relationship. They can’t bond until Noa lets go of some of those doubts and reaches out confidently to take up his father’s legacy.</p>
<p id="BUZoQQ">All of which should be a triumphant moment, and the payoff to an emotional, satisfying arc. If only we hadn’t had the end of this story trumpeted on every poster and promo image — long before we even knew what the story <em>was</em>. </p>

            <p>God of War: Ragnarök is reportedly the next Sony game coming to PC.</p>
<p>Leaker billbil-kun – who has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-playstation-plus-essential-game-for-march-leaks">regularly, and correctly, let Sony-shaped cats out of the bag before</a> – purports that they have "managed to determine" that a PC port of the hugely successful sequel to 2019's God of War will be announced "sometime in May".</p>
<figure>

<p>Billbil-kun says they're unsure of the game's release date but reckons we may find out more at the next PlayStation State of Play showcase, which is also rumoured – but yet to be confirmed – to be taking place later this month.</p>
<p>If the port <em>is</em> confirmed later in May, all eyes will be on Sony and whether or not it will require PC players to connect to PSN. Initially, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-developer-wants-you-to-know-you-can-play-it-on-steam-without-linking-to-a-psn-account">Ghost of Tsushima developer Sucker Punch told players that they would only be required to connect to PSN</a> if they intended to use the Legends multiplayer mode, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-players-are-getting-auto-refunds-if-they-cannot-legally-sign-up-for-psn">players who cannot legally make a PSN account are having their pre-orders automatically refunded</a> regardless.</p>
<p>If you haven't gotten around to it yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-free-valhalla-dlc">don't forget that at the end of last year, Sony treated us to a free rogue-lite expansion</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crow-country-is-a-gloriously-grimy-revival-of-%E2%80%9990s-survival-horror.868242/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even as modern horror games become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14353714/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc">unnervingly immersive</a>, there’s still a place for the particular mood of old-school survival horror. Through a combo of grimy visuals, cryptic puzzles, slow pacing, and clunky controls, PlayStation-era games like <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Silent Hill</em> were able to create a distinct kind of tension and terror. <em>Crow Country</em> is what would happen if that kind of game never went out of style. It has the look and feel of the classics but with just the right amount of modern flourish. It’s a perfect bite of classic horror.</p><p><em>Crow Country</em> comes from indie studio SFB Games — led by brothers Tom and Adam Vian — which has so far managed to create quite the eclectic library of releases. There was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16633946/snipperclips-plus-nintendo-switch-interview">the playful Switch launch title <em>Snipperclips</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20917268/apple-arcade-tangle-tower-localization-translation">the point-and-click murder mystery <em>Tangle Tower</em></a>, and now a dark survival horror game. <em>Crow Country</em> doesn’t just evoke the <strong>’</strong>90s&nbsp;— it’s set during the period as well. The entire game takes place in an abandoned Atlanta amusement park in 1990, as a woman named Mara sets out in search of the park’s elusive owner who mysteriously disappeared. Of course, the place is teeming with monsters and mystery.</p><p>The first thing you’ll notice is just how much this looks like a 32-bit game. The attention to detail is immaculate, from the blocky characters to the fuzzy textures to the crunchy, distorted sounds. Even the menus are period-appropriate. This extends to how the game plays and how it’s structured. Initially, Mara only has access to a small section of the park, but slowly, you’ll open up more by collecting obscure items, specific-colored keys, and solving very strange puzzles. The park itself is both scary and comical, like if the original <em>Resident Evil</em> mansion was crossed with <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em>.</p><p>You move around like, well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_controls">a tank</a>: movement is slow, you have to stop to shoot zombie-like enemies, and the aiming is intentionally frustrating to amp up the tension. Similarly, you have to deal with limited resources, with relatively scant ammo and medicine to keep you going. All of this infuses even small encounters with danger. You do <em>not </em>want to waste bullets. It helps that the monster designs are truly unsettling, with fast-running toddlers, spindly-legged monstrosities, and shifting blobs with faces.</p><p>What’s most remarkable about <em>Crow Country</em>, though, is how it builds on those old-school sensibilities with some very welcome quality-of-life tweaks. Perhaps the biggest: the camera is actually 3D, so you can move it around to get a better look at your surroundings. But there’s also a more modern control option for better shooting, a limited hint system for when you miss one of those small clues, a very helpful map, and safe rooms that actually feel safe, so you can catch your breath and plan your next move. There’s even a mode that removes enemies entirely if you just want to explore.</p><p>The impressive thing is that these updates don’t take away from that classic tension. They simply remove some (but not all) of the frustration inherent in <strong>’</strong>90s-era survival horror, creating perhaps the most accessible example of the genre while maintaining the look, feel, and personality. <em>Crow Country</em> does all of this while telling an excellent mystery that dramatically builds in scope over five hours or so of playtime. It doesn’t quite surpass its inspirations, but it’ll remind you why you loved them so much in the first place.</p><p><small>Crow Country <em>is available now on the PS5, Steam, and Xbox Series X / S.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Steam has been banned in Vietnam.</p>
<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/steam-suddenly-banned-in-vietnam">Game Developer</a> and spotted by our sister site, <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, it's unclear exactly why the PC platform has been banned, but GI.biz proposes it may be due to "Valve's business operations".</p>
<figure><figcaption>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, as reported in <a href="http://vietnam.net/">Vietnam.net</a>, it's possible Steam has been taken down in Vietnam after local game developers complained about the scope and size of Steam's vast portfolio of games, claiming Vietnamese devs cannot compete with Steam's releases given they are subject to government approval and thousands of international games on Steam are not.</p>
<p>Citing it as "an injustice to domestic publishers", Vietnamese studios reportedly say that local game development "will die" if Steam is able to keep releasing games without the same government scrutiny as domestic games.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there's been no formal word from Vietnamese authorities or Steam about the "ban", but according to players, all Vietnamese internet providers have "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/0/4362376335340911703/">decisively blocked access</a>" to both the Steam launcher and Steam's website, and unhappy players have taken to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/0/4362376335340911703/?ctp=2">Steam Forum</a> to share their dismay.</p>
<p>"TLDR: the online game monopolies of Vietnam complains that they can't extort the market share our Lord and Savior Gabe Newell rightfully earned," said <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/0/4362376335340911703/#:~:text=%2314-,%EA%91%ADHorus%EA%91%AD%20%F0%93%82%80%20Disciple%20of,-7%20May%20%40%202">one</a> unhappy Steam user.</p>
<p>"So they wanted to brand him and Steam as illegal platforms. Now they have just gone ahead and blocked the platform in Vietnam, forcing users to tinker a bit with their DNS to bypass."</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-players-are-getting-auto-refunds-if-they-cannot-legally-sign-up-for-psn">Steam is taking the unprecedented step of auto-refunding players who bought Ghost of Tsushima</a> Director's Cut in countries where PSN isn't available.</p>
<p>As developer Sucker Punch is "part of the PlayStation Studios family", it seems a decision has been made to pre-emptively refund all pre-orders to players who can't legally sign up for PSN after fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">review-bombed Helldivers 2 so badly</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony eventually reversed the decision</a>.</p>

<p id="z6apCR"><strong>Director: </strong>Todd Haynes<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins</p>
<p id="ILdwKm">Fans of Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway, and director Todd Haynes all seemed to miss one of their finer works of the last few years: <em>Dark Waters</em>, a legal thriller that does for teflon pans what <em>All the President’s Men</em> did for presidents’ men.</p>
<p id="MopIEI">Based on an equally riveting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html">New York Times Magazine</a> expose, and adapted by Matthew Michael Carnahan (<em>The Kingdom</em>), <em>Dark Waters </em>stars Ruffalo as Robert Billet, a real life corporate defense lawyer who is basically guilt tripped into investigating a string of unusual deaths in West Virginia. But as he begrudgingly pokes around, Billet finds that each death traces back to a chemical plant owned by DuPont, and what unravels is one of the great atrocities committed on American soil by a major corporation. Billet knows he can’t stay quiet, but doing so flips his career and life at home upside down.</p>
<p id="wiEB6A">It’s simple but riveting drama, conducted by Haynes in an usually buttoned up style (fans might expect the psychological delirium of <em>Safe</em> or <em>May December</em>). In different hands, without a sensitivity to the human plight and a curiosity for how cracking open a case like this actually works, <em>Dark Waters</em> would be fodder for Peacock docuseries shlock. But Ruffalo, haggard and relentless, and Hathaway, playing an almost throw away part as his supportive but drained wife, burrow so much deeper than what an hour of <em>Law &amp; Order </em>could do. And yes, I tossed all my teflon pans afterward. <em>—Matt Patches</em></p>

<p id="Fu8Vo0"><strong>Director: </strong>James Nunn<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Scott Adkins, Michael Jai White, Alexis Knapp</p>
<p id="QiwgRH">The 2021 movie <em>One Shot </em>took a chance on an experiment: A tactical military action thriller all presented in one take. Star Scott Adkins and director James Nunn reunited for the sequel, <em>One More Shot</em>, which takes the solid foundation and ideas of the first movie and expands on them in a more successful end result. Crucially, the sequel is set in an airport, which adds a different dimension to the action and the one-shot gimmick. It was also a big logistical hassle, as the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24042893/one-more-shot-director-james-nunn-interview-scott-adkins">movie was filmed in a working airport.</a> The fights are great (especially one set on a moving train, using the hand rails as weapons and movement aids), and Adkins’ physical performance in these movies is breathtaking. It’s among the more immersive action thrillers you will find. –<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="0NVglT"><strong>Director: </strong>Taylor Hackford<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Rachel Ward, Jeff Bridges, James Woods</p>
<p id="Jxtuff">If you’re looking for a steamy, slow-burn drama with picturesque sights and great performances, Taylor Hackford’s 1984 thriller will totally be in your bag. Based on the novel by Daniel Mainwaring, <em>Against All Odds</em> stars Jeff Bridges as Terry Brogan, an aging football player who is cut from his team after suffering a debilitating injury. With no other options, he accepts a job from Jake (James Woods), a notorious gambler, to find his ex-lover Jessie (Rachel Ward), who happens to be the daughter of Terry’s ex-boss. </p>
<p id="P0Yebk">Bridges and Ward have terrific on-screen chemistry together as their relationship deepens, and Woods predictably nails it home as a smooth-talking villain with a talent for conniving and manipulation. As if that weren’t enough, the film itself was pivotal in the creation of 2010’s <em>Tron: Legacy —</em> director <a href="https://forcesofgeek.com/2011/03/fog-chats-with-tron-evolution-director.html">Joseph Kosinski modelled the character of CLU</a> after Bridges’ performance in <em>Against All Odds</em>. All in all, it’s a damn solid thriller. <em>—Toussaint Egan </em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Resident Evil 2 remake, alongside<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-path-tracing-performance-4k/"> other entries in the series powered by the RE Engine</a>, recently received a<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-village-path-tracing/"> path tracing mod</a>, which greatly improves the visuals in certain scenarios. So much so to make the considerable performance hit almost bearable.</p>
<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> showcased how the remake of the second entry in the series by CAPCOM is improved by modded path tracing. The biggest improvements introduced by the mod are path-traced shadows followed by global illumination improvements, which are less noticeable due to the game's visual design. Even without denoising, the end results look quite good and could definitely be a good trade-off for performance for some players.</p>

<p>The Resident Evil 2 remake is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-2-remake/">review</a>, who found the remake maybe a little too faithful to the original.</p>
<p><em>Resident Evil 2 is a polished, respectful remake of a survival horror classic that probably would have benefited from a slightly more daring approach. Hints of a braver revamp are sprinkled throughout, but it doesn’t take the risks necessary to join the canon of truly great video game remakes. Make no mistake, though, if you loved the original Resident Evil 2, you’ll likely love the remake, and new players who can tolerate a few old-school quirks ought to have a gruesome good time as well.</em></p>

<p>There are people who relish the feeling of finally nailing down a cryptic clue in a crossword. There are also people unduly aggravated by a puzzlemaster's puns and clever deceptions. I'm more the latter kind. I don't even play the crossword—or <em>Wordle</em> or <em>Connections</em> or <em>Strands</em>—but my wife does, and she'll feed me clues. Without fail, they leave me in some strange state of being relieved to finally get it, yet also keyed up and irritated.</p>
<p><em>Cryptmaster</em>, out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885110/Cryptmaster/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/cryptmaster">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://akuparagames.itch.io/cryptmaster">Itch.io</a> for Windows, seems like the worst possible game for people like me, and yet I dig it. It is many things at once: a word-guessing game, a battle typing (or shouting) challenge, a party-of-four first-person grid-based dungeon crawler, and a text-prompt adventure, complete with an extremely goofy sense of humor. It's also in stark black and white. You cannot fault this game for a lack of originality, even while it evokes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/wizardry-remaster-keeps-apple-ii-vibes-but-adds-graphics-and-modern-graces/"><em>Wizardry</em></a>, <em>Ultima Underground</em>, and lots of other arrow-key-moving classics, albeit with an active tongue-in-cheek filter.</p>

<p>The Cryptmaster in question has woken up four role-playing figures—fighter, rogue, bard, and wizard—to help him escape from his underground lair to the surface, for reasons that must be really keen and good. As corpses, you don't remember any of your old skills, but you can guess them. What's a four-letter action that a fighter might perform, or a three-letter wizard move? Every time you find a box or treasure, the Cryptmaster opens it, gives you a letter count, then lets you ask for clues. "SMELL," you type, and he says it has that wonderful old-paper smell. "LOOK," and he notes that there are writings and drawings on one side. Guess "SCROLL," and he adds those letters to your characters' next ability clues. Guess wrong, well, better luck next time.</p>

<p>Once you've got a few verbs, you'll want to learn them and figure out how they fit together, because you'll have to fight some things. Combat is all about typing but also remembering your words and juggling cooldowns, attack, defense, and ability costs. Strike with your fighter, backstab with the rogue, fling a spell from the wizard, and have your bard reset the fighter's cooldown, all while a baddie very slowly winds up and swings at random party members. Some fights can be avoided by maneuvering around them, but successful fights also let you choose another letter to potentially reveal new verbs. Apologies for the somewhat vague descriptions here, but I'm trying not to give away any words.</p>
<p>There are a few other mechanics to learn, like smashing wall-crawling bugs to gather their ability-powering essence, and defiling shrines to better suit your undead needs. But let's talk about the Cryptmaster. Saying the character is "voiced" by the game's writer and co-designer, Lee Williams, truly undersells it. As with some of the best adventure games, Williams and coder/designer/artist Paul Hart have anticipated so, so many things you might type in when prompted to guess, ask, or interact with their gloomy little world. Maybe there's a point at which the Cryptmaster—a far more dour version of the HBO Cryptkeeper eternally disappointed in you—stops being surprising in his responses. I have yet to find it after a few hours of play. (How the team pulled off such a huge response range is detailed in <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-dungeon-crawler-cryptmaster-responds-to-anything-you-type-into-it-s-word-based-systems-">an interview at Game Developer</a>.)</p>
<p>Go ahead and recapture some of your childhood sense of wonder: Swear at the Cryptmaster. You won't be disappointed.</p>
<p>You can play the game in turn-based mode, removing the pressure of remembering and typing out actions, but it's not the recommended setting. While I played with only typing and relished the chance to give my mechanical keyboard a workout, you can also play with voice prompts. If you're not sure if this is the kind of game for you, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885110/Cryptmaster/">a free demo on Steam</a> that should clue you in.</p>
<p>Was that a pun? Maybe. <em>Cryptmaster</em> gave me a bit more appreciation for word-guessing games—the kind with enjoyments that are not easily, shall we say, spelled out.</p>

            <p>Steam is auto-refunding players who bought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut in countries where PSN isn't available.</p>
<p>Last week – around the same time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">Helldivers 2 was being pulled from sale in 177 countries</a> following the disastrous rollout of mandatory PSN linking – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-developer-wants-you-to-know-you-can-play-it-on-steam-without-linking-to-a-psn-account">Ghost of Tsushima developer Sucker Punch confirmed that Steam players were not required to sign up to PSN</a> if they only wanted to play the Director's Cut's singleplayer campaign on Steam.</p>
<p>Now, however, it seems digital storefronts like Steam and Green Man Gaming have either decided – or been instructed to – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ghostoftsushima/comments/1cp2h5p/ghost_of_tsushima_being_autorefunded_by_steam/">automatically refund pre-orders</a> from people who live in territories where players cannot legally sign up for PSN.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Ghost of Tsushima Review - Ghost of Tsushima PS4 Pro Gameplay.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnYPgpmxeVw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whilst there's been no official word from Sony, Steam, or Sucker Punch itself about the automatic refunds, the game's subreddit and numerous social media channels are being hit with complaints from players who pre-ordered the game only to find that their order was cancelled.</p>
<p>As developer Sucker Punch is "part of the PlayStation Studios family", it seems a decision has been made to pre-emptively refund all pre-orders to players who can't legally sign up for PSN after fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">review-bombed Helldivers 2 so badly</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony eventually reversed the decision</a>.</p>
<p>The message Steam pre-orderers are receiving says: "You are receiving a refund for a game you pre-purchased - Ghost of Tsushima. The publisher of this game is now requiring a secondary account to play portions of this game - and this account cannot be created from your country."</p>
<p>Initially, it was thought that only Green Man Gaming was taking the unprecedented step of auto-refunding Ghost of Tsushima pre-orders, but many players are reporting that the same is now happening on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ghostoftsushima/comments/1cp2h5p/ghost_of_tsushima_being_autorefunded_by_steam/">Steam</a> and Epic Games Store, too.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Sucker Punch and Sony for clarification and will update just as soon as we hear back.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut will finally release on PC on 16th May, 2024. The team at Nixxes Software recently laid out the crossplay and system requirements for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-first-playstation-game-to-have-pc-trophy-support">Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on PC</a>. It has also detailed a new optional PlayStation UI overlay for PC.</p>

            <p>V Rising was finally released in full this week, and so many players have jumped into the open-world survival game, it's breached 100,000 concurrent players for the first time since it released as an early access two years ago.</p>
<p>Developer Stunlock Studios marked the milestone on social media with a "Thank you!" and a simple graphic that confirmed there were "100,000 vampires in-game".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>V Rising trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp21y-jizKs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, the 1.0 edition is sitting on a "very positive" Steam rating, with almost 4000 recent reviews bolstering the early access release's similarly positive score.</p>
<p>"It's like Diablo and Ark but with vampires and actually fun," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/CatherineTakamaki/recommended/1604030/">opined</a> one happy player.</p>
<p>"On first try played with friend for 11 hours, and now we scared of the sun," added <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013914020/recommended/1604030/">another</a>.</p>
<p>Even some less enamoured players can't quite bring themselves to say anything negative.</p>
<p>"I don't personally like the game due to the main gameplay," said one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070319773/">reviewer</a> who had their game refunded on Steam. "Fighting like Diablo with survival gameplay where you build your own homes like most sandbox. Everything is solid.</p>
<p>"I just personally can't play games like Diablo anymore. I just don't like it. Good game just not for me."</p> 
<p>Players who have left less positive messages have called the game <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/retrov1king/recommended/1604030/">boring</a>, complained about the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044215397/recommended/1604030/">grind</a> and the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198146557160/recommended/1604030/">preset difficulty settings</a>, and disappointed about how the game is "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049394193/recommended/1604030/">being ripped apart again</a> and sold in parts, with 4 DLCs that are even more expensive together than the game itself, just to sell the game in parts multiple times".</p>
<p>Find out why Bertie thinks it may be time to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/v-rising-makes-me-wonder-is-it-time-to-rethink-the-survival-crafting-template">"rethink the survival crafting template"</a> and his thoughts about how V Rising has "bulked out in early access" and now "locks its really good stuff away".</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survival-game-v-risings-10-release-arrives-on-pc-this-may">detailed previously</a>, V Rising's 1.0 release brings some significant changes and additions, primarily focusing on its end-game. A PS5 version is also scheduled to arrive later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo seems extremely serious about the security of the Nintendo Switch 2, going so far as to create a codename for the system's actual codename.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SciresM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciresM</a>, a well-known hacker in the current Switch scene who developed the system's custom firmware Atmosphere, among other things, provided a clarification for the Muji codename that's been making the rounds on the web in the past few hours. The codename, which means plain in Japanese, is a placeholder used specifically to avoid leaking the new codename. As knowing the console's codename would be pretty pointless information, creating a codename for a codename is something that only a company like Nintendo would do.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Muji ("無地", "plain") is a placeholder used there specifically to avoid leaking the new codename.</p>
<p>— Michael (@SciresM) <a href="https://twitter.com/SciresM/status/1789102337283551484?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Much like reading too much into the Nintendo Switch 2 codename, doing the same with the "successor" expression used by Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa to describe the Nintendo Switch 2 is pointless. In the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240508e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;A session</a> held after the release of the company's latest financial results, Furukuwa-san confirmed how, at this stage, the "successor" expression was the most appropriate one for the announcement, although rumors do seem to suggest the new system will indeed be an <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-conservative-hardware-evolution/">evolution of its predecessor.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>A native The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask PC port has been made available, complete with Steam Deck support, Gyro aiming, and much more.</p>
<p>A freshly released tool allows for PC ports of N64 titles without the need to use the original game's source code. This new project isn't to be confused <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-majoras-mask-native-pc-port/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the project from 'HarbourMasters' that we reported on last year</a>. Created by coder 'Mr Wiseguy', his recompilation of Majora's Mask uses static recompilation to automatically translate an application from one platform to another. In order to be able to play the game on PC, users will only need the original ROM of the game - no game assets are required. As noted by the creator, the tool uses '<a href="https://wccftech.com/n64-emulator-plugin-rt64-ray-traced-lighting-dlss-object-motion-blur-widescreen-60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dario's' RT64 plugin</a> as the rendering engine to provide various enhancements, including fully intact N64 effects, high-resolution effects, widescreen support, and 60+ FPS. "A lot of care was put into RT64 to make sure all graphical effects were rendered exactly as they did originally on the N64. No workarounds or "hacks" were made to replicate these effects, with the only modifications to them being made for enhancement purposes such as widescreen support", the creator of the tool explains.</p>
<p>As said, the project also supports Steam Deck support with players having the option to set up Gyro Aiming on Valve's platform as well. For more information, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Zelda64Recomp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github page here</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/dariosamo/status/1789049137729515533" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by modder 'Dario' on X, additional features such as ray tracing and emulator support will come in future updates when they're ready. We've included a video of this impressive project below (courtesy of YouTuber 'Nerrel') alongside the main features of this recompilation tool below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Recompilation: An Incredible New Way to Keep N64 Games Alive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywWwUuWRgsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Main features Ocarina of Time Recompilation project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plug and Play</li>
<li>Fully Intact N64 Effects</li>
<li>Easy-to-Use Menus</li>
<li>High Framerate Support</li>
<li>Widescreen and Ultrawide Support</li>
<li>Gyro Aiming</li>
<li>Autosaving</li>
<li>Low Input Lag</li>
<li>Instant Load Times</li>
<li>Linux and Steam Deck Support</li>
</ul>
<p>The Majora's Mask recompilation can <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Zelda64Recomp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be found on Github here</a>. According to 'Mr Wiseguy' he's currently working on a recompilation of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time as well. The coder is also planning to add support for a dual analog control scheme (with analog camera), mods, texture packs, and model replacements in the future.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about this impressive new tool? Will you be trying it out? Do you prefer Majora's Mask over Ocarina of Time? Which other N64 games would you like to see ported using this recompilation tool? Hit the comments below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a rough week for Xbox following <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple studio closures decided by Microsoft</a> and the severe blowback from fans and fellow developers alike, not to mention reports of <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-in-very-rough-state-rumor-redfall-big-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Dark having a rough time</a>, but a new rumor suggests State of Decay 3, at least, might be coming along well.</p>
<p>The third installment in the open-world zombie survival series was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-announced-to-be-early-in-pre-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> during 2020's Xbox Games Showcase when developer Undead Labs revealed the new entry was early in the pre-production phase. To this day, that pre-rendered concept trailer is all we have of the game, and a report from 2022 <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-pre-production-mismagement-sexism-undead-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> there were problems early on due to a lack of vision.</p>
<p>However, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer put his chips on State of Decay 3 when he <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-is-phil-spencers-most-anticipated-game-alongside-starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it was his most anticipated game and expressed excitement about the advancements the studio would introduce to the franchise.</p>
<p>Now, Windows Central's Jez Corden spoke about the game in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mIx8dcrQk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest Xbox Two Podcast</a>. He heard it's coming along very well. Here's the quote:</p>
<p><em>I know Jeff Grubb put out there that Perfect Dark isn't doing that well. Well, I'll put out there that I've heard that State of Decay 3 is doing very, very well and looks very, very, very good.</em></p>
<p>Going back to the advancements hinted at by Spencer, the only hint we have is what current Xbox Studios head Matt Booty said at E3 2018, just after Microsoft had <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-adds-5-new-creative-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> Undead Labs (alongside Playground Games, Compulsion Games, and Ninja Theory). At that time, the executive referred to the original pitch behind Undead Labs: making a zombie MMO codenamed Class 4. The studio ultimately decided to go step-by-step, starting with single player before adding multiplayer with the sequel, but State of Decay 3 is meant to go much larger with persistent online elements. At least, that's what the plan was nearly six years ago; things may have since changed, but it seems doubtful given the ever-increasing emphasis put by publishers on live service games.</p>
<p>We also know that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-is-being-made-with-unreal-engine-5-and-help-from-gears-of-war-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is being made with Unreal Engine 5 with the help of The Coalition</a>, the studio behind Gears of War. They are likely helping not just with making the shooting feel better but also with their great technical expertise with Epic's game-making tool.</p>
<p>Nearly four years after the game's announcement, we might be overdue for a new look at the Xbox Games Showcase due to go live in less than a month, though it's worth noting Undead Labs didn't just sit idly all this time - State of Decay 2 has received new content and constant updates (the latest of which went live in late March) and still has a thriving player base.</p>
<p>State of Decay 3 is currently announced only for PC and Xbox Series S|X, though with <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's new policy</a>, nobody can rule out potential ports to other consoles.</p>
