			<p>The Death Stranding 2: On the Beach release date announcement should be imminent, as information about the game's physical editions, including a pricey Collector's Edition, started surfacing online ahead of pre-orders opening.</p>
<p>The ever-reliable billbil-kun revealed in a new<a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/death-stranding-2-louverture-des-precommandes-est-imminente-60048" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> report</a> that information about the game's physical editions have started surfacing, suggesting that pre-orders are about to begin, and thus a release date announcement is imminent. Besides a standard edition, which will launch for €79.99 and $69.99, a Collector's Edition will also launch in North America and Europe for the price of $299.99 in the United States. The contents of the Collector's Edition are still unknown at the time.</p>
<p>As the insider estimates pre-orders for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will begin before the end of the month, there's a very good chance that the game's release date will be revealed during this week's special panel at SXSW 2025, which will feature not only Hideo Kojima but also Norman Reedus and Troy Baker who play main character Sam Porter Bridges and villain Higgs, respectively.</p>
<p>Likely being a few months away from the release of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach on PlayStation 5, this would be the perfect time to revisit the first entry in the series and get reacquainted with the series' universe. You can learn more about the game's Director's Cut version, now available on PC and PlayStation 5, by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/">review.</a></p>

<p>2K has a habit of rewarding its player base for simply playing. WWE 2K25 follows suit and provides regular Locker Codes to enter. If you do so, you get bonuses ranging from in-game currency to gameplay modifiers. Let’s see what March 2025 Codes we can dig up for WWE 2K25.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> lets you be whatever you want: The Face That Runs The Place, The American Nightmare, The Apex Predator, or any other gimmick-infringement-worthy monikers. It has as much content as a WWE game has ever had—plus the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wwe-2k25-ratings-roster-confirmed-so-far-every-superstar-legend-dlc-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest roster to date</a>!</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter which feature pulls you in providing it gets the job done. To ensure you don’t become a jobber though, keep up with the latest Locker Codes.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-active-wwe-2k25-locker-code-amp-reward-march-2025">Every Active WWE 2K25 Locker Code &amp; Reward (March 2025)</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How much longer will the American Nightmare rule? Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Below are the current Active Locker Codes for WWE 2K25 in March 2025. We’ve also been kind enough to provide the exact characters you need to enter as well. </strong></p>



<p>Double-check what you’ve typed if you get an error, these systems can be finicky. If you get it right, you get a nice <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25</a> reward.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Locker Code</th><th data-align="center">Reward</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">ELITEROCK2K25</td><td data-align="center">Unlocks Mattel “Elite” The Rock</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-wwe-2k25-locker-codes">How to Redeem WWE 2K25 Locker Codes</h2>



<p><strong>You must venture into the WWE 2K25 Settings screen to find the Locker Codes option. Here, input the codes and redeem your free content.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s some more precise instructions if you’re unsure of what to do:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up WWE 2K25.</li>



<li>Go to <strong>MyFaction</strong>.</li>



<li>Head to the <strong>Live </strong>option on the left when the game mode has loaded up.</li>



<li>Go to the bottom and press on <strong>Locker Codes</strong>.</li>



<li>Enter an Active Locker Code.</li>



<li>If entered correctly, a prompt appears confirming it’s worked and you receive the item!</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-expired-locker-codes">WWE 2K25 Expired Locker Codes</h2>



<p><strong>There are no expired WWE 2K25 Locker Codes at the time of writing.</strong></p>



<p>The above statement is true for now, but the ever-changing nature of Locker Codes ensures it won’t be accurate forever. If you try an Active Code and it doesn’t work, there’s every chance 2K has decided to take it offline.</p>



<p>Remember to always be quick and stay on top of the newest Locker Codes!</p>



<hr>



<p>2K’s Locker Codes scheme is a great incentive for keeping on top of WWE 2K social media. Goodies and boosts at no extra cost are always welcome. If you think we’ve missed any codes, be sure to post them below.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has lost this console generation to Sony when it comes to pure sales, but according to one analyst, the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> could be a "last hurrah" for the Xbox Series X and S consoles. <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/analyst/rhys-elliott" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rhys Elliott of MIDiA Research</a> said in an interview that, although Sony will emerge as this console generation's victor, Microsoft could benefit substantially from GTA 6's launch in terms of hardware sales, especially of the less expensive Series S console.</p><p>"Like Rockstar's other flagship titles, GTA 6 will hit PlayStation and Xbox before it hits PC. Therefore, it could pay off for Xbox to have a significant Series S push and fire sale to tie in with GTA 6--as one last hurrah for this generation," Elliott told <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/analyst-xbox-series-x-s-could-have-a-last-hurrah-with-grand-theft-auto-6-were-it-not-for-a-certain-blue-elephant-in-the-room" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>. "The marketing team should be banging the drum, highlighting that 'The Series S is the most accessible way to play GTA 6.' A sub-$200 Series S could be an enticing entry point to GTA for cash-strapped consumers, of which there are many, thanks to today's tumultuous economy and cost-of-living crisis."</p><p>Currently, the 512 GB Xbox Series S is priced at $300, with the 1 TB version going for $350--it's not uncommon to see lower prices, though. Even if those prices hold until GTA 6 launches this year, the Series S would remain the least-expensive console someone could buy to play GTA 6, as the Series X and PS5 are more expensive.</p><p>The Series S is underpowered compared to the Series X and the PS5, of course, but Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-on-xbox-series-s-im-not-really-worried-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527625/" data-ref-id="1100-6527625">isn't worried about that</a>. "Look, we support the platforms where the consumers are for as long as they're there, and we find a way to support platforms despite different levels of tech. Our labels are really good at that. I'm not really worried," Zelnick said.</p><p>However, Elliott also mentioned how the "sad-dad blue elephant in the room" is the possibility that Sony, not Microsoft, secures marketing rights to GTA 6. If this happens, it could give Sony a bigger edge, as trailers and other marketing materials would focus on PlayStation, not Xbox. Elliott pointed out how Sony paid Warner Bros. for the marketing rights to Hogwarts Legacy, which he said led to non-console owners buying a PlayStation console, not Xbox, to play the game.</p><p>"It is worth noting that PlayStation would very much want the same thing to happen with GTA 6. Take-Two also of course wants to sell the most copies it can and would do so via PS5's higher installed base. That's why I reckon PlayStation will get the rights," Elliott said.</p><p>Console sales in the US are slumping, and other experts have predicted that GTA 6's launch--combined with the debut of the Switch 2--could help <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">lift the overall gaming market in 2025</a>.</p><p>GTA 6 launches this fall for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">though it could be delayed</a>. Rockstar Games released the game's one and only trailer back in December 2023, and since then, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wait-for-gta-6s-second-trailer-just-broke-a-sad-record/1100-6528595/" data-ref-id="1100-6528595">has not said a single word about the game</a>.</p>

The first of these is the door puzzle, which throws players off by providing almost useless symbols into the mix.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4455112-splitfiction_howtounlocktheiceking%27scastle0-3screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4455112" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4455112-splitfiction_howtounlocktheiceking%27scastle0-3screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4455112"></a><figcaption>Ice King Palace door puzzle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4455112-splitfiction_howtounlocktheiceking%27scastle0-3screenshot.png"></figure><h2>Ice King Palace door puzzle solution</h2><p>The instinct is to look at the symbols and match them with the icons on the door, but this isn't quite the way to solve this puzzle. When you get to the large door with the symbols on, turn Zoe into her fairy form and use the nearby flower trail to gain access through the door via the lock. Meanwhile, Mio should wait outside in her monkey form.</p><p>When she gets inside, Zoe will spot a lever and four buttons that control the outside buttons. Instead of matching the symbols, you want to get the notches around the outside of the buttons to line up with the flowing vines until they light up.</p><p>When all four of the buttons line up outside, and the vines are lit up, Mio should punch the buttons to lock them in. Then, the door will open, and you can proceed through the level.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4455111-splitfiction_solvingtheiceblockpuzzleinhopesofspring0-20screenshot%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4455111" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4455111-splitfiction_solvingtheiceblockpuzzleinhopesofspring0-20screenshot%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4455111"></a><figcaption>Ice King Palace block puzzle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4455111-splitfiction_solvingtheiceblockpuzzleinhopesofspring0-20screenshot%281%29.png"></figure><h2>Ice King Palace ice block puzzle solution</h2><p>The next puzzle blocking your way to the Ice King is the block puzzle. Here, Mio can use her monkey form to punch the ice block across the ice in certain directions, while Zoe can use her tree form to raise large stones to block it in its path. If the stones aren't raised due to the slippery surface, the block will just keep sliding until it reaches an edge.</p><p>The goal is to get the ice block in the center of the area so that Mio can punch it through the green gateway and free up some space for them to move forward. This isn't as straightforward as it seems, as there are multiple options and pathways to take. If we take the block's starting position and say that the green gateway is south, the most effective solution is:</p><ul><li>Push the block south</li><li>Raise the stone to the east and push the block east</li><li>Raise the stone to the north and push the block north</li><li>Push the block east</li><li>Raise the stone to the north and push the block north</li><li>Raise the stone to the west and push the block west</li><li>Raise the stone to the south and push the block south</li><li>Raise the stone to the west and push the block west</li><li>Push the block south</li></ul><p>This will smash the gateway and free up Zoe and Mio's path forward.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/07/atomfall-preview-surviving-a-very-british-supernatural-nuclear-disaster/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>What kind of game is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a>? Following its reveal last year, featuring 1950s retro-futuristic tech and a story set in the wake of a nuclear disaster, it might have seemed to be a British riff on the modern Fallout series, but as has been stated time and again in headlines across the gaming press, Atomfall is not Fallout.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall Preview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eIqZnxhVvo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In terms of the narrative at least, this is more of a British STALKER than Fallout. The game takes place following the Windscale disaster in North-East England –&nbsp;the worst nuclear accident in UK history in which one of the reactors caught fire for three days and released radioactive material into the atmosphere. While nowhere near the scale of disaster of Chernobyl, it was also subject to a cover up, the UK government massively downplaying the severity of the issue and failing to evacuate the surrounding area.</p>


<p>In Atomfall, something very different is at play, a mystical force or being known as Oberon, the military group known as Protocol moving in, and a lockdown that has cut the region off from the rest of the world for the last five years. That’s led to a stark divide as some live within the secured confines of Wyndham Village, while feathered outlaws and mask-wearing druids roam the surrounding wilderness, only really interrupted by the occasional Protocol patrol.</p>


<p>Our hands-on time picks up a few hours into the story, as you set foot in Casterfell Woods for the first time. This region is largely controlled by the druids, who follow what they call The Voice in the Soil, having set up wooden walls around their camps, keeping massive bonfires alight, and with towering wicker men standing watch. The druids aren’t openly hostile to you upon first sight – they shout warnings to say they don’t know if you’re a danger to them, in fact – but they’re quick to defend themselves with a strong attack if you get too close or are openly armed. Since they tend to patrol in groups, you’d do will to keep a little distance.</p>
<p>After all, you’re armed with deeply insufficient weaponry. The events at Windscale have led to accelerated corrosion in the region, particularly affecting metals, and with everyone cut off, you’ll be walking around with rusty shooters. At least you can always rely on a handy hatchet to throw at enemies and a good old cricket bat for a bit of melee clobbering –&nbsp;it’s all starting to sound a bit Clockwork Orange here, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Staying away from the druids and bandits won’t always be an option. Tramping through the woods following the one lead I had at this stage, I make my way to meet Mother Jago, a villager that’s outcast herself from the village and made a funny little life for herself at the old mine, making natural tonics and remedies. She’s happy to help, giving you the lay of the land, but for a little more of the mystery, she just asks that you do a little favour and go get her herbalism book back from the druids.</p>
<p>Of course, you can go in all guns blazing, but you’ll probably have a hard time of it, when there’s limited ammo. So it’s much better to take a stealthier approach, hiding away in thick grass to keep out of view once you reach their base at a ruined castle. Heading into the cave network beneath reveals this otherworldly blue glowing growths all over the place, and even more horrors as there’s sometimes human bodies incorporated into this. I later encounter the Ferals that these poor souls might turn into, zombie-like creatures that glow blue from the insides and spit blue goop once you get too close. Get hit by their attacks, and heavy whispers flood your ears – is this the Voice?</p>

<p>Clearly the events at the atom factory have unleashed something, and through exploring the region and continuing down the questlines I had discovered, it certainly feels like there’s multiple paths to take through this story. Do you choose to align with the very real Voice, or is that related to the ‘Oberon’ that you’re told you must kill when answering one of the oddly placed red telephone boxes?</p>
<p>Pulling on the narrative threads help me discover the survivor of a helicopter crash, holed up in a communications bunker and with a nudge to help you access the Interchange and discover more of what B.A.R.D. were up to down there – just beware of mutated rat swarms that will absolutely rinse your healing supplies. You’ll also inevitably be drawn to Wyndham Village, uncovering the tales of the locals who remain under the thumb of the Protocol rule.</p>
<p>Throughout, I’m reminded a little more of something like BioShock than I am Fallout. With the limited supplies and the damage that enemies can deal to you, there’s a particular feel to the combat that I find reminiscent, even if you’re not shooting bees out of your fingertips. Instead you’ll be scavenging for usable items and crafting materials to use with various recipes you find. There’s also a ‘learning potion’ cooked up by B.A.R.D. that gives points toward learning new skills –&nbsp;it’s a reward for exploring and a good alternative to gathering XP and levelling up.</p>

<p>I also love the visual style and tone of Atomfall. There’s common ground to Rebellion’s other games in the look and feel of the world, but instead of bombed out cities and facilities of World War 2, it’s distinctively British, from the stone buildings in the village to the army fatigues and flatcaps, and even to the way the druids have decorated their caves with multicoloured bunting. Decorations fit for a jubilee!</p>
<p>I came out of my time with Atomfall with an awful lot of questions for the whole mystery surrounding Windscale and entrapping the local population, but also a ton of answers for what this game actually is. I’ve honestly no idea which way I’ll lean while wending my way through the full narrative, but I enjoy the feel of this world that Rebellion has crafted, the late 50s / early 60s style of the world and its inhabitants, and the leanings of the gameplay and combat.</p>
<p>There’s just a few weeks before the full game is released, with Atomfall launching for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 27th March.</p>

		<p>A week has whizzed by, and while there’s been all sorts of news, I’ve mostly been playing Monster Hunter Wilds, along with making my way through Split Fiction with Tef. I’ve got a bunch of things to take a look at this weekend… but I’ll probably end up playing Monster Hunter.</p>
<p>To begin with the team’s rundown, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. This is, of course, unexpected. Meanwhile, <strong>Gamco</strong> has been playing Balatro, Avowed, Phasmophobia and Orcs Must Die 3. He said, “Balatro is particularly addictive!”. And then we heard no more from him.</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> is also heavily invested in Monster Hunter, and he told us, “I’ve got an endgame version of every weapon type and am fancy looking.” This is the way.</p>
<p>Weirdly, <strong>Jim</strong> has been fighting the urge to play more Monster Hunter Wilds and taking aim at his backlog instead. He says, “I blitzed through A Plague Tale: Innocence which was a fun rat-filled romp that was well-paced and never outstayed its welcome. Next up, I’m finally looking to beat Mafia III ahead of the next game in the series launching later this year.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> is allowed to tell you he has been playing Assassin’s Creed: Shadows a whole lot! But that is all you’re allowed to know. He’s also currently anticipating a delivery person arriving to give him a copy of Split Fiction to play with his partner.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/glover-qubyte-classics-review/">Glover</a> for review, saying, “It wasn’t great”, but things thankfully looked up, telling us that, “Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii which is a silly and fun spin off, and This Way Madness Lies, a RPG where magical girls save worlds based on the plays of Shakespeare. It was fun and had some good comedy in it. Plus it only takes around 6 hours to complete so well worth a playthrough.”</p>
<p>Though he’s not had much time for gaming this week, <strong>Steve</strong> managed to finish off Eternal Strands and carried on with some Princess Peach Showtime on commutes to uni. He told us what he’s planning to do next, saying, “I need to get back into Avowed where I reached the second area with a two-handed club that seems to one-shot most non-named enemies… I’ve also got some indie games to look at once the current avalanche of marking subsides.”</p>

<p>Rounding us out, <strong>Tef</strong> has (as I’ve already said) been playing Split Fiction with me. We’re onto the final stretch now, so you can expect a review pretty soon. Even sooner than that, though, keep an eye out for his previews of Atomfall and Blades of Fire later today!</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

<p>Earth, our birthplace and cradle is lost, swallowed by millennia and cosmic vastness. Our ships cannot pass through the Limit, confining us to a hundred heliospheres. We see the greater universe but cannot touch it. Are we imprisoned or kept safe?</p>

<p>Zeotech brings us technological marvels. But no matter how far we travel, how far science advances, our shortcomings follow. One hundred suns and we yearn for more. Some must seek further, delve deeper, uncover secrets no matter the warnings that their curiosity will bring disaster. Others are never content with a fair share, needing to dominate and control. History’s lessons are ignored. Mistakes of the past hound us.</p>

<p>Humanity struggles to find meaning, ever at odds with itself, and now a whole star system has disappeared. Dread and paranoia threaten to tear us apart. Previously clandestine powers vie brazenly to control humanity’s future, undeterred by the growing crisis.

<p>Welcome to <em>Zeo Genesis</em>, an upcoming skirmish miniatures game from Best Hobby, featuring game and lore design from industry veterans Andy Chambers and Gav Thorpe. The sci-fi setting sees rival factions battling it out with Zeoforms, known as Zeos. The various factions that populate the worlds aren't at outright war, but that doesn't stop covert operations, small skirmishes, brawls, and grudges from being settled.</p>

<p><em>Zeo Genesis</em> currently has a preview page on <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/best-hobby/zeo-genesis-scalable-smirmish-game" rel="nofollow">Gamefound</a>, and the playtest rules are also available for free on their webpage <a href="https://www.zeogenesis.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. We've been sent a 3D-printed demo set to preview here, and while the forces should reflect those included in the first 2-player starter set, the material the miniatures are made from will change. The rules may also develop between now and the games' publication.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zeo-genesis-5.jpg?itok=ds5koLgn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zeo-genesis-5.jpg?itok=CequzrXO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Mechanical Skirmish Mechanics</h2>

<p>I won't take you through all the rules for <em>Zeo Genesis</em>, as you can&nbsp;read them in full&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zeogenesis.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but I will highlight some of the mechanics that make it stand out for me. The first is the turn sequence, which consists of players taking alternate actions until they run out of actions. This won't sound uncommon for wargames used to alternate action games, but what stands out is that <em>Zeo Genesis</em> only has a single game turn. Once players run out of actions, they take a regroup action, which refreshes all of the action points on their units but doesn't let you activate that turn, with play passing back to your opponent, meaning you will miss that activation.</p>

<p>The second mechanical element I like is the action/reaction system. Each unit has a number of action points available to it, and these can be used to enter an activation mode when it's your turn to activate or to react when one of your units is targeted. When you activate a unit, you pick an activation mode, which then allows your unit to complete a small series of actions, like the Melee activation mode, which gives you 2 move actions and a melee action, with additional melee actions for each unused move action. This allows you to either melee 3 times with a unit you're engaged with or any combination of move and fight actions as required. Or you could take the Charge action, allowing you to take a snapshot shoot action, followed by 2 move actions, and a melee action if you're able to get into base contact with an enemy.</p>

<p>It all combines to give&nbsp;<em>Zeo Genesis</em> a system that feels like a cross between <em>Infinity</em> and <em>Bushido</em> (2 of my favorite wargaming systems), with no slow down for turns as you just keep taking actions, tactically timing your regroup action. The Zeos are also pretty durable, so the action-reaction system works very well as your units won't just be deleted with one hit, and there's no slowdown, it just feels like one epic action phase.</p>

<p>At launch, and the demo pack we received, features 2 factions from the <em>Zeo Genesis</em> universe. The first, Pact, are a freeform gathering of explorers and thinkers, a group that pledged to aid each other. Their force in the demo set is led by the towering Amaroq Masterform Zeo, armed here with the Meson Canon, which increases its damage stat for each hit scored, and the Hivestream, which fires multiple rockets into a blast area, but it has several other weapon options depending on how you equip it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zeo-genesis-7.jpg?itok=3_mla_qy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zeo-genesis-7.jpg?itok=iF1PJUCp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Pact forces from our <em>Zeo Genesis</em> demo kit, led by the huge Amaroq Zeo.</figcaption></figure><p>Supporting the Amaroq is a Bokujin, a drone controller and 4 drones of 2 types that can capture objectives, draw enemy fire and disrupt attacks, and to provide heavier support, the Skerpskutter, armed with either the low attack, high damage AZ Lance, or the Beamer with 4 attack that increases damage with each hit.</p>

<p>The other faction are the Guardcorps, the police enforcers of a powerful private enterprise group. Rather than a single powerful Zeo, the Guardcorps are led by 2 Stormer Zeos that we had multiple weapon options for. We opted for 1 with a Gulo Assault Rifle and the other with a Claviger Battle Rifle. Both weapons have high damage for targeting the Amaroq and the option to fire smart rounds that don't need line of sight to fire.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zeo-genesis-6.jpg?itok=3a5iF4Q8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zeo-genesis-6.jpg?itok=711P7__a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Guardcorps forces from our <em>Zeo Genesis</em> demo kit, led by 2 Stormer Zeos.</figcaption></figure><p>Backing up the Stormers are 3 Troopers, 2 of ours are armed with short-range, high-attack carbines, and the other with the longer range higher damage rifle. Further support is added with the Tech Ops unit, who can keep the Zeos in the fight, and Hyane Pursuit Drones, who are great at taking down enemy support units or can remain close to your Zeos and take damage for them.</p>

<p>I had an absolute blast with <em>Zeo Genesis</em>. The core rules and army lists are still in development, but I already love the flow of the system and how it feels with the big mechs, supported by the ancillary units. The armament options and the current variety of units gives a lot of flexibility in list construction, and I like how the system scales well as the points go up and the amount of Zeos you field increases. The printed miniatures we got aren't the final material, they'll be multipart hard plastic when the campaign delivers, but the sculpts are great, and the setting gives infinite flexibility in how you paint your team. There's a lot we haven't talked about in this preview, which we'll save for the full review, or you can discover for yourself by testing the playtest rules, but this is one to watch for sure, and its success at crowdfunding will only make it better and expand faster with more units and factions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sugardew-island-review-farming-on-budget<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a world long abandoned by humans, you'll soon take on the role of restoring balance through the power of growing crops and selling produce. This&nbsp;<em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;review will explore Rokaplay's latest entry into the Farming RPG genre — a game that also happens to have a dash of shop simulator gameplay mixed in.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4f429af4-356a-4124-a879-487ced844db8" href="https://techraptor.net/games/sugardew-island" rel="nofollow"><em>Sugardew Island</em></a>, players take on the role of a human whose boat has crashed into the titular island. Fortunately, a merchant named Tomte rescues you and sets you up in a derelict (but serviceable) house. In a tale as old as time, you've been put in charge of bringing a dilapidated farm back to life.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sugardew-island-review-managing-the-shop-in-sugardew-island.jpg?itok=bhtTHyU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sugardew-island-review-managing-the-shop-in-sugardew-island.jpg?itok=2n10yPgm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Running the shop takes time, but you'll make way more money than if you sold your produce directly to Tomte the merchant.</figcaption></figure><h2>Farm and Shop and Farm and Shop and...</h2>

<p>You won't be able to do much in your first few days on the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4c0e46e8-9724-4c77-bf91-ea772a990ad1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/sugardew-island-farming" rel="nofollow">farm</a> — you don't have much in the way of money or energy. Still, you'll be able to get your journey started in earnest.</p>

<p><em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;has a pretty simple gameplay loop: you plant crops, harvest them, and sell the resultant produce in a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4929e4fc-9740-404b-9b1a-6a3d5992c143" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/sugardew-island-store" rel="nofollow">store</a>. Selling produce in a store earns you Sugardew (the game's currency) and Harmony, a sort of experience point that can be used to advance <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8fec8a46-7c97-455a-b4b9-270ab0aed527" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/sugardew-island-quests" rel="nofollow">quests</a> at the Harmony Tree. Each completed quest unlocks new items on your farm.</p>

<p>As you progress further in the game, you'll be able to unlock <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="df0d3f4c-414f-49c5-8dd8-2d3306f531d8" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/sugardew-island-animals" rel="nofollow">animals</a> and pets. Pets are a cosmetic luxury that don't contribute to your earnings, but farm animals such as cows and chickens can put a little extra money in your pocket — as long as you remember to feed them.</p>

<p>One quickly falls into a routine: wake up, water and plant crops, sell items at the shop, complete a quest, and repeat. It's plenty of fun in its own right, but it feels like there's a missed opportunity to do more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sugardew-island-review-looking-at-grown-corn-crops-on-the-farm-in-sugardew-island.jpg?itok=HsdXFB3l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sugardew-island-review-looking-at-grown-corn-crops-on-the-farm-in-sugardew-island.jpg?itok=Tj3wEGJ3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There is a lot of acreage available to you for farming, but you'll need to use less than half of it to complete the game in a reasonable timeframe.</figcaption></figure><h2>Farming, Distilled</h2>

<p><em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;essentially has three core gameplay mechanics: growing crops, tending to your animals, and selling the items you get at the store to advance quests. It's a simple gameplay loop and it works, but other games in the Farming RPG genre have much more on offer.</p>

<p>For example, Farming RPGs traditionally will have cooking, fishing, and other side activities. In some cases, there are dungeons to explore, too.&nbsp;<em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;has none of these things; it is laser-focused on its basic gameplay and nothing else.</p>

<p>The lack of a cooking system is particularly disappointing. There are 20 or so different crops that you can grow, but you can only make one energy-restoring item. This is a seriously missed opportunity to let players experiment with different ways of restoring energy or gaining short-term buffs. A robust cooking system often adds a welcome layer of complexity.</p>

<p>On the upside, this simpler style of gameplay makes&nbsp;<em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;more appropriate for younger gamers. There's no risk of tears from dying in a dungeon or losing an animal to sickness. There's no stressing out about catching legendary fish, no list of cooking recipes to scroll through. There's a sort of zen comfort in the simplicity of your daily routine.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;keeps things simple, it manages to do a solid job of performing its double act as a Farming RPG and a shop simulator. It may not be the best game in either genre, but it certainly works well enough for the price point.</p>

<p>Experienced fans of Farming RPGs probably won't find anything novel to enjoy here. Younger games and players new to the genre, however, could easily learn the basic mechanics of Farming RPGs through&nbsp;<em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;without having to crack a wiki open to sort through hundreds of different crafting recipes.</p>

<p><em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;is a great game for younger kids or people who want to simply farm crops and sell items without too much stress. If you don't fall into either of those categories, then you'd probably want to pass on&nbsp;<em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;for now.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-battlefield-dev-diary-gunplay-movement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-details-new-battlefields-gunplay-and-movement-in-first-dev-diary.1128033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-battlefield-dev-diary-gunplay-movement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released the first in a new series of dev diaries aimed at detailing the development process behind the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, and this one's all about the game's gunplay and movement systems.</p>

<p>The movement and combat systems in the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game (which has yet to be officially unveiled) are the first features EA is testing as part of its Battlefield Labs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea" rel="nofollow">initiative</a>, which promises to involve the&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>community in active development through regular feedback and refinement.</p>

<p>According to EA, the goal with the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>is to ensure that "players of all skill levels can enjoy [the game's] gunplay and movement systems". Gameplay should reward veterans while also providing an "intuitive experience for new players to learn and enjoy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-dev-diary-2042-ea.jpg?itok=BQuD7pKe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-dev-diary-2042-ea.jpg?itok=u3xC9NCQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>will prioritize accessibility in its movement systems and gunplay.</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of what's new, there's plenty of granular detail in this dev diary. EA has, for example, reduced the time between pressing fire and bullets appearing on the screen, and the studio has also revealed it's building the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>for a 60Hz tick rate, hopefully increasing precision.</p>

<p>Recoil has also been adjusted so that different weapon types feel unique, and each shot's recoil direction will now match its gameplay angle thanks to "enhancements to gunplay recoil, camera shakes, and firing settles".</p>

<p>As you can tell, EA really wants&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>fans to believe that it's moving on from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-bugs-other-issues-plague-launch" rel="nofollow">disastrous launch</a> of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>, with the studio clearly hoping to win players' trust back after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/60000-battlefield-2042-players-want-their-money-back" rel="nofollow">negative feedback it received</a> regarding that game.</p>

<p>Four studios are working to create the game: regular developer DICE,&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>outfit Motive,&nbsp;<em>Burnout&nbsp;</em>dev Criterion, and former DICE offshoot Ripple Effect. We'll have to wait and see whether it manages to get the series back on track as far as fans are concerned.</p>

WHAT?!</p><p>John. Cena. Turned. Heel. This is real.</p><p>On his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028">retirement tour</a></span>, the former (insert crying emoji) leader of the Cenation kicked his WrestleMania 41 opponent Cody Rhodes squarely in the nuts, forsaking his fans and selling out to The Rock in order to better position himself to secure that elusive, record breaking 17th world title. Whether or not Big Match John is able to actually win the gold remains to be seen.</p><p>To put John Cena’s utterly stupefying actions into context, we’ve assembled the 12 most earth shattering, attitude adjusting heel and face turns in WWE history. </p></div></div><div><p>Two wrestling legends. A damsel in distress. Jealousy. More finger pointing (literal and figurative) than an OG Bloodline segment. It was the worst of times for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-booed-wwe-raw-netflix-1851742857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-booed-wwe-raw-netflix-1851742857">Hulk Hogan</a></span> and Randy Savage.</p><p>In the late ‘80s, the dynamic duo united to form an unlikely (and even more unstoppable) tag team, ruling the WWF with Miss Elizabeth at their side as the Mega Powers.</p><p>Savage began to grow jealous of Hulk’s fondness for Elizabeth, which culminated in an explosive backstage segment that spelled their downfall. Macho Man got in Hogan’s face, nearly poked him in the eyes at least thrice, and smacked him in the head with his WWF Championship belt while an injured Elizabeth looked on in horror.</p><p>You can still feel the tension through the screen as Savage appears legitimately angry at the Hulkster, and the scene becomes even scarier when Macho Man physically tosses Elizabeth out of the way (yikes) so he can keep beating up Hogan.</p><p>The rivals-turned partners-turned rivals again eventually squared off at <em>WrestleMania V</em>, but their blow-up (aka Savage’s heel turn) is the moment that lives on in infamy. Years later, Hogan would pay Savage back for the crimes he committed.</p></div><div><p>A prerequisite for any successful tag team is that they will eventually break up. The Rockers were no different, and their split continues to serve as a standard bearer for how to expertly execute friend-on-friend betrayal in pro wrestling.</p><p>Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty teamed together from the mid-80s to early ‘90s, showcasing their high-flying, fast-paced style and influencing the likes of the Hardy Boyz, Los Guerreros and the Usos.</p><p>However, cracks in their foundation formed when Jennetty accidentally cost Michaels multiple matches and the duo suffered a deflating defeat against The Legion of Doom for the tag titles (which the Rockers never won).</p><p>Brutus Beefcake attempted to mend the Rockers’ relationship on his show <em>The Barber Shop.</em> but Michaels wound up super kicking Jannetty and tossing him through the barbershop window, face first.</p><p>To say the break up had significant ramifications would be an understatement. The Heartbreak Kid transformed into one of the best and most influential wrestlers ever, while Jannetty failed to reach an even remotely similar level of success. Still, The Rockers’s demise, due to Michaels’s turn, served as a blueprint for the division of many tag teams to follow.</p></div><div><p>If you go to the Ocean Center in Daytona Beach, Florida–home of WCW’s 1996 Bash at the Beach–look closely. You can still see janitors cleaning up the debris that fans chucked at Hulk Hogan when he revealed himself to be the third Outsider nearly 30 years ago.</p><p>Hogan turned the (heel turn) tables on Randy Savage, hitting him with a leg drop after viewers assumed he was there to help WCW repel Kevin Nash and Scott Hall.</p><p>Not so.</p><p>He enacted revenge on the Macho Man, but more importantly, revealed his evil intentions to form the New World Order (NWO), which would change the wrestling world forever.</p><p>For wrestling fans in the ‘90s, a Hulkster heel turn was as imaginary as a unicorn. That’s why when it actually happened, it represented something far greater than a shocking swerve. It was a paradigm shift in how wrestling promotions and fans viewed even the godliest of characters. They too can have evil inside of them. More on this later.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a2876366ec9e4f78021b2d17372c8a8" data-recommend-id="image://8a2876366ec9e4f78021b2d17372c8a8" data-format="jpg" data-width="703" data-height="532" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stone Cold fighting off a Sharpshooter" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stone Cold fighting off a Sharpshooter" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a2876366ec9e4f78021b2d17372c8a8" data-recommend-id="image://8a2876366ec9e4f78021b2d17372c8a8" data-format="jpg" data-width="703" data-height="532" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stone Cold fighting off a Sharpshooter" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The fabled “double turn” gained its fame thanks to two WWE Hall of Famers: Bret Hart and Steve Austin.</p><p>Leading up to their match at WrestleMania 13, a heel(ish) Stone Cold was developing into a rebellious, foul-mouthed anti-hero. His promo at the 1996 King of the Ring pay-per-view in 1996 gave rise to “Austin 3:16” and his most famous catchphrase: “And that’s the bottom line cuz Stone Cold said so.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the WWF audience was growing tired of Bret Hart’s stale babyface character. He carried himself with a nauseating self-importance, often whining about the injustices he faced in the ring. Austin called him out for it, and the stage was set for a role reversal.</p><p>The commentators, ironically led by Vince McMahon, championed Stone Cold’s badassery and bemoaned Bret Hart’s sour attitude. Austin’s tough S.O.B. status was solidified when he, bleeding profusely from his head, refused to tap out to the Sharpshooter (making good on his promise) until he passed out.</p><p>The Hitman earned the victory, but Austin won respect from the fans for not giving up and for walking out on his own power. On a macro level, the performance set him up to become the most overwhelmingly beloved WWE superstar of all time. </p></div></div><div><p>The WWE’s Attitude Era was built on the understanding that Vince McMahon hated Stone Cold Steve Austin and vice versa. They were arch nemeses like Batman and the Joker, forever intertwined in mutual disdain… until WrestleMania X7.</p><p>Stone Cold challenged The Rock for the WWF title in Houston, Texas, the Rattlesnake’s home state. A brutal battle ensued, with the superstars bloodying each other with weapons and landing finishing maneuver after finishing maneuver.</p><p>Late into the match, McMahon strutted down to ringside, and pulled Rock off of Austin as the Brahma Bull went for a cover following a Rock Bottom.</p><p>No one knew why.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Austin called for Vince to bring him a chair, with which he proceeded to repeatedly nail The Rock with violently. It took several chair shots and false finishes for Stone Cold to pin the champ, until the evil deed was finally done.</p><p>As The Chairman and Austin shook hands, WWF commentator Jim Ross was beside himself, delivering a handful of trademark “GOD ALMIGHTY’s” and “FOR THE LOVE OF GOD’s,” while berating Austin for “shaking hands with Satan.”</p><p>It was truly a jaw dropping surreal moment that only an unexpected turn could deliver.</p></div><div><p>In the lead-up to their historic bout at WrestleMania X8, Hulk Hogan hit The Rock in the back of the head with a literal hammer. Then, he rammed a semi-truck into the ambulance carrying The Great One away to a hospital.</p><p>It didn’t matter that the Hulkster (a heel) effectively attempted to kill the People’s Champ (a face). Hulkamania would run wild once again on the grandest stage of them all.</p><p>During the Icon vs. Icon match, a thunderously boisterous and partisan Toronto crowd cheered Hogan’s dirty tactics of biting, scratching, stomping, low-blowing and belt-whipping, and chanted “Rocky sucks” whenever The Rock gained an advantage.</p><p>Reading the “room” in real-time, Rock and Hogan orchestrated an improvised face turn mid-match(!) for the latter. Watching Hogan Hulk up for the first time in nearly a decade and fans lose their collective shit was surreal.</p><p>The unplanned turn had several consequences. Most notably, it earned Hogan one more run as WWE Champion and pushed The Rock to turn heel, during which time he masterfully embodied the role of Hollywood sellout. </p></div><div><p>Five years before LeBron James chose to take his talents to South Beach, Batista elected to keep his talents on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-wwe-monday-night-raw-the-rock-john-cena-news-1851734142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wwe-monday-night-raw-the-rock-john-cena-news-1851734142">Monday Night Raw</a></span>. Instead of revealing the decision in an interview with Jim Gray, he did so by power bombing Triple H through a table. To each their own.</p><p>WWE teased The Animal’s turn for months, and they executed the moment to perfection.</p><p>In a nod to Triple H’s banishment of past Evolution member Randy Orton, Batista smiled and gestured a thumbs up to his stable-mates, indicating that he’d listen to The Game and Ric Flair’s wishes and leave for Smackdown. His expression quickly changed to one of anger, and his hand turned over to offer the most dramatic thumbs down in the history of thumbs. Just look at Flair’s face.</p><p>The Animal’s alliance with Evolution was officially over, and Triple H’s days as World Heavyweight Champion felt numbered–much to the delight of fans and the chagrin of his former mentor.</p><p>Babyface Batista went on to defeat The Game at <em>WrestleMania 21</em>, while John Cena knocked off JBL for the WWE Championship, unofficially ushering in a new era of WWE.</p></div><div><p>Eddie Guerrero lied, cheated, and stole his way to the hearts of fans. That is, until he added betrayal to his rap sheet.</p><p>On a 2005 episode of Smackdown, Latino Heat brutally attacked his tag team partner Rey Mysterio. As blood oozed out of Rey’s torn mask, Eddie vertically suplexed his former best friend onto steel steps, a move that looked legitimately painful to both parties involved. The crowd was stunned, their silence deafening.</p><p>The following week, Eddie sauntered to the ring (his patented low-rider notably absent) dressed in black to the tune of his theme music, slowed and reverbed. He cut a promo equally as disturbing as the beating, pulling Mysterio’s mask out of his pocket and screaming at the inanimate object as if it was Rey himself… or rather, Rey’s severed head.</p><p>It would have been easy to fumble the literal theatrics, but Eddie’s ability to convincingly take on the persona of an unstable, psychopathic abuser capable of snapping at any moment (see his “LOOK AT ME WHEN I’M TALKING TO YOU” scream) would make a Shakesperian actor proud.</p></div><div><p>Back when Chris Jericho and Bon Jovi looked like the same person, Y2J was the best in the world at what he did: heeling.</p><p>Jericho officially cemented himself as an irredeemable villain when he attacked babyface Shawn Michaels for turning into “a lying, cheating, pathetic, little worm of a human being.” Ouch.</p><p>Y2J kicked his childhood hero in the groin and shoved his head to the ground, shades of the aftermath of their WrestleMania XIX bout. Double ouch.</p><p>Then for good measure, Jericho violently rammed Michaels’ face into the Jeritron 6000 flat-screen TV. Triple ouch (not H).</p><p>Jericho’s actions were ruthless, but they stemmed from logical reasoning. He claimed Michaels could get away with anything, like retiring the legendary Ric Flair (which he did at WrestleMania XXIV) and cheating to win matches (which he also did), and still receive the adoration of fans. He wasn’t wrong, and because he wasn’t wrong, his subsequent feud of the year with HBK felt so right. </p></div><div><p>At the Payback pay-per-view, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wwe-seth-rollins-captain-america-marvel-1851737016&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wwe-seth-rollins-captain-america-marvel-1851737016">Seth Rollins</a></span>, Dean Ambrose, and Roman Reigns defeated Triple H, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wwe-smackdown-elden-ring-randy-orton-cody-rhodes-1851624304&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wwe-smackdown-elden-ring-randy-orton-cody-rhodes-1851624304">Randy Orton</a></span> and Batista (Evolution) in a no holds barred, elimination match in clean sweep fashion. The following night on Raw, Batista quit the WWE (giving us an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://makeagif.com/gif/batista-goodbye-b3Hnft&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://makeagif.com/gif/batista-goodbye-b3Hnft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iconic GIF</a></span>), and Triple H famously unveiled his “Plan B” for taking out The Shield.</p><p>Rollins stabbed his Hounds of Justice brothers in the back.</p><p>The chair shots echoed long and loudly. The group’s black vests that once seemed bulletproof–thanks to two and half years of dominance–couldn’t resist the double-cross.</p><p>While Rollins’ treachery put an end to The Shield, it skyrocketed his career. He went on to win the Money In The Bank briefcase, successfully cash it in at WrestleMania 31, and hold both the WWE and United States Championships at the same time (becoming the first and only man to ever do that).</p><p>The effects of Rollins’ heel turn continue to ripple a decade later as Reigns opted to smash Rollins in the back with a chair during his WrestleMania XL contest with Cody Rhodes (electing revenge and perhaps costing victory), and Rollins refused to partner with Reigns at Survivor Series: War Games in 2024. That is long-term storytelling at its finest.</p></div><div><p>For years, the WWE Universe refused to accept Roman Reigns as the company’s new John Cena-esque face. Finally, Reigns embraced his inner villain.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://uproxx.com/sports/paul-heyman-interview-wwe-wrestlemania-40-roman-reigns-documentary/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://uproxx.com/sports/paul-heyman-interview-wwe-wrestlemania-40-roman-reigns-documentary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coming out of (a brief) retirement</a></span>, he attacked Bray Wyatt and Braun Strowman at Summerslam. A few days later, the Big Dog revealed a surprising partnership with former nemesis Paul Heyman.</p><p>The result?</p><p>A 1,316-day run as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion for Reigns, which included four WrestleMania main events and victories over Seth Rollins, Brock Lesnar, John Cena, Logan Paul, Cody Rhodes, Drew McIntyre, Sami Zayn, Kevin Owens, are more.</p><p>Reigns’ in-ring success worked in tandem with the flawless development of his Tribal Chief persona, which sprouted from a physically and emotionally abusive rivalry with cousin Jey Uso, and blossomed into a domineering, ruthless, gaslighting, and cult leader of the Bloodline faction.</p><p>Week-in and week-out, the Bloodline delivered can’t miss television–especially when Sami Zayn entered the fray–becoming a mini universe unto itself. Reigns commanded so much gravity that it even drew The Rock into his orbit.</p><p>Roman’s reign of terror came to an end in perhaps the greatest storyline payoff in WWE history. Cody Rhodes–with the help of Seth Rollins, John Cena, Kevin Owens, Sami Zayn, the Usos, and The Undertaker–finally beat the immovable object at WrestleMania 40 and won the WWE Championship to finish his story.</p><p>Without a Roman Reigns heel turn, the WWE today looks drastically different.</p></div><div><p>Hell officially froze over. The lochness monster was found. The forever face that ran the place has gone to the dark side. Hustle, loyalty and respect is dead.</p><p>John Cena, for the first time in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DGtNrVSTD_D/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGtNrVSTD_D/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7,786 days</a></span>, over 21 years, is a heel.</p><p>Back in January, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028/slides/2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028/slides/2">we suggested</a></span> that a retirement tour turn was in the cards, but in order to effectively pull it off, WWE would need to thread the smallest of needles. The needle is threaded. Now it’s time to stitch together a beautiful run.</p><p>Cena has a clear motivation, which is to win the Undisputed WWE Championship and break Ric Flair’s world title record.</p><p>He didn’t emerge victorious in the Royal Rumble, meaning his opportunities started to dwindle. So, he aligned himself with The Rock, a TKO (WWE’s parent company) board member, to ensure he’d have a shot at the gold at WrestleMania 41 against Cody Rhodes (the John Cena of the modern era).</p><p>Still, many questions remain: How will Cena explain his actions? Does he come out to new theme music? Are his jorts and colorful shirts gear of the past? Will the turn have the type of long-term effects that Hogan joining the NWO did? Is he going to retire as a heel?</p><p>Regardless, John Cena’s time as a babyface is up. John Cena’s time as a villain is now. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-played-again-most-anticipated-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Atomfall fits <strong>very nicely </strong>into my wheelhouse. It’s (kind of) a post-apocalyptic, semi-open-world adventure set in the rolling hills of Cumbria, England, and it’s riddled with combat sequences, stealthy escapades, and dense mysteries. I recently played Atomfall for just over an hour, exploring more of what is my most anticipated game of 2025.</p>



<p>My exclusive session took place a few hours into the game, so I had plenty of toys to play with, and I quickly found myself plunged into a stunning world fraught with danger, intrigue, and opportunity.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-atomfall-is-coming">Atomfall is Coming</h2>



<p>Atomfall has been described as ‘Fallout in the United Kingdom’, and that’s not far off the mark. It has post-apocalyptic vibes, roaming robots, mutated creatures, and a solid mix of factions. The world is dangerous and expansive, the survival elements are front and centre, and the game boasts a branching narrative that can be approached from multiple angles.</p>



<p>It also has skill paths, it suits a range of play styles, and the core of the story is set around a nuclear disaster.</p>



<p>I’ve had my eye on Atomfall since it was revealed, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at Gamescom 2024</a>, I had the chance to play an earlier build – and fell in love. This extended preview that I recently enjoyed was nothing short of sumptuous, giving me the freedom to explore a large area of the game and uncover some key secrets – which I won’t spoil here.</p>



<h2 id="h-atomfall-my-impressions">Atomfall – My Impressions</h2>



<p>From what I’ve seen, Atomfall is turning into a sharpened survival title with more than a few innovations. The world looks brilliant, combat feels satisfying, and the gameplay focuses nicely on a balance between open-endedness and dedicated investigations. It’s a mystery game at heart, and players are tasked with ultimately solving what happened in the world to cause this disaster.</p>



<p>There are multiple endings, which can be discovered by aligning with or turning against factions, but it all boils down to getting access to the Windscale Power Plant and finding out what happened – and dealing with it accordingly. That’s the gist I’ve got from my experience with Atomfall, anyway.</p>



<p>Along the journey, players must contend with rampaging raiders, twisted tribes, and some fairly ethereal enemies. It’s not all aggressive, though – there are plenty of friendly, generous folks out there in Atomfall, should you be willing to risk the wilderness to find them.</p>



<p>I had nothing but a good time with Atomfall. I love the pacing of the game, which is fairly slow but can quickly turn on its head when you get into a fight. It’s designed for the player to prioritise stealth and subterfuge over bold-faced combat, which is a refreshing change from the games I’m used to playing of late.</p>



<p>In the hour that I played, I didn’t experience any issues, and I found myself genuinely interested in learning about the events of the world around me through notes, books, and other scraps I could pick up to inform me about the game’s lore. There’s a lot to catch up on, and I’m <strong>intrigued and eager </strong>to learn more.</p>



<p>The set pieces are nice, the animations are clean, and some of the more technical mechanics, like the need to manage your stamina and inventory, present a fair challenge without being too finicky. </p>



<p>I can’t wait for more.</p>



<p>Atomfall will be released on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC on March 27.</p>

<section><p>More than just Fallout in England</p></section>

                <p>Atomfall is a detective game. Yes, the post-apolyctic first-person shooter from the Sniper Elite studio feels more like Paradise Killer than Fallout. Rather than ping-ponging between objective markers around a map, Atomfall's story is structured around a series of clues that are organically picked up and tracked as you explore its world. Its quests are nonlinear and you're gently guided to points of interest. From there, it's on you to reference your quest log and put the story of its world together.</p><p dir="ltr">Atomfall's world might look derivative given how prevalent the post-apocalyptic genre is, but its setting and tone do a lot to differentiate it from its peers. The game takes place five years after the Windscale fire of 1957, a real-world event that happened in the UK and is considered one of the worst nuclear accidents in history. However, Atomfall envisions a world that never properly recovered from that disastrous event. Violent factions have popped up all over England, irradiated monsters roam the wilds, and--of course--there might be a few government conspiracies at play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4455028-02_atomfall_preview_gp.mp4.00_17_24_12.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455028" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4455028-02_atomfall_preview_gp.mp4.00_17_24_12.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455028"></a><figcaption>Swinging the axe in Atomfall</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4455028-02_atomfall_preview_gp.mp4.00_17_24_12.still003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While this may sound like Fallout England, Atomfall's tone is quite different. The dark, sarcastic humor of the wasteland is <em>mostly</em> replaced with a more grounded take on the genre. Creative Director Ben Fisher really wanted to capture the look and feel of British speculative fiction and science-fiction from the 1950s and 1960s, like Doctor Who and John Wyndham novels. The result feels like a uniquely British take on the post-apocalyptic setting.</p><p dir="ltr">This grounded tone makes a lot of sense when paired with its gameplay. Unlike Fallout, Atomfall is not an RPG. You are as frail as most of your enemies, and if a particular encounter is giving you grief, you can't level up your character and come back later. Different weapons and gear could give you an edge in a firefight, but almost every shootout feels deadly. Fisher mentioned Stalker and Metro as inspirations for Atomfall, and while it isn't as dense or complicated as GSC Game World's first-person shooter, the similarities are easy to spot. Ammunition is hard to come by, items like bandages and health packs are invaluable, and it doesn't take much to put you in the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike Stalker, though, Atomfall has a bigger emphasis on melee combat. Given how scarce bullets are, most encounters can be settled with an axe, knife, bat, or one of the game's many close-quarters weapons. The melee combat isn't as robust as something like Avowed or Dying Light, but there is a bit of heft to the weapons, giving the melee combat a tactile feel. Plunging an axe into an enemy feels deadly and is accompanied by some crunchy sound effects.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Sniper Elite might seem like the polar opposite of Atomfall, it does retain Sniper Elite's open approach to exploration and combat. As Fisher puts it, "[In the Sniper Elite games] you've got a clear objective, and then you uncover ways to achieve that objective over time, and then you've got a sense of freedom in that space." For Atomfall, the team wanted to "take that template and make the entire game structure one giant Sniper Elite mission."</p><p dir="ltr">While it's hard to say if Atomfall will live up to this lofty ambition, the narrative structure could support something like this. It does have an overall objective, but how you achieve that goal seems relatively open-ended. The game will loosely guide you around one of its handful of semi-open-world maps, but it's up to you to put the mysteries of its world together, and it seems like there are multiple ways to uncover those mysteries, whether it's befriending a hostile faction or turning over every stone in an important dungeon. Unfortunately, I only got to see the first area in my play session, so I can't say how far-reaching or involved these narrative threads are, but if Rebellion pulls it off, it could make for an interesting approach to storytelling.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4455029-02_atomfall_preview_gp.mp4.00_10_28_12.still002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455029" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4455029-02_atomfall_preview_gp.mp4.00_10_28_12.still002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455029"></a><figcaption>Sneaking around with a bow in Atomfall</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4455029-02_atomfall_preview_gp.mp4.00_10_28_12.still002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's also hard to say if the combat will feel as open-ended as the Sniper Elite games. While you are given some agency when it comes to the weapons you use and approach you take for any given encounter, it doesn't quite have that sandbox feel that the Sniper Elite games are known for. This could change as you unlock more skills and find new weapons, but the more grounded approach to combat and the lack of climbing mechanics feels at odds with Sniper Elite's open approach to combat. This isn't necessarily a bad thing given Atomfall's tone and genre, but fans of Rebellion's recent games might not find as many toys in Atomfall's sandbox.</p><p dir="ltr">My biggest criticism I can level at Atomfall--at least based on the 90 minutes I played--is that the enemy AI is fairly easy to exploit. Quite early on I figured out that if I kicked a human enemy and then used a heavy attack with my trusty axe, it was an instant kill. Since most enemies just rush you down, I would wait at the end of a hallway and let them come to me. It gets a little more complicated when there are ranged combatants, but as long as I broke their line of sight, they couldn't do much. Part of what makes survival games so compelling are their cunning use of NPC AI, and based on what I played, Atomfall doesn't quite hit the watermark set by games like Stalker and The Last of Us. It's possible that tweaking the difficulty and playstyle settings could alleviate this issue, but I didn't have time to dig into those options during my limited playtime.</p><p dir="ltr">Atomfall seems like a big swing for Rebellion. While it borrows bits and pieces from its previous games, it feels like a genuine attempt for the team to step outside of its comfort zone and deliver something different. The narrative structure in particular has me eager to explore that world and piece together its narrative. I'm very curious to see how the narrative holds up as the scope of the world expands and more threads are introduced, but if done well, it could make for a memorable story.</p>

			<p>It appears that Respawn Entertainment has quietly canceled another game project. The news was shared via LinkedIn by former Executive Assistant and Production Coordinator&nbsp;Emilee Evans, who wrote (as <a href="https://thegamepost.com/titanfall-developer-respawn-canceled-fps-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by The Game Post):</p>
<p><em>The unannounced incubation project I was a part of for the past year was canceled this week, so I am joining the group of extremely talented and kind people in the games industry searching for a new role.</em></p>
<p>Evans did not specify what kind of project it was, but the studio had been <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/game-design-director-incubation-team-at-respawn-entertainment-3789765830/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring</a> people with 'significant professional experience designing Multiplayer FPS experiences' for the Incubation Team, hinting that it would have been a multiplayer first-person shooter game. That's certainly not surprising, considering that the studio built its fortune on that kind of game with Titanfall and later Apex Legends.</p>
<p>We'll probably never know for sure if it was another attempt to make a new Titanfall, though Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-game-reportedly-in-development-at-respawn-though-it-wont-be-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> last year that the studio was indeed developing another game in the franchise. This would be the second time (that we know of) a new franchise installment gets canceled, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-legends-single-player-gamer-canceled-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closure of the Titanfall Legends single player project</a> in early 2023.</p>
<p>About a year later, Respawn Entertainment's parent company, Electronic Arts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> another game in development at the studio, a multiplayer first-person shooter set in the world of Star Wars. Back then, EA CEO Andrew Wilson highlighted the need to move away from licensed IPs due to the licensing costs. That excuse is certainly not applicable to new Titanfall games, though.</p>
<p>Right now, the Los Angeles based studio is certainly <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> on the third and final entry in the Star Wars Jedi franchise. They should also still be publishing an upcoming XCOM-like Star Wars tactics strategy game with Bit Reactor. In June 2024, the developers <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/bitreactor-has-a-star-wars-tactical-strategy-game-in-the-works-15-xcom-veterans-on-its-team-and-an-ambitious-vision-for-the-future-of-the-genre/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked to PC Gamer</a> about the partnership:</p>
<p><em>Respawn really treats us like an internal team. They've been really good to us. They encourage collaboration and communication between teams. And so they've been just flat out the best experience I've ever had in publishing. They trust us to make the kind of game we know how to make.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-gets-two-more-game-boy-classics.1127997/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-picross-donkey-kong<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added two more Game Boy classics to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and if you're a fan of classic puzzlers or old-school retro delights, then these games are very much for you.</p>

<p>As with all of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-donkey-kong-land" rel="nofollow">other</a> Game Boy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch" rel="nofollow">games</a> available on the Switch Online <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-july" rel="nofollow">service</a> (although not Game Boy Advance games, importantly), these two new games can be enjoyed if you've got a basic Switch Online membership. You won't need the Expansion Pack addon to play them.</p>

<p>First to be added today is&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em>, also known as&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong '94&nbsp;</em>after the year in which it was released. It's essentially an adaptation of the original&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em>, albeit with many, many more levels and some additional gameplay quirks to contend with.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-march-2025-donkey-kong.jpg?itok=z4_NZHzQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-march-2025-donkey-kong.jpg?itok=vwgm3CTD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong '94&nbsp;</em>is one of two games being added to Nintendo Switch Online today.</figcaption></figure><p>The game blends gameplay elements from several different Nintendo titles; it's got the item pickup mechanic from&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros. 2&nbsp;</em>(that's the weird one, not&nbsp;<em>Lost Levels</em>), as well as the rope-climbing from&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Jr.&nbsp;</em>and, of course, the basic structure of the original&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em>.</p>

<p>Your second Game Boy offering in today's haul is&nbsp;<em>Mario's Picross</em>. If you're familiar with nonogram-style puzzles, then this one probably doesn't need much introduction.</p>

<p>If you're not, though, nonograms are essentially puzzles where you must systematically eliminate squares on a grid in order to uncover a picture. You'll need to observe the numbers along the sides of the grid carefully to determine which squares need to be filled in and which should be left alone.</p>

<p>As you might expect,&nbsp;<em>Mario's Picross&nbsp;</em>has plenty of&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>-themed images for you to uncover, so if you're looking for a fun way to while away an hour or two, you could do a lot worse.</p>




<p>Both&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong '94&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mario's Picross&nbsp;</em>are available to play right now on Nintendo Switch Online. You can sign up for a membership via your Switch console's eShop if you're not already subscribed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-danny-dyer-and-why-is-rockstar-posting-about-his-latest-movie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">GTA: Vice City’s Kent Paul is back… well, the actor behind him. </h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you follow Rockstar Games on X (the Everything App formerly known as Twitter), then you may have been surprised, confused, or a combination of the two when you saw the GTA studio posting about the film Marching Powder and its star, Danny Dyer. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1897764284651762165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Why on earth would Rockstar be posting about a small British film to its audience of 21 million followers? And who is this Danny Dyer guy? Don’t worry, we’re here to explain. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Who is Danny Dyer?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Danial John Dyer, better known as Danny Dyer, is an actor from East London. And if you live in the UK, he needs no introduction. As Rockstar’s post states, he’s an “absolute legend”. If you don’t speak British slang, then please refer to the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=legend" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Urban Dictionary’s definition of the term</a> to better understand Dyer’s reputation:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>“A person who embodies the pinnacle of all the important social aspects. Any person who is funny, reckless, original and sensitive in the right measures is likely to be nominated a legend by his associates. A person to whose persona you aspire.”</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dyer has been acting since 1993 and has built up a reputation for playing rough-and-ready working class characters. That’s in part due to his public persona; he’s considered somewhat outspoken on societal and government issues, and is known for his “tough uncle” approach to life. For example, in 2010 when offering advice to readers of Zoo magazine, Dyer told a man attempting to recover from a recent break-up that he should go “on a rampage [drinking session] with the boys."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dyer is also beloved for his many wild social media posts, such as this gem: </p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Roll on bonfire night..........it's gonna get strapped to a great big massive fuck off Rocket so it can join the other Furbys in the sky...</p>— Danny Dyer (@MrDDyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrDDyer/status/378183407521759232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 12, 2013</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2">How is Danny Dyer Connected to Rockstar?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve no idea who Danny Dyer is, but are a big fan of the Grand Theft Auto games, then you’ve almost certainly heard his voice. Dyer plays Kent Paul in GTA: Vice City, the manager of Scottish rock band, Love Fist. He reprised the role for GTA: San Andreas, in which Kent represented a new band, the Gurning Chimps, and later produced for rapper Madd Dogg. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dyer has a more important connection to Rockstar, though, and it comes from an unusual place. In 2004, Dyer starred in The Football Factory, a British film directed by Nick Love and produced by… Rockstar Games. Yes, once upon a time Rockstar helped create a feature film. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/07/the-football-factory-1741347914065.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Danny Dyer (right, wearing the tan jacket) starred in The Football Factory, which was produced by Rockstar Games. | Image credit: Vertigo Films</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Marching Powder, a new film releasing in the UK and Ireland this week, reunites Danny Dyer with Nick Love. The project, while not a sequel to The Football Factory, pulls on many of the same ideas, including football hooliganism (see: violence among fans), heavy drinking and drug use, and a uniquely British gritty sense of humour. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the post on X, Rockstar has nothing to do with Marching Powder. It seems the studio is simply championing the film because of its prior connection to Dyer and Love and their work on The Football Factory. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is Vice City's Kent Paul Returning for GTA 6?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Short answer: we’ve no idea. And this social media post certainly has nothing to do with GTA 6. But hey, we might as well theorise anyway. Could Kent Paul show up in Grand Theft Auto 6?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s important to remember that GTA is split up into two very different eras: the 3D era (games released on the PS2 and PSP) and the HD era (GTA 4 onwards). Both are considered their own universes – storylines from one do not continue into the other. That’s why GTA 5’s Los Santos looks entirely different to San Andreas’ equivalent city, and why there’s no direct mention of characters from the PS2-era games in GTA 4 and 5.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/07/kent-paul-gta-vc-1741348272844.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Tommy Vercetti tackles Kent Paul in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City | Image credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say there’s no overlap, though. CJ’s home cul-de-sac, Grove Street, appears in GTA 5, and many of the gangs that first featured in the 3D universe are present in the HD universe, including the Ballas. Lazlo, the infamous ponytailed scumbag, has also been in a number of GTA games spanning the two eras. And here’s the kicker: Kent Paul has his name on the Vinewood Walk of Fame.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So is there a chance that Kent Paul could return for GTA 6? It’s certainly possible. But a post on X about Marching Powder certainly doesn’t bring us any closer to confirmation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Since 2020, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/1900-6416758/" data-ref-id="1900-6416758">Destiny 2</a> has pit the three Guardian classes against each other in the Guardian Games to determine whether the Titans, the Warlocks, or the Hunters will reign supreme for a year. On March 11, the 2025 Guardian Games will begin with a few changes. Guardian Games Nightfalls and Focused Activities have been dropped from this year's event. In their place is a new boss rush mode called Rushdown, which looks like it will test even the most seasoned Destiny 2 players.</p><p>Bungie has shared <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid_03_06_2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the details for this year's Guardian Games</a>, including the way that Rushdown will work. Rushdown will assemble bosses from the campaigns, the seasonal story missions, and the exotic missions in battles that will get exponentially more difficult for players. Each run through Rushdown will feature five boss encounters, all of which must be completed before time expires. Time gets added to the clock with each boss that goes down, and teams that finish more quickly have a better chance of earning higher quality rewards.</p><p>Rushdown includes warm-up, standard, and expert modes, but only the last two will include combatants with modifiers while also letting players receive revive tokens. However, players will get a higher score if they use fewer revive tokens. All three modes will be open for standard matchmaking, class-based matchmaking, and private fireteam matches. Players will be judged by how many bosses they defeated and by their overall score.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4455148-destiny2guardiangamestraceriffle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455148" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4455148-destiny2guardiangamestraceriffle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455148"></a><figcaption>The new Arc Trace rifle from this year's Guardian Games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4455148-destiny2guardiangamestraceriffle.jpg"></figure><p>It just wouldn't be a Guardian Games without a new weapon. This year's addition to the armory is called Keraunios. It's a powerful new Arc trace rifle that features jolting impact, recycled energy, and rolling storm. Last year's addition, the Allstar Vector Skimmer, will be available again during this year's Guardian Games. Players will receive a temporary version of the weapon for the duration of the event. But if players want to permanently add it to their collection, they will need to complete a quest called Drop In.</p><p>Players who finish three encounters in any of the Rushdown modes will be guaranteed to receive a Guardians Games weapon during that run. The five scoring thresholds are bronze, silver, gold, platinum, and diamond. Naturally, players who reach the higher tiers in standard or expert will get better rewards. And players who achieve high scores in expert mode will also get the chance to pick up fully Masterworked Guardian Games weapons.</p><p>In order for players to help their preferred faction to win the overall Guardian Games, they have to team up with members of the same class and fight in PvP and other activities to earn medallions. Once the medallions are in hand, players need to bring them to the podium to count them among the total points for their class. There will be winning classes on every day of the event, but only one faction will be named the victor when the Guardian Games close after three weeks of competition. As usual this will be accompanied by an event card (including an Exotic emote and sparrow) and the ability to unlock The Champ as an in-game title.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4455168-d2armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455168" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4455168-d2armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455168"></a><figcaption>Guardian Games 2025 armor ornaments</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4455168-d2armor.jpg"></figure><p><span>A new set of armor ornaments will also be available and can be seen above.

            <p>While we are all here frothing at the mouth in anticipation for more Grand Theft Auto 6 news, developer Rockstar is casually sharing a trailer for a Danny Dyer-fronted film instead.</p>
<p>The film in question is Marching Powder, which has been <a href="https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/movies/danny-dyer-marching-powder-film-interview-stephanie-leonidas-162145794.html">described as a "Bridget Jones with the C-word"</a>. In Marching Powder, Dyer stars as Jack, an ageing, drug-taking football hooligan.</p>
<p>"From our friends Nick Love and Danny Dyer, the absolute legends behind The Football Factory..." Rockstar wrote on social media, with an accompanying trailer. "[Marching Powder] - a proper naughty comedy out tomorrow in the UK and Ireland." The studio then shared a link for tickets.</p>

<p>Now, in fairness to Rockstar, this isn't a totally random trailer for the company to share.  <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> actually produced sports drama film The Football Factory, which was released in 2004, so the team does have a connection to Nick Love and Danny Dyer's films.</p>
<p>But, even so, this post has caught the attention of Rockstar's gaming community, who are crying out for another GTA 6 trailer, not a footy film trailer.</p>
<p>"Okay. Y'all are definitely trolling now," reads one reply. "Doing anything except giving us content for the biggest game of all time," another adds. One social media user quipped that Rockstar had "dropped the wrong trailer" with its latest post.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is set to release this autumn - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">window publisher Take-Two Interactive remains confident of</a>. </p>
<p>
But, even though in the grand scheme of things we should be getting our hands on the next Grand Theft Auto game relatively soon, we still haven't actually seen or heard that much about it. In fact, we've only had one trailer, which was released over a year ago. Surely the developer is going to tell us something more soon... right?</p> <div>
