The studio is planning yet another quality-of-life update for the game with Patch 8.</p><p>“Arriving next year, this update will introduce some of the most eagerly awaited features to <em>BG3</em>: cross-play, and photo mode, along with 12 new subclasses,” <a rel="sponsored" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4461474037375172735">Larian wrote on its Steam Community page</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307746/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-cross-play-photo-mode">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTcxMzk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236649/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-live-evil-endings-mod-support">Baldur’s Gate 3 patch adds official in-game mod support</a></h2><div><p>The long-awaited <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199957/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-coming-soon">Patch 7 for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> is now live. The update adds new, gruesome cinematics for some of the game’s evil endings, new legendary actions for Honor Mode encounters, and official in-game mod support.</p><p>However, with Patch 7 comes a big ole asterisk from the game’s maker, Larian Studios. The patch is currently only available for PC, meaning that players will be unable to load cross-platform save files from PC on their console versions. PC / Mac multiplayer is also disabled. Larian says that it intends to launch Patch 7 on consoles and Mac sometime in October, so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23827343/baldurs-gate-3-reactivates-ps5-cross-saves">if you like to hop between desktop and console to play <em>BG3</em></a>, you’ll have to wait about a month. The compatibility issues can be avoided by simply declining to update the game on PC, but with all the other Patch 7 improvements, that might prove a difficult choice.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236649/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-live-evil-endings-mod-support">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjEyMDY=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199957/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-coming-soon">Larian Studios teases all the new features coming in the next Baldur’s Gate 3 patch</a></h2><div><p>In a new community update, Larian Studios <a rel="sponsored" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4240783699885624491">has shared a brief overview</a> of all the things it’s working on for the next <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> patch.</p><p>Larian has previously announced that patch 7, due out in September, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">will include the release of official mod support</a> and the introduction of a toolkit that will allow players the ability to create their own mods. According to Larian, the toolkit supports the creation of new items, classes and subclasses, races, and more.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199957/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-coming-soon">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjU4ODk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">Baldur’s Gate 3 mod support is coming in September</a></h2><div><p>It’s gonna get pretty funky in Faerûn with official mod support coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Larian Studios announced that official mod support will roll out in phases, starting today with a closed alpha, before a closed beta test in July, culminating with the official release of Patch 7 in September. According to Larian, the staggered testing phases will give the community ample time to test the new mod tools before making them available across PC and consoles.</p><p>If you have experience with official mod support in games like <em>Skyrim</em> or <em>Fallout</em>, Larian’s approach will sound similar. On PC, mods will be tested to ensure terms of service compatibility and overall stability before approval. Those mods will then undergo additional approvals before coming to console. While PC players will have access to the full suite of mod creation tools, and mods can still be made, downloaded, and played without using the official mod browser, console players will only be able to browse and install mods officially approved by Larian.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzIzMDU=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24108773/baldurs-gate-3-larian-dungeons-and-dragons">Baldur’s Gate 3 developer is moving on from Dungeons and Dragons</a></h2><div><p>With the sheer popularity surrounding <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the game is ripe for an expansion — but if it ever happens, it won’t be made by its developer Larian Studios. During a panel at the Game Developers Conference on Thursday, Larian founder Swen Vincke revealed that the studio plans on moving away from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>games, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-wont-make-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-expansions-or-baldurs-gate-4">as first reported by <em>IGN</em></a>.</p><p>“We’re not going to make new expansions, which everybody is expecting us to do.

I’m reminded of this by the utterly bizarre reaction to the most recent <em>Superman</em> TV spot, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1883606788249206932&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1883606788249206932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared by James Gunn</a></span> and responded to by those who purport to be the movie’s future audience as if he’s committed a war crime. Stop it! Everyone just stop it! You’re liking things all wrong, and it’s ruining it for everyone.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>So, by “fans” I mean the word very literally, “fanatics.” I don’t mean those who engage with media by playing, watching, or reading with a desire to find enjoyment: I mean those who believe they are in a relationship with the work, that there’s some sort of two-way communication going on. These inverted parasocial relationships, where the audience believes itself in authority over the subject, are having a grim effect on culture. We’ve reached a position where a director is immediately defending himself against an onslaught of wildly inaccurate and frankly concerning criticism from those who believe themselves in charge of how an unreleased film is supposed to be. And, as a consequence, those with the money are starting to believe this madding crowd needs to be heard.</p><p>On January 26, James Gunn—the director of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> movies, and the person now in charge of DC’s cinematic universe—shared via X a new teaser for his forthcoming <em>Superman</em>.</p><p>I am a Superman skeptic. Not a <em>Superman</em> skeptic, because I’ve yet to see the movie that hasn’t been released, so have no rational basis on which to form an opinion. But boy do I have Superman opinions. I dislike how people making films or TV shows never seem to know how to cope with this specific character, seeing his innate, all-powerful nature as an issue that needs to be removed. That’s a fascinating problem to solve! You have this essentially immortal god, a being of absolute power to tell stories about, but no one seems to know how to portray him without instantly resorting to reducing him to mortality, whether by weakening him or opposing him with an equally powerful enemy. I have a “Time to Kryptonite” meter on which all Superman fiction is judged, and almost all of it fails miserably. (I know nothing about comics, including <em>Superman </em>comics, and expect this has all been far more interestingly investigated there.)</p><p>I must make an aside for the recently concluded <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, that repeatedly failed on Time to Kryptonite in every one of its arcs, but actually handled the challenge better than everything else. It showed Superman’s genuine, consequential vulnerabilities: his love for his family, his grief for his parents, his terror at his wife’s cancer, his panic at his son’s crippling anxiety disorder. All of this made an immortal figure meaningful, albeit constantly undermined by yet another weaker enemy using various colors of Kryptonite to punch him in the face.</p><p>I worry James Gunn’s movie could do the same but less effectively, taking this fascinating dilemma and rendering it moot by saying some green rocks make it go away. That would be disappointing. However, I’m not organizing a campaign to demand he not do this, nor declaring the film will be obsolete should he do so. I’m not under any delusion that I’m in any form of dialogue with this piece of art: I will be its supplicant viewer.</p><figure id="" data-id="d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-recommend-id="image://d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1791" data-height="1008" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A fire-breathing lizard beast in the streets of Metropolis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A fire-breathing lizard beast in the streets of Metropolis." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-recommend-id="image://d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1791" data-height="1008" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A fire-breathing lizard beast in the streets of Metropolis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Not so for those who responded to Gunn’s short clip. The 30 seconds of context-less images includes three seconds of Superman flying through some ice, presumably near his Fortress of Solitude. I watched it and thought this: “There’s Superman, flying past some ice. Ooh, he rolled over.” I had no further thoughts about that moment, more interested in other aspects like the role of the yellow flag and the potential silliness of a Godzilla-like creature rampaging through Metropolis.</p><p>But this, I have since learned, is not how the film’s “fans” responded. They are <em>furious</em> about those three seconds of flying. Livid. Their reaction has become “viral.” It has offended vast numbers of people who believe themselves the movie’s core audience, and they’re explaining to Gunn in their thousands about how he’s misused CGI, the ways in which he’s messed up some face-replacement technology, and how actor David Corenswet’s eye is millimeters out of line and thus the film is a disaster. (I wish any of this was an exaggeration.)</p><p>This reached such a pitch that Gunn felt the need to respond (nooooo!) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/DFVZvy0A1sd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/DFVZvy0A1sd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Threads</a></span>, calmly stating that the entire furor over his CG-based crime exists only in the imaginations of the angry mob.</p><p>“There is absolutely zero CG in his face,” Gunn explains. “People’s faces can look different when you put a wide angle lens up close. The background plate in Svalbard is 100% real as is David.”</p><p>So yeah, the criticisms were conspiracies, entire mobs built around this unforgiveable faux pas that hadn’t taken place. They needed to find <em>something</em> wrong, something that couldn’t pass their perfection test, grabbed hold of this (despite the damned Godzilla), and were utterly wrong. It was only ever a cool, practical flying effect, like it looked.</p><p>The endless criticisms about Corenswet’s eyes gets to me more than anything else. Firstly, it’s something people spotted by pausing a three second clip on a monitor in front of their face, forgetting that this is a movie intended to be watched in a theater and no rational person would even study the exact positions of his eyeballs in those circumstances. It’s a fuss about <em>nothing</em>. And what if those are just his eyes?! For God’s sake, the actor who plays Lois in <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, Elizabeth Tulloch, has strabismus, meaning her eyes point in slightly different directions at all times. It’s a normal thing. God,  you awful people.</p><figure id="" data-id="0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-recommend-id="image://0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1700" data-height="956" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman, bruised and cut, lying in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Superman, bruised and cut, lying in the snow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-recommend-id="image://0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1700" data-height="956" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman, bruised and cut, lying in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I can’t tell you the number of podcasts and YouTube channels I’ve given up on, because the creators spend their entire time worrying about, or directly responding to, the loudest voices in their audience. I struggle to think of any I’ve stuck with that aren’t plagued by this issue. A constant, spoken concern about the portion of their audience who doesn’t like, or doesn’t accept, or doesn’t tolerate, some small aspect of what they do. It’s mostly delivered jokingly, “Ooh, don’t say that, you know what our DMs will be like!” but it’s never with any humor. It’s fear. A show’s fans can cause its creators fear.</p><p>And the mistake is the two-way engagement. Before the internet, the movies, TV shows, books, games, plays, whatever, were the authority. They defiantly existed, and the audience either liked them or disliked them in futile near-privacy. Their means of affecting their existence lay purely in choosing whether to continue being the audience. If they didn’t like the show, they didn’t tune in. If they hated the book, they didn’t buy the next one. They could tell their friends to join or not join the audience, and that was effective, but based on their own real-life relationships. Sure, critics had some influence too, but this again was a one-way communication with an audience that mutely chose whether to engage.</p><p>And movies and TV shows and games weren’t worse for it back then! It turns out, they didn’t need to be told what to do by an audience that hadn’t yet watched or read or played them in order to create excellent art. Based on the thousands of years of evidence, it’s perhaps reasonable to conclude it’s not a vital part of the creative process. Yet, today, a piece of media’s purported audience sees itself as so utterly crucial that without its constant input, only terrible things can result.</p><p>“Thank goodness we were there to tell James Gunn not to use bad CG on Superman’s face in that one flying scene!” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXuDCDE7vmg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXuDCDE7vmg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they tell themselves</a></span>, likely never bothering to listen to the response that there was no CG, good or bad. Almost definitely not replying to say, “Oh, I’m sorry, I was completely wrong.” (I checked. They didn’t.)</p><p>Instead, when their fury is contradicted by regular people saying, “Ooh, I enjoyed that teaser! Can’t wait to see the movie!” their reaction is to create even more elaborate, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa79mQ9tpKs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa79mQ9tpKs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deranged theories</a></span> that explain these normal people as evil agents.</p><figure id="" data-id="414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-recommend-id="image://414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1750" data-height="984" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman protects a small child from an explosion of cannisters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Superman protects a small child from an explosion of cannisters." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-recommend-id="image://414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1750" data-height="984" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman protects a small child from an explosion of cannisters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But this obviously isn’t unique to this incident. It’s everything, all of the time, this irrationally entitled belief that the media you consume owes you something. That you are the authority now, that the subject must bend to your whim, and deviance from this is terrible customer service that must be punished. It’s horrible.</p><p>Everyone’s liking everything wrong, and it’s spoiling it! For god’s sake, all creators, you have to stop responding to these voices, too. They aren’t your audience, and when you listen to them, you misrepresent the vast majority of people who are waiting to enjoy your output. Whether it’s a podcast constantly falling over itself to avoid an email, or a movie studio panicking because some loud group of dumbasses made a bunch of YouTube videos, just ignore them. They will never be satisfied, it will never be good enough, and their motivations are suspect and unspecific. </p><p>If only our artists would re-establish and reinforce the one-way relationship, reclaim the authority. And then once something exists, listen to curated, informed voices whose goal is to see something be the best it can be, not to tear it down to bathe in its entrails.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new extremely handy Steam Deck mod is now available for download, allowing users to use AMD FSR 3 Frame Generations in games that support NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation for significantly improved performance.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/Decky-Framegen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decky Framegen Plugin</a> is a Steam Deck plugin that replaces the NVIDIA DLSS DLL with the FSR 3.1 DLL, allowing users to use Frame Generation in Steam Deck in games that do not natively support AMD's tech, such as Black Myth Wukong, Final Fantasy XVI, Hogwarts Legacy and The Witcher 3, as showcased in a very informative video put together by Deck Wizard which also provides detailed installation instructions. While the end results aren't always perfect, as there are some visual issues such as ghosting in Final Fantasy XVI, for example, the mod definitely helps make more games playable with acceptable performance on Steam Deck, although games running below 30 FPS won't benefit too much from it due to the input lag caused by the low base framerate.</p>

<p>Since its release back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022</a>, the Steam Deck has become an incredibly popular gaming system, essentially bringing forth the age of handheld PCs that doesn't seem will end anytime soon. Following the launch of the original model, Valve released a slightly upgraded model featuring a gorgeous <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-steam-deck-oled-limited-edition-679-usd-an-all-white-exterior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OLED screen</a> and a few other improvements, but the company doesn't seem interested in doing <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-wont-be-doing-yearly-steam-deck-releases/">yearly releases</a>, despite the demand. Earlier this month, it was rumored that a new version of the system powered by the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-amd-ryzen-2-not-works/">AMD Ryzen Z2 APU</a> was in the works, but Valve quickly squashed the rumors, so it will definitely be a while until we will be able to get a proper Steam Deck 2 in our hands.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-2-story-dlc-delayed-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has delayed the upcoming&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>story DLC out of the game's sixth year, but it looks like the third season will remain on the cards for February.</p>

<p>In an X <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884255116636705006" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Ubisoft says that it wants to "deliver the best possible experience" for&nbsp;<em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC, and so it "will not ship during Year 6". That likely means it won't be released until at least summer this year, although it could be even longer.</p>

<p>The DLC was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-heartland-division-2-resurgence-news" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2023</a>&nbsp;and was initially intended to be part of the game's fifth year of content, adding new zones, main missions, and "a whole new endgame structure" towards the end of 2024.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-division-2-story-dlc-delayed-beyond-2025-map.jpg?itok=UDvPwOZ5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-division-2-story-dlc-delayed-beyond-2025-map.jpg?itok=TnDQ-HoP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC has been delayed again.</figcaption></figure><p>However, in December 2023, the game's story DLC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-2-story-dlc-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-launches-project-resolve-to-improve" rel="nofollow">was delayed</a>&nbsp;beyond 2024, making this the second time the DLC has been pushed back. Perhaps appropriately, that first delay was revealed alongside "Project Resolve", an initiative that aimed to improve&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>across the board.</p>

<p>Ubisoft hasn't revealed a new release date for&nbsp;<em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC. Honestly, at this stage, I don't think I'd be surprised if the expansion was canned altogether, although perhaps the game still enjoys a sizable enough player base for these delays not to spell the end.</p>

<p>The pushback of this DLC comes after what has been a pretty horrendous year for Ubisoft. The studio has endured multiple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">high-profile failures</a>, including&nbsp;pirate game&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones</em>, open-world adventure&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and first-person shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow"><em>XDefiant</em></a>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Ubisoft has&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> its upcoming flagship RPG&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">twice</a>, faced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">investor unrest</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy" rel="nofollow">legal action</a>, and closed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">three of its studios</a>, with several more undergoing downsizing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-star-wars-outlaws.jpg?itok=CanXzuiy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-star-wars-outlaws.jpg?itok=xuTsrXLK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It hasn't exactly been a great year for Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC&nbsp;may not exactly be the flagship release Ubisoft has been banking on to turn its fortunes around, but this delay won't exactly come as a balm to shareholders who are already concerned the company has no clue what it's doing.</p>

<p>At any rate, if you'd like to catch up on&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>before the DLC launches (a pursuit for which it seems you'll have plenty of time), you can grab it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2221490/Tom_Clancys_The_Division_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-2/9nc944t50735" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, as well as on current-gen consoles through backwards compatibility.</p>

                <p>The modding community can give older games a much-needed overhaul, or add an extra challenge to maybe an oversimplistic one. In recent years, we've seen everything from Resident Evil demakes to GTA upgrades--not to mention the vast landscape of Baldur's Gate 3 mods--but a new mod for 1991's Sonic the Hedgehog adjusts the game's visuals in real-time, going back and forth depending on the player's blast processing in the game.</p><p>Brandon Sheffield of Necrosoft Games showed how the mod worked on his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3lgr543otmc2n" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> account and did a quick demo.</p><p>"Vladikcomper on the SGDK Discord has created an amazing and ridiculous mod for Sonic the Hedgehog (MD) in which quality degrades to different resolutions/numbers of colors unless you fill your blast processing meter up," he said, as the game switched from widescreen to smaller size as the gameplay went on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434400-sonicdegrade2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434400" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434400-sonicdegrade2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434400"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434400-sonicdegrade2.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434392-sonicdegrade2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434393-sonicdegrade3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434394-sonicdegrade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434392,1300-4434393,1300-4434394" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4434392-sonicdegrade2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4434393-sonicdegrade3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4434394-sonicdegrade.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434392-sonicdegrade2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434393-sonicdegrade3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434394-sonicdegrade.jpg"></figure><p>"Blast Processing" was the marketing term used by Sega of America to describe the processing capabilities of the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive that didn't really have any technological explanation, but sounded cool.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios' chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt is to take an extended "sabbatical" from work, and when he returns, he'll be working on a new Arrowhead game.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1884015181895983223" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Pilestedt says that while fans have been enjoying&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>for almost a year, he's been "living it since early 2016", and if the first <i>Helldivers&nbsp;</i>is included, "since 2013".</p>

<p>He says that eleven years of working on the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>games have caused him to neglect his family, his friends, his wife, and himself, and so he wants to take some time to "redeem what was lost from all of those that supported [him] for over a decade".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical-omens-of-tyranny.jpg?itok=d_Ad7Gc7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical-omens-of-tyranny.jpg?itok=IjcaBny3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s creative lead Johan Pilestedt is taking some time out from work.</figcaption></figure><p>Expressing faith in his Arrowhead colleagues to continue doing "their utmost" to deliver "amazing stuff" for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>while he's off, Pilestedt says that on his return, he will "start working on the next Arrowhead game".</p>

<p>Whether that means he won't be involved in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>anymore going forward isn't clear, but at the very least, it seems his focus will be elsewhere for a while, so major showstopping creative updates for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>may be few and far between in future.</p>

<p>Well-wishers flocked to X to express their hope that Pilestedt enjoyed his break, with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation" rel="nofollow">recent PlayStation leaver</a> Shuhei Yoshida and Kinda Funny's Greg Miller sending their best wishes to Pilestedt.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Pilestedt, he served as the CEO and chief creative officer of Arrowhead Game Studios between 2009 and last year before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo" rel="nofollow">stepping down and appointing a new CEO</a> in order to focus on his creative work.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/24350444/mythic-quest-season-4-review-apple-tv-plus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Mythic Quest</em>’s ability to spin some of the gaming industry’s ugliest aspects into genuinely funny comedy was what made it such <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128489/mythic-quest-ravens-banquet-review-apple-tv">a surprising delight when it first hit Apple TV Plus back in 2020</a>. Even when it was joking about chaotic streamers or Nazi server takeovers, you could feel the respect <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s creative team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21177373/ashly-burch-interview-mythic-quest">has for video games as an art form</a>. And by keeping its focus on the lives of people who actually dream up and build games, the series put itself in a position to tell poignant stories about the costs that come with chasing one’s dreams.</p><p><em>Mythic Quest</em>’s new fourth season still gets in its fair share of solid digs at gaming culture. But the show feels like even more of a character-driven narrative that’s trying to show you how every member of the MQ crew is evolving as they move deeper into their careers. <em>Mythic Quest </em>has always had a knack for switching up its relationships and power dynamics just enough to keep its office drama element feeling fresh yet familiar. This time around, though, the shuffling is all in service of giving everyone at Mythic Quest HQ a new (but not necessarily healthier) work-life balance.</p><p>While an unhealthy amount of dysfunction has always been part of Ian Grimm’s (Rob McElhenney) creative process, <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s fourth season finds him trying to be a better colleague and friend to all of the people who have helped bring his ideas to life. It’s still a little hard for Ian to remember that Poppy Li’s (Charlotte Nicdao) return to Mythic Quest Studios with him hinged on his respecting her personal boundaries and acknowledging her as an equal in their professional relationship. Ian also can’t stand how much time Poppy wants to spend with her new artist boyfriend Storm (Chase Yi). But everyone working on Mythic Quest (the fictional game) can feel how, after years of blowing up at one another, Poppy and Ian are in a new headspace where they can genuinely appreciate how they make each other stronger. </p><p>With Mythic Quest gearing up to launch a new Playpen update giving players the ability to create their own in-game content, executive producer David Hornsby (David Brittlesbee) and monetization head Rachel Meyee (Ashly Burch) are all too happy to have Ian and Poppy onboard cooking up ideas to make the feature shine. As the creator of <em>Cozy Galaxy</em>, the most popular game on the Playpen platform, former-tester-turned-developer Dana Bryant (Imani Hakim) can’t help feeling ticked at the way she’s being cut out of all the revenue Mythic Quest is raking in. But to money shark Brad Bakshi (Danny Pudi) and cutthroat assistant Jo (Jessie Ennis), Dana’s feelings about working at Mythic Quest Studios are a sign that it’s time for them to reconsider whose team they want to play for.</p><p>Like previous seasons, <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s new episodes use the fictional in-show game to dunk on uglier aspects of the real-world gaming industry with a specificity that makes it feel like the writers room has been keeping up with the news. Playpen’s popularity is a financial boon to the Mythic Quest team because of how it presents an opportunity to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346862/genshin-impact-developer-20-million-fine-ftc-data-lootboxes">roll out more in-game currencies</a>. It also raises serious questions about whether platforms like Playpen are built with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121420/roblox-child-exploitation-robux-child-labor">the intention of capitalizing on child labor</a>.</p><p>Those questions become even thornier as players start coming up with ways to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-thinks-mods-breathe-l%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dus-request-to-please-not-give-cait-sith-a-dump-truck-ass">bring sex into their Playpen creations</a>. But even though this season of <em>Mythic Quest </em>gets its dunks in on the larger gaming industry, the show spends more time focusing on the growing pains that come when interpersonal relationships start to change for the better.</p><p>You can see it most clearly in Ian and Poppy’s arc this season as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339070/mythic-quest-season-4-trailer">the two turn to AI assistants</a> to help work through their complicated feelings about one another, but it’s also highlighted in some of the season’s episodes — one of which is an excellent <em>Clue </em>riff — that take you outside of the Mythic Quest office. We see more of what David gets up to in his free time and how the evolution of Dana and Rachel’s careers has brought new tensions into their romance. And with so many of his colleagues (who are really his only friends) pairing off, this season underscores how Ian’s prickliness with other people stems from the fact that he doesn’t have anyone to come home to.</p><p>Though digging deeper into everyone’s personal lives and easing up on the workplace shenanigans doesn’t quite move <em>Mythic Quest </em>into straight dramatic territory, it does make this season feel like you’re meant to appreciate how far these characters (and a few other surprise cameos) have come since we first met them. This season’s video game jokes aren’t <em>quite </em>as scathing as some viewers might like, but they reinforce how Mythic Quest (the game) has become something much more than another fantasy MMORPG for both its players and creators — just as Apple seems intent on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296445/mythic-quest-season-4-premiere-date-side-quest">growing the show in similar ways</a>.</p><p><em>Mythic Quest </em>also stars Naomi Ekperigin, Andrew Friedman, and Michael Naughton. Season 4 hits Apple TV Plus on January 29th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-stone-of-madness-review.1093743/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-stone-of-madness-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The stony halls and ancient walls of an old monastery are fertile ground for all kinds of horror and intrigue. The Stone of Madness is certainly filled with both, painting an eye-catching portrait of secrets and skullduggery as you sneak around, searching for an escape. As the days and nights drag on, though, the cracks in its facade show, and the initially intriguing tactical stealth falls prey to too many technical issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stone of Madness comes from developers Teku Studios and The Game Kitchen, the latter of which is best known for Blasphemous, a series of action games similarly laden with religious imagery. There are still overt religious themes and visuals here, but instead of striking down giant bosses, The Stone of Madness is all about quietly finding a way out of the 18th-century Spanish monastery that acts as your jail.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Stone of Madness Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Five prisoners make up the core of your party, hoping to escape after a brutal encounter that binds them all together. The halls are patrolled by guards, priests, nuns, and soldiers, but the motley crew of would-be escapees have plenty of ways to get around them. It's a really compelling mood to set, heightened by the interesting characters that make up this team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The holy man Alfredo, for instance, can put on priest's robes and blend in with the clergy. Old lady Agnes has witchcraft up her sleeves, casting curses on unsuspecting guards. Eduardo, the silent giant, moves boxes and breaks down walls, while the tiny Amelia can sneak through tunnels, lay down mousetraps, and pick pockets. Leonora was my go-to for most days; she can climb walls, pick locks, and drop ropes, opening up new routes for characters in the process. She can also knockout guards or even kill them, though she will harm herself out of remorse in the process.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gaining mastery over the monastery feels incredibly rewarding.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Days in The Stone of Madness alternate between daytime excursions and night-time planning. Stealing resources, uncovering clues, and completing objectives all take place in real-time during the day as you explore different areas of the monastery. At night, you can use your time and crew's skills to recuperate and scheme. Time also passes during the day, with patrol routes changing and malevolent spirits emerging as afternoon turns to evening and on to nighttime. Staying out late can mean new, rewarding opportunities, but also more dangers, which makes for some exciting thrills as you try to push your luck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your characters have health, suspicion ratings, and sanity to manage, so keeping them healthy and stocked with tools for their particular skill sets is crucial. Managing the tasks you need to complete each day against your deteriorating well-being and limited night-time activities makes it feel like every victory is won against the ticking clocks of doom and entropy. Overcoming those odds, gaining mastery over the resources available, and thriving inside the walls of the monastery feels incredibly rewarding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Flipping between these characters can feel a bit cumbersome while playing with a controller, but tinkering around with different combinations of abilities and options is enjoyable. Having Amelia mock an enemy and lead them into a quiet room where Leonora can knock them out, for example, captures the feeling of helming the crew of a well-planned heist. Each excursion from the team's shared cell only lets you pick three members, so you're pushed to constantly think ahead, considering who can collaborate to open the pathways or accomplish the tasks for each day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters also have their drawbacks, too. Each of the five prisoners has their own fears to cope with or cleverly work around, and forcing them into certain situations will drain their sanity. Eduardo fears the dark, for instance, while Leonora cannot bear the sight of a blazing pyre. Amelia's fear of the gargoyle statues looming throughout the halls is a constant concern when you're trying to navigate new areas or evade capture. Finding ways to avoid these problems, like lighting up darkened rooms or shooting down gargoyles with a pistol, adds more satisfying wrinkles to iron out on the way to your objective.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I ran into a ton of different control issues, bugs, and glitches.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Lose enough sanity, and a character will develop a new affliction, like claustrophobia. It's an interesting system, and I actually found it to add some compelling friction. These conditions would force me to be mindful of where I left characters standing or how I moved them through a space. If I need Eduardo to drag a big box around, I better make sure the area is well-lit, which then isn't great for sneaking around. That combination of team skills and dangers smartly encourages a lot of risky decision-making. Who can work well in this area, and what skills do you need on-hand? And who can salvage the operation when it all falls apart?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frustratingly, things can fall apart, and not always because of your own mistakes. Across the roughly 25 hours it took me to finish The Stone of Madness’ two separate campaigns, I ran into a ton of different issues, bugs, and glitches. A guard got stuck on a random piece of geometry; a character disappeared out-of-bounds while moving through a tunnel; a cutscene would pop Alfredo out of his priest robes in the middle of a populated area; and in one case, opening a chest with Eduardo caused him to "zip" through the ceiling and onto the roof… in front of a waiting patrolman.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These frequent issues are tedious enough in isolation, but in a tactical stealth game where health and resources are at a premium, it can mean a full reset of the current day (upwards of 10 minutes at a time) and any progress lost. I even started avoiding certain areas or routes because I knew I could potentially run into a day-ending issue there, stamping out plans I had laid in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Repeating these encounters also makes the control issues stand out even worse. Getting a character to lock onto the right target, interact with the right object, or even sometimes maneuver around certain obstacles always feels too finicky and unresponsive. Little annoyances compound, and it's certainly frustrating when, say, a ghost is chasing you down and you can't exorcise it because your character keeps locking onto something else nearby. The isometric camera angle doesn't always help here either, and navigating certain areas took some trial-and-error to understand just where certain hiding spots and shaded corners even were. Tack on some weird graphical issues, like characters popping up through the environment or objective markers appearing in the way of prompts, and it can all wear on you pretty fast.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The graphical issues are a shame when the art is so fantastic overall.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s particularly a shame because the art and animations are simply fantastic overall, with absolutely gorgeous models and areas on display across each campaign. Running along the tall ramparts of the monastery for the first time looked amazing. An 18th-century monastery is already a great setting choice, and The Game Kitchen uses the subject material well to create a memorable art style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each task within the monastery is a bread-crumb trail leading the five prisoners closer to freedom, while also sending them teetering down into the darker secrets hidden within its walls. The Stone of Madness is a dark story, all about the corruption and rampant abuse within a supposed asylum. Through its two campaigns, the prisoners uncover many hidden horrors, with plenty of wrinkles to force stubborn players to change up their approaches; certain areas might be difficult for your preferred characters to navigate until you've unlocked alternate pathways, for example.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Opening these areas up and mastering them over the course of a campaign is the greatest sense of achievement The Stone of Madness has to offer. Daily objectives help guide you along, but each new zone is really a puzzle to solve on its own. Distracting a guard with one of Alfredo's sermons can let Eduardo lay down a plank, creating a bridge for Leonora to cross so she can lockpick a chest and uncover new treasure. These moments of carefully coordinated sneaking, puzzle solving, and thieving are when The Stone of Madness stands out the most.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Eric's Supreme Sneaking Missions</h3><p>Some of the best stealth games you can find... if you can find them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual stories told throughout both campaigns serve their purposes well enough. Several well-animated cutscenes make the high points resonate, but it’s mostly told through text-only dialogue windows otherwise. The named characters are certainly memorable, like Tía del Nido, the egg-collecting elderly woman who gathers gossip, or the merchant Panecillo, who wears a loaf of bread for a hat. I wish some objectives were a little more overt about where to go next, but the intrigue compelled me enough to keep checking and rechecking old haunts to track it all down, and the tips and hints are extremely generous if you want them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though there are two branching campaigns, each with their own areas to explore and stories to tell, they play out pretty similarly in terms of what you’re actually doing. Additional characters to meet, stories to uncover, and areas to sneak around can add quite a bit to the total runtime, but the twin campaigns mostly offer two distinct flavors of the same idea. Still, I enjoyed the new challenges a second route offered, especially since each campaign's final objective is a tense, thrilling challenge that lets every character shine in their own way.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The first demo of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unforgiving-fantasy-extraction-shooter-dark-and-darker-has-its-steam-next-fest-playtest-extended/1100-6511474/" data-ref-id="1100-6511474">Dark and Darker</a> debuted almost two years ago, just a few months before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-and-darker-is-getting-a-mobile-version-from-the-creators-of-pubg-mobile/1100-6517182/" data-ref-id="1100-6517182">the mobile version of the game was announced</a>. Now, Dark and Darker Mobile's North American soft launch is just a few days away, and the global launch is expected to arrive in the first half of this year.</p><p>PUBG Mobile publisher Krafton and Bluehole Studio have revealed that Dark and Darker Mobile will be available for American and Canadian players on February 4. The soft launch was originally going to be only for Canada before the decision was made to expand the early access.</p><p>"We are thrilled to expand our soft launch beyond Canada and bring Dark and Darker Mobile to even more players across North America," said Bluehole Studio's Joonseok Ahn in a statement. "The strong enthusiasm from the community encouraged us to accelerate our plans, and we look forward to gathering more feedback as we prepare for the global release."</p><p>Like the original Dark and Darker, the mobile incarnation of the game thrusts players into a fantasy-inspired dungeon-crawler where they must contend with monsters and creatures while searching for loot and treasures. Players also compete against each other inside of the dungeons, with the victor taking the spoils. It's a high-risk/high-reward scenario that can leave one side bereft of everything that they had before entering a dungeon.</p><p>Although Krafton and Bluehole Studio haven't set a date for Dark and Darker Mobile's global rollout, pre-registration is currently taking place <a href="https://dndm.krafton.com/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on the game's official site</a>. Krafton has already laid out some of the other features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-dark-and-darker-mobile-will-differ-from-the-original/1100-6522381/" data-ref-id="1100-6522381">that distinguish the mobile version from its PC counterpart</a>. For example, players can recruit AI sidekicks to accompany them into either PvE or PvP dungeons. Players can also equip several buffs to increase the odds of their characters' survival.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">First a hello, then sent to hell. That's the scenario the actor behind Grand Theft Auto V's Trevor would like to see for the character in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. While Steve Ogg hasn't reportedly done any work on the next entry in the franchise, he'd love to see Trevor "pass the torch" to new leads in a way that sees his brains turning into pink goo.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-6-trevor-steven-ogg-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ScreenRant</a>, Ogg explained that his wish for GTA VI is "if Trevor appeared in it just to be killed at the beginning." This would be a full-circle moment for Trevor if Rockstar followed along with Ogg's suggestion. That's because Trevor kills GTA IV: The Lost and the Damned protagonist Johnny Klebitz in GTA V. "Pass the torch, stomp Trevor's head in, and sort of put an end to that and allow a new generation to take over," Ogg said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="800878387" data-promo-id="0"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wwe-2k25-release-date-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K has announced the&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>release date, as well as who'll be on the wrestling sim's cover and what kind of new gameplay improvements you can expect.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>will officially release across PC and consoles (including last-gen machines, intriguingly enough) on March 14th, and if you pick up one of the game's two special editions, you can play it a week early.</p>

<p>The cover star is none other than "Original Tribal Chief" Roman Reigns. After&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K24</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wwe-2k24-announced" rel="nofollow">WrestleMania Showcase focus</a>, the new game's Showcase mode will instead revolve around Reigns and the extended Anoa'i wrestling family, which also includes The Rock, Rikishi, and Jacob Fatu, among others.</p>

<p><em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>will also introduce The Island, a hub featuring "a series of areas built around different WWE themes" in which you'll try to impress Reigns by completing a number of different challenges and tasks.</p>

<p>2K is boasting that&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>will feature the largest roster of any&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K&nbsp;</em>game to date; it'll feature over 300 wrestlers spanning multiple generations of WWE history, including the likes of Rey Mysterio, Chyna, and Bret "Hitman" Hart, plus more.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also look forward to lots of new match types in&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25</em>, including intergender wrestling for the first time in the series' history, as well as new Underground Matches, the return of Chain Wrestling, and Bloodline Rules Matches.</p>




<p>Three different versions of the game will be available: <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/buy/?release=wwe-2k25-standard-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Standard</a>, <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/buy/?release=wwe-2k25-deadman-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadman</a>, and <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/buy/?release=wwe-2k25-the-bloodline-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloodline</a>.</p>

<p>The Standard version launches on March 14th, and it'll also get you cross-gen access, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. Meanwhile, Deadman and Bloodline both pack in extra goodies and launch a week early.</p>

<p><em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>comes out on March 14th (or March 7th, depending on your edition) on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878960/WWE_2K25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP1001-PPSA22696_00-WWE2K25000000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/wwe-2k25-standard-edition/9P6NQMP5LXD6/0017" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

When I'm back I will start working on the next Arrowhead game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pilestedt was thrust into the headlines following Helldivers 2’s explosive launch in February 2024. Despite a raft of issues the cooperative shooter became PlayStation Studios’ fastest-selling game of all time, shifting 12 million copies in just 12 weeks. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-helldivers-2-film-in-production">Helldivers 2 is so successful that Sony is turning it into a movie</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pilestedt himself became the face of Helldivers 2, often wading into discussion about the game’s qualities and failings across social media, Reddit threads, and Discord. In May last year, Pilestedt revealed that Helldivers 2’s enormous success had caused a problem for the studio: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-its-seen-a-horrifying-amount-of-threats-and-rude-behavior-from-some-in-the-community">more community toxicity than it had ever had to deal with before</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to the release of Helldivers 2, Arrowhead had enjoyed big hits with the first Helldivers game and Magicka, but the success of Helldivers 2 raised the game and the studio’s profile. "The big difference now, which is horrifying, is the amount of threats and rude behavior that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community," Pilestedt told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">G.biz</a>. "That’s something new we have to deal with."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Helldivers 2 launched it faced significant server issues that made the game unplayable for many, sparking an initial backlash. Since then, Arrowhead has faced complaints about everything from weapon balance to low impact Premium Warbonds. But by far the biggest backlash was sparked by Sony’s controversial decision to force PC gamers to link to a PlayStation Network account to play. Sony eventually reversed its decision, but not before a review-bombing campaign savaged Helldivers 2 on Steam. Arrowhead community managers have said the PSN backlash caused staff to lose a week simply having to deal with the fallout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid Helldivers 2’s success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs">Pilestedt changed his position from Arrowhead CEO to chief creative officer</a> so he could focus more on the studio’s games as well as its community. Replacing Pilestedt as Arrowhead CEO was Shams Jorjani, former executive at fellow Swedish games company Paradox and publisher of Magicka.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no word on Helldivers 2’s next game, but it seems likely we won’t see it for some time. Meanwhile, Arrowhead continues to update Helldivers 2, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024">the recent addition of third enemy faction the Illuminate breathing new life into the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Kentucky Route Zero is celebrating its five-year anniversary today, January 28, 2025. Below, we look back at its inspirations and excitement for experimentation.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It is in the details that Kentucky Route Zero stakes its claim beyond video games. Its typewriter typography. The terse descriptions of characters between bursts of dialogue. The adventure game actions written like stage directions. Lights that illuminate the new parts of a stage or set. It is the details that matter. In practice, KRZ doesn't play differently from any other adventure game, but it feels different than many of them. This is because it takes from a wide array of influences, many beyond the usual preview of video games. Its interest in theater, film, visual art, and radio is what still makes it a vivid game five years later.</p><p dir="ltr">It is no secret that video games can be a little self-obsessed. While one could meaningfully label a painting, a movie, or a book as "science-fiction" or "romantic," video game genre designations like "roguelike" or "platformer" can only really describe video games (though if any one wants write an essay about what novels could be described as "strategy" or "simulation," I would be very eager to read it). Many--even most--big-budget games borrow from a ready-made list of influences, such as Star Wars, Alien, Indiana Jones, or Lord of the Rings. This narrow set of sources can make video games feel sometimes hyper-generic: unable to node themselves into a meaningful network, but instead digging deeper into an ever-drying well. When a big game attempts a big homage to genuine artistic legacy, it can feel absurd. Who could possibly take Ghost of Tsushima's "Kurosawa mode" seriously?</p><p dir="ltr">Though Kentucky Route Zero could be described as science-fiction, it is a quiet unnerving kind, drawing most obviously from the magical realism of writers like Gabriel García Márquez and Ricardo Piglia. It has stark artificiality, a stageness, that is clearly pulling on the theoretical and fictional work of Bertolt Brecht. It is, in a word, pretty far outside the regular span of video games. This results in something that can feel beguiling and strange in a way video games can often struggle to be, especially if you haven't read any of its inspirations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434372-krz3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434372" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434372-krz3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434372"></a><figcaption>Kentucky Route Zero</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434372-krz3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>This is not to say that KRZ is ashamed of or above its adventure-games roots. It also stakes its claim within video games, sometimes in grand overt gestures. Within the first screen of KRZ you will encounter a computer console where you can request "games." It will reply "games is not real." In Act 3, you interface with a gigantic machine which plays a version of Colossal Cave Adventure. It is, undoubtedly, pretentious. But it also puts video game influences alongside the literary and theatrical without a lot of fuss. Of course these things belong together. Why wouldn't they? That matter-of-factness grants KRZ a lot of ground to explore its own formal qualities.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it is important that we not give into astonishment. Plenty of games take inspiration from outside of video games (or even just outside of video games' regular set of influences) and they are still tiresome. BioShock Infinite is perhaps the most grandiose and spectacular example of this. There are also plenty of great games which also pull beyond the medium's clichés. Disco Elysium and Signalis made big splashes for similar reasons. Norco was unfairly compared to Kentucky Route Zero for drawing on a different set of Americana. People can be hyperbolic about KRZ, naming it as one of the most important games of all time merely for having book smarts and pro-labor politics. It's easy and tempting to exaggerate a video game's originality or power, especially when we haven't read or watched or looked at the things it is drawing from.</p><p dir="ltr">But what KRZ has, that many other games don't, is a real excitement and verve for experimentation. It is not merely that it borrows from other works of art, but that it wants to innovate on its own terms. Each of its five acts are, to some degree, daring formal exercises. From the whirring wheels and road maps of Act I to the Huckleberryian ferry ride of Act IV, the game never settles on a consistent visual language or conceit. The game took so long to make, the full game released nine years after it first appeared on a Kickstarter campaign. This is perhaps explained by how eager it is to reinvent itself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434373-krz2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434373" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434373-krz2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434373"></a><figcaption>Kentucky Route Zero</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434373-krz2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Every act, released individually, does feel like something new. Main characters vanish never to appear again and the player's control and perspective alter constantly. The culmination of this is, of course, Act V, where the player plays a cat wandering a small town. The camera turns on a swivel placed in the center of town. The center of the camera is on the spoke of the wheel or the trunk of a tree, the heart on which this whole community turns. In its final moments, the game takes on a communal character, not following any individual really, but instead a place: a people.</p><p dir="ltr">If you search the right phrase, you'll find dozens of forum posts asking for movies, books, and TV shows like KRZ. The question is sort of funny on its face. What makes KRZ strange and exciting in video games is far more commonplace in essentially every other medium. It is easy, and understandable, to denigrate KRZ's contributions for this reason. Could I not just read Gabriel García Márquez, Berholt Brecht, and John Steinbeck and call it a day? But what this fosters in me is a sense of indebtedness. Self-evidently, great art steals, but that theft is not one of ownership. It's more like a torrent. Every other copy still exists; many of them have their pieces in yours. It's a network. Any theft pulls a string, tying the knot further. KRZ's final image is of a house without walls--a place that lets you in--where new friends pull up a chair for you, and lend you a book. Kentucky Route Zero is a powerful work of art, because it is an invitation. Many games are eager to bring you into their world, to make it consume you. KRZ wants nothing more than to push you into something else, to make you see the world that came before it.</p>

			<p>In an era of reboots, remasters, and endless rumours of new and old Resident Evil games, it’s refreshing to look past the noise and play an actual game whilst you wait for the latest shenanigans of the Umbrella Corporation. There’s plenty of indie counterparts these days, whether they’re looking to reinvent the genre or pay strict homage to the classics.&nbsp;The Mute House is very much in the latter category as it is very much Resident Evil by the numbers. This isn’t as damning as it may sound though, as I am always in the mood for some spooky mansion action.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Mute House | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lhK6vmpRJ-M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The most impressive thing about The Mute House is how polished the game feels considering it is the work almost entirely of a solo developer. There is some excellent use of Unreal assets (all credited) and a clear understanding of just what makes the genre work. The level design, puzzles, and combat are all first rate with only a few minor niggles leading to some frustration.</p>


<p>Alongside being a very faithful take on Resident Evil’s style and design, The Mute House is also a return to the more hardcore nature of the early games. There are no initial difficulty settings here and the intended experience is challenging in a way that reminded me of my teenage days grappling with the first Resi game on PS1.</p>
<p>You begin by playing as Amber, a young woman lost in the woods on her way back from a night out. Immediately you are thrust into a chase scene as a ‘maniac’ is following her. Amber soon finds herself taking shelter in a cabin near a mysterious mansion. The relief is short-lived, however, as this is just the beginning of her nightmare. Cut to a week later and Amber’s elder sister, Emily, a local cop is investigating her disappearance. Upon entering the mansion, the entrance is sealed behind her and her quest begins.</p>


<p>At first glance the mansion is almost a carbon copy of the original Spencer Mansion even to the point of having a concealed door behind the staircase. The rest of the levels do find their own style though, and you’ll find yourself navigating a cemetery and sinister gatehouse before you have any chance of finding Amber.</p>
<p>Navigation is familiar genre fare, with perfectly implemented tank controls and inventory management being the name of the game. One big departure from other games in the survival horror genre, though, is also perhaps the most controversial aspect here – there is no map function whatsoever. This could be a deliberate move to increase the hardcore aspect but it does take some getting used to, especially once you start unlocking shortcuts and alternative paths around the mansion. I can see the appeal of this in a second playthrough (and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/24/dead-of-darkness-review-terror-from-the-top-down/">Dead of Darkness</a> has an achievement for not checking the map) but it did lead to some annoying backtracking at times. The ideal situation is to play through in one sitting, but the 5 or 6 hour initial playtime makes this difficult.</p>

<p>Combat plays a significant role here, with the narrow corridors in many areas not being conducive to dodging the zombies and mutated monsters that you will face. Initially you’re restricted to your police issue handgun which is fine, but soon becomes underpowered. Once you find a shotgun it will become your main go-to, although ammo management is an issue for much of the game. This area could do with some rebalancing as zombies taking 8 or 9 shots to die makes the pistol barely usable when a single shotgun shell will do the trick. I ended the game with around a dozen clips in storage and others left in the environment.</p>
<p>Inventory management is another key survival horror staple that The Mute House takes and gives a distinctive hardcore twist. Rather than the magically linked item boxes that are typical for the genre, the shelves here only act as local storage, so you need to remember where you put things and return for them. This was another aspect that took me a while to get used to, so entrenched was the usual approach, but there are a couple of centrally located shelves to work with and nowhere near the deluge of items that are in other titles. In fact, aside from some key items you’ll only need to juggle health restoration and your weapons and ammo. This, however, is also made more difficult by the odd decision not to allow item stacking. This means that each clip or box of shells is a single item and reloading with partial clips drops the bullets already in the pistol.</p>

<p>Equally central to the world of survival horror are puzzles, and The Mute House has a nice mix of key finding, item use, and some more involved environmental ones. I was especially impressed by an audio-based puzzle that required you to memorise a tune and play sections of it in the correct order, and an Indiana Jones-like floor tile puzzle that requires you to take notes from five different pictures throughout the game. The latter was less exciting the fourth and fifth time I had to repeat it though as it preceded an instant death boss encounter with no save point in between, despite there being a room in which one would have worked.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Mute House is one of the most faithful survival horror experiences currently available and is highly recommended for any fans of the genre. While clear in its influences, it also has some new ideas of its own. They don't entirely come off, but I appreciate the distinct vision at play here and once you take the game on its own terms you are set for a memorable time. I just don’t think I ever want to do that tile pattern puzzle again!	</p></div>

Of course, there's the obligatory video with glimpses from the community, but there's also lots of news about the game's future.</p>
<p>To start with, the fifth content update, titled Pact of the Flame, is available now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-roleplay-wrath-and-glory-stater-set-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>A simple job they told me. Travel in luxury aboard the Herald Varonius as an agent of the rogue trader Jakel Varonius and glory will await you. I should have known things are never that easy. It went sour pretty quickly onboard, and throne knowns what horrors and schemes await me in the Gilead System. Still, the Emperor knows I'm not in this for the quiet life.</i></p>

<p>We've been fans of Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying games for a while, and you can read our review of the <em>Age of Sigmar&nbsp;Soulbound</em>&nbsp;starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game</em> starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=_3mXzx0r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=aK27Opmu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set includes 2 books for the GM to run the adventure.</figcaption></figure><h2>For The Emperor!</h2>

<p>Similar to Cubicle 7s's <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy roleplaying systems, their sci-fi <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> (or <em>40K </em>for short) roleplaying systems also have 2 options, with different mechanics and styles. The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> system that we're looking at here, uses 6-sided dice, similar to the tabletop wargaming system, and is much more combat-focused. Whereas <em>Imperium Maledictum</em> (for which we will review the starter set for next month when it releases), uses a D100 system, similar to that of the <em>WFRP </em>system that Cubicle 7 also produces, and is much more focused on investigation and social encounters.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that this starter set is slightly different from that released in 2018 by&nbsp;Ulisses Spiele, which we <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wrath-and-glory-starter-set-review-warhammer-40k-roleplaying" rel="nofollow">reviewed here</a>. With Cubicle 7 taking on the system, they've updated the books (this version includes a completely new adventure) and changed some of the components inside, all for the better.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=MP-uNWZj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=nBRGGbyu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While still of a high quality, the&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set components don't feel as polished as the other <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying starter sets Cubicle 7 offer.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tools Of The Faithful</h2>

<p>Like the other 2 Cubicle 7 roleplaying starter sets we've covered, <em>Wrath and Glory</em> contains all the components for 6 players plus a Games Master to play through their first adventure and beyond. Each player gets a pre-generated character sheet, which we'll go into more detail below, along with some quick reference sheets for the rules and a map of the system.</p>

<p>The Games Master, who runs the adventure, gets 2 books, the&nbsp;Traitor’s Hymn, the core adventure and rules tutorial for <em>Wrath and Glory,</em> and&nbsp;The Varonius Flotilla, a sourcebook full of details of characters the players might meet, along with ships and local politics, which can be used to either flesh out the included adventure, or create your own to expand beyond the Traitor's Hymn.</p>

<p>The maps, rules references sheets and box don't feel as polished as the other starter sets that Cubicle 7 offer. The sheets are single-sided and there's no rules reference for the GM on the inside of the box. It's not a huge deal, but compared to the others sets, it does feel like a missed opportunity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=Ffge1wna 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=9BI2fdII 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set includes an incredible spread of pre-generated characters that create fantastic party tension with their different loyalties.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Faithfull and Fallen&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The<em> Wrath and Glory</em> starter set includes 6 pre-generated characters, and similarly to the <em>WFRP</em> and <em>Soulbound</em> starters, each character comes with a fold-out sheet full of background details to flesh out the character beyond the stats. Also similarly to the other starters, it has a great spread of characters to introduce players to the setting.</p>

<p>Players can choose from a Rogue Trader, who are half merchant half adventurer, a Sanctioned Psyker, a magic user approved by the Imperium, a Sister of Battle, a warrior devout to the Imperium's religious creed, a Skitarius, a heavily augmented human, a Space Marine Scout, a new recruit to the superhuman soldiers of the Adeptus Astartes, and an Aeldari Ranger, a space-elf sniper.</p>

<p>The mix creates an interesting dynamic within the group, and while they may be loyal to each other, they all have higher goals or loyalties. The Rogue Trader is ultimately only out for themselves, the holier than thou Battle Sister would burn everyone she suspected of treachery, the Skitarius is only loyal to the Machine Cult, similar to the indoctrinated Space Marine who would choose their Chapter over anything, and everyone suspects the alien.</p>

<p>I said the same things in my review of the Cubicle 7 <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy starter set reviews, about the Games Master needing to do some prep (which is standard for all GMs), but here it is a little simpler as the game mechanics are a lot more straight-forward (at least in the starter set, there's a lot of extra awesome depth in the full rules). This means that once the GM has a handle on the rules, they can focus on the adventure. They do have to have some ideas ready on the fly for the Wrath dice, which we discuss below, but that's an essential skill for being a good GM anyway.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=UuN2UiJj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=4TrAepPB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set custom dice help to keep a simple system even faster to focus on the action. Watch out for the 1 on the red dice though!</figcaption></figure><h2>How To Wage War In The Name Of The Emperor</h2>

<p>The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> system uses 6-sided dice (D6s), with each result of a 4+ being a success (or icon in <em>W&amp;G</em> terms). A roll of 6 counts as 2 icons, and the custom dice included in the <em>Wrath and Glory</em> starter set show this clearly, with skull icons for the 4 and 5, and a skull with a halo for the 6.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This system keeps the game flowing fast, as the Games Master will call out a test target, 3 is standard, and the attribute and skill required for the test. For example, if you're trying to push over something heavy, it would be an Athletics - Strength skill, but if you're trying to jump over a series of obstacles, it would be an Athletics - Agility test. Once the test and difficulty is called, the player rolls a number of D6s equal to the combined attribute and skill they have and simply need to roll a number of icons equal to or above that.</p>

<p>When players collect their dice, they identify one as the Wrath die (the starter set includes a custom red die). This dice has a bonus effect of adding a complication to the roll (success or not) if a 1 is rolled, or the group gains a point of glory or it counts as a critical hit if it shows a 6. I absolutely love this little detail, which, for such a simple mechanic, really adds depth to the rolls, along with keeping players humble. Even when rolling 20 dice for a test requiring 3 icons, that little Wrath dice can still spoil your day with a complication when you succeed.</p>

<h2>Wrath and Glory Starter Set Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> starter set is a great introduction to roleplaying in the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> setting. The adventure has both intrigue and combat, showing the strength of the system in both areas and really allows you to get behind blasting the enemies of the Emperor. The characters are all fantastic, and if the players have a little background knowledge of the setting, can really get into the depths of the suspicions between each of them. If everyone is coming in cold to the setting, the character sheets do a great job of bringing you in, and telling you who you like and don't. The starter set mechanics are simple enough that you don't need to spend ages working out results, allowing you to focus on the combat, and are a great introduction and stepping stone to the full system.&nbsp;The Varonius Flotilla book allows you to expand well beyond the introductory adventure and gives you a few sessions' worth of material for the GM to work with if you want to test the system more before investing further.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-more-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>developer Phoenix Labs has laid off the majority of its remaining employees as part of what it describes as "unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on LinkedIn, the studio says the layoffs were a "tough decision" and that it "recognize[s] and deeply appreciate[s] the contributions of every individual impacted". The studio stops short of saying exactly how many employees will be affected by these layoffs.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what this might mean for&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>(or, indeed, for cozy sim&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>), Phoenix Labs says it'll share more on its plans for these games "in the coming weeks".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phoenix-labs-dauntless-layoffs-ice-monster.jpg?itok=VqegnAn- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phoenix-labs-dauntless-layoffs-ice-monster.jpg?itok=P2RJgd2v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dauntless</em>' Phoenix Labs has laid off the majority of its remaining staff.</figcaption></figure><p>Beyond the rather vague "unfortunate but necessary changes", Phoenix Labs doesn't offer any kind of reason as to why this decision has been made.</p>

<p>However, the studio has come in for criticism recently regarding the most recent major&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>update, otherwise known as Awakening.</p>

<p>The update has proven unpopular with players, resulting in the game hitting an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331370/Dauntless/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Overwhelmingly Negative rating on Steam</a>, where it was released on the same day as the Awakening update landed.</p>

<p>Criticism included the update's changes to monetization, progression, and other gameplay systems, with some laying the blame at the feet of Phoenix Labs' owner Forte Labs, a blockchain-focused company that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">purchased</a> the studio from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-acquired-by-garena" rel="nofollow">former owner Garena</a> (from which Forte itself spun off) in 2023.</p>




<p>The changes to <em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>proved unpopular enough to prompt Phoenix Labs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology" rel="nofollow">issue an apology</a> and promise to make "immediate adjustments" back in December, but if the game's current Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/331370/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">player count</a> (at time of writing) is anything to go by, those changes haven't made much of a difference.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that even if Phoenix Labs' layoffs are directly related to&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' recent performance, the studio is far from alone in laying off employees; these layoffs are taking place against the backdrop of a much wider wave of staff cuts, project cancellations, and studio closures.</p>

<p>Other studios hit in recent months include&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector" rel="nofollow">Reflector Entertainment</a>, tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, and (reportedly)&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">Rocksteady</a>, among many others.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/halo-call-of-dyuty-collab/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sledgehammer-games-planned-to-have-halo-maps-in-modern-warfare-3-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1093686/</guid>

<p>Sledgehammer Games once had plans to have a massive Halo collaboration in Modern Warfare 3, where some Halo maps would come to Call of Duty.</p>



<p>That’s according to leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1884053078682566742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@TheGhostOfHope</a> on X (formerly Twitter), who has seemingly returned back to form and started to leak details in regards to Call of Duty again after taking a break.</p>



<p>In a new post, Hope revealed that “Sledgehammer Games had plans to do a huge collaboration with Halo with Modern Warfare III which would have added various maps from the Halo franchise.”</p>



<p>Another leaker and dataminer by the name of Alaix seemingly confirmed the details by saying, “maybe one day i’ll feel generous enough to share some of the screenshots I have from this collab.”</p>



<p>While it’s currently not known on what maps, weapons, or outfits would have made it into Modern Warfare 3, it’s intriguing to know that there where at least plans at one stage, with Alaix’s comments implying that there was even assets made.</p>



<p>It means that Microsoft could visit such collaborations again in the future, depending on how the Call of Duty franchise performs and how much interest such collaborations would bring in.</p>



<p>But this isn’t the first time we’ve heard that Microsoft have been considered Call of Duty and other Microsoft IP crossovers. In November 2024, it was claimed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-doom-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soon feature collaborations between Halo, DOOM, and Gears of War</a>. While those leaks are yet to come to fruition, where there’s some, there’s fire.</p>



<p>Would you like to see a massive Halo x Call of Duty crossover in a future CoD title? What do you think of Halo once being planned to be in Modern Warfare 3? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Keen Games outlined what the next year of development for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/enshrouded/" data-ref-id="5000-587982">Enshrouded</a> looks like, confirming that a 1.0 release for the survival game will finally arrive in Spring 2026.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P62h-4bEaWo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P62h-4bEaWo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Enshrouded was one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/" data-ref-id="2900-5289">survival games</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-isnt-the-only-survival-game-climbing-up-the-steam-charts/1100-6520667/" data-ref-id="1100-6520667">blew up in popularity alongside Palworld</a> last January, with Keen Games confirming that it has amassed over 3 million players in one year. Keen Games consistently delivered updates for it throughout 2024, and the same will happen in 2025. Enshrouded's 2025 roadmap kicks off today, January 28, with the Pact of the Flame update. Pact of the Flame adds several useful multiplayer features to Enshrouded, including an in-game text chat, options for proximity or server-wide voice chat, emotes, and a new social menu. On top of that, a first-person camera mode for building and over 80 new items have been added.</p><p>Keen Games also released a roadmap of Enshrouded's expected 2025 updates. Throughout this year, new features like an event system, base raids, weather events, the ability to teleport between servers, build sharing, and a new biome are all expected to come to Enshrouded. Following even more updates early next year, we can all expect Enshrouded's development to crescendo with a 1.0 launch next spring. You can check out an image of the full roadmap below to get a better idea of everything that Keen Games is working on right now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4434095-enshrouded2025roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434095" data-ratio="1" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4434095-enshrouded2025roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434095"></a><figcaption>Enshrouded's early access roadmap for 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4434095-enshrouded2025roadmap.jpg"></figure><p>Enshrouded is currently in early access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on PC via Steam</a>.
