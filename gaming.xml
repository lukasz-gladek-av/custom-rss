			<p>Warhammer 40K Darktide appears to be headed to Sony's PlayStation 5 console. The news comes from the ever-helpful Taiwanese rating board (<a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1835519789847978106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Gematsu</a>), which recently rated this new version ahead of any announcement from developer Fatshark.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Darktide is currently only available on PC and Xbox Series S|X. However, it is likely that Microsoft only secured a timed exclusivity deal rather than a definitive exclusivity deal, and the Xbox Series S|X version <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-patch-13-preview-and-qa-class-system-overhaul-xbox-specs-and-pc-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on October 4, 2023. Most timed exclusivity deals are one year long, so Fatshark might be about to launch the PS5 version in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>The game originally debuted on PC in late 2022, but it was in rough shape back then. The studio spent a long time afterward fleshing out key systems like loot and class. The next big overhaul is coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-secrets-of-the-machine-god-details-itemization-preview-and-brief-qa-with-fatshark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">itemization</a>. The two new major systems are called Mastery and Expertise.</p>
<p>Mastery is the core progression system tied to the weapon type/family. As players use a particular weapon, they'll gain more experience, unlocking new blessings, perks, tokens, and a special weapon cosmetic via the Reward Tracks. As they progress, the potential quality and stats of the weapon will also increase.</p>
<p>Mastery will merge all weapon types/families, meaning Warhammer 40K Darktide players will get to freely switch between different brands of the same weapon type. For example, if you own an Infantry Lasgun, you can unlock all the possible marks for that weapon and switch from one mark to another.</p>
<p>When you view a weapon, you will see the weapon's maximum potential stats (which are randomly determined). It's up to the player to decide if the weapon's profile is interesting enough to commit to and to increase the stats until they reach that potential (which will then be applied to the weapon through the expertise system).</p>
<p>While the Mastery system is where a player unlocks a weapon's potential, the Expertise system is where players apply those changes through crafting. Players will be able to configure the weapon, change the blessings or perks, and increase the stats. They will no longer be locked out after making two changes to perks or blessings. They will be using resources to make these changes.</p>

<p>The itemization update titled Locked &amp; Loaded will be released on September 26. Obviously, it will be included with the PS5 version when it launches in the near future.</p>

<p>The 2024 RLCS has officially come to an end. Rocket League fans around the world have gotten their fix of car vs car soccer action, with the best Rocket League teams ever to exist facing off against each other in Forth Worth, Texas. However, only one team was able to walk out at the champions, and that was Team BDS.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-team-bds-manages-to-win-rlcs-grand-finals-after-barely-winning-semifinals">Team BDS Manages to Win RLCS Grand Finals After Barely Winning Semifinals</h2>



<p>It was a riveting day for Team BDS, as the popular esports organization barely made it to Grand Finals. During the matches, the team had to face off against Team Falcons, who had previously lost to Karmine Corps in the Upper Bracket Quarterfinals.</p>



<p>Team Falcon’s loss, however, had made them hungry. Knowing their next set of matches could be their last, the team pushed forward past their limits as well as they could against Team BDS, but ended up losing 4-3.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Team BDS, though, had a victorious day after winning, not only the Upper Bracket Quarterfinals but also their Semifinals matches and the Grand Finals. </p>



<p>The team faced off against G2 Stride, winning the championship 4-2. Not only did they win $300,000, but their lead player, ExoTiik, was awarded the <strong>RLCS 2024 Season MVP</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="h-rlcs-hosts-a-successful-event-in-texas">RLCS Hosts a Successful Event in Texas</h2>



<p>The 2024 RLCS proved to be another successful event for the esport, as Rocket League really only has this one big tournament a year. Like the 2024 Fortnite Globals event, the event was held at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>



<p>With 16 of the best Rocket League teams in the world competing, fans saw some of the best 3v3 action out there. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The entirety of the tournament lasted five days and had a $1,165,000 prize pool.</p>



<p>It will be interesting to see where the RLCS season goes in 2025.</p>

For the first time since becoming interested in MMA during the McGregor era and falling in love with the sport during the pandemic, I skipped all of my UFC fight week traditions. I hadn’t tuned in to a single episode of <em>Embedded</em>, nor did I watch the press conference on Thursday or the ceremonial weigh-ins on Friday. And I certainly didn’t have my usual “one more sleep” jitters heading into Saturday. What’s clear to me now is my lack of enthusiasm was the result of the sort of uncertainty that leads to reservation rather than curiosity.</p><p>Almost everything about Saturday night’s card left me and other fans scratching our heads going into it, starting with its hodgepodge of a name: UFC 306: Riyadh Season Noche UFC. And then there was the star of the promotional buildup. No, not the homegrown, hype-machine-manufactured Sean O’Malley, and not even Mexico’s own Alexa Grasso, but rather The Sphere (or simply “Sphere,” as it was referred to throughout the broadcast). A Mexican-inspired Fight Night that somehow became a numbered pay-per-view presented by a Saudi Arabian festival series, boasting an arena as its main attraction, left me with questions that couldn’t be answered by the sights and sounds of a typical fight week. Instead, those questions were answered by the standard brilliance of the most production-savvy combat sports promotion this side of WWE.<br></p><p>When it was initially reported the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2024/07/29/ufc-noche--ufc-306-ticket-prices-top-out-at-17507/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2024/07/29/ufc-noche--ufc-306-ticket-prices-top-out-at-17507/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheapest seat in the house</a></span> would cost over $2,000, I wondered if more impassioned Mexican and Mexican-American fight fans would be priced out in favor of casuals with cushy salaries and corporate credit cards. That concern was quieted once I heard the crowd pop for Raúl Rosas Jr. as he walked toward the octagon ahead of the night’s first prelim. I did my best Irish accent and asked <em>who da fook is dat guy </em>when I found out four fighters I’d never heard of were opening the main card. Lo and behold, those were the two most entertaining bouts of the evening, with Esteban Ribovics and Daniel Zellhuber earning Fight of the Night bonuses that could have just as easily gone to Ronaldo Rodríguez and Ode’ Osbourne. And, as Sean O’Malley <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mmamania.com/2024/8/24/24227374/sean-omalley-annoyed-with-promotion-noche-ufc-im-the-one-doing-interviews-not-the-sphere-ppv-vegas&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mmamania.com/2024/8/24/24227374/sean-omalley-annoyed-with-promotion-noche-ufc-im-the-one-doing-interviews-not-the-sphere-ppv-vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took issue with himself</a></span> at one point, I noted with interest, which soon soured into ambivalence, that the event’s venue was being promoted more heavily than the then-bantamweight champion at the top of its billing. I don’t know about him, but I understood why that was by the end of the night, as the suspense surrounding what a sporting event at The Sphere might look like paid off more abundantly than the one-way drubbing most educated fans correctly predicted he’d receive in the main event.<br></p><p>But above all, the main question I had before last night was why did the UFC’s first and potentially only appearance at The Sphere <em>need</em> to be on Mexican Independence Day? As Noche UFC neared, my thinking was that, presumably, an event headlined by the eventual return of either Conor McGregor or Jon Jones would have made for a greater pop cultural spectacle, International Fight Week would have led to less complicated branding, and UFC 300, which fans and pundits also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mmamania.com/2024/4/20/24135832/dana-white-drops-video-bragging-about-ufc-300-success-tries-to-turn-fighters-against-mma-media-ppv&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mmamania.com/2024/4/20/24135832/dana-white-drops-video-bragging-about-ufc-300-success-tries-to-turn-fighters-against-mma-media-ppv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made the mistake of underestimating</a></span>, would have allowed for a deeper card. Again, the event itself convinced me of its merits in a way that no moment on <em>Embedded</em> or confrontation at a press conference could have prepared me for.<br></p><p>No alternative I had in mind for a more appropriate Sphere card would have resulted in the breathtaking storytelling of Noche UFC. The six interstitials produced by Oscar-winning filmmaker Carlos López Estrada’s Antigravity Academy made perfect use of The Sphere’s immersive capabilities, transporting audiences throughout Mexican history with images that inspired awe even through a TV screen. Ancient civilizations, heroic freedom fighters, spiritual traditions, iconic combat athletes, and the virtues of Mexican culture were all honored with Lucasesque light and magic. Eight first- and second-generation Mexican Octagon Girls strutted between rounds wearing stunning costumes inspired by their shared heritage.<br></p><p>The main event notwithstanding, the fights themselves lived up the pageantry of the night in ways only the drama of high-level MMA could, especially when booked in celebration of a culture’s fighting spirit. Minutes after a short film told the story of Indigenous warriors, the earliest people to fight for the land now known as Mexico, Mexican flyweight Ronaldo Rodriguez escaped two near-completed submissions and persevered his way to a unanimous decision over Ode’ Osbourne. Right after that, Mexico City-born Daniel Zellhuber battled Argentina’s Esteban Ribovics with the breakneck pace of a <em>Street Fighter</em> button-mashing, losing on the cards but winning over fans like me who were watching him compete for the first time. And despite a lackluster performance from former Women’s Flyweight Champion Alexa Grasso, I found myself on the edge of my seat seemingly once per round, attempting to will a tap from Valentina Shevchenko into existence.<br></p><p>Similar to 300 before it, there are images from UFC 306 that’ll be etched in my brain for the rest of my fandom; thrilling moments I would have never predicted when comparing the names on the card to the hyperbolic hype that preceded it.<br></p><p>I don’t know if Noche UFC turned out to be “the greatest sporting event of all time,” as UFC CEO Dana White <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2024/07/02/dana-white-sphere-card-will-be-greatest-sporting-event-of-all-time/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2024/07/02/dana-white-sphere-card-will-be-greatest-sporting-event-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promised in July</a></span>. In his post-fight press availability, White admitted himself it’d be up to the public to decide if the night lived up to that claim. In general, I’m a bit allergic to making statements that grand. But what I will confess is Noche UFC was the most impressively produced televised sporting event I’ve seen with my own two eyes–better than any Super Bowl, NBA Finals, or WrestleMania I’ve ever watched.</p><p>It was a spectacle I couldn’t quite convince myself to anticipate, but one that I’ll never forget. If you’re still with me, scroll or click through the following photos for a look at what made the night so memorable.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8f20de7df38ae73d248bae4568288366"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-is-by-far-the-biggest-reason-to-buy-a-playstation-5-pro/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Fall season is mere days away, which means GTA VI should launch around a year from now. Last we heard from Take-Two, Rockstar's highly anticipated game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated</a> to launch in Fall 2025, contributing to what could be a stellar year for the publisher:</p>
<p><em>Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window of Calendar 2025 to Fall of Calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto VI. We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase. Looking ahead, we believe that our Company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>GTA VI is, of course, the star of an amazing Take-Two lineup for 2025 that also includes the next mainline entries in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civilization</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mafia</a> franchises, not to mention <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borderlands 4</a> and possibly even <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judas</a>, the long-awaited new game from Ken Levine. In this article, though, we'll focus on why GTA VI is going to be absolutely critical not only for Rockstar and Take-Two but also for Sony, specifically with regard to the upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro console.</p>
<p>The anticipation for the next mainline installment in the Grand Theft Auto series can hardly be overstated. The previous entry, Grand Theft Auto V, can be considered the best-selling game of all time, with over 200 million units sold. Sure, technically Minecraft has sold even more, but there are numerous caveats: it launched two years before GTA V; it is cheaper; it is available on way more platforms, and it also targets a much broader audience that includes kids.</p>
<p>Rockstar Games has rightfully earned itself a massive fanbase thanks to masterpieces like GTA and Red Dead Redemption, and it's been a long time since we got a game of theirs. GTA V originally launched in September 2013, and Red Dead Redemption 2 was released in October 2018. It was, therefore, not very surprising to see the first GTA VI trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-breaks-100-million-youtube-views-is-the-biggest-non-bts-video-ever-for-its-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shattering YouTube records in terms of views</a>.</p>
<p>If we take a moment to dive into why Rockstar's titles are so popular, a big reason is that they move the needle forward when it comes to the open world genre. They've done that ever since Grand Theft Auto 3, which showed the way to the whole industry on what was possible with PlayStation 2 hardware, and the latest games are no different. Red Dead Redemption 2 itself is still unmatched in some areas, even when compared to more recent open world titles.</p>
<p>However, there's a flip side. Rockstar's games have historically struggled on the performance side precisely because the developer always attempts to cram as many technological advancements as possible onto the available hardware. Grand Theft Auto VI is unlikely to be different in this area.</p>
<p>As such, gamers will need the most powerful hardware to get the optimal experience when it comes to smoothness and definition. With Red Dead Redemption 2, the Xbox One X <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-xbox-one-x-best/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered that</a> with a clear advantage in both rendering resolution and frame rate stability over the less powerful PS4 Pro. However, this time, Microsoft doesn't seem interested in delivering a mid-generation console refresh, betting everything on the next generation instead (which they <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim</a> will offer&nbsp;the biggest performance leap ever).</p>
<p>With the PC version of GTA VI unlikely to materialize until at least a year and a half from the console debut, the best way to experience the story of Lucia and her partner will be on PlayStation 5 Pro. Even if it turns out to be true that Sony's $700 console <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannot deliver 60 frames per second</a>, it will most likely offer a performance mode of around 40-45 FPS that takes advantage of variable refresh rate technology (VRR) to offer a far smoother experience than 30 FPS.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro remains a niche console with its high pricing, but that niche will still spend what Sony is asking to get the best experience possible for the top games—starting with GTA VI. Sony is well aware of this and will likely push to make a Grand Theft Auto VI PS5 Pro bundle when the game finally launches next Fall.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/flappy-bird-crypto-scam/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The mobile game community was abuzz earlier this week following reports from CNET that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/flappy-bird-returning-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flappy Bird is set to return after a decade-long hiatus</a>. However, fans of the original game were quick to point out that it wasn’t all that it seemed, with some suggesting that the game is a crypto scam.</p>



<p>Just a few days after the news surfaced, Dong Nguyen, the original creator of Flappy Bird, has spoken out on Twitter. <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/1835229532301017328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nguyen said</a>, “No, I have no related with their game. I did not sell anything. I also don’t support crypto.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Dong%20Nguyen%20Ha%20%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">court documents</a>, Gametech Holdings LLC seized Nguyen’s trademark of Flappy Bird due to inactivity. This means that Gametech Holdings LLC can now essentially do what it pleases with the game. As for the game being a crypto scam, it’s been discovered that hidden pages on the Flappy Bird website suggest that there will be crypto involved when the game relaunches. </p>



<p>“The original Flappy Bird is back and will fly higher than ever on Solana as it soars into web 3.0,” and continues to say, “build, create, play, and stake to own.”</p>



<p>The now-new owners of Flappy Bird are yet to comment on any of the accusations officially, but following the announcement of the game’s return, a representative said, “We are beyond excited to be bringing back Flappy Bird and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come. We have big plans for our little Bird!”</p>



<p>What do you think of Flappy Bird potentially returning as a crypto scam? Let us know in the comments below or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-analysis-improvements/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is going to bring visual and performance improvements to games even without patching, although some games will benefit more than others from the console's improved specs.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their Weekly podcast, which is currently only available to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> supporters, the tech experts at Digital Foundry analyzed a high-quality version of the console's announcement video, revealing some interesting details on each of the shown games, as reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/JMaine518" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@JMaine518</a>. First-party games such as The Last of Us Part 2 and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart see increased image quality and more stable performance thanks to the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution scaler. Another first part game, Horizon Forbidden West, runs with higher detail, but the resolution didn't look 4K, so it was probably not using PSSR. Speaking about Gran Turismo 7, Digital Foundry revealed how the game runs at a lower resolution (1188p) than on the base model, upscaled to 4K with PSSR on PS5 Pro and at native 4K without ray tracing.</p>
<p>When it comes to third-party games running on PlayStation 5 Pro, it seems like the console's increased power isn't enough to address the low base resolution some of these games run at. Alan Wake 2, for example, at the two shown modes, targeting 60 and 30 FPS respectively, runs at the same resolutions it does on the base model, 846p and 1260p, although PSSR is presumably used in place of AMD FSR 2. The 30 FPS mode could also feature ray tracing, while the 60 FPS mode features screen-space reflections.</p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy is a step up over the base model, featuring ray-traced reflections and possibly even ray-traced shadows mixed with screen-space reflections. Interestingly, one game that could see a massive performance improvement on PlayStation 5 Pro is Dragon's Dogma 2, which looked to be running at 60 FPS, possibly with PSSR. Assassin's Creed Shadows also seemed to run at 60 FPS but at a low 846p resolution, presumably upscaled to a higher resolution using PSSR.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Notes from the Digital Foundry Direct Weekly #180 - PS5 Pro Breakdown</p>
<p>The Last of Part 2 - 1440p internal resolution at 60fps in this PS5 Pro Mode (same as PS5 Performance Mode) with improved image quality due to PSSR</p>
<p>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart - Between 1440p and 1800p…</p>
<p>— King J 🤴🏿 (@JMaine518) <a href="https://twitter.com/JMaine518/status/1835119239650312661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Judging from this early analysis, it really seems like the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler will be the true <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing-pssr-game-changer/">game changer</a>&nbsp;Digital Foundry thinks it will be. The other two pillars of the PlayStation 5 Pro, while important, look like they won't be as impactful as the AI-driven upscaler.</p>

But while the group has been framing it as the triumphant return of a classic mobile game, <em>Flappy Bird’</em>s original developer, Dong Nguyen isn’t calling it a comeback — in fact, he says he’s not involved at all.</p><p>Nguyen posted as much on X (for the first time since 2017!) this morning, saying he didn’t “sell anything.” The Flappy Bird Foundation wrote in the announcement it shared with press last week that it had “acquired the rights from Gametech Holdings, LLC,” which had secured the trademark from Nguyen, but it doesn’t appear as though that was the result of any dealings between him and the group.</p><p>Gametech <a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91287432&amp;pty=OPP">filed in opposition</a> of Nguyen’s <em>Flappy Bird</em> trademark in 2023, <a href="https://x.com/SamNChiet/status/1834246569857634352">spotted X user Samperson</a>. The filing came nearly a decade after Nguyen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5400488/flappy-bird-pulled-because-it-became-addictive">pulled the then-popular game</a> and never released another version, and the US Patent and Trademark Office determined his trademark to be abandoned, terminating his claim to it in January. </p><p>The Flappy Bird Foundation didn’t say in its announcement that Nguyen was involved, but it certainly leans on nostalgia as it promotes the game. More than half of the game’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXn6Yd-j8DeE">first trailer</a> lingers on the game’s rise in popularity and the disappointment of its abrupt disappearance in 2013, before declaring that “In 2024, Flappy Bird will fly again.”</p><p>As for the crypto piece of this puzzle, cybersecurity researcher <a href="https://varun.ch/flappy-bird">Varun Biniwale pointed out</a> hidden pages from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5400488/flappy-bird-pulled-because-it-became-addictive"><em>Flappy Bird</em> website</a> that indicate there may be such a component in the game’s launch. One page that seems to have been removed (and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240912185616/https://flappybird.org/web3-1/">archived here</a>) said <em>Flappy Bird</em> will “fly higher than ever on Solana as it soars into web 3.0,” and invited players to “build, create, play and stake to own.”</p><p>For now, <em>Flappy Bird</em> is listed as coming soon for iOS and Android. Just don’t expect it to be the <em>Flappy Bird</em> you knew — that, it seems, remains as gone as ever.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I recognize this isn’t indicative of much beyond my sentimentality, but I thought it was a crucial tidbit to underscore something else, something important about PlayStation’s excellent new platformer. It really <em>is</em>, more than anything else,<em> </em>a celebration of the consoles and games that shaped me, and likely many of you, too. It is so completely possessed with joy and teeming with the life of everything that PlayStation has meant to people over the years. It is also a brilliant platformer in its own right, stuffed full of ideas that make it seem like Asobi Team is just getting started in this utterly endearing franchise. For all its charms and wonders, however, there’s also a slightly melancholy feeling that <em>Astro Bot</em>, which secondarily serves as a kind of museum of PlayStation’s history, is putting that legacy and the spirit of innovation that defined it under glass to be gazed upon and appreciated as a relic of yesterday, rather than to infuse and electrify the games of today and tomorrow. — Moises Taveras</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="16c1e2c3bf5a396b2f6341e2f187c480" data-recommend-id="image://16c1e2c3bf5a396b2f6341e2f187c480" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->PlayStation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="16c1e2c3bf5a396b2f6341e2f187c480" data-recommend-id="image://16c1e2c3bf5a396b2f6341e2f187c480" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Remember when we all played <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/in-the-console-wars-astros-playroom-is-extraordinarily-1845761531&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/in-the-console-wars-astros-playroom-is-extraordinarily-1845761531"><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></a></span><em>, </em>which came pre-installed on every PlayStation 5<em>,</em> and enjoyed a collective nostalgia trip through Sony’s video game history, coupled with a great deal of hope for the future of our shiny new consoles? The platformer pays tribute to PlayStation’s past with cute little robot cameos representing nearly every video game hero from every era remotely associated with the brand. It was more or less a guided tour through the legacy of one of the big three, and after the PS4 solidified Sony as top dog in the console landscape, I was certainly in the mood to look back at how we got here when the PS5 launched in 2020.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> has reportedly earned Blizzard around $150 million from in-game microtransactions since it released in June 2023.</p>
<p>That's according to senior product manager, Harrison Froeschke, who stated in a since-nuked <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrison-froeschke/">LinkedIn account</a> that they had led the "monetisation strategy of the store cosmetics, pricing, bundle offers, personalised discounts, and roadmap planning which have driven over $150m [microtransaction] lifetime revenue".</p>

<p>Froeschke's LinkedIn account has now been removed from public view, but not before <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/blizzard-reveals-how-much-money-players-spent-on-microtransaction/z1726b">Game Pressure</a> managed to snap a screenshot purportedly taken from Froeschke's account, which also alleges the product manager has overseen game sales "resulting in over $1bn total lifetime revenue".</p>
<p>The numbers help us contextualise not only Diablo 4's success - Blizzard itself confirmed Diablo 4 had generated <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230612864402/en/Diablo%C2%AE-IV-Crosses-666-Mi%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dn-Five-Days-of-Launch-Setting-New-Blizzard-All-Time-Record">$666m in just five days</a> - but also the commercial impact of making the game available for no additional cost to Xbox Game Pass subscribers.</p>
<p>Back in July, of course, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">sweeping changes to Xbox Game Pass</a> that would see day-one releases being removed as a benefit to subscribers of the service's revised basic tier, including Diablo 4.</p>
<p>That new tier - known as Game Pass Standard - is now live, but it turns out subscribers are missing out on more than just new releases: Microsoft has pulled access to over 40 previously available games, including major titles like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review">Hellblade 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what%E2%80%99s-the-deal-with-water-in-the-forever-winter.981441/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/whats-water-the-forever-winter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following a recent beta, in which a few content creators and players from the game’s Discord were able to test out a recent build of the game, a new mechanic came to light: Water. In the game, water proves vital. It’s a crucial resource you must collect in the wasteland to attract merchants and mercenaries to your base. But there’s cause for concern. Your water depletes. When it does, say goodbye to your progress. Here’s what you should know about water in The Forever Winter!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-water-work-in-the-forever-winter">How Does Water Work in The Forever Winter?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, alongside the loot you’ll find in the world to earn money, <strong>you’ll collect water from the wasteland to help sustain your home. As you bring back water, it collects in a reservoir, attracting merchants and mercenaries.</strong> The former will sell you better equipment, like rigs and weapons. If you choose to play the game solo, the latter will journey into the raid with you, fighting by your side as an AI companion. </p>



<p>But there’s a catch, unfortunately. <strong>Your water depletes over time</strong>. It’s not a problem if you’re actively playing the game, but it also depletes in<strong> real time </strong>when you’re not playing. If you take a break from The Forever Winter to check out another game, you’ll return to find your water completely gone. If your water is gone, then the merchants and mercenaries leave.</p>



<p>But even worse is, <strong>if your water depletes completely, you’ll lose your entire stash</strong>. All of the equipment and items you’ve looted are gone!</p>



<p>According to developer Fun Dog Studios, the goal is for players to “<strong>feel anxiety</strong>,” even when not playing the game.</p>



<p>With all that said, the mechanic is supposedly quite forgiving time-wise. <strong>Your reservoir is said to hold a month’s worth of water</strong>, which you can fill in a few raids. If you hop in on the weekends to play, you should be okay.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-the-devs-change-how-water-works">Will the Devs Change How Water Works?</h2>



<p>As of right now, no, they won’t. When criticized for the mechanic by playtesters and fans in the Discord, they doubled down and confirmed that they might change how much water you loot in-raid, but they won’t change the overall mechanic. It’s a core game component; they want you to play frequently or lose everything. </p>



<p>What do you think of the water mechanic in The Forever Winter? Is it too much, or is the one-month reservoir enough? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official forums</a>!</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s almost time to hop in-game. Here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-you-play-the-forever-winter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when you can play The Forever Winter</a> on PC!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24243908/shogun-showdown-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shogun Showdown</em> sometimes breaks my brain. The new deckbuilding roguelike is all about tactics, and a key part of the game is that you can always see what the enemies plan to do next. Every once in a while, that gets me in a quandary where I know I’ll lose. But when things click into place and I clear everyone out in one fell swoop, I feel like a strategic genius.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the game, which <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2084000%2FShogun_Showdown%2F">just left early access</a>, you’re constantly trying to position your character across a small level to either attack your foes or dodge their moves. As you play, you can upgrade your “tiles” (think: cards) to improve their damage, add perks like freezing ice, or lower their cooldown so that you can use them more frequently. You’re also able to stack up to three tiles so that, with one press of the attack button, you send off a salvo of moves to take out a bunch of bad guys at once.</p><div><figcaption><em>Since you can see everyone’s moves, there’s usually a lot of options to mull through.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Goblinz Publishing</cite></p></div><p>Since you can see what the enemies will do, you’re constantly strategizing about whether to move in to strike or if you need to back off to stay alive. It can get complex, and sometimes it feels like I have to galaxy brain each move to survive difficult rounds. The strategizing is all worth it when you pull off a series of attacks that clear the battlefield.</p><p>Here’s an example of how it comes together. Playing as the starter character, called the Wanderer, I start with a pair of swords that can simultaneously hit the spaces to my left and right as well as an arrow that can fire across the level. With some strategic maneuvering, I can set up the Wanderer so that she strikes a baddie that’s behind her and then shoots an arrow in front of her to eliminate all the dangers on the map.</p><p>During each run, you’ll have opportunities to improve your tiles, pick up new ones, and shop for upgrades. Sure, those are all familiar roguelike trappings, but with a little planning, you can make some extraordinarily powerful tiles. For my first winning run, I upgraded an arrow tile so it had high damage and no cooldown, meaning I was firing off arrows without breaking a sweat.</p><div><figcaption><em>Upgrades galore!</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Goblinz Publishing</cite></p></div><p>As you play, you’ll also collect skulls that can be used to unlock things like new tiles and more things to buy at item shops. Spending those skulls quickly adds variety to each run, and I don’t think I’ve doubled up on a build yet. Once, I went all in on a dragon punch move that sent enemies flying into each other, and while it didn’t get me a win, I loved punching bad guys across levels to open up space.</p><p>I’m still early in the game, and I’ve only unlocked one of four additional characters, so there’s still a lot for me to see. As you clear runs, you can also play through harder “days” with added challenges like tougher enemies or fewer item drops.</p><p>Even though I’m working through bigger games like <em>Astro Bot</em> and a long-in-the-works <em>Mass Effect</em> trilogy playthrough, I keep coming back to <em>Shogun Showdown</em>; it’s just too much fun to experiment with the game’s many weapons and strategies. Maybe it’s time for me to try that dragon punch build again — or stumble into something completely unexpected.</p><p><small>Shogun Showdown<em> is available now on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox</em>.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
