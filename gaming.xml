			<p>Since the previous sales milestone for Persona in March 2024, the series has gone on to sell a whopping 23.5 million copies across the globe, with the sales including both physical and digital. In March, it was reported that the Persona series had sold 22.6 million copies. This was announced shortly after the release of Persona 3 Reload, which sold more than one million copies in less than a week. The Persona series is continuing to expand and become more popular, as it was once considered a niche series. However, as announced in <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/en/ir/library/printing_annual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sega's Annual Integrated Report</a> for 2024, the report now includes the updated cumulative sales for the most notable IPs for Sega. This, of course, included Persona.</p>
<p>In this report, Sega says that the fast sales growth for both the Persona and Like a Dragon franchise can be attributed to the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-annual-franchise/">the games</a> were released on multiple platforms, as well as simultaneous worldwide releases. Not only that but remasters and spin-off titles have helped the franchises exponentially. This doesn't come as much of a surprise, as for most gamers, Persona 5 and the other Persona 5 spin-offs really helped bring the franchise to the forefront and introduced people to the series as a whole.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the Persona 5 series alone sold over 10 million copies worldwide. Again, this is a statement that doesn't come as much of a surprise, especially considering how many games are in the Persona 5 series alone. In total, there are five titles in the Persona 5 series, with another game called Persona 5: The Phantom X due to be released in the near future. The Open Beta for this title began in April 2024, but there haven't been too many updates since then. Compared to the other games in the Persona 5 franchise, this one won't be as much of a mainstay as others, as only some of the original staff from the first Persona 5 game are working on this game, and it's marketed as a gacha game for the most part.</p>
<p>This year also saw the release of Persona 3 Reload, and then ATLUS branched out and created Metaphor: ReFantazio, which is a game that has a similar art style to that of Persona and has also done significantly well. Whether we'll see remakes of the original Persona games that started off the franchise remains to be seen, as we've seen some of the older games get ported to other platforms, like Persona 4 Golden, which was released last year.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks like this franchise is going to continue to be massively successful for Sega and Atlus.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-generation-zero-update-last</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-generation-zero-update-will-be-its-last.1028046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-generation-zero-update-last<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Systemic Reaction has announced that the next major&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero&nbsp;</em>update will serve as the game's final major content drop.</p>

<p>The Showdown Update currently doesn't have a release date, but Systemic Reaction describes it as&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero</em>'s "last hurrah", promising that it will conclude the story arc that's been running throughout the game's "main missions and in-game lore".</p>

<p>The update will take you to "a new area that you haven't been to before", and Systemic Reaction is promising that while it's not quite as big as some of the game's other areas, it will give the studio "the space needed to tell the last part of our story".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/generation-zero-update-last-screens.jpg?itok=oz6nXfUl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/generation-zero-update-last-screens.jpg?itok=rqFjR_KA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This mysterious teaser image is pretty much all we know about the Showdown Update right now.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've not yet gathered all of&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero</em>'s Soviet Nesting Dolls collectibles and you haven't caught up on "the attached lore" yet, Systemic Reaction recommends you do so prior to the Showdown Update's arrival.</p>

<p>As well as the story coming to a head, Systemic Reaction is also promising that the update will add new Experimental weapons, and it'll also remove the skill point cap, allowing you to "unlock all skill upgrades and complete the endgame experience".</p>

<p>New cosmetics are also on the way, as well as a host of quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes that are the bread and butter of any self-respecting game update.</p>

<p>Although you won't need&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero</em>'s&nbsp;<em>FNIX Rising&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alpine Unrest&nbsp;</em>expansions to enjoy the Showdown Update, Systemic Reaction does recommend them for "more context".</p>

<p>The game launched in 2019 and received numerous updates over the course of its life, adding features like a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/open-world-shooter-generation-zero-is-getting-photo-mode-next-week">photo mode</a>, destructible <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/generation-zero-update-lets-you-storm-fully-destructible-bases">bases</a>, and even a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/generation-zero-companion-update">cute little robot friend</a> to keep you company on your travels.</p>

<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/704270/Generation_Zero/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/generation-zero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/generation-zero/C20WW4W29FQ1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and it's also playable on current-gen consoles through backwards compatibility. The game will remain online, so even though it won't be getting more updates, it'll still be playable.</p>

            <p>The trailer for Bambas! starts off innocently enough. It's an "innovative urban walking simulator" in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller's analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them. </p>

<p>The final 30 seconds of the trailer are an appalling display of sneakers kicking cars to death, flip-flops stamping on defenceless sandcastles, and stilettos flagrantly holding up traffic at zebra crossings. It's just as well the video is only a minute long, because the escalation curve is clear. If this were a four minute gameplay overview, the last third would consist of shoes vindictively toeing the Declaration Of Independence, or nudging lost kittens into jet engines.</p>
<p>Bambas! - yes, the exclamation mark is part of the title - is the work of Villena, Spain-based Devilish Games, who say it isn't just a game but "a tribute to urban culture". You can find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3274390/Bambas/">Steam</a>. Come release day in 2025, the game will "break stereotypes with its non-linear narrative and environmental storytelling, where stories unfold around every corner". You will "discover hidden spots that hold secrets and characters that will lead you down unexpected paths".</p><p>The game's setting is "a vibrant, detailed Mediterranean coastal city where creativity rules and exploration is your passport to fun", a place of Jet Set Radio-ish abandon where "you'll need to navigate crosswalks, kick cans, balance on curbs, and pull off impossible jumps to complete hundreds of challenges". It all looks and sounds very jolly - far from the Qwoppy puzzler I was half-expecting from the press release, and more in keeping with the mayhem of Untitled Goose Game.</p>
<p>Complete those challenges, and you'll unlock "countless" shoes. I've never been a shoe collector, myself - I've never had the budget for it, but also, I don't have the imagination. Any shoes I own are doomed to be worn everyday from dawn till dusk until they lose all form and colour and become muddy teatowels, wrapped around my feet.</p>
<p>It occurs to me, after watching the trailer for Bambas!, that my shoes might resent this treatment, and wish to be free of me. I am looking at my current trainers as I type this, and wondering what they'd do if I were... out of the picture. Readers, I am telling you this because I fear to utter the words aloud: <em>it is possible that my shoes are conspiring against me</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to the latest announcement by Binding of Isaac creator <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Edmund McMillen</a>, the title will receive a full online co-op mode, including completion markers for its 10th-anniversary update. The online co-op mode is scheduled to arrive on November 18, 2024. The game will also receive a ‘considerable balance update’, which will look towards buffing items the community has found to be “lacklustre/bad”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binding of Isaac is celebrating its 10th anniversary with a massive 50% discount on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and discounts on all DLCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edmund McMillen and Nicalis, Inc. developed Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, which was released in 2014. It is an action RPG shooter with a heavy focus on rogue-like elements. Players follow Isaac’s journey as he battles gangs of deranged enemies, lost brothers and sisters, fears, and eventually his mother.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game features shooter gameplay in randomly generated environments. As Isaac, players will find mysterious treasures that provide the character with superhuman abilities and other skills to conquer more difficult enemies and explore unreachable areas. Rebirth is a remake of the original title with a new game engine, all-new hand-drawn pixel-style artwork, highly polished visual effects, an all-new soundtrack and more.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> From the Rift is the upcoming season of the battle-royale and it launches on Tuesday 5th November - yes, you read that right, it's out today! So, you really don't have long to wait to get your hands on the new and revamped Lifeline, Launch Royale, plus all the other goodies being added to round off 2024.</p>
<p>As recently announced on <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1853784986689622333">Apex Legends official X account</a>, this season will be home to Launch Royale - a brand new mode that lets you turn back time and set foot in the very beginning of Apex Legends, with the original Legends and weapons on offer to give you the original Apex experience.</p>
<p>That's just the first of many things to look forward to this season - up next is the remixed and revived Lifeline. The combat medic not only has a very literal new look with a robotic arm (with currently unknown origins), but all of her abilities are now different, too - redesigned to give better reset opportunities for any squad that contains her.</p>
<p>Lifeline's Passive still contains combat revive but it's been expanded, so now she can also grab onto D.O.C and glide mid-air for a short period of time until fuel runs out. You can let go of and grab D.O.C as much as you want during gliding, as long as there's fuel - which replenishes the moment you touch the ground. Weapons cannot be drawn while gliding, however.</p><p>D.O.C is still Lifeline's Tactical but the little drone now has more mobility. Instead of hovering in place, he'll now follow an ally he's assigned to while healing them and any allies in the surrounding area. Lifeline can call him back to her or reassign D.O.C to another teammate at any time.</p>
<p>Now, onto the biggest change, Lifeline's Ultimate says goodbye to the Care Package! In its place will now be D.O.C's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a>, a ring-shaped shield that's impervious to damage. Lifeline's squad can enter and exit the shield as they like, but there's no strafing if the ring is deployed inside a building or outside - it's the same wherever it's deployed. However, the halo is stationary and without a roof there's a vulnerability to attacks from above so watch your back.</p>

<p>Lifeline isn't the only Legend getting some love in Season 23. Gibraltar is getting a massive cooldown reduction on his dome from 30 seconds to just 17 seconds alongside two other upgrades. Newcastle's mobile shield will no longer take damage and it can now be controlled while downed, as well as Wattson being able to tap into the revive expert perk as a chooseable upgrade. At a recent press event, it was also teased that Loba and Mirage will see big changes this season but, at the time of writing, these are still to be revealed.</p><p>All Support class legends are seeing some boosts this season too, with class perks to help them excel in revival and recovery. Supports won't be slowed down while healing and small meds will heal double the normal amount. Also, this class will be able to revive allies 25 percent faster than before, with health regen granted to revived players and mobile spawn beacons in teammate's death boxes as well as at crafting beacons. To counter all that, Supports no longer have the unique ability to craft squad banners.</p>
<p>On the subject of Legends, the Apex Legends team has made clear it's aware of the issues with Crypto and his Off The Grid ability, but has assured there are changes coming to fix these issues at the start of the season and Off The Grid will be staying for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Now, let's move on to the new loot type being added in From the Rift - Rift Relics. These are new and exceptional pieces of loot - and something to look out for. When lightning strikes the ground from cosmic rifts in the skies above, you should follow the beam of light to find new high-level loot. These loot items are different from anything else found on the ground across the maps in terms of sheer power and functionality, and there's even some items that will be familiar to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> fans. One such item is the EPG-1, marked as possibly the biggest and most powerful Rift Relic Weapon.</p>

</figure>
<p>There's a new category of item being added as part of this, called Boost Kits. These add passive or active abilities to your Legend when you find them. For example, The Hover Boost Kit will let you hover in the air while aiming.</p><p>We've learned there are more than 25 Rift Reflics available in the loot pool, which will be added gradually across the season. Getting your hands on any of these relics can dramatically turn the tables of who is winning in a match - so it's worth battling it out to find them before someone else does. These new and intriguing loot items will be available across PUBS, as well as the limited-time Trios Revival and Straightshot Revival modes this season.</p>

<p>Weapon update time, and first of all the HAVOC is going into the care package with the Select Fire Beamshot attached. As one goes in, another comes out so the Devotion is returning to the floor without the Turbo Charge but it has received multiple baseline buffs to compensate. The Sentinel and Rampage have had their charge capacity increased, the Longbow and Spitfire have had damage buffs, as well as the L-Star now dealing extra damage with the P2020 Akimbos getting a hip fire accuracy increase.</p>
<p>A new universal melee weapon has been added, the Karambit. Also called Raptor's Claw, its design and animations won't be the same for each Legend. Every character will have their personalities reflected by this weapon if they use it and it will be available at the launch of From the Rift.</p>

<p>Ranked has had some tweaks that are said to be laying the foundations for bigger updates coming in the future. A new visualisation tool will be introduced in ranked lobbies so you can see the distribution of ranks in the one you're in. It's a bar at the bottom of the screen that shows you what rank players are in the lobby and how many of that rank are. There is a plan to add this mechanic to other modes in future seasons.</p><p>The entry cost for platinum, diamond and master ranks will be reduced and new ranked rewards are actively being worked on to replace the removed dive trail rewards, but it's worth knowing they're likely coming in the near future instead of this season.</p>
<p>Apex Legends' team told us that working on anti-cheat is its top priority. The developer is working hard behind the scenes to continuously improve anti-cheat and working with more anti-cheat tools to ensure that the matches remain fair in such a competitive game.</p>
<p>Apex Legends From the Rift will launch on Tuesday 5th November 2024 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.</p>

			<p>With Grand Theft Auto VI, Rockstar Games has raised the bar again in terms of realism and NPC behavior while offering players more freedom than before, according to a former developer of the game.</p>
<p>Speaking With <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GTAVI-oclock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTAVIoclock</a>, former game designer at Rockstar Games, commented on the next entry in the open-world series launching next year, saying that the developer has raised the bar again in terms of realism and NPC behavior, which will blow everyone away and will be talked about many years after launch. The former developer also talked about mission design, saying that it will be what makes the game good, granting players freedom. As for the current state of the game, Grand Theft Auto VI is in the bug-fixing phase, so hopefully, it won't take much longer to see more of it.</p>

<p>It has been almost a year since we last saw Grand Theft Auto VI, thanks to its official announcement trailer, which provided a very quick look at the two protagonists and the state of Leonida, where Vice City is located. Since then, Rockstar Games has been pretty silent about the game, leaving plenty of room for rumors and speculation regarding its precise release date, which hasn't slipped to 2026 as of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">September</a>, leaving fans plenty of time to put together documents going over everything that is currently known about what will be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time, according to analysts.</a></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is in development for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It will be released sometime next year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-gets-new-creative-director-for-future-updates.1027995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-new-creative-director<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced that&nbsp;it has appointed a new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>creative director, and he'll be helming what will be the game's biggest update yet.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>website, Drew Rechner will be stepping up to the plate as the game's new creative director. Whether previous directors Julian Gerighty and Mathias Karlson will still be playing a role in the game's ongoing development remains to be seen.</p>

<p>In the blog post, Rechner says he's identified "three key areas" in which he and the team would like to improve&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, namely combat, stealth, and character control.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-new-combat.jpg?itok=G116zB68 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-new-combat.jpg?itok=YZ6CPU3O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft still wants to improve&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>across the board, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to combat, Rechner says the studio is looking to add "more depth and excitement to the experience" in order to further reward players' "tactics and precision".</p>

<p>When it comes to stealth, the plan is to improve the "readability and consistency of enemy detection" and to provide more "choice" in how you want to approach encounters.</p>

<p>Finally, character control improvements will apparently involve "improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls".</p>

<p>These are areas in which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-update-112">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>updates have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-update-130-stealth-speeder">sought to make improvements</a> as well, particularly in the case of stealth, but Rechner says the forthcoming update 1.4 will be&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' "biggest yet" when it lands on November 21st.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, it's an open-world action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft and set, believe it or not, in the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>You play scoundrel Kay Vess, who must wheel and deal her way through the underworld's crime syndicates as she plans the heist of a lifetime. The game mixes shooter-style combat, stealth, and open-world exploration.</p>

<p>Despite the popularity of its IP,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">underperformed for Ubisoft financially</a>, leading to the company rethinking some of its strategies; Ubisoft games will be released on Steam on day one from now on, and the company is also dropping the season pass model for future releases.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also coming to Steam on November 21st, the same day the next update arrives.

October was when it announced the original Switch, before launching it the following spring. But with no further news on the next console, despite plenty of other Nintendo announcements, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-mario-screen-specs-features-1851653104&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-mario-screen-specs-features-1851653104">a look at the Switch 2</a></span> before the end of 2024 is looking less likely. </p><p> “Making an announcement this year has gotten quite difficult,” Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Reuters</em></a></span>. “You would not want to divert attention to an upcoming console in the middle of the critical year-end shopping season.”</p><p>Indeed, Nintendo is already losing ground on this year’s ambitious sales plan for the nearly eight-year-old Switch. The company previously aimed to sell <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-limited-edition-zelda-echoes-sales-1851611733&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-limited-edition-zelda-echoes-sales-1851611733">13.5 million consoles in 2024</a></span>.

Nintendo’s only sold 4.72 million Switch consoles year-to-date. </p><p>Despite a steady stream of smaller, mid-sized games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and ports like <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, the original Switch is clearly running out of gas. Outside of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, Nintendo seems to be holding the next round of upcoming heavy-hitters until the Switch 2 is out, and who knows when that will be.<br></p><p>At this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if the company holds its big reveal showcase until the standard February Nintendo Direct. Diehard fans just need to hang on for a bit longer. A surprise release of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> in January might help with that.  After all, that’s when the first <em>Pokémon Legends</em> game hit. </p><p> .</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You see, I take them far too seriously and, not to toot my own horn, I’m good. I routinely top the leaderboard for kills and objectives. So, after growing up reading and watching <em>Starship Troopers</em>, the basic concept of slaughtering bugs on xeno planets across the galaxy—specifically in a horde shooter setting—immediately caught my attention the day the Early Access began. Like thousands of players since its EA launch, <em>Starship Troopers: Extermination</em> kept me playing through countless updates until we finally hit 1.0 in October, 2024. With new players refilling the ranks, it’s time to reflect on the experience and see how it fares on Steam.</p><p>While I’m enamored with the game and its genre, not everyone feels the same way. As of writing, despite <em>overall</em> positive reviews, <em>Starship Troopers: Extermination</em> sits at ‘Mixed’ on Steam. Many players take issue with the game’s performance following full release. They say it feels like an Early Access title, full of bugs, glitches, and stuttering performance issues that ruin the experience. That’s not to mention the long queue times and crashes-to-desktop frequently plaguing the matchmaking experience.</p><p>All that said, look at many of the game’s positive reviews. While you’ll find the usual, “The only good bug is a dead bug,” type of reviews, mimicking lines from the film, most come from genuine fans—some of which have hundreds or thousands of hours of game time. They tout the class variety, PvE gameplay, co-op experience within the community, and the hordes of bugs you can slaughter atop the walls of a FOB. It’s an experience unlike most others.</p><p>Whether you’re on the fence, or seeking validation about your current favorite first-person shooter, here’s a look at <em>Starship Troopers: Extermination</em>, as told by Steam reviews.</p><figure id="" data-id="f6ace86d3e595c69b8d525224f141dcb" data-recommend-id="image://f6ace86d3e595c69b8d525224f141dcb" data-format="png"

<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out and it’s been a <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17037/dragon-age-the-veilguard">well received game overall</a>. It’s launch 10 years after the last mainline Dragon Age game has had people wondering if the original games could get the remaster treatment. </p>



<p>While Creative Director John Epler would like it to happen, he doesn’t see it likely. In an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a> around the game’s launch, Epler was asked about seeing the first three games remastered in some way. </p>



<p>“I think I’m one of about maybe 20 people left at BioWare who’s actually used Eclipse,” Epler told the outlet. “It’s something that’s not going to be as easy as Mass Effect, but we do love the original games. Never say never, I guess that’s what it comes down to.”</p>



<p>While he does say “never say never”, the technology of the original games could prove a sticking point. The first two Dragon Age games from 2009 and 2011 were built with the custom Eclipse engine. The third game, Dragon Age: Inquisition ultimately moved to the Frostbite Engine, making it more likely for a remaster than the others. </p>



<p>Rolling Stone mentioned the Mass Effect games getting remastered. Those games were built on Unreal Engine, making it an easier task to bring forward with newer technology.</p>



<p>If it were to happen, it would almost be a certainty that the first two games would have to be built from scratch in Frostbite, or a different engine.</p>



<p>Do you think the original Dragon Age games get remastered? Let us know below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>If you spend any amount of time online, specifically on X (formerly Twitter), then you know Elon Musk enjoys the sound of his own voice. More specifically, the look of his opinions in text format, as the man tweets constantly. It’s downright amazing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how he has time for anything else besides posting online</a>. Still, in his spare time, he’s quickly risen through the ranks to become a top 20 Diablo 4 player—one of only two in the United States. It’s absolutely shocking and entirely true.</p>



<p>It’s well known that Elon Musk plays video games. It wasn’t long ago that players online tore apart his Elden Ring build, after all, but he appears to favor RPGs with grind involved. In Diablo 4, he’s previously complained about how overpowered Barbarians are, and as a Barb main, please cry about it, Elon. Oh, but he plays a Barbarian primarily. Go figure!</p>



<p>During his appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast, Musk kickstarted the conversation by bragging about becoming one of the top 20 Diablo 4 players in the world. He’s one of only two Americans currently on the list, with the other topping the leaderboards in the number one spot. Currently, Musk sits in 19th.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Now, this ranking revolves around Pit runs. He’s achieved the 19th best timed run through Pit 150, which is an absolutely challenging grind and, honestly, a little impressive.</p>



<p>Instead of playing his usual Barbarian, Musk ranked with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-reveals-new-spiritborn-class/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Spiritborn class</a>, part of the Vessel of Hatred expansion. Furthermore, he’s running a Quill build.</p>



<p>Alongside Diablo 4 and Elden Ring, Musk is also a long-time fan of Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>Do you think Musk managed to hit the leaderboards in Diablo 4 legitimately or not? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p>On the topic of Elon Musk, did you know he’s considered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-stream-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most successful streamers ever</a>? He broke records in a single hour!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/starship-troopers-terminator-warhammer-40000-helldivers-2-creative-director-reveals-his-dream-crossovers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Smash hit co-op shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> seems ripe for a crossover, but which franchises might it partner with? That’s a fun conversation players have been having ever since the game’s explosive launch earlier this year. Now, Helldivers 2’s creative director has had his say, revealing a number of intellectual properties he’d love to work with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1853793032249765932" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Arrowhead CCO and Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt cautioned against doing too many crossovers, saying “it would dilute the IP and make it a ‘not Helldivers’ experience.” However, he also published an extended list of IPs he “really would love to do a take on!”</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Aliens</li><li>Starship Troopers</li><li>Terminator</li><li>Predator</li><li>Star Wars</li><li>Fifth Element</li><li>Blade Runner</li><li>Warhammer 40k</li><li>Trench Crusade</li><li>Mutant Chronicles</li><li>Dropzone Commander</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s easy to see how many of these franchises would work within Helldivers 2. Starship Troopers is the obvious choice, given Helldivers 2 riffs so heavily on the cult classic sci-fi flick. Terminator, too, seems an easy fit, given the Automaton alien enemy are basically Terminators themselves. Aliens, Predator, and Star Wars are fun to think about, but my favorite is Warhammer 40,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It would be amazing to drop down into a planet overrun by Tyranids or Necrons as an Imperial Guard soldier, complete with lore-accurate weapons, vehicles, and, of course, dialogue. Yes, Warhammer 40,000 fans have the wonderful and hugely successful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> to play right now, but that's a Space Marine game. Helldivers 2 is near enough an Imperial Guard game already. I’d drop a dollar or 10 on an Imperial Guard crossover in a heartbeat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which brings us on to the next question: how might Helldivers 2 do crossovers if it ever came to it? In a <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1853793858959634504" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subsequent tweet</a>, Pilestedt suggested it could come in the form of a Warbond (Helldivers 2’s take on a battle pass) or even individual super store items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Having a full Starship Troopers Warbond with mobile infantry armor, voices and weapons would also be cool!” Pilestedt said, before stressing: “Nothing decided yet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-slug-tactics-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Slug Tactics lives up to its stone-cold classic namesake from SNK’s golden era with its painstakingly detailed pixel art, head-bopping soundtrack, and snappy structure. It magnificently translates the run-n-gun series into its first turn-based tactics game, but doesn’t sacrifice substance for cheap nostalgia, either. Aside from a few annoying quality-of-life issues and bugs, Metal Slug Tactics’ excellent retro-inspired shell houses a well-made, distinct, grid-based tactics roguelite that cleverly adapts its frantic roots into a more orderly genre without missing a step. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like pretty much every mainline Metal Slug game (the most recent being 2009’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/13/metal-slug-7-review">Metal Slug 7</a>), Tactics puts you in command of the Peregrine Falcons, an elite fighting force within The Normal Army. This spin-off takes full advantage of Metal Slug’s legions of varied enemy types, distinct locations, expansive arsenal, and fleet of awesome vehicles. Sprinkle in clever spins on series mainstays, like rescuing hostages to add some extra objectives on the battlefield, and it’s not hard to see why this seeming left turn was a logical next step.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metal Slug Tactics Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before starting out on a run, you’ll have to pick three out of this surprisingly diverse cast of nine characters. Every character has four different unlockable loadouts, with each one catering to a slightly different approach. Marco is an all-arounder whose status as leader means lots of his abilities focus on teamwork in both offensive and defensive scenarios, but one of his loadouts lasers in on ranged moves to help maximize the amount of Synchronized attacks he can execute with his teammates in one turn. Alternatively, Trevor is a glass cannon who exposes his targets to death by a million cuts with movement and offensive-focused tactics, but one of his unlockable loadouts ditches ranged versatility to double down on close combat. Meanwhile, Fio is a support character with a ton of helpful mobility tools that make her a reliable ally for setting up all sorts of flashy combos who can also become a self-healing tank.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This system helped me build my teams around specific goals. One time, I put Fio, Trevor, and a trap-based specialist named Nadia on the same team and picked loadouts that let me exert greater control over the map, allowing me to chase a defensive strategy that revolved around lining up my targets and satisfyingly knocking them all down in one fell swoop.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Tactics squeezes every inch of your screen for all the charm it can display.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Calling Metal Slug’s unified fighting force “The Normal Army” isn’t Shakespeare, to say the least — nor should it be. The premise and plot serve the “rule of cool,” a master that demands dieselpunk machines, chunky guns, tons of explosions, and bad guys that feel ripped from an ‘80s action movie and usually make no sense. Metal Slug Tactics knocks this out of the park thanks to its art style, which squeezes every inch of your screen for all the charm and character it can possibly display. Tanks and battleships chug and buckle under the sheer force of their destructive horsepower, explosions crash onto the grid with a satisfying flourish, and your characters are never still, even when they’re hiding behind cover. To say Metal Slug Tactics “oozes personality” would be a disservice; it spurts out of every pixel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Subtle touches that nail Metal Slug’s fun, cartoonish vibes are peppered all over its screens. If you look to the sidelines of a map, you might find soldiers sunbathing just off a desert battlefield or notice the video game Peregrine Falcon member Ralf is playing on a tiny TV in the barracks, which is so well-animated you can tell exactly which 2D fighter he’s playing. This attention to detail is so consistent that I’m still finding new stuff to chuckle at in between turns every time I try a roughly 45-minute run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another stellar soundtrack from composer Tee Lopes, whose work on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review">Sonic Mania</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-review">TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/streets-of-rage-4-review">Streets of Rage 4</a>, has codified him as the king of retro revitalization by way of bumping drum and bass backing wailing guitars. It’s a delight to just jam out and pick up on all the small flourishes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you think of turn and grid-based tactics games, you might think of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review">XCOM</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-tactics-review">Gears Tactics</a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-review">Mario + Rabbids</a>’ lengthy encounters that can last for dozens of in-depth turns. Instead, Metal Slug Tactics sacrifices some of the satisfaction you might get from carefully weaving a web to catch unsuspecting prey over multiple turns for smaller engagements that condense and speed up that same satisfying process. Tactics draws a lot of water from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/27/into-the-breach-review">Into The Breach’s</a> well; most battles take place on a much tighter grid, with attack and movement range scaled down to match. This keeps the turnover rate between levels pretty quick, no matter the objective, ensuring things stay fresh from battle to battle. Still, it does a good job of differentiating itself from the genre-defining 2018 classic thanks to its slightly more expansive battlefields, lower difficulty, and movement-focused mechanics.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It draws a lot of water from Into The Breach’s well, but still does a good job of differentiating itself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The goals of each fight here are fun but standard stuff you’d find in just about any tactics game, including the usual eliminating all or some of the enemies on the field, taking out an enemy convoy, protecting civilians, surviving a certain amount of turns, reaching a checkpoint on the map, or escorting an NPC to a certain point. Most of these will still only last about three to five turns and net you some helpful loot to beef up one of your three characters’ attack power, buy a new upgrade in a shop, or get reinforcements that can be used to revive a downed teammate. Secondary objectives reward and encourage skilled play with compelling extra challenges, like missions that task you with taking minimal damage, setting up your squad to chase assists with each other, or completing a level within a certain number of turns to earn bonus loot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Slug Tactics matches the standard run-based structure of your garden-variety roguelite by offering semi-randomized runs, each divided into four stages that end with a big boss fight. You can opt into taking on just one of the three starting stage options, or pursue all of them before venturing into a final fourth area. Each of these stages will subtly scale its challenge with sightly stronger enemy types depending on which level you took on before, ensuring a consistent sense of progress no matter where you start, but the maps and pace of each of these four regions remains the same. A banner at the top of the screen even constantly reminds you that there are only “X Missions Remaining Until The Boss Arrives.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is where Tactics feels more like an arcade game more than a roguelite. Although there are secret bosses and optional extra objectives to chase, it doesn’t give you any tools to break the rules. There aren’t any opportunities to, say, take on the remaining handful of missions left on the map of any given section for higher risk with the promise of a better reward. When a boss does crash onto the Super Mario Bros. 3-like overworld map, you have no choice but to engage, which is frustrating. I wish Tactics offered some extra challenge or special conditions to meet that allowed me to complete the area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each boss fight does a good job of testing your mastery over Tactics’ movement and teamwork-heavy mechanics. The first boss, for example, has you fighting against a battleship that can barely fit all the guns it has on its deck. It targets your squad with homing missiles, tasking you with getting endangered units to cover while making sure they build up enough Adrenaline to avoid taking damage. Every few turns, the ship will also shoot down one of the platforms your squad is using to target them, forcing you to make sure your team is able to rotate from platform to platform while also dishing out damage from sufficient cover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adrenaline and Synchronization, which are Metal Slug Tactics’ shining mechanical innovations, help to justify its smaller scale. The Falcons can accumulate Adrenaline by moving, earning bonuses for jumping between elevations and clearing small gaps. This versatile resource powers a character’s ability to dodge incoming attacks and use special abilities. Linking these two crucial tools for success on the battlefield doesn’t just make for a challenging and rewarding push-and-pull between defense and offense, it also forces you to keep your party in motion. This brilliantly translates the series’ run-n-gun roots into… well, running and gunning, just within the context of a turn-based tactics game. Even characters like the heavy Ralf, who might be slower or tankier in other tactics games, are highly mobile, with limitations placed on their attack range or ability set rather than their range of motion. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sync attacks double down on the satisfaction of lining up a Rube Goldberg machine of bullets.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This meshes exceptionally well with the Synchronization mechanic, which helps Tactics take advantage of its relatively short skirmishes. Whenever one character attacks an enemy or destructible part of the level, other characters within range automatically join in. Lining up the optimal Rube Goldberg machine of bullets and explosions has always been my favorite part of tactics games, and this mechanic doubles down on that satisfaction, with the only limit on sync attacks being placed on Tactics’ boss characters, as they can only be targeted with a sync attack once per turn. Thankfully, each team member can still attack them one at a time without the extra teamwork. Most Adrenaline-fueled special abilities tie into a specific character’s strengths and weaknesses in a way that underlines Tactics’ surprisingly diverse nine-character cast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, a few annoying bugs in Metal Slug Tactics sometimes blocked me from executing my master plan. One bug I ran into when Ralf was turned into a mummy, which is supposed to temporarily alter your soldiers’ abilities, prevented him from using normal attacks even after transforming back into his regular self. Resetting the turn normally flushes out anything gumming up the works, but that didn’t help here, and I was forced to take my turn hoping the problem would pass after he got behind some cover. Thankfully it did, but I’ve infrequently run into a few issues like that here and there, which hasn’t a huge deal but can be pain all the same. Mercifully, it’s easy enough to work around most problems since Tactics is constantly creating save states after every move, and quitting to the main menu and hopping back into the fray is helpful without being too time-consuming.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">From its lively, cartoonish sprites to its energetic soundtrack, Metal Slug Tactics is a meticulously crafted ode to the arcade classic that never gets lost blindly chasing its adoration for the series without understanding what makes Metal Slug great. Instead, it introduces a handful of distinct innovations to the tactics genre that masterfully meld Metal Slug’s action-packed platforming and shooting onto a tactics grid. Even though it’s hampered by some frustrating bugs, I’m still having plenty of fun with each run as I experiment with new strategies and team compositions.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some are eager for machine learning-based tools that help solve complex problems, others are tired of being told AI will replace workers or make their lives easier (when it might just make more work).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A wrinkle with the rollout of generative AI tools is the transparency (or lack thereof) of when a game or game asset was made using AI. Hiding this fact can create surprises in the hiring process or publishing side if an asset unexpectedly appears in a game. It can also create difficulties when purchasing 3D assets off of stores like Fab. It's become common knowledge that developers can spot AI-generated 2D art by "looking at the fingers" (or other common cues), but how do you do the same for 3D models?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If modelers making 3D assets with generative AI were required to tag their models as AI-made, it would be easy. But on Fab, they aren't.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over on Bluesky, veteran 3D artist Liz Edwards answered that question. In a short thread, she broke down common traits in AI-generated 3D models—and how those traits often make said models inferior for general game development usage. She was kind enough to allow Game Developer to recreate her insights to help you learn how to spot the work of machines.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/stellaris-new-ai-characters-are-powered-by-ai-voices" target="_self">Stellaris' new AI characters are powered by AI voices</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Bad textures and jumbled UVs">Bad textures and jumbled UVs</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Edwards began by scrutinizing a 3D model of a penguin model she spotted on Fab, which at a first glance, may not seem that odd. Veteran developers may look closer and notice some oddities like the shape of the feet and weird lines on the stomach, but Edwards called out deeper flaws.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The model, she wrote, has "telltale signs" of AI generation. 3D generated models made by AI usually have baked-in lighting, she explained, and the textures are projected from a 2D image. Artifacts from that 2D image remain on the skin.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image by Liz Edwards via Bluesky</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Edwards accessed the model and looked at the wireframe and UV maps, noting that the wireframe looks like a "dense automesh" and the maps were automatically unwrapped, leaving a "jumbled mess" in their wake.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image by Liz Edwards via Bluesky</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/lizaledwards.bsky.social/post/3l7yfj7j26u2b">compared it</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to another penguin model made by "Pinotoon," which possessed more familiar traits, such as a clean UV layout and better-positioned eyeballs and beak.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Edwards used another example of a strange cabinet hybrid to illustrate a common trait with 3D generated models: an insanely high polygon count. Elsewhere on Bluesky, she's spotlighted how the creators of genAI 3D models will put objects like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/lizaledwards.bsky.social/post/3l7cdlnrowl23">crates</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the Fab marketplace that have 50,000 triangular polygons, where the average crate in a video game only needs 500 triangular polygons at the very upper end.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image by Liz Edwards via Bluesky</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="3D models made with generative AI can create confusion">3D models made with generative AI can create confusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Edwards warned, the traits above alone don't automatically identify a model as being generated by AI tools. For instance, 3D models captured using photogrammetry share the same traits. The difference is that those models have natural textures, are usually free of artifacts, and have coherent, naturalistic details.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image by Liz Edwards via Bluesky</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you aren't animating a given 3D asset or aren't bothered by its polygon count, you might shrug off a model that looks like it was created with photogrammetry—but beware. As Edwards showed, those models can still have incoherent details that look unsettling or inappropriate when viewed up close.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image by Liz Edwards via Bluesky</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She also explained that meshes on generative AI-made 3D models are "rarely" symmetrical, and are often melded together into "featureless blobs." Those "blobs" often weld together feet or arms, on animals, monsters, and humanoids, making it impossible to pose or animate them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image by Liz Edwards via Bluesky</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This problem spotlights a major risk of using models that trade quality for efficacy in creation—if the object looks "good enough" but either has too many polygons or is impossible to animate, an object could interfere with the rest of the work a team needs to make a great game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Know how to spot the machines">Know how to spot the machines</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Should game developers have to make their own </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bladerunner.fandom.com/wiki/Voight-Kampff_test">Voigt-Kampf tests</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to identify if visual art is made by generative AI? For now, that would be a "yes." There all kinds of ways that an art asset made with generative AI might slip into your pipeline, and if it's not caught quick, it could cause problems for a team not ready to catch them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not all generative AI tech is made with deception in mind. But it's been pointed out that a broad usecase for generative AI is to deceive others, especially when using image, text, or video generation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A developer in search of a solid penguin model might waste valuable time trying to get this flawed version to work.

            <p>
Nintendo is now "very unlikely" to reveal its hotly-anticipated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> hardware this year, a games industry analyst has told Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>
This morning's financial results from Nintendo revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-cuts-switch-sales-forecast-as-the-wait-for-new-hardware-continues">larger-than-expected drop in hardware and software sales for the current Switch</a>, as the console ages and its release calendar quietens. 
</p>
<p>
The results also passed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">without even a whiff of Switch 2 being shown</a> - and perhaps, with Nintendo's new hardware not due to arrive until sometime in 2025 - for good reason.

<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer today, industry analyst Serkan Toto, CEO of Japanese game industry consultancy Kantan Games, said any mention of Switch 2 now would only further impede Switch 1 sales during the console's last holiday season.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo is unpredictable, but I do believe a reveal before the end of the year is very unlikely," Toto said. 
</p>
<p>
"Sales of the current model are cratering, more than Nintendo had already anticipated. They would implode even further if a Switch 2 announcement came before the holidays, so why would they do that?
</p>
<p>
"Instead, Nintendo is a lot more likely to wait until early January to show the new device. For 2024, the ship has sailed."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal plans have been the subject of a frenzied rumour mill of gossip and speculation amongst fans of the company and the video game industry at large. Throughout all this, Nintendo has remained silent, busy launching its final slate of Switch 1 games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-nintendo-museum-a-joyful-celebration-of-machines-magic-and-the-art-of-play">opening a museum</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over">releasing a £99 alarm clock</a>.
</p><p>For its part, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo has stated it will unveil Switch 2 before the end of its current financial year</a> - 30th April 2025. Eurogamer understands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">Switch 2 will not launch before that point, either</a> - even if it was revealed on 1st January.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Souls of the Frozen Frontier update follows on from other major content drops like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-melodies-of-mire-update">Melodies of the Mire</a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-enshrouded-update-hollow-halls">Hollow Halls</a>, and it's seemingly on a similar scale, introducing a whole new biome, a new dynamic weather system, and more.</p>

<p>First up, the Albaneve Summits, a "breathtaking new mountain region", are now yours for the exploring. They're packed with "fresh challenges, discoveries, and opportunities", according to Keen Games, so you should have plenty to keep you busy.</p>

The higher you go, the more snow and cold you'll encounter, and you'll need to accommodate that change with food and clothing.</p>

<p>You can also now tame non-hostile animals and take them back to your base, and just in case you're wondering, it is possible to pet non-hostile animals as well. That alone should be reason enough to head back into&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>.</p>

<p>The game's level cap has been increased to 35, and new crafting resources have been added as part of the new biome's appearance, along with new crafting stations and new armor sets.</p>

<p>In short, there's lots to discover as part of the&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>Souls of the Frozen Frontier update. You can read the full list of changes (which, as you'd expect from a large update like this, is extensive) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4461471496628338725" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game which sees you exploring a vast world, gathering resources to craft a base, and venturing into dangerous mist in order to collect powerful rewards from dangerous enemies.</p>

<p>The game is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and if you want to know what we think of this ambitious survival-crafter, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/enshrouded-final-preview-survival-progression-at-its-finest">check out our preview here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Listening to Nintendo music isn’t easy. It’s not available on streaming platforms, so I usually end up scouring YouTube for songs from <em>Animal Crossing</em> and <em>Metroid</em>. Because of this, I was hoping that Nintendo Music, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">a new app that surprise-launched last week</a>, would be my one-stop shop for listening to Nintendo soundtracks. But while it features some clever ideas, there are lots of frustrations and weird choices from Nintendo that mean it isn’t quite what I was hoping for.&nbsp;</p><p>Navigating the app, which is available on iOS and Android but only accessible to Switch Online subscribers, feels a lot like other music services like Apple Music or Spotify. You can browse tracks from individual games or hand-curated playlists themed around things like characters, <em>Pokémon</em> battle songs, or tracks you might want to listen to on an extended loop.&nbsp;It’s organized in a thoughtful way on a per-game basis. The fictional bands in <em>Splatoon 3</em> all get artist pages with bios. The page for <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> features playlists for K.K. Slider performances <em>and</em> instrumentals, and if you want to listen to a full playlist of Kapp’n’s sea shanties, that’s available, too.</p><p>The extended loop feature is my favorite part. For some songs, you can choose to extend them out to 15, 30, or 60 minutes. I’ve already used it quite a bit to work to music from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;</em> the calming piano sounds of “The Great Plateau” are still exquisite seven years later. I also like that you can add games to a “spoiler prevention” list to hide information about a game you might not have played yet, which could be a good way to keep yourself in the dark about a final boss for a game you might want to play.</p><div><p>There just aren’t many games on the app</p></div><p>But Nintendo Music doesn’t have many game soundtracks to listen to. Nintendo has more than 40 years’ worth of titles it could have included, and right now, there are only 25 games to pick from. There are just two <em>Zelda</em> games: <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. <em>Fire Emblem</em> is the only Game Boy Advance game. There are three NES games, and two of them are <em>Metroid</em>. Technically, one of the “games” is Wii Channels music (which, to be fair, is full of bangers).</p><p>I could go on, but the point is that Nintendo Music isn’t a comprehensive collection of the company’s enormous musical history. Given that most of the soundtracks are for Nintendo Switch games, it’s more of a collection of Nintendo’s <em>recent</em> musical history, but it seems like a huge miss that I can’t listen to anything from <em>Super Mario World</em> in the app.</p><p>That will start to change, and probably slowly, if the drip-feed of Switch Online retro games is any indication. A day after the service launched, Nintendo added <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1852215844421669245">the soundtrack to <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a>, and on Monday, <em>Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy’s Kong Quest</em> became available, too. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ5EeImWYaI">Nintendo Music reveal trailer</a>, the company showed that <em>Wii Sports</em>, <em>Super Mario 64</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>Splatoon 2</em>, and <em>F-Zero X</em> are all set to arrive on the service, but only on a vague “over time” schedule.</p><p>Nintendo Music also doesn’t credit the real humans involved in making a song. That means, curiously enough, that the fictional bands in <em>Splatoon 3</em> have more prominence in Nintendo Music <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23680052/super-mario-bros-theme-music-us-library-of-congress-nintendo">than the legendary Koji Kondo</a>. (Nintendo has kind of a weird thing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23860180/mario-new-voice-actor-super-bros-wonder-nintendo">about credits at the moment</a>.)</p><p>The app has some other issues, too. You can’t extend some songs, and there’s no indication why, which is really annoying. One of the first songs I wanted to try the feature with was <em>Metroid Prime</em>’s<em> </em>soothing “Phendrana Drifts” music, but it’s not possible — which, given that it’s one of the main songs you hear on loop while exploring that area of the game, doesn’t make sense to me. Sure, you can just set the song to repeat, but that’s not quite the same as an hour-long extension. And when you select the duration of how long you want to extend a song, the whole song starts over; it’s a little thing, but I wish the app could just make the extension happen without the brief but jarring halt.&nbsp;</p><p>And disappointingly, Nintendo Music is currently only available on iOS and Android — there’s no desktop or web app. I’d really like to listen to Nintendo Music from a Mac app or in my desktop browser; it isn’t compatible with <a href="https://support.m.nintendo.com/hc/en-us/articles/10684349809807-Is-Nintendo-Music-compatible-with-CarPlay-and-Android-Auto">CarPlay or Android Auto</a>, either.</p><p>For the songs that are currently available, Nintendo Music is great. But so much is missing that part of me wonders if Nintendo pushed this service out the door ahead of the launch of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">successor to the Switch</a> so that it could add to the service later. It’s a similar feeling to the frustrations with other recent not-Switch things from Nintendo, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">the Alarmo clock</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">skin-deep Nintendo Museum</a>; they all have good ideas but also some weird limitations.</p><p>Nintendo Music just isn’t as deep as I would like it to be. It means I’m going to have to keep tracking a lot of music down on YouTube.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-biggest-update-to-date-is-out-now-adding-new-npcs-animal-companions-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the release of Enshrouded, Keen Games has been nonstop on adding quality-of-life changes to the game and major content updates for the title to keep it fresh in the Early Access period. When it comes to value for money, Enshrouded is undoubtedly it. Today, the fourth content update, Souls of the Frozen Frontier, is out and available. This is their biggest update yet and adds a ton of new content to explore, as well as bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements. The full 1.0 launch of Enshrouded is edging ever closer, as the full release is planned for 2025 on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. This title has been in Early Access since <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-hits-30-million-players-since-january/">January 2024</a>, and Keen Games is showing no signs of slowing down. If you are getting stuck into the latest update, there is a lot to look forward to.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of the new update, Keen Games has released two videos to show off the features, with one being a general trailer and the other being a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpK-BZdngOc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature spotlight</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enshrouded - Souls of the Frozen Frontier | Official Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PogZ1u9mGSM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First and foremost, there is now a new region to explore named the Albaneve Summits. Here, you'll get to experience the brand-new dynamic weather system, which will be featured throughout the entirety of Embervale and will take you through snowy tundras, ice plains, and plenty of new quests. The Summit is home to a lot of new monsters and creatures, as well as materials that you can bring back to your base and use for crafting.</p>
<p>For some, the most important things that are being added to Enshrouded are pets and farm animals. You can now have furry friends to keep you company at base. Anything non-aggressive can be tamed, and you can then help escort them back to your base. To make sure they're safe and happy, you can provide them with a home and some treats to keep them happy. If you are keeping farm animals, they will also drop resources that you can use every once in a while.</p>
<p>That's not all, as there are also new NPCs that you can find throughout Embervale, which can now be asked to return with you to your base to assist with crafting recipes and other tasks. Along with this comes new armor sets that you can equip to remain fashionable as you explore the expansive world of Enshrouded, with the player level cap now being increased to level 35 in the new update. This will allow you to access new spells, skills, and additional perks to help you survive the frozen areas of Embervale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-reckons-the-idea-of-an-exclusive-is-disappearing-altogether/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Final Fantasy XVI producer and Final Fantasy XIV director Naoki Yoshida was recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/811/G081112/20241010055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by the Japanese website 4Gamer alongside series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi to discuss the upcoming game <a href="https://wccftech.com/fantasian-neo-dimension-launches-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FANTASIAN Neo Dimension</a>, which will be available next month on PC and consoles after an exclusive debut on Apple Arcade.</span></p>
<p>When asked whether he'd ever want to make a game for Apple's platform, Yoshida-san replied that in his mind, the idea of a platform exclusive is disappearing altogether.</p>
<p><em>Now the biggest gaming platform is the PC, and with the streaming boom, PC-based gamers are becoming mainstream. But on the other hand, smart devices are becoming a platform that everyone has for the younger generation. Given that, if possible, it would be better to make it playable on any platform rather than making it for a specific platform in order to reach a much larger audience. With that as a basic idea, I decide whether the game I'm trying to make will run properly on smart devices.</em><br>
<em>If the parts that can't be run are equal to the fun of the game, I'll give up on smart devices and make it fun. On the other hand, if it fits within the specs and can be played without the device getting too hot to touch, it's definitely better to make it for smart devices as well. In my mind, the idea of ​​a platform exclusive is disappearing altogether.</em></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI certainly suffered from that. It was only available on PlayStation 5 for over a year, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-fell-short-high-end-sales-goal-slow-ps5-adoption-blamed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led</a> to weak sales, similar to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Now, Square Enix has largely <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-unveils-new-business-plan-with-aggressive-multiplatform-strategy-and-quality-over-quantity-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched</a> to a multiplatform strategy that will take Xbox into much greater account. Yoshida reiterates the shift later in the aforementioned interview:</p>
<p><em>This time, we will also release the Xbox Series X|S version (of FANTASIAN: Neo Dimension) at the same time. In the future, Square Enix titles will be released simultaneously on each platform more and more, but since this is close to the first release, we would like Xbox users to play it as well.</em></p>
<p>Xbox fans are hoping Square Enix will eventually bring Final Fantasy XVI to their favorite platform, too, after the recent debut on PC.</p>

Always a classic, that build sacrifices your minions to increase your solo damage capabilities, and I’ve listed it below as the “Endgame” build since it is very similar to what you’ll use once you begin Torment difficulties.</p><p>As for the minion build, a good starting point is this beginner build right here.

<h2 id="h-is-there-a-planet-coaster-2-platinum-trophy-on-ps5">Is There a Planet Coaster 2 Platinum Trophy on PS5?</h2>



<p>As Planet Coaster 2 launches simultaneously on PC and PlayStation 5, along with the Xbox Series X|S, it does indeed have a platinum trophy to unlock. It’s called “Heir to the Throne,” and of course, requires you to unlock all other trophies in the game to acquire.</p>



<p>It’s quite the challenge, but savvy fans with experience in previous “Planet” titles should have no issue meeting the unlock requirements for each of the above-mentioned Planet Coaster 2 achievements and trophies!</p>
