<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> is coming to Switch 2 only, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0</a> is lined up for both Switch 1 and 2 - and Square Enix has confirmed there'll be no way to upgrade a Switch 1 version of the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/square-enix-games.com/post/3lvbhnvp7ys2m">Posting on Bluesky</a>, the publisher says that if you buy the Switch 1 version, you won't be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 version via an Upgrade Pack. This means Switch 2 owners wanting a physical copy of the game will be stuck between Switch 1 cart they can't upgrade and a Game-Key Card which — according to the official box art — will require a 5GB download.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067uimnjv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Note about the Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch versions 1/2]<br>
The Switch 2 versions (both the physical and digital versions) can only be played on Nintendo Switch 2.<br>
[2/2]<br>
It is not possible to upgrade from the Switch version to the Switch 2 version once purchased. There are also no plans for an option to upgrade to the Switch 2 version in future. Please make sure you purchase the correct version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other publishers have offered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">Upgrade Packs</a> that let anyone with the Switch 1 game get the upgraded version of the game on the more powerful console but, for whatever reason, Square apparently has no interest in offering this as an option.</p>
<p>As a reminder for anybody out of the loop, Nintendo introduced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Cards</a> as an option for publishers on Switch 2. They don't contain any game data, with the cart acting — as the name suggests — as a key that must be inserted in the console, first to download the entire game from the eShop, and subsequently to access the game on your hard drive.</p>
<p>While this means that publishers can get a 'physical' product on store shelves and you have something to put on your own shelf (or resell, if you like), you'll still need to have the game downloaded and taking up storage space on your system - and you'll need the card inserted to play it.</p>
<p>Players' reaction to Game-Key Cards from players has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/we-must-resist-buying-these-game-key-releases-says-gamesmaster-host">largely negative</a>, although the option to get a physical copy of the Switch 1 game and then get the digital-only Upgrade Pack for Switch 2 was a compromise some were prepared to make. Zero chance of that here, it seems.</p>
<p>The game's not out until December, so it's possible plans could change. "Please make sure you purchase the correct version" doesn't sound promising, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Robo-Link, activate?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Nintendo Partner Direct, we got a new trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. While most of the trailer was straightforward, it ended on a cryptic tease that has Zelda fans running with speculation as to what the scene could mean for the game's roster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end of the trailer shows a chamber deep inside a cavern where what appears to be one of the Constructs from Tears of the Kingdom is being assembled and activated. The Constructs themselves are nothing new - they're all over the place in Tears of the Kingdom, and we know they were created by Mineru during the events of Age of Imprisonment, so it makes sense we'd see them in the game. What's interesting about this one is that it appears to be roughly human-shaped and -sized, whereas none of the Constructs we've met before (including Mineru's own Construct) were quite that proportioned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why are fans excited about this? Well, a lot of folks think this means <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeLink/comments/1me38a5/how_are_we_feeling_about_construct_link_x_zelda/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we're getting some sort of Robo-Link playable in Age of Imprisonment</a>. The game takes place in the far, far distant past, thousands of years before the main events of Tears of the Kingdom, and in the time period that Zelda is transported to at the start of that game. It covers the events of the Imprisoning War as Zelda experienced it during her time in that era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As such, chronologically, it doesn't make any sense that Link would be playable in Age of Imprisonment. There was no Link in that era, after all. That said, it also seems baffling that a Legend of Zelda game, even a spin-off, could exist without Link involved. This is why a lot of fans have been speculating that Link will find some way to turn up, whether that's through alternate timeline shenanigans (see: Age of Calamity) or some other method. And this teaser offers one possibility for this hoped-for Linkening: maybe Link somehow gets to embody one of Mineru's constructs made in his likeness, so he can fight alongside the others of that era.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">nintendo you know i dont play about fi please dont play with me <a href="https://t.co/Uj0QOJQ9aj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Uj0QOJQ9aj</a></p>— ava (@zeldevil) <a href="https://twitter.com/zeldevil/status/1950913028670787672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That said, there's one other detail that has fans thinking this is going in a different direction. If you listen back to the ending teaser, there's a bit of music that plays as the scene transitions to the Construct. If you're a Skyward Sword fan, you'll recognize it as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV1Efuh-aus" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fi's Theme</a>. The presence of this little chime has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1me1h85/aoi_new_age_of_imprisonment_trailer_in_nintendo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some suspecting that this won't be a Robo Link</a>, but actually a way for Fi to finally reappear in a Zelda game after being (understandably) absent for so long. Some are suggesting this could be possible given that Zelda obtains the broken Master Sword at the start of her time in the ancient era. Given that Fi dwells within the sword, what if they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1me2vii/totk_rise_up_because_we_are_so_back/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">used its fragments to give her a body to fight with</a>? Anything's possible!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that means it's also possible this thing is none of the above and we're in for some sort of weird twist surprise when the game comes out. Age of Calamity, after all, wasn't quiiiite what we thought it was by the endgame, so it's likely Age of Imprisonment also has some tricks up its sleeve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We unfortunately still don't have a firm release date for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment but know it's coming to Nintendo Switch 2 sometime this winter. You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at today's Nintendo Partner Direct right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> fans tuning in were left disappointed by yet another video game showcase passing with no further word of Team Cherry's highly-anticipated, long-awaited sequel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And to be fair to the fans, there was cause to think today might finally bring Silksong's much-desired release date. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window">Nintendo Direct earlier this year confirmed the game would arrive in 2025</a>, raising hopes of a fresh appearance today. And, just days ago, Microsoft announced that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-a-new-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-playable-at-gamescom">Silksong will be playable via a fresh Xbox demo</a> in a couple of weeks at Gamescom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid this backdrop, hopes were high — but, as we now know, they were in vain. Reaction to the Nintendo Direct on the Hollow Knight and Silksong subreddits has, perhaps to be expected, not been positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The top thread currently on the Silksong <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1me1j9k/aaahahahahahahah/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> is a meme of a cat laughing open-mouthed, pointing at the screen. "It's never been so over", "The cycle of pain", "Silksong isn't real" read a selection of the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've genuinely lost so much hype for this game," wrote reddit user YeetHead10. "I was so excited last year but now I've just moved on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"No you havent," replied DirtySlutMuffin. "You're here complaining."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"At least this is consistent in my life," CringeNaeNaeBaby2 said, referring to the constant disappointment around Silksong they faced. "You know when they go to jail, spend years trying to get out, then beg to be readmitted after being freed? I'm gonna beg for Silksong to be unreleased. I need the longing, the spite keeps me alive. I'm gonna drop dead when Silksong comes out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans simply seem upset at their own frustration, though a few have suggested Silksong developer Team Cherry should be doing more to set expecations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I feel like people would be taking it better if Team Cherry themselves gave more frequent updates," wrote reddit user ChocoGoodness, "instead of letting us wait for Nintendo or Xbox or whatever to announce it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, all we know of Silksong's arrival is that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-responds-to-release-date-confusion-promises-launch-before-holiday-not-tied-to-xbox-handheld-arrival">will launch before Christmas 2025, and not be tied to the release of the ROG Ally X handheld</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For everything that <em>was </em>shown today, here's our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">roundup of the Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase presentation in full</a>.

<p dir="ltr">Nintendo of America staff then shared some of their own, alternate Pokemon character designs. The designs were apparently so traumatic that Ishihara said he "won't show those illustrations to anyone as long as I live."</p><p dir="ltr">"They kind of looked like the characters from the Cats musical," Ishihara said. "So, for example, Pikachu was changed into a character shaped like a kind of tabby cat with huge breasts."</p><p dir="ltr">Later in the interview, Ishihara is asked to clarify what the design looked like, and if it looked similar to when women dress up like Pikachu at anime conventions.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yes, exactly," Ishihara said, seemingly clearing up any potential confusion. "They presented that kind of design to us for real. I thought it was interesting, in a sense of appreciating such cultural differences. However, I didn't want to compete in the [overseas] market with that kind of thing."</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon, of course, would go on to be released overseas with relatively few changes from the original Japanese version, creating a multi-media juggernaut that still continues today. It feels fairly safe to assume that might not have been the case had Pokemon all been anthropomorphized animals with big boobs.

<p>And it's got a release date</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a survival horror fan, you've probably been keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a brand new sci-fi third-person shooter where you jump between 1980's Poland and a dystopian future. Previews for the game dropped earlier this week for other platforms, and they seem solid across the board.</p>
<p>Luckily, Switch 2 owners don't need to miss out on the scares, as the game was confirmed to be coming to the new Nintendo console on the same day as other platforms; <strong>5th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Developed by Bloober Team, the studio behind last year's critically-acclaimed <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Cronos puts you in the suit of The Traveller who live in a world post "Change", a cataclysm that turned many humans into 'Orphans', monsters who now prowl across the world.</p>
<p>Traveller's job is to jump back in time to the '80s and extract the souls of those who were transformed during the apocalyptic event. Gunplay and combat is thoughtful and you can't just shoot your way through every encounter — even if you want to when a terrifying monster is approaching you.</p>

<p>This was probably the biggest surprise of the Direct for us — a game that's already pretty established getting a Switch 2 version <em>and</em> release date, the same day as other consoles? That's a shock we're willing to accept.</p>
<p>And hey, if previews are anything to go by, this looks pretty solid; <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview">IGN</a>, <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/145273/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview">Shacknews</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/after-2-hours-with-the-silent-hill-2-devs-slimy-sci-fi-beast-cronos-im-thrilled-it-has-dead-space-dna-and-the-soul-of-resident-evil-this-is-more-like-a-love-letter-to-survival-horror-than-to-poland/">Gamesradar</a> all have good things to say.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bloober Team's 2021 psychological horror game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/">The Medium</a> is being adapted into a film by Gary Dauberman, the man who horror fans will recognize as the writer and producer of the recent <em>It</em> and <em>Annabelle</em> films.</p>



<p>Dauberman won't be writing on the project himself, as he is currently in the process of looking for a writer and director to helm the film. Dauberman's production company, Coin Operated, which he runs along with the company's president, Mia Maniscalco, will be producing the film.</p>



<p>Dauberman told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gary-dauberman-spooky-video-game-the-medium-exclusive-1236333819/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, who first reported the news of the adaptation, that "<em>With its compelling story and incredibly cinematic visuals, </em><em>The Medium</em> is a natural for a feature film adaptation. When I talked to Piotr [Babieno] about it, we immediately connected on our mutual love of horror and his vision for where the genre is headed. I have no doubt anything Bloober develops is going to push horror forward in unique and terrifying ways, and I’m excited to be working alongside them."</p>



<p>For Bloober Team's part, chief executive officer Piotr Babieno added, "<em>Adapting games into films often involves balancing many interests, but with </em><em>The Medium</em>, I have a deep sense that Gary is the perfect partner for us. From our very first conversation, I felt we were completely in sync. And every conversation since has only reinforced that feeling."</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what becomes of this film. Dauberman most recently worked on the adaptation of Until Dawn, which, by most accounts <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/until-dawn/">did not impress audiences</a>. Whoever he gets to work on this adaptation as a writer and director will, of course, likely be the make-or-break element of this film.</p>



<p>The other interesting aspect about this adaptation news is that it brings into question what's happening with the previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloober-team-the-medium-tv-series-the-witcher-producer/">TV series adaptation</a> of The Medium. The assumption, now that this film adaptation has been announced, is that nothing is happening with that series, and that it's another of dozens of projects that are born and die before they ever get close to audiences in the regular Hollywood churn. </p>



<p>Or perhaps we'll see the TV series be born again after this film with a different angle. Or maybe we'll see neither, as this film adaptation could see the same end the TV series did.</p>

Even though they confidently take a Rathalos fireball to the face in their introductory cutscene, Lagiacrus is weak to Fire. They also differ from other water monsters in that they’re not weak to Thunder, and instead use Thunder element attacks. All that to say, <strong>Fire-based weapons and Thunder-resistant armor will go a long way here</strong>.</p><p>I’ve had the most luck when keeping a +20 Thunder resistance. This hunt isn’t as bad as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span>’s almost endless lightning strikes, but more than half of the attacks are electric. Being afflicted with Thunderblight and subsequently getting stunned is highly likely if your resistance isn’t high enough. </p><p>Besides a couple of projectile attacks, Lagiacrus’ physical attacks are similar to Mizutsune’s, in that they’ll cover a substantial amount of ground lunging and sweeping their entire body at you. Don’t expect a certain area to feel safer, the way you can lie low underneath <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913">Zoh Shia</a></span>. Well-timed guards and evades are incredibly important for a fight like this.</p><p><strong>Prioritizing hits to the back is a smart way to restrict some of Lagiacrus’ Thunder attacks and collect the not-so-common Lagiacrus Shockspike material.</strong> Heavy Bowguns and other weapons with long reach will be fine, but Dual Blade users like me mostly have to rely on traps and mounting. A great method for any hunter to dish out damage to the back is by dodging through the monster’s massive discharge attack, since that can reveal a Focus Strike spot for a few seconds after.</p><p>The environment is a helpful friend in a fight like this. Never hesitate to lead it towards Poisoncups, Sporepuffs, or into a turf war with another monster. On the likely chance it moves to Area 15, trigger the Dam Rubble interactable with your slinger. You’ll deal a lot of damage and knock it down for a bit.</p><p>Lagiacrus will retreat to the newly added Area 19 at the tail end of the fight. It will briefly surface along the edge of Area 13, where you can trigger Unstable Rubble to fall and knock it out of the water. No matter if you interrupt its journey or not, you’ll track it to Area 19. Keep the hits coming to make the monster dive into the nearby water. This is when you can follow after it and fight the “Lord of the Seas” on its own turf.</p><figure id="" data-id="af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-recommend-id="image://af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-recommend-id="image://af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Bear in mind that underwater combat isn’t as fleshed out as regular combat.

The latter is the best way to deal big damage during this part of the hunt.</p><p>Hurt Lagiacrus enough during this phase to trigger a cool cinematic of your hunter smacking the hell out of it and taking the fight back on land. If there isn’t enough damage dealt, the watery serpent will quickly create a whirlpool that unleashes a massive discharge of electricity. Swim as far away as possible to avoid losing a majority of your health or even fainting. Either way, the fight will transition back up top for the final bout. Play it smart and you’ll be done soon enough.</p><p>Tempered Lagiacrus kicks the difficulty up many notches. Attacks are frequently chained together and they all hurt a lot. Evading seems to be a more manageable strategy than guarding against these attacks.

    <p><span>From Oink Games.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Oink Games [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/oink-games">Oink Games</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > Chillin' by the Fire" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin’ by the Fire</a></em>, a campfire <a title="Genres > Simulation [797 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation game</a> for <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [267 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. It is available now via <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/chillin-by-the-fire-switch-2/" target="_blank">Nintendo eShop</a> for $14.99. <span id="more-981194"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Oink Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Only the faint crackling of firewood fills the night. A quiet, low-poly world, where each player’s voice blends with the flickering of the campfire—that’s <em>Chillin’ by the Fire</em>, the campfire simulation game.</p><p>In <em>Chillin’ by the Fire</em>, your goal is to grow your campfire while doing things such as splitting firewood, stacking firewood, and fanning the flames. In order to grow your fire, you can’t have too much or too little firewood. The thickness of the wood, how you stack the wood in the fire, and the timing are also very important, and sometimes you just need to sit back and wait for a while. This quiet back-and-forth with nature will draw you in…and when the fire finally roars to life, the sense of accomplishment you’ll feel is more satisfying than any high score could ever be.</p><p>You can enjoy the game solo at your own pace, or gather around the fire online with friends and family using GameChat or GameShare. Camera feeds appear around the fire, making it feel like you’re truly together in the same place. You can work together to build a fire, or compete with your own firepits. There’s a variety of different playstyles waiting for you. In addition, there’s a built-in “Campfire Convo” feature which helps keep the chat exciting.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Growing Fire, a New Kind of Gaming <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong> – The star of this game is the tiny flame born from your fingertips. The flow of the air, the thickness of the wood, and the angle at which it’s placed all intertwine, as the flame steadily grows. Your goal: Campfire Level 10. The sense of accomplishment you feel when the firebed turns into bright red embers and the pillars of flame illuminate the night sky is more powerful than any scoreboard.</li><li><strong>Communication Around the Campfire</strong> – You can play online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [561 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> with the members of your GameChat session. Up to 4 players can play while chatting. Chat members are instantly invited to the same campfire, making matchmaking simple. But that’s not all, with an external camera connected, you can video chat with CameraPlay. You and your friends’ real faces will show up around the campfire. As the light of the flames reflect off your expressions, you’ll feel the same warmth even with players who are far away—such a mysterious sense of closeness. Campfire Convo prompts will be displayed randomly, helping to spark some small talk. From every day chit-chat to late-night philosophy, the conversations are sure to get exciting.</li><li><strong>Beauty in Simplicity—Blazing <a title="Companies > Orange [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/orange">Orange</a> Gradients in HDR</strong> – The visuals are intentionally low-poly. Even so, the flames appear in a beautiful orange gradation thanks to HDR support. An eye-catching vividness and a deep, soothing sensation—savor them both.</li><li><strong>Subtle Details That Support Healing and Immersion</strong> – Try headphones to fully experience the crackling of the flames and the sound of crumbling firewood. HD Rumble brings the feel of the campfire to your hands, uniting your sense of sight, sound, and touch.</li><li><strong>Anytime, Anywhere</strong> – Whether online or via local connection, up to 4 players can gather around the same fire. <em>Chillin’ by the Fire</em> supports GameShare, so even if only one person owns the game, everyone can play together. You can also share the experience through local multiplayer on <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [22,372 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Switch via GameShare. Whether you’re spending a quiet night alone or catching up with faraway friends, bring a gentle warmth into your everyday life.</li><li><strong>Three Game Modes</strong><ul><li><strong>Normal</strong> – Grow your fire and try to reach Campfire Level 10.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Survival [437 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a></strong> – Your supply of firewood is limited. Plan how to pass the flame from one log to the next and prevent the fire from going out.</li><li><strong>Playground</strong> – Use the four fire pits and play online to compete with friends. Whether <a title="Genres > Racing [263 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> to build the biggest fire, interfering with each other, or working together, it all depends on the rules you decide.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Environmental Changes Through Four Stages</strong><ul><li><strong>Beach</strong> – High temperatures and low humidity, enjoy the most carefree campfire.</li><li><strong>Grove</strong> – A dry forest that offers a bit more challenge. Great for conversations with friends and just the right level of difficulty.</li><li><strong>Plateau</strong> – Majestic mountains stretch out in the distance. The temperature is lower and sometimes showers roll through. A location where even experienced players will find a challenge.</li><li><strong>Snowy Mountain</strong> – Temperatures below freezing. A frigid area where both firewood and fire blower freeze over. A harsh environment that will put everything to the test.</li></ul></li><li><strong>No Campfire Experience? No Problem.</strong> – The game comes equipped with features to help you, such as the “Voice of the Fire,” which tells you about the condition of the fire and gives general advice, a detailed “Campfire Guide,” and a visual display that shows the status of the firewood. Even if you have no experience building a campfire, you can still have fun playing with confidence. Players that are new to campfires are encouraged to explore the game’s hidden depth. For experience campers, these features can be turned off, for a more demanding and refined challenge. In a world that’s always rushing, reclaim the simple joy of just watching a fire.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Nintendo Direct: July 31, 2025 Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Chillin' by the Fire – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 7.31.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKrZUZCDRaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="チルっと焚き火ソン [Nintendo Direct ソフトメーカーラインナップ&nbsp;2025.7.31]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q8SasBNe79I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/campfire-simulation-game-chillin-by-the-fire-announced-for-switch-2-now-available]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you've ever fired up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and wondering why the likes of Shadowheart or Lae'zel's portrait shows them glaring at you like they've been summoned into some kind of video call, I bring good news. Larian's rectified this and one other infamous issue as part of the game's latest hotfix.</p>
<p>Don't get too excited, though. The devs are so keen to make sure no one gets their hopes up for any more major additions to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> now that its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees">final patch</a> is out of the way that they've dubbed this a "room temperature fix".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538855872766412727?l=english">notes</a>, you'll find plenty of useful stuff, such as a fix that should stop modders being timed out when trying to upload beefy works. There's also some documentation in legalese for you to dissect over a cup of tea in the form of <a href="https://larian.com/fan-content-policy">updated</a> <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/bg3-fan-content-terms/">rundowns</a> of Larian's policies when it comes to fan-made content.</p>
<p>But enough of that, to the headliners! "Told the Dark Urge, everyone's favourite amnesiac, to stop talking about people 'back home' (you don't know where that is yet, bestie) and spoiling the game by mentioning their 'father', among other silly notions, in their overhead dialogues," reads one tweak.</p> <div>

<p>If you're none the wiser, cough cough Baldur's Gate 3 spoilers ahead cough cough, the Durge wouldn't stop alluding to who their dad was, and it's someone whose name begins with the sound a sheep makes.</p>

            <p>Punishing my tendency to never bother watching Nintendo Directs, Bandai Namco used today's Switch 2-focused showcase to announce <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/once-upon-a-katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a>: the first mainline, non-remake Katamari game since 2011. It’ll be out on PC as well, come October 24th 2025, and while you’ll once again be rolling up entire societies around a swelling sticky ball, this one will span a range of time periods - so you’ll be able to knead whole new planets out of feudal Japan or ancient Greece.</p>

<p>As is tradition, dating back to 2004’s original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a>, said rolling will be on behalf of godlike space-monarch and perennial fuckup The King of All Cosmos, whose latest oopsie has re-destroyed the Earth for what must be his fifth or sixth time now. Though it looks like the historical eras you’ll be rolling up are all Earth-based too, so you’re presumably building a replacement planet out of itself, which the King will then ruin in the future, and will need to built out of itself again, and so on, for infinity. Nice bit of timelooping existential horror for this child-friendly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle game</a>, there.</p>
<p>Other touches of newness include the ability to customise your lil' rolling person’s appearance, an original, likely catchy soundtrack, and most pertinently to your rolling endeavours, a powerup system that can make for faster or more precise detritus-bundling. In the trailer we see a range-extending magnet, rocket boosters, and the power to stop TIME ITSELF.</p>
<p>I admit to not having played any Katamari games on PC, much of my series experience coming in the form of bleary-eyed New Year’s Day sessions on consoles belonging to whichever old college friend had just let me sleep on their floor. But Windows has seen a few of the remakes in recent years, with Liam (RPS in Peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-22-favourite-games-of-2023-so-far">loving</a> 2023’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/we-love-katamari-reroll-royal-reverie">We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie</a> in particular.

<p>Available in Coral Red and Translucent Black, the Elves 2 is a different proposition from its 'Pro' variant, (which is already available - you can check out our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gulikit-elves-2-pro-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-a-small-yet-refined-saturn-tribute">full review for all the details</a>). The new model is missing a few key features, such as APG recording and custom thumbstick sensitivity, but it's still got gyro support, three levels of rumble intensity, and those all-important Hall Effect analogue sticks with removable caps.</p>
<p>The Elves 2 is priced at $29.99 and is available from Amazon now in the US and Japan, with Europe to follow "soon". Select global retailers will also offer the pad, though pricing may vary depending on region.</p>
<p>"We’re proud to be the first controller brand globally to support wake-up functionality on the Switch 2 at launch," said Gulikit in its press release.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of the pad's key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Retro-Inspired Ergonomics:</strong><br>
Shaped after the Sega Genesis controller for comfortable, fatigue-free play. Compact and lightweight for gaming on the go.</p>
<p><strong>- World-First Switch 2 Wake-Up Support:<br></strong>Instantly wake up your Switch 2 from sleep mode—GuliKit is the first controller brand to offer this feature out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>- Dual Hall Effect Joysticks:<br></strong>Drift-free performance with 2200-level high precision and long-lasting durability.</p>
<p><strong>- Advanced Haptics with Asymmetric Dual-Rotor Motors:</strong><strong><br></strong>Three levels of responsive vibration feedback for immersive gameplay, similar to Xbox's tactile feel.</p>
<p><strong>- Universal Compatibility:<br></strong>Works seamlessly with Switch 2, Switch, Windows, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p><strong>- Classic Floating D-Pad:<br></strong>Perfect for fighting games, with precise actuation and fast combo execution.</p>
<p><strong>- Pro-Level Input:<br></strong> Tactile triggers and silent conductive rubber buttons for fast, responsive, and comfortable control.</p>
<p><strong>- Wired &amp; Wireless Modes:<br></strong>Choose between Bluetooth (730Hz polling rate) or wired (1000Hz) connections for ultra-low latency.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-clubs-changes-deep-dive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-deep-dives-into-ea-sports-fc-26-clubs-changes-including-archetype-revamps-support-for-multiple-clubs-and-more.1258551/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has just <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-26/news/pitch-notes-fc26-clubs-deep-dive">published a deep dive</a> into the changes it made in EA Sports FC 26 to Clubs, with revamps to archetypes and archetype progression, support for multiple clubs, dynamic Club Rush Live events, and more.</p>



<p>Regarding archetype progression, consumables are the new introduction to help players earn XP for their archetypes outside of playing matches or skill games, and to help players who didn't jump into FC 26 on day one and start building their clubs right away catch up to those who did. You'll unlock consumables through season pass and objective rewards, or through the Clubs Store. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And while there will be multiple kinds of consumables available, some of the ones EA is introducing are Archetype XP multipliers and Direct Apply AXP, both of which boost AXP either through match rewards or just a direct boost. Archetype unlocks are exactly what they sound like, letting you unlock any of the remaining 12 archetypes you didn't pick when you first jump into clubs, and the same goes with Archetype Resets, which let you reset your attribute points and redistribute them.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>FC 26 also introduces signature perks, which, according to EA, "<em>encourage you to embody your chosen archetype or specialization whenever you step onto the pitch</em>." Every archetype comes with two perks that you unlock through archetype progression, and a third can be applied when you have a specialization active.</p>



<p>Some perks are action-focused, which means they're based around you performing specific actions on the pitch, while others are mechanic or team-based. Mechanic perks focus on improving elements of your game, like your passing, while team-based perks improve how your computer-controlled teammates receive passes and control the ball.</p>



<p>Live events coming to Clubs are one of the other major changes in FC 26, with new events coming to Clubs regularly through single-elimination knockout rush tournaments. That said, you do have multiple attempts to make it out of the first round if you lose a match when starting a rush tournament. You're truly eliminated when you lose each attempt.</p>

			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Some of the rush tournaments will have house rules like Rugby Rush, which is basically a 'no fouls' mode, or a Designated Scorer mode, where goals only count if they come from a designated player.</p>



<p>Players can now also be a member of up to three clubs at a time, switching between them at will through the Clubs menu, but that doesn't mean you'll earn rewards for all three when playing a match for one of them. So make sure you have the right club selected if you're trying to earn rewards for a specific one.</p>



<p>The big promise with this year's entry into EA's long-running football series has been to "<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/"><em>make gameplay better</em>,</a>" and address the myriad of issues that players have had with the game for years. It's clear that EA is putting in some kind of effort from these deep dives and its marketing, but whether it's all sizzle and no steak is something we won't know until FC 26 launches on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, on September 26, 2025.</p>

Square Enix have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, a prequel to the genteel 2019 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/octopath-traveler-pc-review">hailed</a> as... "a bit of a slog"?? "A big old anticlimax"??? I thought it was quite good!</p>
<p>This is an outrage! I'm going to tell Katharine she sucks at writing and is terrible at video games. What do you mean, she doesn't work here any more? Well in that case, I'm going to tell Graham he should never have hired her. What do you mean, he doesn't work here any more? Who <em>does</em> work here any more? Oh screw it, just roll the trailer.

<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> Nought takes place in the first game's Orsterra, a medieval fantasy confection with a few Steam Age flourishes, and sports the same "HD-2D" visual direction - a calculatingly throwback  blend of chintzy sprites and lushly illuminated 3D environments, much like a grandfather clock equipped with a wifi speaker.</p>
<p>It brings back the first game's battle system, which saw you Breaking (aka, staggering) enemies by filling a bar, and spending Boost points to enhance actions performed in each turn. Characters still get unique Path Actions when interacting with townsfolk, too. 
</p>
<p>
So where does it differ? Well, you can now customise your protagonist and rebuild your very own hometown, Wishvale, after somebody inconsiderately burns it down in the prologue. It's not yet clear how this might affect the rest of the game, but I imagine you'll be able to shop in Wishvale and give your party members places to live. It's what I'd do, if I were Enix, Esquire.
</p>
<p>
Octopath Traveler Nada launches on December 4th this year. That dirty, no-good Katharine also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/octopath-traveler-2-review">reviewed the second game</a> before she left us languishing in the arms of Ian Games. She remained unimpressed, concluding that "bar a couple of very minor evolutions, this is effectively the same Octopath Traveler as before". I confess, the first game's story does drag on, but I greatly enjoyed the alchemy of the Boost and Break systems. I do think Square Enix have run the HD-2D look into the ground at this point, though.

Its tale of the cutthroat, vindictive side of the entertainment industry may be oozing true crime flair, but outside of the jump scares and darker turns, is the story it tells really <em>that </em>different from any real-life horror story you might have heard about the challenges struggling artistss sometimes face when they’re trying to make it?</p><p>If you want a game to talk about the trials and tribulations of actors, it’s worth having some incredible talent to get the message across. <em>Dead Take </em>stars <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> lead Ben Starr and Astarion from <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> himself, Neil Newbon, as two struggling(?) actor friends(?), Vinny Monroe and Chase Lowry. Both actors auditioned for a role in the latest movie by visionary director Duke Cain, but Vinny was the one who landed the job. While Chase is clearly not thrilled by this turn of events, he and Vinny seem to still be on good terms, up until Vinny stops answering his phone after a party at Cain’s luxurious mansion. Chase, in an effort to find his friend, goes to Cain’s home and finds only the aftermath of a party long over.</p><figure id="" data-id="bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-recommend-id="image://bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chase looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chase looks into the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-recommend-id="image://bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chase looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of <em>Dead Take </em>plays out as a kind of large-scale escape room. Cain’s mansion is full of locked rooms with mysteries and unpleasant answers on the other side. The game is a mostly solitary affair, as Chase seems to be the only soul in the building, but Starr, Newbon, and a few other surprising big actors in the video game space get some real face time through found footage. So even if Chase is alone, every supporting character’s presence is still felt in their absence. There are plenty of text logs and environmental cues that give you a sense of what’s going on, but the bulk of the story is told through FMV video files you search for and watch in Cain’s lavish home theater. There are some puzzles even within that, some requiring you to use video editing software to find hidden footage within the files you’ve already discovered. It’s nothing as demanding as what you find in a Sam Barlow game like <em>Her Story </em>or <em>Immortality</em>, but it’s just enough to make you feel like even the videos you find aren’t the full story, and that there are hidden meanings to be found within even the most innocuous footage.</p><p>Starr’s performance is the standout for me. Vinny is a driven but privileged nepo baby who is drinking Cain’s Kool-Aid as if the man’s films were plopped into theaters by Christ himself. But that’s not even a character flaw that’s specific to him. Everyone<em> </em>in <em>Dead Take </em>is lapping up everything this man puts down, and they’re willing to sabotage others to bask in his light.</p><figure id="" data-id="d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-recommend-id="image://d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The video editing interface in Dead Take." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The video editing interface in Dead Take." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-recommend-id="image://d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The video editing interface in Dead Take." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We’re seeing this all through Chase’s eyes, and his voyeuristic role in this whole ordeal means we see more of Vinny’s character than probably anyone else, with much of the footage we see of Chase being taken from his initial, unsuccessful audition. <em>Dead Take </em>has the perspective of someone who has been pushed out or denied entry into a sacred, elite space, and by god, it sure speaks to the feeling of trying to break into a competitive artistic field where certain auteurs are put on a pedestal by just about everyone. Yeah, this is the kind of shit Hollywood has to deal with, but it’s also universally applicable to most creative industries. Whether you’re an actor, an artist, a musician, or hell, even a journalist, there’s a perception that there’s an in-crowd and that some people are so legendary that they cannot be so much as be questioned. To say a word against them is to incur their wrath, and that of the people who stand to gain something by being in their proximity. <em>Dead Take</em>’s horrific vision of these ideas is extreme, but it’s rooted in something so real that I had as much of a visceral reaction to the notes I found as I did to any of the more straightforward horrors I encountered in the self-aggrandizing museum Cain calls a home. I won’t spoil some of the mysteries I uncovered, but suffice it to say, <em>Dead Take</em>’s rancid vibes don’t just come from the tense, isolating atmosphere.</p><p>All that being said, the more straightforward scares are my biggest issue with <em>Dead Take</em>. I can handle a jump scare. I can handle two, even. My problem is that <em>Dead Take</em>’s use of them feels incredibly cheap and artificial. I know it’s currently in vogue to point out that “good” or “elevated” horror doesn’t rely on loud bangs and creepy monsters jumping out of walls to scare a viewer or player. While I think those critiques are often overblown and can carry an air of pretentious elitism, almost all of <em>Dead Take</em>’s jump scares are sudden distorted visions of Starr’s screaming face that appear on the screen without warning or any real diegetic context. This happens over and over, with increasing frequency as the game goes on, and I got pretty sick of it by the time I reached the final sequence. Sure, I could charitably read these as manifestations of Chase’s gradually decaying psyche, but they become so frequent and yet impossible to anticipate or connect to anything specific happening in the game that eventually, they no longer feel like real scares rooted in the world you’re moving through. All they did for me was disrupt my nervous system to the point where I had to brace myself every time I walked into a room, and eventually, I had to pause the game before I moved on because I knew I’d probably get a random bit of Starr screaming at me while I’m just trying to find a key or a USB stick.</p><figure id="" data-id="710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-recommend-id="image://710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hallway covered in movie posters with Vinny and Chase both depicted as the leads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hallway covered in movie posters with Vinny and Chase both depicted as the leads." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-recommend-id="image://710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hallway covered in movie posters with Vinny and Chase both depicted as the leads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a shame those stuttering screams are littered throughout a game I was otherwise drawn into. If you have the tolerance for jump scares, especially ones that have no real basis in the world, have at it. For everyone else, you might need to take some breaks walking through Cain’s mansion like I did, but once you’re past them, there’s a pretty compelling escape room mystery here, elevated by great performances from its two leads. <em>Dead Take </em>is scariest when it’s rooted in something real, and even if there’s a disclaimer assuring everyone it’s not based on anyone specific, know that Duke Cains walk among us.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dead-take-review-ben-starr-neil-newbon-horror-game-1851787439]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These days, many video games either tell you an extravagant story that you’ll play through once and then ditch, or they urge you to open your wallet and delve deep for cosmetics and battle passes on the free-to-play front, presumably forever. But if you venture over to the indie side of gaming, you’ll find genuine gems. One such is <em>RimWorld</em>. It’s a story-generator, according to its creator, Tynan Sylvester, in which the pawns you control and your choices create the ongoing tale. With the launch of the game’s latest expansion, <em>Odyssey</em>, introducing gravships, additional biomes, new animals, and more quests and rewards to uncover, it’s an excellent time to delve into <em>RimWorld</em>. I may be biased as I’ve spent nearly 700 hours with the game. But stick with me and you too might come to see what makes this game so special.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196918" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="196918,196358,195579" data-current="196918"><div><p>Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22475.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h673899"><a id=""></a>So what is <em>RimWorld</em> all about?</h2><figure id="" data-id="aa175e61b0af28305889b80e5a6229b3" data-recommend-id="image://aa175e61b0af28305889b80e5a6229b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A colony set in an active volcano surrounded by lava in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A colony set in an active volcano surrounded by lava in RimWorld." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ludeon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa175e61b0af28305889b80e5a6229b3" data-recommend-id="image://aa175e61b0af28305889b80e5a6229b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A colony set in an active volcano surrounded by lava in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The colony sim genre went through something of a resurgence with the launch of <em>RimWorld</em>. Before that, it was relatively niche, but still popular in a cult following sort of way, thanks to <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>. It’s not about an overarching story; it’s about the tales you craft in the moment. In <em>RimWorld</em>, intelligent AI storytellers, like Randy Random, alter the experience based on how you’re faring in the moment. If you’re doing too well, with abundant food and resources, you might soon endure a horde of man-eating chinchillas ravaging your base and its crops. It’s all part of the experience.</p><p>This randomness is why most people who enjoy <em>RimWorld</em> really enjoy <em>RimWorld</em>. They don’t play for ten or twenty hours; they play for <em>thousands </em>of hours. They want to see what’s going to happen in the next episode of cannibal colony meets <em>The Sims</em>!</p><p>To give you an idea of what can happen in a colony, here’s an excerpt from a review I wrote on Steam about the game, which I think perfectly encapsulates the <em>RimWorld </em>experience:</p><p>“I started an ice sheet challenge with a single colonist. Thanks to the abundance of mods, my colonist soon discovered a talking tree in the wastes. His mind was forever altered. It wasn’t long before the kindly Lafayette was muttering to himself and chanting in odd tongues. He began to worship Cthulu in the mountains - alone and with supplies dwindling. It mattered not. The old god required sustenance of his own. Raiders came to pillage; none survived. They were placed upon the sacrifice table and offered to the tentacled one.”</p><h2 id="h673900"><a id=""></a>New player tips to help you avoid a colony crisis</h2><figure id="" data-id="7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-recommend-id="image://7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A late-game base with storage and base defenses in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A late-game base with storage and base defenses in RimWorld." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ludeon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-recommend-id="image://7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A late-game base with storage and base defenses in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re a new player who recently picked up <em>RimWorld </em>on sale, I’m sorry. No, not welcome or ‘nice to have you here’. Just, I’m sorry. You’re about to either lose many, many hours of your free time or rage so hard as your first colony crumbles into dust that you’ll never pick up the game again.</p><p>If you’re in the former camp, then here are a few tips to help you survive the onslaught of Randy Random and Cassandra Classic:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Don’t hesitate to pause the game</strong>. While the default game speed isn’t overwhelmingly zippy, there’s a lot of map to explore, including under-mountain areas, colonists to manage, animals to hunt, and monsters to flee from. Your attention will be pulled in ten different directions simultaneously every few seconds, so pause to give yourself some breathing room.</li><li><strong>Defend your colony to the death</strong>. Upon crash-landing planetside, there are a few necessities to consider first: food, shelter, and safety. These three pillars are paramount to your colony’s success, but so many new players overlook safety. They think building in a mountain like a dwarf secures their existence. It doesn’t. You’ll want to consider traps, sandbags, etc.</li><li><strong>Build for efficiency, not aesthetics</strong>. Once you’re more experienced, then you’ll start designing bases that incorporate vibes or whatever Reddit says these days. For now, focus on efficiency. Wood burns, granite doesn’t. Your refrigerator and kitchen may remain in the same room to eliminate wasted time. Your Research Bench isn’t like other workbenches, in that it requires a sterile room to boost your colonists’ research rate, so separate it from the rest of the rabble.</li></ul><p>I could go on endlessly, but these tips will start you off strong.</p><h2 id="h673901"><a id=""></a>A look at <em>RimWorld</em>’s wild side: modding</h2><figure id="" data-id="f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-recommend-id="image://f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-format="png" data-width="1145" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A look at the front page of the RimWorld Workshop on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A look at the front page of the RimWorld Workshop on Steam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Ludeon Studios / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-recommend-id="image://f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-format="png" data-width="1145" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A look at the front page of the RimWorld Workshop on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>RimWorld </em>draws in tens of thousands of players daily and has an all-time peak player count of over 62,000. It’s safe to assume people love the game. And as it’s on PC, the modding community is obsessively active.

Anything you need or want, the modding community delivers!</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Quality of Life mods</strong>, such as better storage solutions, greater pawn control, pawn editors, an improved camera, and the must-haves, like interaction bubbles that add flavor to your characters.</li><li><strong>Content mods</strong>, such as additional weapons, vehicles, animals, workbenches, hygiene, oil production industries, sushi cooking, fishing, mining, refrigerators, a Roomba, giant crops straight out of Stardew Valley, and of course, anime women.</li><li><strong>Total conversion mods</strong>, such as for <em>Dune</em>, <em>The Witcher</em>, <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, <em>Killzone</em>, a medieval setting, a zombie apocalypse, and much more.</li><li><strong>Adult mods</strong>, such as…you know what, I checked out the offerings at Loverslab specifically for this bullet point, and I feel gross.

The Deck and Booster Pack art was also revealed, and they feature such characters as Daisy, Demona, Gaston, Simba, Megara, Judy Hopps, and Robin Hood.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winterspell Promises 'Flurries of Fun' With Stitch, Angel, and More</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/stitch-1753964680733.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Q1 2026, Disney Lorcana will be releasing Winterspell, a new expansion that promises "Flurries of Fun."

I didn't find anything particularly difficult."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Recently, a 73-year-old woman (playing as the pink version of Panda no less) beat a 73-year-old man in the finals of the Tekken 8 portion of the 11th biannual Amigo Club Cup, an esports competition for elderly care home residents in Japan. YouTube livestreams and videos of this feat have drawn attention to the event, and the benefits that gaming can give players, regardless of their age.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with Japanese news site <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/13/154970.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game*Spark</u></a>, the tournament’s winner, Yoshie Murabe revealed that she chose to main Panda purely for the reason that she likes the animal. Murabe picked the pink version of the character; however, opponents should not be fooled by this cute appearance. Murabe’s winning bout shows her taking good advantage of Panda’s slow yet powerful attacks, giving her the edge over her opponent Sadayuki Kato, who picked King as his fighter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Murabe revealed that Tekken 8 is the first video game she has played in her life and that she really enjoyed her tournament debut. Asked about her feelings while playing games and whether she found anything difficult, Murabe’s answer is equally badass: "I'm happy I won. I didn't find anything particularly difficult." She added that she'd really like to try playing other games competitively too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/screenshot-2025-07-31-151536-1753971354672.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">73-year-old Panda main Yoshie Murabe won the Tekken 8 tournament. Image credit: Care eSports / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/y0LlKhMAuZo?feature=shared">YouTube</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Murabe and her fellow geriatric gamers got the chance to throw punches in Tekken 8 thanks to an organization called the Care eSports Association. It was founded in 2019 to give elderly citizens in Japan a new way to engage with others during the pandemic. They started out with slow-paced video game versions of board games like Shogi and Othello, but then decided to shake things up by adding Tekken 8 into the mix, starting with the 9th edition of the tournament.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/13/154970.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game*Spark</u></a>’s interview with the Care eSports Association's PR rep Shimpei Hama, this came about due to his background as a pro Tekken 8 player (he is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ouiuUxYqxlHBi6GAtgTuA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rox3Gaming’s Hama-chan</u></a>). He decided it would be interesting to see how the seniors got on with Tekken 8. Hama said the elderly residents, some of whom have dementia, reported that they really enjoyed it. Many became attached to their characters, showing determination to win at least once, with some staying up late to practice in the run-up to tournaments. He also thanked the carers for their hard work in introducing their residents to video games and the concept of online tournaments. “None of this would have been possible without the dependable cooperation of the staff onsite,” Hama noted.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/screenshot-2025-07-31-151832-1753971530210.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yoshie started strong. Image credit: Care eSports / YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken 8 first showed up in the Amigo Club Cup as an exhibition match in the tournament’s 9th iteration back in June 2024. However the recent 11th tournament is the first time it has been played competitively by care home residents. Livestreams and videos of the matches were posted on Care eSports Association's official YouTube channel, attracting attention online. Acknowledging the views, Hama noted, “We received way more feedback than ever before,” with voice actors and streamers among those who praised the event. Champion Yoshie Murabe is actually one of the younger participants in the tournament — there was also a <a href="https://youtu.be/3j-MdwkihME?si=ZbAHEgi2p2RchJhg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>fast-paced match between two 93-year-old women playing as Lili and Steve</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the process of introducing Tekken 8 to the Amigo Club Cup, Hama realized that "care home residents are more interested in video games than I thought." He said they plan to continue to offer Shogi and Othello, but would also like to add other fighting games, as well as "games that everyone can enjoy more casually — something like Geoguessr." He noted that some residents were not keen on the idea of fighting in a game. Geoguessr, a non-violent Google Maps deduction game, would be a good way to engage more residents and help them to keep their brains sharp. At the moment, Care eSports Association’s activities are limited to three Japanese prefectures but they eventually aim to hold a national tournament (source: <a href="https://careesports.com/careesports/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Care eSports official website</u></a>).</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/screenshot-2025-07-31-152225-1753971751223.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yoshie ended up victorious.
