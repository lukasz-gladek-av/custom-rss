            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple has been ordered to pay a fine of&nbsp;€500 million and make changes to the way its iOS store works as part of its ongoing legal battle with&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio Epic Games.</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-is-breaking-the-law-by-charging-fees-for-steering-imposing-restrictions-on-third-party-stores" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Epic reveals that the European Commission has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1085" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">found</a>&nbsp;Apple to be in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires the iPhone maker to "inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store".</p>

<p>As part of the DMA, Apple must also "steer [customers] to those offers and allow them to make purchases", an obligation with which the European Commission believes Apple "fails to comply". The Commission says Apple "prevents app developers" from informing customers about alternative offers and distribution channels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apple-epic-european-commission-fortnite.jpg?itok=nL_9tJEl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apple-epic-european-commission-fortnite.jpg?itok=qPrGULfx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Apple's battle with Epic has resulted in another blow to the Cupertino tech giant.</figcaption></figure><p>Today's ruling means that Apple must "remove the technical and commercial restrictions on steering" (i.e. allowing developers to recommend other offers and non-iOS alternatives to customers) and "refrain from perpetuating the non-compliant conduct in the future".</p>

<p>According to Epic, changes Apple must make include the removal of fees imposed on purchases made outside of an iOS app, as well as the elimination of "restrictions on the language, style and flow that developers can use to link to their website or to access an alternative payment system".</p>

<p>If you need a reminder of where all this started, it's been running since 2020, when Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">decided to offer a discount</a> on in-game&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>purchases across all platforms, but only if using a new direct payment system introduced by the company at the time.</p>

<p>Apple took umbrage at this decision and removed&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>from the iOS App Store, prompting Epic to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines" rel="nofollow">file a lawsuit in response</a>. Google, the owner of the Android operating system, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">took similar measures</a> and was also sued by Epic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-mobile-epic-apple-european-commission.jpg?itok=pYA66nQy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-mobile-epic-apple-european-commission.jpg?itok=nia3XVmp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>All of this started as part of a row over alternative payment systems within&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on mobile.</figcaption></figure><p>The saga has essentially been running since then, but Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-victory-play-store" rel="nofollow">won another pretty significant victory</a> back in October, this time against Google. As part of the ongoing case, a judge ruled that Google must open up its Play Store to third-party apps and give "rival third-party app stores access to the full catalog of Google Play apps".</p>

<p>That ruling referred specifically to the Epic Games Store's availability on Android rather than alternative payment systems, but since Epic would rather funnel players through its own store and payment systems than Google or Apple's, it's all connected.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what today's ruling means for Epic and Apple in the future. In the meantime, you can still play <i>Fortnite&nbsp;</i>on mobile devices, although you'll need to download the Epic Games Store app to do so.</p>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the year’s biggest PlayStation 5 games is launching this fall: <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-comes-to-playstation-5-on-october-2/">Sony just announced</a> that <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253576/ghost-of-tsushima-2-yotei-ps5-pro-2025">Ghost of Yōtei</a></em> will hit the PS5 on October 2nd. The news was accompanied by a fresh trailer that’s mostly dramatic samurai cinematics, but also some brief glimpses of its bloody combat and traversing the beautiful landscape on horseback.</p><p>The follow up to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai">2020’s <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> from developer Sucker Punch, <em>Yōtei</em> features a new samurai protagonist called Atsu, who is, naturally, on a quest for revenge. The trailer introduces a gang of outlaws, and her ultimate goal is to find and eliminate all six. “One by one, she’s hunting them down to avenge her family,” the official description reads. “But while Atsu’s story begins with vengeance, she’ll find there’s more to her journey than just revenge. As she explores Ezo, Atsu will meet unlikely allies and forge connections that help give her a new sense of purpose.”</p><p>The game’s structure sounds fairly open, as Sony says “you’ll choose which leads to follow as you pick which Yōtei Six member you want to hunt down first.”</p><p><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> is one of s small number of major exclusives planned for the PS5 this year. It will follow the launch of <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610946/death-stranding-2-trailer-ps5-state-of-play-on-the-beach">which comes out on June 26th</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Choose your path—build an economy based on farming or profit from monster-slaying (either way, don’t forget to collect taxes). Recruit adventurers and send them on quests to kill, defend, explore, and more. After all, everyone knows the only thing adventurers love more than glory… is gold.</p><p>With no army and no budget, you’ll have to throw gold at every problem and hope your hired heroes survive long enough to gear up, grow stronger, and maybe evolve into something more. If they don’t? Feed them to the pet god-beast you found snacking on your supplies. It’s growing faster than expected—so raise it, teach it spells or tricks, pet it, brush it, and if necessary, discipline it. Treat it well, and it just might become a trusted companion on your journey. Run the town, fund the chaos, and hope your gold lasts longer than your heroes.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Give <a title="Platforms > Quest [138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s</strong> – Everyone knows that adventurers do not work for free.

Kill, defend, explore, and more!</li><li><strong>Recruit Unique <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,225 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>rs</strong> – Gold-thirsty adventurers will come from all corners of the world.

Create an economy based on either farming or monster-slaying, and watch as it evolves based on your <a title="Genres > Action [2,683 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. Whatever you choose, remember to collect your share of the taxes!</li><li><strong>Raise a Pet God-Beast</strong> – The pet you found snacking on your supplies seems to be growing more than expected. Far more. It might be wise to teach it what is right and wrong, before it grows too big to care about your opinions. Raise it, teach it spells or tricks, pet it, brush it, and if necessary discipline it. You might find that it becomes a trusted companion on your journey!</li><li><strong>Fight Monsters</strong> – As your adventurers clear the world of monsters, you can watch their pathetic struggle against the world. Be merciful and help them survive, get better items, and learn new skills… or feed them to your god-beast. Each level brings them one step closer towards a forbidden evolution.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Apple has been hit by a €500m (£429m) fine from the European Union for violations of its Digital Markets Act (DMA) - and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games, which has been warring with the iPhone manufacturer amidst the rollout of its own app store, has been quick to respond.
</p>
<p>
Today, both Apple and Facebook owner Meta have been handed the first major penalties to come from the DMA. Apple has been slapped for App Store practices. Meanwhile, Meta must pay €200m (£172m) over its advertising policies.
</p>
<p>
Issues with Apple's App Store centre on the company's policy of not allowing iPhone and iPad apps to mention or link to alternative storefronts or offers elsewhere - meaning customers are directed to spend solely via the App Store, where Apple takes its 30 percent cut.
</p>
<p>
This was a key issue behind Epic Games' original beef with the iPhone maker, when it launched the first strike in its now years-long war with both Apple and Google by slipping cheaper, direct payments into Fortnite (and swiftly getting booted from the App Store and Google Play as a result).
</p>
<p>
Apple has always argued that its baked-in storefront was the most secure option for users, and that opening up its systems to alternatives posed risks to itself and to customers. The company has said today it will appeal the decision.
</p>
<p>
"Under the DMA, app developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able to inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases," <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1085">the European Commission wrote today</a>, announcing its verdict.
</p>
<p>
"The Commission found that Apple fails to comply with this obligation. Due to a number of restrictions imposed by Apple, app developers cannot fully benefit from the advantages of alternative distribution channels outside the App Store. Similarly, consumers cannot fully benefit from alternative and cheaper offers as Apple prevents app developers from directly informing consumers of such offers. The company has failed to demonstrate that these restrictions are objectively necessary and proportionate."
</p>
<p>
On top of its fine, Apple has now been ordered to "remove the technical and commercial restrictions on steering and to refrain from perpetuating the non-compliant conduct in the future" within 60 days, or risk further fines.
</p>
<p>
And there's further bad news today for Apple as the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1086">European Commission has issued its preliminary findings on the company's "user choice obligations", as well as its controversial Core Technology Fee</a> - essentially a tax on major app store developers who choose to publish their games on alternative iPhone storefronts in regions (such as the EU) where Apple has been compelled to allow them.
</p>
<p>
"The Commission takes the preliminary view that Apple failed to comply with this obligation in view of the conditions it imposes on app (and app store) developers," it wrote. "Developers wanting to use alternative app distribution channels on iOS are disincentivised from doing so as this requires them to opt for business terms which include a new fee (Apple's Core Technology Fee). 
</p>
<p>
"Apple also introduced overly strict eligibility requirements, hampering developers' ability to distribute their apps through alternative channels. Finally, Apple makes it overly burdensome and confusing for end users to install apps when using such alternative app distribution channels."
</p>
<p>
These findings have now been passed to Apple, before further action is taken. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Apple for comment. 
</p>
<p>
"Apple is breaking the law by imposing illegal fees, scare screens and restrictions on purchases made outside the App Store," <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-is-breaking-the-law-by-charging-fees-for-steering-imposing-restrictions-on-third-party-stores?sessionInvalidated=true">Epic Games said in a statement today</a>, meanwhile. "Apple's pattern of malicious compliance must end the following technical and commercial restrictions: 
</p>
<p>
"Apple must allow apps downloaded from the App Store to steer customers to third party stores. Apple must not charge any fees on purchases that are made outside of an app. Apple must eliminate restrictions on the language, style and flow that developers can use to link to their website or to access an alternative payment system. In simple words: Apple must end the scare screens they pop up in front of Epic Games Store to deter customers from doing business with us.
</p>
<p>
"Apple must not track, surveil, or require developers to send Apple data about purchases that consumers make outside apps. Apple must allow developers to advertise lower prices and communicate directly with their customers."
</p>
<p>Back in January, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-set-to-pile-pressure-on-apple-and-google-app-store-dominance-as-fresh-investigation-launched">UK's Competition and Markets Authority announced a similar investigation into both Apple and Google,</a> backed by fresh powers granted under the recent Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Sucker Punch have announced the&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> release date, and it won't be long until you can check out the studio's sequel to&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</p>

<p>Per a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-comes-to-playstation-5-on-october-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025" rel="nofollow">first announced back in September</a>, will be launching exclusively for PlayStation 5 on October 2nd. If <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-announced-for-pc-with-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-unlocked-frame-rate-and" rel="nofollow">its predecessor</a> is anything to go by, however, we can probably expect a PC port somewhere down the line as well.</p>

<p>Pre-ordering the game will get you a special in-game mask and a set of PSN avatars, and multiple editions of the game will also be available, each of which comes with its own set of bonuses.</p>

<p>The Collector's Edition, meanwhile, gets you everything in the Digital Deluxe Edition, as well as "a replica display edition of Atsu's Ghost mask", which is made from resin and measures 6.8 by 5 by 5.9 inches.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you'll get a number of other goodies, including a replica sash inscribed with the members of&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>'s villainous Yōtei Six faction, plus a number of other great physical goodies. Sucker Punch&nbsp;says it considers this Collector's Edition "the best Collector's Edition we've ever produced".</p>

<p>All of this was announced alongside a brand new trailer that shows off the aforementioned&nbsp;Yōtei Six faction, as well as giving a couple of new glimpses into the game's world. You can check that trailer out here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, it's a followup to Sucker Punch's 2020 game&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. Taking place over three hundred years after the events of that game,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>follows Atsu, a woman on a quest to avenge her family against the Yōtei Six.</p>

<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on October 2nd.</p>

That’s a number that “far exceeds our expectations, and far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered from the My Nintendo Store on June 5th.”</p><p>In its first month on sale the original Switch <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/historical_data/index.html">sold 360,000 units in Japan</a>, suggesting that Nintendo is seeing six times the demand for its sequel. The Japanese demand for day one is almost as high as the 2.74 million Switch consoles the company sold worldwide in its first few weeks in 2017.</p><p>Furukawa didn’t say how many consoles Nintendo has ready for the launch, but only that “a significant number of customers” won’t be lucky in the My Nintendo Store lottery. Those who don’t get a console will be automatically re-entered into a second lottery, while third-party retailers in Japan will begin taking preorders tomorrow, April 24th. In Japan Nintendo is offering two versions of the Switch 2: a Japanese-only model for ¥49,980 (about $350) and a ¥69,980 (about $500) multilingual version which is exclusively available through the My Nintendo Store.</p><p>Preorders have already been open for several weeks in some parts of the world, including most of Europe, and stores have sold out fast. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">US preorders open tomorrow</a> for $449.99, following an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">initial delay</a> over tariff concerns.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Be swift, strategic, or wildly chaotic. Slip through like a shadow or crash in like a steel storm. <em>Haneda Girl</em> is a love letter to controlled chaos, precise gameplay, and the kind of bold design that defines Studio Koba’s DNA.</p><p>With its unique aesthetic, explosive mechanics, and a world that pulses with energy, <em>Haneda Girl</em> is built for both hardcore players and anyone who just wants to have a blast while tearing through digital enemies in style.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered - Official Full Reveal Presentation</p>
      </div>
<p>The ratings change was partially due to depictions of blood and gore that were more graphic in-game than initially anticipated, but the ESRB had also picked up on a partially nude female model that could be accessed in the PC version of the game using mods. This inclusion--however it ended up in the game's files--resulted in Oblivion getting a "Nudity" label until the offending files were patched out.</p><p>Oblivion Remastered has been rated under the original Oblivion ESRB listing, and so it has the same rating description as the original: Violence, Blood and Gore, Sexual Themes, Language, and Use of Alcohol. Despite getting the same rating, the remaster has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-and-different-in-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/" data-ref-id="2900-6492">number of changes</a> from the 2006 classic, including new lines of dialogue as well as plentiful quality-of-life changes.</p><p>Oblivion Remastered is out now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S, and is included on Game Pass for Xbox and PC. While Bethesda doesn't <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-install-oblivion-remastered-mods/1100-6531034/" data-ref-id="1100-6531034">officially support</a> mods for the remaster, it's still possible to mod the game, and the modding scene is lighting up.</p><p>If you're just getting started in Oblivion, or coming back to it after a long break, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">full walkthrough</a> for a guide to all aspects of the game.</p>

This morning, Bethesda shared a livestream showcasing the game and explaining their love for arguably the most important entry in the franchise, even if it is not necessarily the most popular. Virtuous developed the remastered version of the game. Bethesda's Todd Howard also made reference to the fact that work on the sixth Elder Scrolls is obviously continuing, but the stream was wholly focused on Oblivion.</p>

<p>The Remastered subtitle is almost as misnomer as footage of the game does make it look like a complete remake. Seeing screenshots and gameplay of the two games side by side shows a stark difference. Every asset was redesigned, and the Unreal Engine has allowed the team to create a significant overhaul in the lighting department. Lip-syncing has also been improved to, hopefully, make speech look better. All of the "quirky" dialogue remains, but new voiceover has been recorded to make the races feel more unique.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kk5cymSWmqo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Gameplay has also been addressed with significant changes to the game's feel, UI, and audio design. New effects and better enemy hit reaction should also make combat feel better. Sprinting has also been added to the game, despite internal debate about whether or not it should be included. The minigames, like lockpicking, however, remain mostly untouched.</p>

<p>Bethesda also confirmed that all of Oblivion's add-ons and expansions will be included, but the stream did not make reference to Oblivion's notorious horse armor.</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is available today on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>

			<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy has quite the history, this remake bringing back Benoit Sokal’s Amerzone from 1998, which itself was based on a comic strip from 1986. Amerzone was the first major adventure game Sokal was behind, setting the foundations for its better known cousin, Syberia. Microids’ remake has a lot to live up to from a reputational perspective, and it generally does.</p>
<p><iframe title="Amerzone: The Explorer's Legacy - Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q62WD2p-uaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy puts players in the shoes of a nameless journalist, who has their first big break with the opportunity to interview the explorer Alexandre Valembois. Valembois has agreed to speak about his trip to the mysterious South American country of Amerzone, which took place approximately 50 years prior to the events of the game. However, the invite for an interview takes a turn and it leads to the journalist embarking on a trip to Amerzone to return an egg.</p>



<p>This isn’t any old egg that you buy by the half-dozen, but one that ties into the mythology of the indigenous people of Amerzone, holding within it a unique species of bird that is believed to bring good luck to Amerzone. It may seem like a superstition, but since the egg left the country, Amerzone has fallen into a military dictatorship and the indigenous groups have been all but wiped out. Getting to Amerzone is no easy feat since the country’s borders are closed with any interlopers shot on sight. Luckily for the journalist, Valembois has built a vehicle called a Hydrofloat that has all sorts of modes that allows someone to travel from the Brittany coast of France to the secretive South American nation and within it too.</p>

<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy is the very definition of a point and click adventure game. There is no free movement for players. Instead you look in a direction where an arrow appears, press a button, and the character will move along a predetermined path on their own. You can watch the walking animation or choose to skip and be instantly be transported to the next location. In most areas, you will find items to interact with that will either be useful items that you put in your inventory or provide you with information.</p>

<p>You see, aside from attempting to return the egg to its rightful place the journalist is documenting their journey too. Along the way, different investigations will pop up and you can decide to dig further into these by exploring each location thoroughly or moving on and focusing on the main path. Naturally, you will come across items related to these side investigations, and most will draw you in. Amerzone’s environmental story telling is excellent providing a lot of contextual information so you can piece together what has happened in the past, whether it is to do with Valembois’ own story or something completely different.</p>
<p>Amerzone’s main story is fine and does move along at a decent pace. It has some good writing but there are moments which could have benefited from having a bit more of a build-up or not being quite so predictable. You can guess what will happen with the main story beats pretty early on, but with a game like this the journey is more important. The Traveler mode will have more documents and clues to find in the environment to help with puzzles, along with a hint system that will eventually give you the answer if you get stuck. The Adventurer mode, meanwhile, provides fewer clues meaning you will get stuck more often and have to connect the clues yourself to find solutions.</p>

<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy does look very good with environments that have lots of detail to them, from thick foliage in the jungles to some nicely designed beaches on Shipwreck Island. There are some minor performance issues here and there with a bit of stuttering, but on the whole the game performs fine too, and it’s hardly an issue for this style of game. Amerzone’s music is well done too with tunes that fit the atmosphere, though there are moments of silence that could have been filled with song.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy is a very good remake of an already well regarded puzzle game. While the story is a little predictable, it looks very good, the puzzles are well designed, and the environmental story telling is well constructed.	</p></div>

			<p>Ghost of Yotei will launch in early October on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, a new trailer shared today confirmed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVBLJYjSAhg&amp;t=2s">The new trailer</a>, which can be watched below, confirmed the game will launch on the current generation PlayStation consoles on October 2nd worldwide. Besides confirming the release date, the new trailer also provides a new look at the Yotei Six, gang members that Atsu has sworn to hunt down. Needless to say, the game is looking great and is a considerable step up from Ghost of Tsushima, which was originally released on PlayStation 4 and was later ported to PlayStation 5 and PC to offer improved visuals and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/ghost-of-yotei-launches-october-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>The Onryo’s List</strong></p><p>Alongside today’s news, we’ve also released our latest trailer for <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, “The Onryo’s List.” Sixteen years ago in the heart of Ezo (called Hokkaido in present day), a gang of outlaws known as the Yotei Six took everything from Atsu. They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived. She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito.</p><p>One by one, she’s hunting them down to avenge her family, armed with the same katana used to pin her to that burning tree all those years ago. But while Atsu’s story begins with vengeance, she’ll find there’s more to her journey than just revenge. As she explores Ezo, Atsu will meet unlikely allies and forge connections that help give her a new sense of purpose.</p><p>We hope the brief looks in today’s trailer give you a taste of what you can expect from <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. Beyond your first look at the Yotei Six, you’ll spot some of the gorgeous scenery of Ezo as well as a handful of Atsu’s new weapons, a few of her allies, and even a new gameplay mechanic that will allow you to glimpse Atsu’s past and understand everything that was taken from her.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But we’ve only scratched the surface. In <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, we’ve built upon and evolved the way you explore the open world, offering even more freedom and variety than in <em><a title="Games > Ghost of Tsushima [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a></em>. You’ll choose which leads to follow as you pick which Yotei Six member you want to hunt down first. Atsu can also track other dangerous targets and claim bounties, or seek out weapon sensei to learn new skills. Ezo is wild, and as deadly as it is beautiful. As you trek across the open world you’ll find unexpected dangers and peaceful reprieves (including some returning activities from Tsushima), and you’ll be able to build a campfire anywhere in the open world for a rest under the stars. We want you to have the freedom to explore Ezo however you decide to, and we can’t wait to share more.</p><p><strong>Pre-Orders</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ghost-of-Yotei_Pre-Orders_04-23-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><p>Today we can also reveal that pre-orders for <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> begin next week, on May 2 at 10:00 a.m. in your local time zone (10:00 a.m. ET for those in the United States), and you’ll be able to choose between multiple different editions, including our amazing Collector’s Edition.</p><p>First, if you pre-order any edition of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> you’ll receive a unique in-game mask, as well as a set of seven <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [47,430 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Network avatars featuring concept art of Atsu and each member of the Yotei Six at launch. Pre-orders on PlayStation Store will receive the avatars immediately.</p><p><strong>Standard Edition</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ghost-of-Yotei_Pre-Orders_04-23-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>The standard edition of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> will be $69.99 USD / £69.99 / €79.99 / ¥8,980 MSRP and will be available at retail or at PlayStation Store.</p><p><strong>Digital Deluxe Edition</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ghost-of-Yotei_Pre-Orders_04-23-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>At PlayStation Store, you’ll also be able to pre-order the <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Digital Deluxe Edition for $79.99 / £79.99 / €89.99 / ¥9,980 MSRP.</p><p>The Digital Deluxe Edition includes a digital copy of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> plus in-game bonuses including The Snake’s armor set, as well as an alternate dye for your starting armor. You’ll also receive a unique horse color and unique saddle dye, plus an in-game Charm, gold Sword Kit, and an early unlock of Traveler’s Maps, which allow you to find statues throughout the world to upgrade your skills.</p><p><strong>Collector’s Edition</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ghost-of-Yotei_Pre-Orders_04-23-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>Finally, we are thrilled to reveal the <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Collector’s Edition, which will be available for pre-order at <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Direct</a> in parts of the world where it is available, or at select retailers in other regions. Collector’s Edition pricing will be announced at a later date.</p><p>This packed edition includes all of the pre-order bonuses, all in-game items from the Digital Deluxe Edition, and a digital copy of the game, as well as a replica display edition of Atsu’s Ghost mask. The mask is built to-scale with Jin’s mask from our <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> Collector’s Edition. If you have both, they look great next to each other on a shelf! The mask measures 6.8 x 5 x 5.9 inches and is made of resin, plus includes its own display stand.</p><p>Also included is a replica of Atsu’s sash, complete with the names of all six members of the Yotei Six (but you’ll have to cross them off yourself). The sash measures 71 inches long and is made of a cotton blend, a perfect cosplay accessory or wall decoration.</p><p>There’s also a replica of the Tsuba from Atsu’s katana, forged by her father in the image of two twin wolves. This Tsuba measures roughly 3 x 3 inches and also includes its own display stand.</p><p>In addition to all of the above, the <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Collector’s Edition also includes a pouch of coins and instructions to play Zeni Hajiki, a game of skill you’ll play throughout <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. There’s also a foldable papercraft ginkgo tree along with a wolf at its base, and a set of four 5 x 7-inch art cards featuring the sash, the wolf, Atsu’s Ghost mask, and our key art.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developed by Sucker Punch Productions, the game is a sequel to the critically acclaimed Ghost Of Tsushima.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVBLJYjSAhg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PVBLJYjSAhg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-comes-to-playstation-5-on-october-2/" rel="nofollow ">In a blog post</a>, Sucker Punch revealed more about Ghost of Yotei's plot, which revolves around the protagonist Atsu hunting down the Yotei Six, a gang of outlaws who murdered her family. While Atsu was left for dead, she survived her encounter with the gang--made up of members known as the Snake, the Oni, the Kitsune, the Spider, the Dragon, and their leader Lord Seito--and she spent the next 16 years learning to fight. Armed with the same katana used to pin her to a burning tree, Atsu's story will see her explore Ezo and find new allies in her quest for revenge.</p><p>Sony also revealed the various editions for the game that will be available to preorder starting May 2. All preorders will come with several bonuses, including a unique in-game mask for Atsu to wear and a set of seven PSN avatars featuring concept art of Atsu and each member of the Yotei Six.</p><p>There'll be a $70 standard version of the game, and the Ghost of Yotei Digital Deluxe Edition is priced at $80. This one includes a digital download key for the game, The Snake's armor set, an alternate dye for your starting armor set, a unique horse color, a unique saddle dye, an in-game charm, a gold sword kit, and an early unlock of Traveler's Maps that can be used to find statues throughout Ezo. Discovering these will allow you to upgrade your skills more easily.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481014-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481014" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481014-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481014"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei Collector's Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481014-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition-3.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481015-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481016-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481015,1300-4481016" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4481015-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4481016-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition-2.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481015-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481016-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition-2.jpg"></figure><p>While its pricing hasn't been revealed yet, Sony did show off what the Ghost of Yotei Collector's Edition contains.

<p>Ghost of Yōtei will launch on Playstation 5 later this year, on 2nd October.</p>

<p>"It's been nearly five years since we shipped <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, and in that time we’ve been hard at work making Ghost of Yōtei something special," wrote Sucker Punch's Andrew Goldfarb, announcing today's release date news. </p>
<p>"While the stories are unrelated, it's important to us to make this a worthy follow-up to Jin's journey, and we can't wait for you to experience Atsu's quest for vengeance later this year."</p>
<p>The studio also released a new trailer for Ghost of Yōtei, which you can check out below.</p>
<p>This trailer gives us more insight into Atsu's aforementioned quest for vengeance. We already knew she was seeking revenge for her ravaged home and family life, but now we know just <em>who </em>it is she is hunting down - that would be a gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six.</p>
<p>"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived. She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito," Sucker Punch teases.</p>

<p>Today's trailer is but a small taste of what players can expect on Ghost of Yōtei's release, the developer added. Sucker Punch previously said it is going to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-will-have-a-less-repetitive-open-world">Ghost of Yōtei has a less repetitive open world compared to its predecessor</a>, with criticisms for Ghost of Tsushima often directed at its somewhat repetitive activities, so this remark is in keeping with the studio's overall plan for the sequel.</p>
<p>Those interested in pre-ordering Ghost of Yōtei will be able to do so from next week, with those pre-orders starting on 2nd May (how is it May next week?!). As is the case with many releases these days, there will be a number of different editions to choose from. </p>
<p>Regardless of which edition you plump for, those who do pre-order will receive a unique in-game mask, as well as a set of seven PSN avatars featuring concept art of Atsu and each member of the Yōtei Six (see below).

<p>Anyway, onto those editions, and what they include. The standard edition of Ghost of Yōtei which includes the game (obviously) will retail for £69.99 / €79.99. This edition will be available at certain retailers or via the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p>A Digital Deluxe Edition of Ghost of Yōtei will also be available for  £79.99 / €89.99. This chap will have the game itself, as well as some bonuses such as The Snake's armor set, as well as an alternate dye for your starting armour. </p>
<p>
Ghost of Yōtei's  Digital Deluxe Edition will also come with a unique horse color and unique saddle dye, as well as an in-game Charm, gold Sword Kit, and an early unlock of Traveler’s Maps. These will help you find statues throughout the world, which in turn will be useful for upgrading your skills.

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-update-sparks-speculation-of-new-in-game-economy-and-bounty-system">Sucker Punch said it remained committed to Ghost of Yōtei's 2025 release window</a> on PS5. </p>
<p>There had been some speculation the studio and PlayStation may nudge it back a touch to make way for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">a game many expect will dominate the gaming landscape when it releases this autumn</a> (unless it gets delayed).

            <p>After plenty of rumours, speculation and leaks, Bethesda finally announced and released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">spruced up version of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion last night</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after this, the studio stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">there was no official mod support for its Oblivion remaster</a>, but that hasn't stopped plenty of players already releasing mods for it anyway.</p>

<p>As highlighted over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k5pezw/oblivion_remastered_theres_already_over_70_mods/?share_id=JAyEZRfoDcy1hdxfTtsPb&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">reddit</a>, in just 11 hours after the game was released, there were already over 70 mods available for Oblivion Remastered players to choose from.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are currently 96 Oblivion Remastered mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivionremastered/mods?sort=updatedAt&amp;page=1">available on Nexus Mods</a> (at least as I can see while not being logged in), but I suspect it will soon pass 100.</p>
<p>These mods include things like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/100">Faster (And Slower) Levelling</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/97">Slower Item Degradation</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/13">improved HUDs</a>. There's also the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/15">Adoring Fan desktop shortcut icon replacer</a>, because <em>of course </em>he is going to pop up.</p>
<p>So, yes, people have certainly been busy since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> debuted yesterday. Meanwhile, I am sitting here just chuffed that I have at least managed to get it installed on my Xbox in the time since last night.</p>

<p>Away from my not-very-impressive-Xbox-flex, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered has pulled in some impressive player numbers for Bethesda and co-developer Virtuos on Steam, where it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam">has an 182,298 concurrent player peak so far</a>. Are you one of them?</p>
<p>Earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mods released today introduce two new full-fledged playable characters as well as new abilities for playable Sephiroth.</p>
<p>Following the video preview shared <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-playahble-characters-pc/">last week</a>, D3DNieR released today on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> a new <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=description">mod</a> that introduces playable versions of Reno and Rude. The two new characters, which replace Cloud and Tifa, have some small issues, but they feel like proper playable characters with some unique mechanics, such as Rude's ability to use more basic attacks after using the Unbridled Strength skill, the ability to cancel some animations by pressing the strong attack button, a counterattack, and much more.</p>
<p>While Sephiroth has been made playable past the flashback sequence at the beginning of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth already, his moveset is considerably limited compared to the other playable characters. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/980?tab=videos">The new mod</a> released by Eulymedon today, however, partially addresses this issue by introducing abilities taken from the boss version of Sephiroth, including Heartless Angel, Errant Whisper, Wicked Augment, and more. You can check how these abilities work in the video below.</p>

			<p>Ghost of Yotei has been rated in Taiwan today, suggesting that, judging from some precedents, the game may not be too far from release.</p>
<p>As reported by Gematsu, the second entry in the series developed by Sucker Punch received an R rating for violence, tobacco and alcohol and inappropriate language, which was predictable looking at the first entry in the series. While the rating also highlights how a launch date has not been revealed yet, we are likely going to hear more about it very soon, as not much time usually passes from the first ratings in Asian countries to the release date announcements. For Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, another big PlayStation 5 exclusive launching in 2025, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/">launch date</a> was confirmed a little over a month after the game was rated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/">South Korea.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ghost of Yotei has been rated in Taiwan.</p>

<p>— Gematsu (@gematsu) <a href="https://twitter.com/gematsu/status/1914870872667488508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We haven't seen much of Ghost of Yotei since its announcement last year. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gets-new-details-from-official-website/">Back in March</a>, the game's official website confirmed some details regarding the new protagonist, Atsu, and some new gameplay mechanics, including new weapons like the odachi, kusarigama, and dual katanas, more varied environments that players will be able to take advantage of, and more.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei is scheduled to release in 2025 on PlayStation 5. A PC version has yet to be officially announced, though there's little doubt that a port will be coming at some point.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenderfoot-tactics">Tenderfoot Tactics</a> is a wistful and dreamlike turn-based indie that I had a real soft spot for the year it released. It's still available on Steam and well worth a look, but won't be available on the Xbox Store from today. In an act of solidarity with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">BDS boycott of Microsoft</a> following their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/23/israeli-military-gaza-war-microsoft">reported connections with the Israeli military</a>, the development team have removed their game from sale on Microsoft's storefronts.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The Tenderfoot Tactics team has decided to remove our game from sale on Xbox in solidarity with the Palestinian-lead Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign," wrote designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sonofbadru.bsky.social/post/3lngim3mjzc2x">badru on Bluesky</a> (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/rpg-tenderfoot-tactics-removed-from-xbox-store-in-solidarity-with-pro-palestine-boycott-we-call-on-others-in-our-community-to-do-whatever-they-can-to-fight-this-historic-injustice/">thanks, PC Gamer</a>). "We hope that Microsoft will listen to the voices of their workers and customers and stop all business with the criminal Israeli military, which we have watched conduct an open genocide in Gaza over the last 18 months".</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-fire-employees-who-protested-the-sale-of-genai-tech-to-the-israeli-military">Microsoft fired two software engineers</a> who protested against the company's business with the Israeli military. "We provide many avenues for all voices to be heard. Importantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate," said Microsoft in a statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/microsoft-fires-employees-protesting-israeli-militarys-use-of-companys-ai-tech/">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-has-israels-gaza-offensive-killed-2025-01-15/">Gaza's Ministry Of Health puts the current Palestinian death toll</a> at more than 50,000 since October 7th, 2023, although Israel <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx25x35476yo">has disputed those figures</a>. The BDS movement have called Microsoft "perhaps the most complicit tech company in Israel's illegal apartheid regime and ongoing genocide against 2.3 million Palestinians".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
