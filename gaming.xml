		<p>If I had enrolled in one of Dr. Jones’ courses at Marshall College, I’d probably have demanded my money back. Oh sure, he knows his stuff, and his passion for archaeology and preserving stuff in museums is without doubt, but his impromptu field work probably means that he barely spends any time doing the <em>actual</em> teaching you’d expect him to. It should come as no surprise that, after a break-in at Marshall College by a very, very, very tall man, he takes that as an excuse to go gallivanting once again in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gamescom Date Reveal Trailer - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/STrKl828Aeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s address the priceless porcelain elephant in the room, because if there’s one element that has proven to be rather divisive since Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s reveal, it’s the mixed first and third-person views that MachineGames has leant upon for this game. Given how Indiana Jones helped inspire the third-person action of Tomb Raider and Uncharted, it would have been very natural for it to come full circle with third-person adventuring – after all, that’s what we saw in Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb, two decades ago – but that’s not MachineGames’ speciality, so they’ve gone predominantly first-person instead.</p>


<p>In fact, the game is probably 99% first person, with the only brief cuts to third-person coming when swinging on Indy’s trademark whip, pulling himself up to a ledge or a little bit of climbing. It works decently well, but I’d personally argue that they could ditch third-person entirely – we’ve had countless examples like Dishonored, Mirror’s Edge and more that have special abilities and slick movement entirely in first-person, and Indy’s just a dude who does a bit of clambering and swinging in comparison.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle quickly grabbed my attention as I played through the opening stages. There’s a really intriguing blend of linear and open levels, of action, stealth and puzzles, all wrapped up in the pulpy action adventuring of a classic Indiana Jones story.</p>

<p>Investigating the nighttime break-in at Marshall College is a quick prologue and introduction to the wider story, a familiar starting point as you and Marcus Brody try to figure out what was stolen and who did it. Crucial clues then see Indy immediately packing to head off to the Vatican –&nbsp;it’s alright, someone else can fill in for his classes.</p>

<p>Messaging a good friend in the clergy en route, it’s clear that this won’t be a haven of safety for an inquisitive American. Set shortly after Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1937, it’s the height of fascism in pre-WW2 Europe, and the Vatican is now flooded with patrolling Blackshirts that you have to sneak (or clobber) your way past.</p>
<p>You can absolutely use stealth to your advantage, hunkering down behind objects and out of sight, picking up objects and throwing them to cause distractions for you to move to other cover, but this isn’t Splinter Cell. Stealth is often more of a prelude to some robust and rambunctious brawling, without the ability to attach to cover or do corner takedowns, so you’ll invariably resort to fisticuffs at some point with left and right hooks, blocking incoming swings to let you counter, and grabbing items to wallop enemies with. Each item will break after just a few hits, whether it’s a rake or a bell that makes a delightful clanging sound as you clobber someone over the head –&nbsp;even more satisfying if it’s a canned takedown from behind.</p>
<p>One thing I didn’t really latch onto was using the whip for anything but traversal. In the moment, I was happier to wallop enemies instead, but that’s something I’ll have to remind myself to do for the full game.</p>

<p>You can, of course, resort to firearms as well, whether that’s Indy’s revolver or grabbing a dropped gun from an enemy. Don’t expect a Doom-like arsenal of guns to be stuffed into Indy’s back pocket, or even a Halo-style two-gun limit. This is more like the Mirror’s Edge of having just the clip that’s in a gun before you need to drop it – though you can also use empty rifles to hit people, which is a little amusing.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t tell you what you need to know about the gunplay, then the other thing is that a straight up headshot won’t kill an enemy, even if they’re not wearing a helmet. It took me by surprise while playing, but it makes sense. Two shots to kill at the default difficulty will encourage more of a stealthy approach and lead to more brawling.</p>
<p>You’re nicely rewarded for exploring the nooks and crannies of levels, with MachineGames having snuck a bunch of little side puzzles and secrets in. It makes you feel clever when you root around on a guy’s desk and find a note talking about some kind of iconoggraphy, only to spot that particular motif and realise that it’s the trigger for a secret passageway.</p>
<p>You’ll also be on the hunt for the books that feed the character progression. You need to then action those books by spending Adventure Points that you’ve collected for performing various feats and mission goals, mind you, but there’s some nifty abilities, such as Punch Out restoring stamina with a KO, Lucky Hat giving Indy another chance after being downed himself, if he can just drag himself across the floor to reach his fedora, and plenty more besides.</p>

<p>The trip through to the Vatican was a fairly directed and linear level, but jumping ahead to a visit to a dig site at Gizeh showed off the other side to this Indiana Jones game. This presents a much broader region to explore, with a workers’ camp that’s a safe haven to return to with Dame Nawal a handy ally to give you the main mission, a small village, and then a whole host of dig sites around the Sphinx.</p>
<p>It took a while to realise that the game wasn’t going to hold my hand here, shepherding me through to important events and mission objectives, wrapping me up in a disguise to get past German guards patrolling the desert. As I first stepped out of the camp, I was immediately confronted and found myself in a scrap, though a little more care meant I was more than able to avoid patrols. It’s only a fair bit later (and thanks to a set of handy pointers for this preview event) that I could grab and don some worker’s garb, from well away from the action –&nbsp;a little odd that I couldn’t get any at the camp or village, though.</p>
<p>The main goal is to figure out what Voss is after and foil his plan, with this adventure’s companion Gina manning a radio back in Dame Nawal’s tent. While waiting for the opportunity to sneak in, Nawal gives you the goal of preventing the wider pillaging of historical artifacts, namely a set to stone stelae that absolutely belong in a museum.</p>

<p>Following the clues to these locations takes you around this map, to underground passages and ancient structures. Some are single room puzzles –&nbsp;a room filled with angry scorpions needs you to waft a torch at them, another needs use of a lighter to clear a pitch black and completely overgrown passage –&nbsp;but then there are the much, much larger digs, a site that’s almost very flooded and with the Germans having to make do with too few pumps and generators. While they’re distracted, you can sneak in, get some clobbering done, a little bit of light electrocution by turning generators back on, and finally get access to a little puzzle chamber to reveal another stele.</p>
<p>There’s a nice flow to it, though I also found myself completely backed into a corner at one point, a half-loaded rifle in hand and half a dozen guards that I’d previously skirted past now heading down to figure out what the fuss was about. It took a few goes to get out of that scrappy situation, and it wasn’t a pretty fight!</p>

<p>Through it all, there’s a sense that MachineGames has really understood the charm and appeal of the Indiana Jones films. The cutscenes are impeccably rendered, Troy Baker doing a good job of channelling a younger Harrison Ford (though still occasionally sounding more like himself), and with some light humour that largely works quite well.</p>
<p>I do think that the first person gameplay will remain a sticking point for some. There’s a different style and scale to how you interact with a game world in first person over third person, a need for greater precision in your controls when trying to target and interact with things, and a closeness that perhaps highlights the game-y way that characters walk, talk and act outside of cutscenes, but I’m fine with that. The films are pulpy fun, so this can be a game-y game.</p>
<p>And in general, I’m rather keen to see how this full adventure comes together. MachineGames are taking a less obvious path, but that’s going to lead to a much more individual and distinctive game and journey. And if you’re going to trust anyone to make a game that’s a lot to do with beating up fascists, it’s probably them!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-lords-of-the-fallen-enhancements-revealed-more-updates-planned-sequel-teased.1021974/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lords-of-the-fallen-enhancements-revealed-more-updates-planned-sequel-teased/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The details of the PS5 Pro enhancement patch coming to Lords of the Fallen have been shared by developer Hexworks. Here's what they shared with fans in the new press release:</p>
<p><em>The PS5 Pro version of Lords of the Fallen allows players to experience the game with a 40% increase in pixel density over the base PlayStation 5 console, resulting in a sharper image and finer details. Performance Mode delivers rich visual detail at 4K60 (upscaled from 1440p) with a fluid 60 frames per second, sharper distant details, and refined textures on characters and environments. For those prioritizing visual fidelity, Quality Mode runs at native 4K30, showcasing intricate visuals across the dual realms of Axiom and Umbral at a stable 30 FPS.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, the developers have also teased that further updates and enhancements are planned for the game as a whole, mainly inspired by feedback received from the community. This is a bit of a surprise, as we believed no further patches would be coming for Lords of the Fallen, given that Hexworks is already working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-gets-first-details-elevated-production-values-gameplay-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a> scheduled to launch in 2026.</p>
<p>Speaking of Lords of the Fallen 2, Gamereactor has just <a href="http://0.10.211.177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> an interview with Hexworks head of art Javier García Lajara, who talked about the first installment as well as the upcoming sequel:</p>
<p><em>In a month, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-sold-1-million-units-in-10-days-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> a million copies sold, and after that we kept working on several updates and post-launch content for several months. We are around one million and a half more or less. I don't have the final numbers but it should be like that. Unfortunately we haven't had a perfect launch, mainly on PC. The PC market is full of different specs. You can run the game on a pretty beefy machine or you can have a low-end PC, and our game needs to run on both platforms, so we were trying to fix all these problems after launch and we spent several months doing that. I think we managed to do it and the game right now is a completely new experience. I think it's worth it to try again if you had problems on launch.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>For Lords of the Fallen 2, we are not only keeping the dual realm mechanics; we are improving it, and we are leveraging on what we do there. I can't say too much about that. Epic joined the ship to funding the project and we are using of course Unreal Engine 5.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doloc-town-is-a-pixel-art-farming-sim-with-a-platforming-twist.1021971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doloc-town-farming-sim-bullet-hell<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer RedSaw Games and publisher Logoi have announced&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town</em>, a cozy pixel art farming sim with a spicy bullet hell and platforming twist, and you can check it out on Steam now.</p>

<p>In a press release, RedSaw and Logoi say&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>takes place "amidst the remnants of civilization", not unlike Pathea's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-skipping-early-access"><em>My Time&nbsp;</em>series</a>, although it's fair to say&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>is decidedly less idyllic than those games are.</p>

<p>You'll get the chance to build up "automated production systems" on a farm where you can cultivate crops and build facilities, all while you're contending with post-apocalyptic weather conditions like acid rain.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doloc-town-farming-sim-platformer-rainy-forest.jpg?itok=EwApMZJ4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doloc-town-farming-sim-platformer-rainy-forest.jpg?itok=5f92FLkN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>looks to be a moody yet cozy post-apocalyptic farming sim.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what makes&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>stand out amongst a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fields-of-mistria-roadmap">bevy</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-release-date">other</a> cozy <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/my-time-at-sandrock">farming sims</a> on the market right now (or about to be on the market, anyway), the answer could well lie in the game's combat systems.</p>

<p>Rather uniquely,&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town</em>'s combat takes influence from platformers and bullet hell shooters. RedSaw says you'll be able to use "guns and...auxiliary combat drones" to help you battle "dangerous creatures".</p>

<p>Don't worry if you're not much of a bullet hell fiend, though; RedSaw says that the game's customization will allow "flexible combat styles", so you shouldn't need to fret about not having perfect reflexes.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town</em>, which also gives a sense of the game's&nbsp;very&nbsp;<em>Cave Story</em>-esque pixel art aesthetic, right here.</p>




<p>If your interest has been piqued by&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>and you'd like to check it out, then you're in luck; a demo of the game is available right now via Steam, so you can give it a go and see whether it's for you or not.</p>

<p><em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it does land, it'll arrive <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2285550/Doloc_Town/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

So it’s always been incredibly ironic that the actor who played him was caught partaking in one of the more violent and shameful moments in American history. If there were a January 6 riot inside the universe of Bob’s Burgers, you know Jimmy Pesto would have been in the thick of it as well. </p><p>This week’s sentencing falls short of the 18 months requested by federal prosecutors, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/comedian-anchorman-mr-show-sentenced-jan-6-capitol-attack-rcna177642&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/comedian-anchorman-mr-show-sentenced-jan-6-capitol-attack-rcna177642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News reports</a></span>, but is still well above what Johnston’s lawyers were seeking. The sentencing memo claims the Hollywood actor was far from just a bystander at the riot and was instead inside Congress pushing forward with the rest of the mob, at one point wielding a riot shield against police in the tunnels beneath the building. Johnston’s lawyer, meanwhile, claimed he was being disproportionally targeted due to his fame. </p><p>Despite the attack on the Capitol taking place in January 2021, the actor wasn’t arrested until June 2023, after which he pled guilty. Federal prosecutors also shared a photo as part of sentencing that showed Johnston dressing up as QAnon Shaman more than a year after the riots. </p><p><em>Bob’s Burgers</em> didn’t replace Johnston until late 2023, after he had already been arrested, with the character being left out of seasons 12 and 13. Jimmy Pesto is now played by Eric Bauza, who debuted in season 14 and had previously done voice work for cartoon characters like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. <em>Bob’s Burgers </em>just entered its 15th season last month. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As SAG-AFTRA’s strike against video game companies continues, the guild has just signed a new deal with Ethovox to protect performers in the AI age. Ethovox is currently working on a consensual, foundational A.I. voice model to ensure performers will be “protected and compensated fairly” while their model reflects their “commitment to diversity and inclusion”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/new-sag-aftra-and-ethovox-agreement-empowers-actors-and-secures-essential-ai-guardrails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deal</a> between SAG-AFTRA and Ethovox ensures that the artist will receive “both session fees and ongoing revenue sharing for the life of the foundational model.” The guild’s National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, stated that during the A.I. age, the performers required “more contractual protection, not less” to safeguard their livelihoods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Duncan Crabtree-Ireland stated, “SAG-AFTRA will continue to recognize AI companies, like Ethovox, that agree with our union’s AI guidelines.” Duncan acknowledged that not every performer would want to work with an AI company; however, those who intend to do so will have an agreement that secures “informed consent” and provides “fair compensation.”</p>



<p>Ethovox CEO Cissy Jones stated, “Ethovox is the only voice A.I. company owned and managed by voice actors, and we are pleased to be partnering with SAG-AFTRA on building a foundational voice A.I. model that prioritizes the interests of voice actors.”</p>



<p>Jones adds that “A.I. should be a choice”. Hence, Ethovox has been reaching out to the voice actor community during the entire process and will demonstrate fair compensation and ethical A.I. development in the future.&nbsp;</p>

Nintendo keeps these mature titles separate from its general N64 collection which includes more family friendly classics such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, F-Zero X, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Top 10 N64 Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadow Man arrived in 1999 as a 3D Metroidvania where players take on the role of Michael LeRoi as he joins a lineage of spiritual warriors who protect the land of the living from supernatural threats. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/07/shadow-man-review">IGN's 1999 review awarded Shadow Man an 8/10</a>, saying "fans of dark storytelling and action hounds alike will find a lot to praise here."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil was released a year earlier and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/12/12/turok-2-seeds-of-evil-2">earned a 9/10 in IGN's review</a>.

"But we just have to do it," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It isn't really the game itself that we're behind on, it's a bunch of server side infrastructure work that is taking us a lot longer than we expected," Rogers said. He explained he didn't realise how much work was involved in making both the original game and Path of Exile 2 compatible, so things like players' paid content isn't lost.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">In order to ensure a smooth launch, Path of Exile 2's Early Access will be delayed for 3 weeks. The new date is December 6th PST.

"I actually believe that we could possibly have made the original launch date. but I'm no longer confident we could do it without making mistakes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those looking forward to Path of Exilies 2 can at least expect a stream with major updates in around four weeks, Rogers said, meaning roughly November 26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Path of Exiles 2 is the sequel to the beloved free to play action role-playing game from Grinding Gear Games, coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC. Set years after the original Path of Exile, up to six player can return to the dark world of Wraeclast together and seek to end the corruption that is spreading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-gets-better-every-time-i-play-it">IGN's previews of the game have been very positive so far</a>. "Based on what [we've] played over the last several months, this is shaping up to be a game you should not miss," we said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

<section><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a confident display of developer MachineGames' toolset, as well an understanding of not just what it feels like to be Indy, but what it means to be him.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Trailers for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have nailed the tone of the franchise. The triumphant John Williams theme song, Harrison Ford's sly smirk, all accompanied with the crack of a whip and the distant howl of a Wilhelm scream. These are stylistic staples in the 43-year-old franchise that has had five films, a handful of games, and a TV show. There's no doubt that developer MachineGames understands the look and feel of Indy, but questions have lingered around its ability to capture <em>playing </em>as the globetrotter. Now that I've had some hands-on time with the game, it's clear to me MachineGames understands more than just the aesthetic of Indiana Jones, but also what it means to <em>be</em> Indiana Jones. The result is a promising prospect not just for fans of the franchise, but the adventure genre as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking place between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, The Great Circle sees the titular character a year removed from his globe-trotting adventures, having been teaching archaeology at the fictional Marshall College in the interim. At the beginning of my hands-on time, I wasn't thrust instantly into a big action set piece, but instead I got to walk around as Dr. Henry Walton Jones Jr. the professor, rather than Indiana Jones the adventurer. This is an important distinction, as it presented a more relatable tone with the character, and a steady sense of pacing that allowed me to take in its environments rather than run through them--characteristics I was happy to see present for the entirety of my 90 minutes of hands-on time, all the way from Marshall College to the mini-sandbox of Giza.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391652-q5zvdkjg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4391652" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="800" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391652-q5zvdkjg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4391652"></a><figcaption>Playing as Dr. Jones the professor, rather than Indiana Jones the adventurer, presents a more grounded tone.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391652-q5zvdkjg.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Dr. Jones's time-off from adventuring is put to an end, however, when he comes face-to-face with a towering intruder, portrayed by the menacing presence of Tony Todd, who steals an artifact from the college's gallery and beats the crap out of Jones. With an artifact gone and its mystery thief on the run, Professor Jones hangs up the tweed sports coat in exchange for his brown leather jacket and fedora.</p><p dir="ltr">Before heading across the world on a new adventure, I was allowed to spend more time in the college, where I was able to explore a side of Indy--or Dr. Jones the professor, rather--that I had only seen glimpses of in the films. I was left to clean up the thief's mess, picking up artifacts and placing them back in their rightful cases based on historical cues like hieroglyphics, playing like an environmental riddle and laying the seeds for the importance of observation for the puzzles to come.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's first-person perspective made looking at the artifacts in Indy's hands feel more tangible and immersive. Even inspecting Indy's notebook--which you do often--feels seamless, as he opens it in front of you without pausing the game, so you can look at maps and notes in real-time without covering your viewpoint, allowing you to still observe and walk around the environment.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p>MachineGames understands more than just the aesthetic of Indiana Jones, but also what it means to <em>be</em> Indiana Jones</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">It was during this time as Dr. Jones that the game reinforced this Clark Kent/Superman-like theme; that Dr. Jones is a mere alter ego to the larger-than-life adventurer Indiana Jones. It's a motif that came up later in the preview, when an old friend of Indy's didn't recognize him without his glasses, tweed suit, and bowtie. It feels intentional, especially in a particular scene when Indy puts his hat on, accompanied with the swelling notes of a John Williams-like score. The scene had the same effect as Christopher Reeves's Clark Kent taking off his glasses and standing up straight to reveal he is Superman (which <em>also</em> features a John Williams score). It's a simple trick, maybe even corny, but was effective enough to put a smile on my face. It's moments like this that, while small, capture the character's whimsy spirit better than even some of its own films do at times. Impressively, whether it's playing as the college professor or the scrappy world explorer, that same spirit seems to be infused through every element of gameplay, especially in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite those Superman comparisons, Indiana Jones is not indestructible. And I learned quickly that taking on enemies face-to-face or fist-to-fist was rarely the best course of action. On one hand, clobberin' guys with punches feels appropriately cumbersome. There's a weightiness to it that can feel satisfying when blocking an opponent's punch, which can then be followed with an equally rewarding well-executed right hook to the face that leaves their face more and more swollen with each blow. On the other hand, however, combat often felt claustrophobic due to the first-person perspective, which led to rather clumsy brawls that can quickly become chaotic when taking on more than one enemy. My feelings could change after the full release, when I can play at my own pace rather than feeling the pressure of a preview event where my time with the game is limited. For now, I think of it as less a criticism and more of an indication that there is a learning curve in understanding my limits as Indiana Jones, which in turn encouraged me to be more creative in how I approached combat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391650-vlt3e8m9.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4391650" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391650-vlt3e8m9.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4391650"></a><figcaption>Clobberin' time.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391650-vlt3e8m9.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, there's a lot of player expression in how you can approach a fight--or how you can avoid them entirely thanks to the game's excellent stealth system. After learning I wasn't the best at hand-to-hand combat, I fell into a rhythm of finding items around me, whether it was shovel, an empty bottle, or a guitar, and using those to wail on those damned Nazis. I also found this fighting method to be genuinely funny, as I often used my whip to knock a weapon out of an enemy's hand, only to snag it for myself and beat them to a pulp with it. It didn't get old.</p><p dir="ltr">As Indiana Jones, you also have a pistol. But, to my surprise, I was extremely reluctant to use it. When I had to shoot my way out of a situation, it felt as if I was admitting I had run out of ideas--a feeling I had never felt in MachineGames' other Nazi-killing game, Wolfenstien. This is one of the strongest examples of how MachineGames has honed in on the spirit of being Indiana Jones: Sure, Indy has shot and killed his share of people in the films, but it's always secondary to his improvisational fighting antics, and this is exemplified by the game's design rather than ever explicitly telling me how to play, or overloading me with ammunition.</p><p dir="ltr">From the tight halls of the Vatican to the open areas of Giza, the game presented me multiple solutions to every combat encounter, whether it was a clean break to escape, a frying pan in arm's reach, finding a disguise, or just an old-fashioned brawl. Pulling out a gun was the equivalent of descending into panic and using it only brought more unwanted attention to me.</p><p dir="ltr">To my surprise, shooting a Nazi in the face didn't feel nearly as rewarding as yanking a bad guy's feet from under him and watching him get knocked out cold from smashing his face into a chair. This reliance on guns is further de-emphasized by allowing each gun to also be used as a melee weapon. Once, when facing-off against a Nazi with a machine gun, I yanked the gun from their hands, picked it up, flipped it upside down, and swung it right into their face.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p>Sneaking around the Vatican, scouting alternate routes, and taking out enemies, in my own unique way, gave my Dishonored itch a well-needed scratch</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">With the amount of variety I was given to tackle any given situation, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has more in common with the immersive-sim genre than I expected. MachineGames worked in collaboration with sister studio Arkane for Wolfenstein: Youngblood, which featured a more open-ended approach to design than previous Wolfenstein games, and there seems to be a knock-on effect present in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle as a result. Sneaking around the Vatican, scouting alternate routes, and taking out enemies, in my own unique way, gave my Dishonored itch a well-needed scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">The Great Circle takes an approach to level-based worlds that is similar to Dishonored--open areas are filled with side missions and secrets to explore, which the player can return to anytime, and are non-linear in their design. One of the more open-ended areas I got to explore was Giza: a vast open desert with pyramids to explore, Nazis camps to sneak around, and shabby markets to purchase items from. While Giza was completely open for me to roam around, I was only able to see about a fourth of it due to time constraints, so I barely scratched the surface of what it had to offer. It was in this area that I got the most out of the game's other two tools: the camera and the notebook. Due to this section's non-linearity, the notebook was vital in keeping track of Field Works (side missions), as well as collecting pictures I had taken, which provide context regarding points of interests and characters you meet along the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391647-u37v36pb.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4391647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391647-u37v36pb.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4391647"></a><figcaption>Indiana Jones's journal is a nifty sidekick in your grand adventure.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391647-u37v36pb.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Filling out Indy's notebook gave me a sense of agency akin to Alan Wake 2's evidence board. By taking pictures myself, I had an active role in digesting the game's information, and in turn, feeling more involved in the story and objectives. This was a feature I loved in Alan Wake 2, as it made me a participant in organizing evidence, rather than an in-game notebook automatically populating itself. In Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, I had a similar feeling. Every time I took a picture of a point of interest, my natural reaction was to open my notebook and observe the photo and its information, making it more like a companion than a checklist tracker.</p><p dir="ltr">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle feels like an amalgam of many genres but appears to be striking the right balance between them, all in favor of honoring the spirit of Indiana Jones, the archaeology professor <em>and</em> adventurer. While 90 minutes wasn't enough time to get the full scope of everything the game has to offer, it gave me a taste of a kind of adventure-puzzle game seldom seen in the AAA space, and it is one that's shaping up to be an impressive display of MachineGames' toolset and understanding of molding game design around its protagonist and story. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is expected to release for Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9.</p>

However, there haven't been many modern video games starring the globetrotting explorer, even as the series has undoubtedly inspired other well-known games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Uncharted</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's changing with the upcoming</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, helmed by developer MachineGames, who've previously worked on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wolfenstein: The New Order</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its sequel, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The New Colossus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A first-person action adventure game focusing on the events between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> puts a more immersive spin on the escapades of the famed adventurer as he explores tombs and pummels fascists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After playing the opening hours at a recent hands-on event, I got a clearer view of MachineGames' take on an Indiana Jones game, which emphasizes player agency and open-ended exploration. I also spoke with design director Jens Andersson, where he explained how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is all about letting players come up with in-the-moment solutions for the game's challenges. .</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Indiana Jones and the change of perspective"><span>Indiana Jones and the change of perspective</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> positions itself as a new adventure during the peak of Indiana Jones' career as an archeologist and occasional college professor. With that conceit, the game focuses on building up the atmosphere and heightened reality for its core combat, stealth, and exploration gameplay sequences, all focused on a protagonist who has to scrape and improvise his way to success. For instance, using Jones' whip was incredibly satisfying for disarming foes or softening up targets to set them up for a finishing blow with an empty rifle used as an improvised club. Many encounters feel like they came out of a movie, and that kind of scrappy and sometimes comedic energy is what design director Jens Andersson wanted to recreate for the game.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/phil-spencer-says-indiana-jones-ps5-jump-good-for-xbox-s-health" target="_self">Phil Spencer: Indiana Jones' PS5 jump good for Xbox's health</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That sense of improvisation is very 'Indy,' isn't it? All of the actions you can do in the game have to make sense for the character, and how we've built it up is something we're very proud of," said Andersson. "Player agency is really important for us, so if an enemy has a gun and he drops it, you should be able to pick it up, and you have a revolver. It's iconic for the character, but in this game, there are many times when you don't want to use it. My favorite part is seeing testers play the game, and there's like a rifle here, and there's a banjo here; everyone picks up the banjo instead because it's just more fun to beat up enemies with, and it also fits the character that you want to play as."</span></p><p>Image via MachineGames/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following the theft of a mysterious artifact from Marshall College, the titular hero (played by Troy Baker) embarks on a new adventure that'll take him to Northern Africa, Vatican City, and other locales as he uncovers an ancient conspiracy that puts him in the crosshairs of the growing Nazi empire.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This setup is very much in line with the film series, but as a video game, there are more opportunities to explore and interact with the characters within the setting. What surprised me most about the opening hours of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is that the game is not a totally linear story experience, but rather, it features some fairly open-ended levels that offer up different ways to acquire knowledge and fight bad guys as Indiana Jones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking with the design director, he stated that the developers were not interested in making a standard licensed game adaptation but wanted to dig deeper into an immersive experience that lives up to the classic LucasArts games—such as the seminal 1992 adventure game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Fate of Atlantis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I really love the whole legacy of LucasArts, and we're trying to evoke that sense of adventure from those games," said the design director. "We're doing something very different with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but because we're building off such a legacy of classic adventure games, we have a little more confidence that we can do a modern adventure game as well. It's proven to fit well with the Indiana Jones IP, and now we get to do it on a grand scale in 2024, and that's very exciting for us."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Along with being able to walk around the environment to examine notes and artifacts, you can explore to find hidden passages, clues to side activities, and open-ended combat encounters that can be cleared with fisticuffs or stealthily knocking out foes with whatever players can find. There was a strong sense of player agency, and it reminded me of a similar feeling I play an immersive sim like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deus Ex</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. However, Anderson stated they were trying to avoid going too deep into that sort of flexibility, rather focusing more on prioritizing improvisation within sandbox environments.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Looking to the past for inspiration"><span>Looking to the past for inspiration</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developer MachineGames is mainly known today for the bombastic and surprisingly introspective </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wolfenstein </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">games. However, the studio is made up of developers who previously worked at Starbreeze, building games such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Darkness</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showed more of a stronger pull from the dev's early games, which the design director stated has been a part of the studio's signature ethos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's almost this kind of muscle memory that MachineGames has been growing consistently from project to project, and many of us have worked together since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Chronicles of Riddick</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Darkness</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> [going back to Starbreeze]," said Andersson. "You build up a way of going about things—which can be hard to do, as game development can feel like turning an aircraft carrier. But what it came down to was that the story needed to come first, and that turned into building the kind of adventure we want to take you on and then building the game features, the pace, and the characters all based around you being Indiana Jones."</span></p><p>Image via MachineGames/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In many ways, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> feels like a successor to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Chronicles of Riddick</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, mainly its focus on balancing first-person action and stealth within an immersive story-driven experience. The Chronicles</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> of Riddick</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s video game adaptation was particularly successful because it didn't directly adapt the film material. Instead, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Butcher Bay</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was more interested in capturing the moment-to-moment experience of being an action hero protagonist that was unique to the interactive experience of the video game medium—and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks to carry on with that same approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of my favorite sections from the opening hours, one that encapsulates the structure of the game well, was the Giza Pyramids, the game's first open sandbox level. While you have a clear goal to get inside a secure tomb, surrounding the ruins are Nazi base camps on the lookout for Jones, along with settlements filled with civilians going about their routines. This section felt very much like an Assassin's Creed-style social stealth sandbox. After gathering intel and scouting ahead with a camera, I had to acquire a disguise or cover to sneak into closely guarded areas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it came to building out these levels, Andersson admits it was a bit risky and scary to design levels with this sort of variation, as the prevailing worry was that players would opt to skip the side activities that help build the world. Still, he reasons that it was worth having them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have a bunch of sections that are linear and more story focused, but there are a number of larger areas like the Vatican and Giza that feature a ton of content there that are entirely up to you to engage with it or not," he said.</span></p><p>Image via MachineGames/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"From a developer point of view, it's a little bit scary for us to have open-ended levels with side content because we spend so much time on it and players might end up skipping it, but that's also why we have this revisit feature in the game. So even when you complete it you can jump back to earlier chapters and then sort of play the content that you didn't discover the first time around to see the little mysteries and encounters you missed. That's one of the things I'm most happy about with the game, and I'm interested to see what people think about it."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="On the next adventures of Indiana Jones…."><span>On the next adventures of Indiana Jones….</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What I found most interesting about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is that it's an action adventure game that's all about getting players to feel resourceful and cunning in their approach to overcoming the odds—like picking up a banjo to clobber fascists. Given the large scope, and the density of its locales, it's an ambitious take on bringing the full Indiana Jones experience to a video game, and I was impressed to see how much detail and variety there was packed into the few areas I got to explore. .</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So far, Indiana Jones' big return to the world of video games shows a new side to the character and its pulpy sense of adventure, and for the design director, he believes that the developers of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have already nailed its most important goal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's all coming together nicely, we're still working all the way to the end," said the design director. "I'm less scared about the riskier design choices we have made, because we've kind of proven that they work. We have people play through the full game now and I just really love how the story has turned out. The whole point of this game is to get you to feel like Indiana Jones, and that's the thing I feel we most succeeded at."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

			<p>More than half of the total CAPCOM software sales for the first half of the current fiscal year have been on PC, according to the publisher's latest financial report.</p>
<p>In today's <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/html/explanation/2025/2nd/1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> covering the first half of FY25, the Japanese publisher confirmed that sales, operating income, and Digital Contents segment are all down 25%, 39%, and 35%, respectively, over the previous fiscal year, which is not surprising, considering the publisher launched mostly minor titles in the first six months of the current fiscal year. Still, the publisher confirmed it is still on target to achieve its annual forecast thanks to a second half of the year that will be stronger than the first, thanks to the upcoming launch of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>This fiscal year's sales also highlighted a growing trend for CAPCOM, as of the 20.025 million units of software sold, 54% were sold on PC, with console sales shrinking from 51% in FY20 to 40% in FY25. The publisher's focus on the PC market is definitely paying off, and it will be interesting to see how much Monster Hunter Wilds will sell on PC compared to consoles, which don't seem will deliver the best way to enjoy one of the most anticipated games of 2025, judging from <a href="https://wccftech.com/monstewr-hunter-wilds-display-modes-consoles-120-hz/">impressions</a> from the PS Plus exclusive beta which began today.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/former-fromsoftware-and-square-enix-game-designer-establishes-new-game-company-to-make-games-for-game-lovers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a> (which, in turn, cites a Japanese <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000001.000151924.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>), designer Sho Igarashi will serve as the newly-created Velux Studio's CEO. He's worked not only with FromSoftware and Square Enix, but also with&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>studio Cygames and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/forspoken">Forspoken</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Luminous Productions.</p>

<p>According to Automaton's translation of the press release, Igarashi's "expertise lies in battle production" (that's Automaton's wording, not the press release's), although it's not clear whether he definitely worked on combat design for the aforementioned games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-velux-studio-sho-igarashi.jpg?itok=ReVpqYIb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-velux-studio-sho-igarashi.jpg?itok=FeE0XH2q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sho Igarashi's credits include&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16</em>, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't know much about Velux Studio, except that per Automaton, the company will be making games across PC, consoles, and mobile devices, and it'll include both "high-end" and "casual" titles in its remit (again, that's Automaton's wording).</p>

<p>The goal here is to "make games for game lovers", or so the press release says, and the studio will be working with Unreal Engine 5 in-house, so it sounds like nothing will be outsourced.</p>

<p>Right now, we don't know exactly what Velux is working on, although if a couple of preview images released on the studio's new <a href="https://velux-studio.co.jp/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> are anything to go by, it looks like the debut game will have a sci-fi flavor to it.</p>

<p>Velux also has an <a href="https://x.com/VELUX_STUDIO" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, although naturally, since the studio is new, there isn't much on there yet. Still, you know who to follow if you want up-to-the-minute news about this new company.</p>

In recent years, we've seen studios started up by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors">several ex-<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developers</a>, as well as staffers from big companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bethesda-bioware-naughty-dog-near-studios-hawthorn">Bethesda</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-ea-staffers-three-thousands-studio">EA</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-staffers-birdkin-hideaki-saori-utsumi">Capcom</a>, among others.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what Velux Studio will reveal as its debut title, but let's hope we find out sooner rather than later. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-how-long-to-beat-1851683622<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>, the latest game in the long-running franchise, tells a brand-new story with a beloved returning character. Everything fans have come to love about the series returns in full, bringing together an emotional story and compelling powers-based gameplay to create something unique and engaging. Let’s take a look at any burning questions you may have about this fresh entry in the world of Life is Strange.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h120090"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> a direct sequel?</strong></h2><p>The original <em>Life is Strange</em> remains a favorite among series fans, so it makes sense that developer Deck Nine would want to revisit the game’s characters at some point. Though a prequel titled <em>Life is Strange: Before the Storm</em> examined Chloe’s life leading up to her meeting <em>Life is Strange</em>’s protagonist Max, there had yet to be a sequel looking into what happened in the years after the events in Arcadia Bay.</p><p>That’s where <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> comes in. <strong>Yes, it’s a full-blown sequel to the first game</strong>, which picks up a full ten years after the events that transpired in that initial entry. While the story of the first game still has an effect on Max and the lives of those around her (more on that below), this new adventure is also a fine jumping-in point for new players—meaning <strong>you don’t necessarily have to have played the original to get a complete, cohesive tale from this one</strong>.</p><p>Max has left Arcadia Bay and is now a photographer at a prestigious university—but we all know that things won’t go too smoothly for our heroine. Instead, Max soon finds her friend Safi dead, prompting a series of events that leads to her learning she has the power to switch between multiple timelines—one in which Safi is dead and another where she’s somehow still alive. This ultimately allows you to weave in and out the two timelines, as Max inches closer to learning who killed Safi, and finding out whether she can stop them.</p><h2 id="h120091"><a id=""></a><strong>How does <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> handle <em>Life is Strange</em>’s multiple endings?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="3f226c73c16d5569f497733b88a96c04" data-recommend-id="image://3f226c73c16d5569f497733b88a96c04" data-format="jpg" data-width="2173" data-height="1215" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Max is confronted by a reporter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Max is confronted by a reporter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f226c73c16d5569f497733b88a96c04" data-recommend-id="image://3f226c73c16d5569f497733b88a96c04" data-format="jpg" data-width="2173" data-height="1215" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Max is confronted by a reporter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>SPOILER FOR <em>LIFE IS STRANGE</em>!</strong></p><p>At the end of the original <em>Life is Strange</em>, Max is faced with one of the hardest decisions anyone could ever imagine: save her friend’s life or save the entirety of Arcadia Bay. Both of these decisions obviously resulted in unique, bittersweet endings, begging players to replay the game and see how things would’ve turned out had they made a different decision.</p><p>With this in mind, you may be wondering how <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> handles this canonically. Well, good news: It doesn’t really matter which ending you chose originally, as a moment early in the game grants you the choice to pick which ending you’d prefer as canon.</p><p>Your journal, texts, and even character interactions differ based on which choice you make, yet again giving you plenty of reasons to pick the opposite option at the beginning of a second playthrough to see how those older events shaped the world for Max and those around her.</p><h2 id="h120092"><a id=""></a><strong>How many chapters are in <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>?</strong></h2><p>Unlike previous games in the franchise, <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> is not an episodic title. However, it is still split up in a way that feels similar to the episodic nature of older games in the series. It contains <strong>five chapters</strong>, with each leading up to an important moment in the story that will shape what’s to come.</p><p>Each chapter can take you between two to four hours to finish, depending on whether you push through the main narrative beats or take your time exploring, checking out the sights, and engaging in optional collectible hunting. As such, you can expect to spend somewhere between <strong>10 to 15 hours</strong> completing the full game based on your playstyle.</p><h2 id="h120093"><a id=""></a><strong>What platforms is <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> released on?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="5e28b6c79bf22a93cb20e180ffe1ee32" data-recommend-id="image://5e28b6c79bf22a93cb20e180ffe1ee32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Max casts a force ghost." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Max casts a force ghost." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5e28b6c79bf22a93cb20e180ffe1ee32" data-recommend-id="image://5e28b6c79bf22a93cb20e180ffe1ee32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Max casts a force ghost." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> is available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-first-black-ops-6-double-xp-weekend/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty’s Double XP Weekends are the best. For a limited time, you can earn twice as much XP in CoD, and if you’re looking to quickly level up in Black Ops 6, the next Double XP Weekend is the dream ticket—so let’s look at all the information we have so far.</p>



<p>I love a Double XP Weekend in CoD. If you’ve not been able to play as much Call of Duty as you’d like, or you’ve had some time off, a Double XP Weekend allows you to catch up, make up lost ground, and get back into the leveling-up fray. It applies to all game modes too, so you don’t need to feel restricted in your methods or change your gameplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> is likely to continue the trend of the last few CoD games by having regular Double XP Weekends. With talk of Black Ops 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season One</a>, and even its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a>, let’s address another key topic right now.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-the-next-double-xp-weekend-event-date-is-in-black-ops-6">Do we Know When the Next Double XP Weekend Event Date is in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s off to work we go. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Right now, we don’t currently know when the first Black Ops 6 Double XP Weekend is expected to be. If we use 2023’s Modern Warfare 3 as a marker though, we should expect to see the first 2XP Weekend in the <strong>third or fourth week of November</strong>.</p>



<p>Modern Warfare 3’s first all-Double XP Weekend debuted on Nov. 22, last year, and the first instance of these special occasions usually drop around the end of November / start of December—expect Black Ops 6 to be the same.</p>



<p>For now, this is pure conjecture on our part, so take this speculation with a grain of salt. However, keep checking back to this guide as we are going to update it as we learn more about the first Double XP Weekend.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-double-xp-weekend-in-black-ops-6">What is Double XP Weekend in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Double XP Weekend is a period—usually <strong>lasting from Friday until Monday</strong>—in which players can <strong>earn twice as much XP for one or more of CoD’s leveling-up systems</strong>—and this is expected to be the same for Black Ops 6 too.</p>



<p>There are many ways to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-double-xp-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earn Double XP in Black Ops 6</a>, but this is one of the best. It depends on Treyarch, but Double Weekends can include one of the following: <strong>Double Player Level XP, Double Weapon Level XP, or Double Battle Pass XP</strong>. If you’re lucky, the developer may decide to be generous and allow you to have Double XP for all three!</p>

Well, our first regret was assuming that our factory at that time—a factory that made lots of Bluetooth speakers—could easily design the electronics for us, saving us lots of time and money. That went pretty well at first. But they, in turn, outsourced the Bluetooth software and chipset to another company in another country," wrote Panic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As a result, the Stereo Dock would crash often–rapidly adjusting the volume would do it. The Bluetooth pairing/unpairing experience was rough. And when we played music, it just didn't sound very good. The back-and-forth between three companies trying to fix bugs became a huge challenge. And worst of all: the cost of the Stereo Dock kept getting higher and higher."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Panic eventually took over the audio production process and hand-tuned the speaker's EQ curves to bolster its output. It also negotiated a buyout of the bluetooth chipset source code with a view to taking over development and improving the user experience, only to be met with some "gnarly code" that made life even more difficult.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hitting pause on the stereo dock">Hitting pause on the stereo dock</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We kept pushing forward.

"Eventually we hit that painful line: we’re spending more to make this product than we are likely to ever make back from it. And so, we hit pause."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company still hopes it will have the time and resources to reboot the project in the future, but for now remains focused on Playdate itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Panic has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdate-devs-have-earned-over-500-000-through-catalog">sold over 70,000 units of Playdate</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> since launching the console in 2022, although it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdate-launch-delayed-until-early-2022-">encountered plenty of challenges</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> along the way. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/panic-launches-catalog-a-curated-digital-storefront-for-playdate">It also launched Catalog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a bona fide storefront for Playdate developers and players, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/panic-recovers-stolen-playdates-worth-400-000-after-lots-of-detective-work-">retrieved around $400,000 worth of Playdate stock</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that vanished in Las Vegas in rather suspicious circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> said personal abuse sent to Wuk Lamat's voice actor "breaks my heart".</p>
<p>Wuk Lamat was a fresh character introduced in the latest expansion, Dawntrail, but proved unpopular with some players. This turned sour when voice actor Sena Bryer received transphobic abuse for her portrayal of the character.</p>
<p>Yoshida has commented on the character, as well as the abuse Bryer received, in a new interview with <a href="https://checkpointgaming.net/features/2024/10/chatting-with-the-iconic-naoki-yoshida-on-the-design-and-reception-of-dawntrail/">Checkpoint Gaming</a>, acknowledging player feedback and tweaks coming in forthcoming patches.</p>

<p>"[Wuk Lamat's] a very complex character, and she even has a bit of a complex about herself," said Yoshida. "Unfortunately, we didn't delve very far into the background of why she had those feelings, so it appeared as if she left a negative impression.</p><p>"We accept that feedback. I feel a little sorry that we weren't able to properly depict her. We may have been able to make her more straightforward, so we're pushing her in the forefront as this character. But again, we're going to be reflecting that learning into [content patch 7.1] and onward, we're hoping that we can show more of what makes Wuk Lamat so great, and I'm hoping that we can regain from there."</p>
<p>Yoshida then specifically mentioned the personal attacks against Bryer.</p>
<p>"One additional thing, there were comments about how we are too accepting of diversity - some people seem to be disapproving of that," he said. "I'm afraid one of our staff members received very negative comments and it almost felt like a personal attack, which breaks my heart, because she worked really hard and these criticisms were not constructive at all. It doesn't do anything except make the staff lose motivation, and in the end that could potentially damage the quality of our game and take away from what makes this game so interesting. So if there are any sort of criticisms, bring it to me, because I'm the one approving this material. I wanted to reiterate that, please refrain from personal attacks against our staff."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Yoshida has been outspoken against this abuse, telling German outlet <a href="https://jpgames.de/2024/09/final-fantasy-xiv-das-sagt-naoki-yoshida-zur-kritik-an-wuk-lamat/">JPGames</a> in September it was "really difficult" to discern valid criticism from people "just criticising the character in relation to values".</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">Yoshida discussed criticism of Dawntrail</a>, particularly how some fans were disappointed the Scions took more of a backseat in the drama compared to previous expansions.</p>
<p>"With regards to the Scions playing a more active role only later on in the story, truth be told this is something I intentionally wanted to try out," said Yoshida. "I do understand there are people who always want the Scions to be at the centre of the story, but at the same time there are people who are also requesting something new instead. So it was a conscious effort on my part to experiment and see how the balance would play out."</p>
<p>Patch 7.1 of Final Fantasy 14, named Crossroads, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-patch-71-crossroads-is-coming-in-november">set for release in mid-November</a>, bringing new story missions and - most notably - the start of the Final Fantasy 11 themed raid series, Echoes of Vana'diel.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will feature multiple display modes on consoles, as well as a 120 Hz output option, judging from the PS Plus exclusive beta that is now live worldwide.</p>
<p>As shown in a screenshot shared on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-test-ot-born-to-be-wild.1020882/post-130805709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, the next entry in the series, launching in a few months, will allow players to either prioritize resolution or framerate, as well as enable 120 Hz output for VRR-compatible displays. Unfortunately, according to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-test-ot-born-to-be-wild.1020882/post-130807878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, both display modes have to make some heavy compromises in terms of framerate and image quality, and performance is not very stable in either mode, dropping heavily in some areas so much that VRR is disengaged, but thankfully, there's still some time before release, and things could be improved further in time for release.</p>
<p>While image quality and performance may not be amazing, it definitely feels like Monster Hunter Wilds will be a massive step forward over its predecessors thanks to some of its new features, which include the Focus Mode gameplay mechanics and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-lobbies-100-players/">100 player lobbies</a> that promise improved interactivity with other hunters.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th, 2024. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">preview.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/koei-tecmo-unannounced-games-fy-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/koei-tecmo-to-release-several-unannounced-titles-before-april-2025.1021860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/koei-tecmo-unannounced-games-fy-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>studio Koei Tecmo has revealed that it has several unannounced projects set to release before the end of the fiscal year in March.</p>

<p>According to the company's latest financial presentation, "several unannounced titles (up to mid-tier)" are set to launch before the beginning of April 2025, although of course, Koei Tecmo doesn't reveal exactly what they are.</p>

<p>That's in addition to the games already in the pipeline for Koei Tecmo, which include the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/romance-of-three-kingdoms-8-remake-release-date"><em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8&nbsp;</em>remake</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, and two&nbsp;different&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian"><em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>RPGs</a>, as well as manga and anime adaptation&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-koei-tecmo.jpg?itok=5fhKKIZm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-koei-tecmo.jpg?itok=C7LF7FQP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Koei Tecmo's upcoming slate includes&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, plus several unannounced games.</figcaption></figure><p>News of Koei Tecmo's unannounced projects comes alongside a look at the company's financial performance for the first half of 2024, and sales are down by 11.4% compared to the previous year, although Koei Tecmo says this is because the PC and console areas of the business were "focused on back catalog".</p>

<p>Similarly, Koei Tecmo's financials are lower than the company initially forecasted for this first half of the year, thanks to a "decrease in sales from console/PC and online/mobile".</p>

<p>However, it's noteworthy that unlike major Western studios (the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">Bungie</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september">Microsoft</a> spring to mind), Koei Tecmo hasn't laid any employees off this year; rather, its headcount has actually increased since the first half of last year.</p>

<p>It's true that Koei Tecmo hasn't increased its salaries across the board like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fromsoftware-raises-base-salaries">some</a> of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-salary-increase">compatriots</a>, but it's still nice to see a company responding to slightly lower sales not by firing employees by the hundreds, but by standing firm.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/koei-tecmo-atelier-yumia.jpg?itok=daFw0PA2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/koei-tecmo-atelier-yumia.jpg?itok=HcuNlrTJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two new&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games are also in the works at Koei Tecmo.</figcaption></figure><p>Impressively, Koei Tecmo says it plans to maintain its current pace with regards to hiring new employees. The studio says it's on target to hire 200 new employees across the 2024-25 fiscal year, with a focus mainly on new graduates.</p>

<p>Other initiatives in place for Koei Tecmo's future include improving its internal tech, utilizing AI, and expanding its global publishing structure in the long-term.

        <p>Aihama, Japan. The final years of the Edo period. One rain-drenched evening, a group of men burst into the town’s brother and sister-run umbrella shop. Yushin is cut down in front of his sister Yui, leaving her alone in the world. The next thing he knows, he is looking down at his own stricken corpse—a soul without a body. The grim incident shatters the peace in this quiet backwater. Lurking beneath the surface is an intricate, deep-rooted plot, shrouded in mystery. Until Yui is safe, not even death is enough to extinguish Yushin’s soul. He’ll stop at nothing on his quest, shifting from body to body, possessing anyone and anything to rescue his sister. But with just seven days before his soul departs this world—can he save Yui in time?</p><p>This is a tale of rain, reincarnation, and revenge.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Soul-Shifting Showdowns</strong> – Lacking a physical form, you’ll need to shift your soul to other bodies on the quest to find your sister.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Songs of Silence - Official 1.0 Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"The release of Songs of Silence is a huge milestone for our studio," creative director Alex Kehr said in a press statement. "Following our journey in Steam Early Access, our players' feedback has shaped the game into something truly special. We are so excited for the community to dive into the 1.0 version of Songs of Silence to experience its epic story campaign, hours upon hours of multiplayer content, finely-tuned combat, and tons of gameplay options that we feel reinvigorates the 4X strategy genre."</p><p>Overall, players can expect a 15-hour campaign alongside PvP and co-op multiplayer modes. One of the other interesting gameplay mechanics in Songs of Silence is the Cards of Fate, cards that represent unique actions and abilities that can be used to change the course of battles and influence elements on the map to your advantage.</p><p>2024 has been a pretty good year for fans of the strategy genre. In addition to the early access release of Songs of Silence, other genre highlights included the recent launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ara-history-untold/" data-ref-id="5000-566096">Ara: History Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-drawing-a-line-in-the-snow/1900-6418286/" data-ref-id="1900-6418286">Frostpunk 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/homeworld-3/" data-ref-id="5000-501735">Homeworld 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/age-of-mythology-retold/" data-ref-id="5000-574585">Age of Mythology: Retold</a>. </p><p>If you're interested in trying it out, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195410/Songs_of_Silence/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Songs of Silence demo is available on Steam</a>, and you can see more of the game in action through the embedded trailer above. The price for Songs of Silence won't increase after it exits early access, and you can pick it up for $40 on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-horizon-forbidden-west-patch-dlss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west-bigger-and-better-in-every-way/">Horizon Forbidden West</a> patch introduces an image treatment solution that delivers better image quality from what we have seen so far of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> discussed this new image treatment solution, saying that it delivers a pristine image quality that is close to what NVIDIA DLSS can deliver on PC and considerably better than what we have seen PSSR do so far. This solution, which is reportedly in development for Guerrilla Games' next project, is likely a compute-based solution that doesn't use the machine learning hardware of the PlayStation 5 Pro, so it could potentially run on the base console, where it could deliver much more impressive results, considering the only upscaler available on the regular PS5 is AMD FSR, which delivers some middling results, as we have seen over and over in the past few months.</p>
<p>Although the great image quality delivered by this image treatment solution could be thanks to the high base resolution (1440p / 1584p to 4K), it could also be another great option for developers, as it could allow Guerrilla or any other developer using the Decima engine, like Kojima Productions with Death Stranding 2, to use the PlayStation 5 Pro machine learning hardware to do other things.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #186: Teraflop War OVER, Killzone Dead, Alan Wake 2 PS5 Pro, Silent Hill 2 Patched!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RrGDYXvKBk?start=6024&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The superior image quality delivered by Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 5 Pro, thanks to this new image treatment solution, could be matched by any other game using PSSR with a high enough base resolution, as the games using the upscaler seen so far had a much lower base resolution than 1440p. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to see for ourselves what the AI-powered upscaler will be able to do under the right conditions, as the console launches next week, on November 7th, worldwide.</p>

            <p>Bungie have been fairly quiet about Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-rebooting-marathon-as-a-pvp-focused-loot-shooter">announced in 2023</a>. Yesterday they released a devlog in which game director Joe Ziegler seemed to want to reassure fans of the studio that the game was still in development. He talked around a lot of the game features, without actually saying much about it. As yet, there's still no footage of the game in action, making its previous release window of 2025 appear even more tenuous.</p>

<p>Ziegler begins the video by saying there's no gameplay footage to show, and talks in some very general terms about what the game is going to be - a PvP-focused extraction shooter. Ollie has already rounded up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-release-date">everything we know about Marathon</a>, and this devlog sadly doesn't tell us anything new about the game. If anything it makes it sound less defined than before. Ziegler makes vague mention of player abilities, loot, and "runner" loadouts, while re-explaining some extraction shooter basics many first-person shooter fans will already know. He does give some indication of where the studio is in terms of production, even if he doesn't show anything.</p>
<p>"Some things are a little bit more complete, like our environments are starting to come together in a really, really beautiful way," he says. "Some of the character models we've been iterating through. So they're coming together but they're not fully there yet... So it's a little early to show you all of it as one piece."</p><p>There are some insubstantial teases of characters. One is codenamed "Thief" and another is codenamed "Stealth" who is unsurprisingly described as "hard to pin down". And Ziegler mentions that the studio will be recruiting more playtesters next year. He doesn't mention anything about the release date, or give much indication about other elements of the game.</p>
<p>In BBC comedy The Thick Of It, a government minister is scheduled to go on a news show. But he has absolutely nothing to announce or say. His vicious PR man, Malcolm Tucker, tells him to come up with something. "It better not be too boring," he commands. "And it better not be too interesting either, okay? And it better not cost too much. It can't be an old thing, obviously, and don't make it too new." </p>
<p>I can't help but suspect Ziegler's non-announcement is the result of the same kind of PR frogmarching and "visibility first" thinking. Bungie's silence around the game has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-full-original-marathon-trilogy-is-now-free-on-steam-but-bungie-are-still-quiet-on-the-reboot">not gone unnoticed</a>, and it's likely the studio wanted to simply say "our game is still alive" without actually showing any work-in-progress. Compare this to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skates-chaotic-playtest-videos-are-the-best-marketing-the-game-could-ask-for">bare-faced development</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">Skate</a> from Full Circle, or the almost worringly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thousands-are-playing-valves-unrevealed-shooter-deadlock-a-blend-of-team-fortress-2-and-dota-with-bioshocky-skyrails">blasé treatment</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> by Valve. Both of whom are happy to show things in various states of unreadiness.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, however, it's up to Bungie to decide when they feel the game is good enough to show. It's not like they have been without road blocks in development. The studio has recently seen multiple <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">management shake-ups</a> amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">mass layoffs</a>. Ziegler himself is directing the game after the removal of previous director, Chris Barrett, for the latter's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-reportedly-fired-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-for-unwanted-and-inappropriate-messages-to-female-staff">allegedly inappropriate behaviour</a>. Some Bungie staff have also been reassigned to other divisions within Sony, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sonys-purchase-of-bungie-is-now-complete">bought the studio back in 2022</a>. None of this is likely to have helped the development of the shooter. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has an arachnophobia mode as part of its accessibility offering that turns spider-like creatures into amusing blobs.</p>
<p>The forthcoming game in the series has an open beta coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-getting-open-beta-in-november-with-early-access-for-playstation-plus-subscribers">PS Plus subscribers getting early access</a> that's now available.</p>
<p>Right at the start, players can tweak the settings and turn on Arachnophobia Assistance, which "adjusts the appearance of some small monsters and endemic life to accommodate players with arachnophobia".</p>

<p>The result is creatures becoming golden globules that wobble around environments. As an arachnophobe myself, it certainly put a smile on my face.</p>
<p>Note, however, this only applies to small monsters rather than the main monsters you'll be tasked with properly hunting.</p>

<p>That's fine for the menagerie of dragon, lizard, bear, and toad-like monsters, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp4gR1QEvVA">spider-esque Lala Barina</a> seemingly won't be affected. Still, it does have four legs rather than eight - and the legs are the worst.</p>
<p>The beta also provides a look at other accessibility options, with three presets for visual, auditory, and motion sickness options. These can also be toggled individually in the options menu.</p>

<p>The arachnophobia mode is fast becoming standard in games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/20-years-later-world-of-warcraft-is-getting-an-arachnophobia-mode">World of Warcraft finally received one</a> earlier this year after 20 years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-arachnophobia-mode-is-arguably-more-terrifying-than-actual-giant-spiders">Call of Duty Black Ops 6 turns spiders into something even worse</a>. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-wont-have-an-arachnophobia-mode-because-it-doesnt-have-a-single-spider">Dragon Age: The Veilguard doesn't bother</a>, because thankfully there aren't any spiders to begin with.</p>
<p>Elsewhere the beta (from the start at least) is the same demo I was able to play at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> this year. It begins with a chase across sand dunes, before hunting a monster with an exceptionally large tongue.</p>
<p>I came away impressed with that demo, calling it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">most approachable Monster Hunter in the series yet</a>. And while that's a descriptor often used for each new game, it's a welcome evolution that streamlines the experience with tidier menus and NPC teammates.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds beta launches across all platforms on 31st October and lasts until 4th November. We've got all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-release-date-time-early-access">beta times in our guide</a>.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-out-february-next-year"> full game will be released in February next year</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arkham-horror-the-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween.1021809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was only three months ago that I was praising Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game Hungering Abyss for its ability to teach the game, supply players with everything they'd need for a multiple-hour experience, and create an entertaining and tense spooky experience. The one major downside I had was how it really was only suited for that one experience, now with the release of the Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook in under a month we know what it will be like to create a story from scratch.</p>

<h2>Intuitive Layout</h2>

<p>Before I get into the contents of the book itself I need to highlight how incredibly well formatted the Core Rulebook is. From the moment I opened the book I could tell the time and effort that had gone into the layout. Starting with what Arkham Horror is, information about the setting of the game, and a very clear section disowning Lovecraft's beliefs, you launch into relevant information for the player.</p>

<p>You'll learn about the city of Arkham, where players might base their character, but also learn about how the game doesn't need to be restricted to Massachusetts. Examples of mysteries in Cairo or Europe, or even beyond the veil immediately start prodding at the mind of DM and player alike.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-the-world.jpg?itok=soqQ6YNz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-the-world.jpg?itok=fkjBAbUI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From there you get all the required information on the rules of the game, neatly together for easy referencing, character creation, and information for DMs.</p>

<p>If you plan to keep the book on hand while playing it should be a breeze to locate what information you're after in a pinch. On top of that, inside the cover is a code from Drivethrurpg for a PDF of the Rulebook.</p>

<h2>Rules Glossary</h2>

<p>The first major section you'll reach is the Rules Glossary. This will cover how the Dynamic Pool system works, the different types of scenes that you'll encounter and how to take actions and consequences.</p>

<p>The approach to this is bite-sized information that can continue to be built upon starting with that important Dynamic Pool. In Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game the Dynamic Pool is every, it will determine how much you can do as you investigate a location to how you can move and act in combat.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-arkham-map.jpg?itok=wrHusmwq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-arkham-map.jpg?itok=G9BRvTnL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Players have a dice pool of six dice. As they take damage they can end up with fewer dice, hence fewer actions to make, or if they experience horrors those dice can turn against you inflicting horrors if they land with a certain face.</p>

<p>Going into the Core Rulebook with an understanding of the dice pool and how it functions after my time with Hungering Abyss the system made sense. For a player coming into this system new I do think it's a bit tough to understand initially. Like with a lot of TTRPGs there's a lot that you can read but doing the thing will normally help you understand much faster.</p>

<p>It's in this way that the introduction to the Dynamic Pool, scenes, and actions is actually better got across by Hungering Abyss in the way that the game only introduces concepts to you as they become relevant.</p>

<p>From there the bite-sized information continues and is effective in creating a glossary that is easy to reference and quick to check with clearly labeled sections and sub-sections alongside well-laid-out descriptions and even some examples for the harder-to-understand concepts.</p>

<h2>Bringing a character to life in the world of Arkham Horror</h2>

<p>There's a funny line at the beginning of the character creation that I believe sets up the world you're about to step into with Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Most of the people in Arkham, Massachusetts and around the globe spend their time dealing with the simple routines of their daily lives. [...] Your characters aren't so lucky"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Players will take on the roles of those unfortunate enough to find themselves tied to a dark and mysterious fate. These characters, dubbed investigators, might have been raised in this world or is about to get pulled from their comfy life but there's no turning back.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-hunter-class.jpg?itok=Rz4XUiD7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-hunter-class.jpg?itok=8Jp0DkOh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A character is made up of a few key components; Background, Personality Trait, Archetype, Skills, and their starting equipment and advancements. In the back of the book is a blank character sheet that you can use to fill out as you go through the process of building your character up.</p>

<p>Interestingly this character sheet wasn't mentioned at the start of the character creation process, or in the table of contents.</p>

<p>A lot of these aspects aren't hard rules but instead prompts, for discovering your characters backgrounds you'll get prompted with questions like "What is your family like?" and "How does your character make a Living?" etc…</p>

<p>These questions then get paired with what differences there might be between a Poor upbringing and that of a Prosperous lifestyle.</p>

<p>Personality and Archetype are more set in the rules. There are eleven Personalities and eight Archetypes. You can mix and match these to finetune your character and allow for differences among characters to develop immediately.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-character-class.jpg?itok=E3B9_BH5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-character-class.jpg?itok=7L8i2HWA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Diversify The Party</h2>

<p>As a 'Outgoing' Personality you might have the chance to perform an action with your Presence stat, but it could also negatively impact you causing Disadvantage against rolls with allies. This could be combined with a Guardian archetype to create a mayoral character who is good at communicating with their peers.</p>

<p>That same Outgoing Personality could create a vastly different character if applied to a Seeker like a private detective, or a Mystic who is able to manifest supernatural abilities.</p>

<p>Characters will progress by earning experience in sequences. This experience isn't something to fill up a meter for, but instead, it can be spent on gaining abilities. It's not as much "leveling up" but skill points to be spent on a tree.</p>

<p>A major benefit of this is that players will be able to tweak a lot more, and faster. It's not a matter of multiple sessions before you can make skill checks easier or pick up a new ability, you might be able to pick something small up at the end of an encounter or save up for something bigger.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-stat-block.jpg?itok=gD4jdwuH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-stat-block.jpg?itok=zIvhswi- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Strapped Up</h2>

<p>The list of interesting equipment, mundane or otherwise, is like stepping into a candy store. Players will be able to obtain different armors, melee and ranged weaponry, single-use items, and even ancient tomes filled with spells.</p>

<p>Each section is filled with relevant information like gameplay mechanics, prices, and more again assisting the DM in creating a very seamless experience.</p>

<p>Mechanically I was extremely interested in the Tomes section. Unlike a Wizards book that could hold any spell the Tomes here are very specific with what information they contain, the checks that a character would need to complete to have read and understood them, and what spells can be cast with them.</p>

<p>These are definitely the rarest of the rare items for your party to come across but who wouldn't like to happen across the De Vermis Mysteriis, allowing you to enchant weapons or armor, or get your hands on the Necronomicon?</p>

<h2>The Role of the GM and Worldbuilding</h2>

<p>Moving further away from the information that the players need to know we reach the chapters with information for the Game Master. Here we have detailed information about Arkham, including the different regions of the town, important locations within them, and even a visitor-style map.</p>

<p>The section on running the game provides a variety of helpful tips and information including how to create a story, how to run the different scenes, and additional information on the tones and themes of the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-included-adventure-character.jpg?itok=A6K7F45x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-included-adventure-character.jpg?itok=fdl5qQre 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For a horror game I'm extremely glad to see a section on safety rules. Not just the guidelines on how to creat lines and veils, known as Pillars and Borders in Arkham Horror, but also to omit all Xenophobia and Marginalization.</p>

<h2>What Lurks Beyond The Veil</h2>

<p>Two of the final chapters are dedicated to the different Allies and NPCs you'll be able to inject into your games, including stat blocks for all monsters. For your world building the chapter, The Ancient Ones, is your one-stop shop to understand the kinds of eldritch creatures that Lovecraft came up with.</p>

<p>Here you'll find multi-paged dossier entries on some of the big and small players of the Mythos including Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Crothhoaka, and more. Each section does an impressive job of distilling all of the information surrounding these creatures into well-formatted sections. Reading each you'll understand what they are and where their domain is, what effect they have, what their lair is like, and what kinds of allies or factions may be supporting them.</p>

<p>What I really appreciate about the introduction of what are meant to be all-powerful Old Ones is that while there's a lot of context and understanding there isn't anything mechanical to them. Sure the Star Spawn might have a reference to their power from Cthulhu but no player character would truly be able to face an Old One. Their presence helps to inform the actions of cults and other factions, instead of being the Big Bad themselves.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-old-ones.jpg?itok=6NIHXB6J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-old-ones.jpg?itok=vySbj8zP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Time To Play</h2>

<p>Finally, the last section of the book holds with it an adventure to play. While I do still believe for new players the Hungering Abyss starter set is going to be your best 'first experience' playing, if you've already completed that and are ready for a new challenge then it's excellent to have this Core Rulebook be a one-stop-shop to your first time playing the game too.</p>



<p>I was incredibly impressed reading through the Arkham Horror Rulebook. The content of it all was extremely easy to understand and efficient, teaching you to the game quickly but also makes referencing rules while playing extremely efficient.</p>

<p>While the character sheet is tucked away the options will provide players a wide variety of options to take through their spooky adventure, and the DM is more than adequately equipped to channel a creepy vibe from beyond the veil.</p>

<p>If you're an absolutely new group to playing I would still recommend the starter set, as it comes with so many tokens, handouts, and a 'learn as you go' style rulebook but if you're a fan and you're ready to dive into your own adventures then this is an excellent Rulebook to do so.</p>
