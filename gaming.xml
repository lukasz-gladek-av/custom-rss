		<p>Ah, Let it Die. Quite possibly one of the most enigmatic free-to-play games of all time, it’s been 9 years since the original launched on PS4, where it introduced the world to Uncle Death, the Tower of Barbs and its Souls-lite hack and slash combat. It also introduced the world to the idea of paying real money to revive yourself, and while that might not have particularly caught on, the fact that it’s still going nearly a decade later shows that it got a lot of things right. Fans of the series can rejoice then, with the announcement of Let It Die: Inferno, a brand-new, full-price entry in the series that looks to take all those things that the original got right and make them better.</p>
<p><iframe title="Let it Die: Inferno - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMwZTM3dJMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Tower of Barbs is gone, and instead you’re about to embark on a mission into hell, descending through the different levels on the way to… well, I’m not sure yet, since Death appears at the start of the game, and it’s called Let It Die. Perhaps the things it wants you to let die are all the beasts and badniks that get in your way, and from the look of the announcement trailer, there’s going to be plenty of those to send on their way. </p>
<p>Touted as a ‘survival action roguelike’ Let It Die: Inferno is due to launch on the PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam on the 3rd of December, 2025. Just like the original game, Let It Die: Inferno is being published by GungHo Online Entertainment, but where that was developed by Suda 51’s Grasshopper Manufacture, the team at Super Trick Games, who span off from the original developers and worked on the short-lived battle royale Deathverse: Let It Die, are once again taking the reins. </p>
<p>It already looks amazing, and seems to mix the characterful combat of the original with a thoroughly modern take on the Roguelike genre, while shifting to Unreal Engine 5 and a full-price release, which should hopefully remedy many player’s number one complaint with the first game. We’ll be checking it out over the next two days at the Tokyo Game Show, and we’ll be sure to let you know how it feels!</p>

Players choose to take on the role of either a disciple of light, aiming to find their way through the labyrinth, or a disciple of shadow.</p><p>After the initial battle, players vote to determine who they believe is the treacherous disciple of shadow.

You can get the Steam version for just $23 (was $30) <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Metal+Gear+Solid+5%27s+Official+Strategy+Guide+Is+Still+Available+10+Years+Later&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-09-24+17%3A17%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-24+17%3A19%3A07&amp;fnarticle_id=6534952&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fmetal-gear-rising-revengeance&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmetal-gear-solid-5s-official-strategy-guide-is-still-available-10-years-later%2F1100-6534952%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">at Fanatical</a>.</p><h2>More Metal Gear Games</h2><ul><li><strong>Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience</strong><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Metal+Gear+Solid+5%27s+Official+Strategy+Guide+Is+Still+Available+10+Years+Later&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-09-24+17%3A17%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-24+17%3A19%3A07&amp;fnarticle_id=6534952&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fmetal-gear-solid-v-definitive-experience&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmetal-gear-solid-5s-official-strategy-guide-is-still-available-10-years-later%2F1100-6534952%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC</a> -- $23 (<del>$30</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Solid-Definitive-PlayStation-4/dp/B07D2X8QHM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4</a> -- $23 (<del>$30</del>)</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Metal+Gear+Solid+5%27s+Official+Strategy+Guide+Is+Still+Available+10+Years+Later&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-09-24+17%3A17%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-24+17%3A19%3A07&amp;fnarticle_id=6534952&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fmetal-gear-rising-revengeance&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmetal-gear-solid-5s-official-strategy-guide-is-still-available-10-years-later%2F1100-6534952%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (PC)</a> -- $23 (<del>$30</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Metal+Gear+Solid+5%27s+Official+Strategy+Guide+Is+Still+Available+10+Years+Later&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-09-24+17%3A17%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-24+17%3A19%3A07&amp;fnarticle_id=6534952&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fmetal-gear-survive&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmetal-gear-solid-5s-official-strategy-guide-is-still-available-10-years-later%2F1100-6534952%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Survive (PC)</a> -- $23 (<del>$30</del>)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4574328-mgsbooks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4574328-mgsbooks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574328"></a><figcaption>Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 2 official novelizations</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4574328-mgsbooks.jpg"></figure><p>For a different take on the Metal Gear Solid saga, you can check out the official novelizations for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Solid-benson-raymond/dp/1841497355?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Solid</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Solid-Sons-Liberty-dp-1841497363/dp/1841497363?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a>. The books retell the events of the first two Metal Gear Solid games and were written by Raymond Benson, who has also authored several official James Bond novels.</p><p>It's worth noting that Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima's latest project, Death Stranding, also received <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Stranding-Official-Novelization/dp/178909576X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an official</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Stranding-Official-Novelization/dp/1789095786?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">two-part novelization</a>. While there are similarities in visual design language, detailed world-building techniques, and even gameplay elements between Death Stranding and Metal Gear, Death Stranding leans more heavily into overt sci-fi elements. Nevertheless, it's worth checking out if you're looking for more reading material based on Kojima's works. Both volumes are available in paperback and Kindle editions at Amazon.</p><p>Speaking of which, Kojima also wrote a nonfiction book in 2021, titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Gene-inspired-creator-Stranding/dp/197472591X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Creative Gene</a>, which compiles his memoirs and essays on creativity, game design, art, and more. While it won't answer lingering questions about Metal Gear lore, it offers insight into his creative process and details important events from his life. The paperback edition is available for $17.87 (was $23) at Amazon.</p><h2>More Metal Gear Solid &amp; Hideo Kojima Books</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Gene-inspired-creator-Stranding/dp/197472591X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Creative Gene by Hideo Kojima (paperback)</a> -- $17.87 (<del>$23</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Stranding-Official-Novelization/dp/178909576X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Death Stranding, Vol. 1: The Official Novelization (paperback)</a> -- $19 | <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Stranding-Official-Novelization-ebook/dp/B08JKMJRSC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle</a> -- $11</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Stranding-Official-Novelization/dp/1789095786?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Death Stranding, Vol. 2: The Official Novelization (paperback)</a> -- $15.84 | <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Stranding-Official-Novelization-ebook/dp/B08HY2YQBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle</a> -- $11</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Solid-benson-raymond/dp/1841497355?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Solid (paperback)</a> -- $16.68</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Solid-Sons-Liberty-dp-1841497363/dp/1841497363?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (paperback)</a> -- $16.68</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Solid-Complete-Official/dp/1908172770?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain - The Complete Official Guide</a> -- $19.70 (<del>$25</del>)</li></ul><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-4k-blu-ray-limited-edition-steelbook-preorders-are-live/1100-6534929/">The Fantastic Four: First Steps Limited Edition Steelbook Preorders Are Live</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/superman-2025-4k-blu-ray-editions-limited-edition-restock-amazon-walmart/1100-6533111/">Superman 4K Limited Edition With Lenticular Art Up For Grabs During Launch Week</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-console-bundle-pokemon-mario-kart-deals-available-at-amazon/1100-6534885/">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle In Stock At Amazon With Same-Day Delivery</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-deals-amiibo-figures-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-street-fighter-6/1100-6534260/">Save On All Four Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Switch 2 Amiibo At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-batman-movie-and-tv-series-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-deals/1100-6533035/">Batman Movie And TV Box Sets Are Cheaper Than Prime Day Prices At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-game-amiibo-preorder-buying-guide-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530754/">Metroid Prime 4 And Samus Amiibo Preorders Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-games-amiibo-accessory-preorders-new-releases-2025-at-amazon/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Direct Switch 2 Preorders At Amazon - All New Games And Amiibo</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rosalinas-storybook-super-mario-galaxy-dark-horse-nintendo-book-amazon-preorder/1100-6534724/">Rosalina's Storybook From Super Mario Galaxy Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Annapurna Interactive went to Tokyo Game Show with three game reveals ready to go, and the results of its three-pronged showcase have resulted in an eclectic slate of upcoming games the company will be publishing. The team showed off a new puzzler in a strangely cozy dystopia, a turn-based RPG that's also part musical, and perhaps most interesting of them all, a game that looks quite like a Legend of Zelda sequel. Here's what you need to know about all three.</p><h2>D-topia</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up28VDHtDgU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/up28VDHtDgU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>D-Topia is described as a puzzle game in which you play the role of a "Facilitator" working at the D-topia residential facility. There, you'll address concerns of the residents while uncovering a secret at the heart of the AI-run society. The "perfectly happy world" that the game is set in seems to be nothing more than a facade, and it's up to you to expose the reality of the situation. D-topia is developed by Marumittu Games and it's coming to PC, Switch, Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox in 2026.</p><h2>People of Note</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXjlS7DLP4I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EXjlS7DLP4I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>People of Note is one part musical, one part turn-based RPG. Basically, it's the dream game for GameSpot's Jordan Ramee. Both the story and the game's combat mechanics lean into the musical aspect of the experience, giving players a big cast of characters who can belt out solos and beat down rivals. People of Note comes from Iridium Studios in 2026 for PC, Xbox, and PS5.</p><h2>Demi and the Fractured Dream</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWZHj4OraIA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xWZHj4OraIA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This is the one Zelda fans ought to circle on their calendars (if people still kept physical calendars, anyway). Demi and the Fractured Dream stars its titular hero, Demi, in a world called Somnus. Demi's quest has him chasing a means of escaping his "cursed fate" and is an ode to classic action-adventure games, with its hack-and-slash combat, environment puzzling, and an emphasis on its story and world. From the team at Yarn Owl, Demi hits PC, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox, and PS5 in 2026.</p><p>This was Annapurna's first time bringing news to Tokyo Game Show, but not nearly the first time it's revealed games I quickly wishlisted.

<p>Introducing Fire Emblem Shadows</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5d4cf2927f728/fire-emblem-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo's mobile game line has today been expanded with the shadow drop of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_shadows">Fire Emblem Shadows</a> for Android and iOS.</p>
<p>This title is a spin-off of the main series and introduces a new style of battle featuring role-playing, real-time strategy and social deduction. According to Nintendo, this is a "free-to-start" experience, with optional in-game purchases available.</p>
<p>Here's a bit more about what you can expect, courtesy of Nintendo's official Japanese website. And when a trailer is made available, we'll update this story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gameplay of <em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em> combines real-time strategy and social deduction.<br>
One of the three allies participating in each battle is secretly a treacherous disciple of shadow. Players choose to take on the role of either a disciple of light, aiming to find their way through the labyrinth, or a disciple of shadow.</p>
<p>After the initial battle, players vote to determine who they believe is the treacherous disciple of shadow. The outcome of the vote affects whether the next battle is more favorable or more challenging. Whether the disciples of light can correctly discover the traitor—or the disciple of shadow can successfully deceive the others—holds the key to how the next battle unfolds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This title is set to be available in more than 70 countries and regions, including Japan and the US. It also supports 10 different languages and has been developed in partnership with Intelligent Systems Co., Ltd and DeNA Co., Ltd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo's acting a bit sus, because this new announcement came out of nowhere. A social deduction game, set within the&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>universe? It's called&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em>, and it's out literally now.</p>

<p>A press release from Nintendo Japan announces&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem Shadows,</em>&nbsp;a brand new mobile-exclusive title with role-playing elements, as well as social deduction -- common games in such a genre include&nbsp;<em>Werewolf, Mafia</em>, or much more recently,&nbsp;<em>Among Us.&nbsp;</em>It's out today, but as of writing not yet available to download on iOS.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250925.html" rel="nofollow">The press release</a> goes into little detail on gameplay other than that gameplay revolves around three players. Two players take the role as a "disciple of light" while another works against them as the "disciple of shadow." The ultimate goal is to traverse a labyrinth or uncover the imposter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The press release continues to be vague on the details, but it mentions an "initial battle" that, after completing, players will vote for the supposed disciple of shadow. Depending on if your guess is right seems to have an outcome on the following battle. Again, there isn't much information battles beyond that.</p>

<p>From a story and lore perspective, it will be interesting to see if&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em>&nbsp;is set in the universe of an existing game such as<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fire-emblem-three-houses" rel="nofollow">Three Houses</a></em>, or if it's standalone and wholly original. The fact that there's an "imposter" reminds me of&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses' </em>own elusive group of imposters, Those Who Slither in the Dark.</p>

<p>It stands to reason it may be a part of the&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em>&nbsp;universe given that the recently announced&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-september-2025-recap" rel="nofollow"><em>Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</em></a>&nbsp;is set in the same universe, but we'll definitely find out more when it's available on&nbsp;</p>

<p>The press release says it is free to play, but there are in-game purchases, so cosmetics seem likely.&nbsp;The good news is, the release for&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em>&nbsp;is September 25, 2025 on iOS and Android, so by the time you're reading this, it's probably already be out. I have word it's on Android already, so soon we'll all be diving into the abyss.</p>

That shared love and passion for the quintessential slasher is one of the many reasons why our team is so honored and excited to collaborate with Malek Akkad, Ryan Freimann, and Gun Interactive to bring the world of Haddonfield and the iconic masked murderer Michael Myers to players in the first major <em>Halloween</em> video game. We’re even more excited to partner with <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [48,610 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> to share our first look at gameplay and the official release date for <em>Halloween</em>.</p><p>From its earliest iterations, <em>Halloween</em> has been crafted to deliver an immersive horror sandbox experience that can be enjoyed through a standalone singleplayer story or dynamic asymmetrical multiplayer matches. We wanted to empower players to create their very own horror movie moments, whether they’re stepping behind the mask of Michael Myers or taking the role of one of the heroic residents of Haddonfield. Our team is working diligently to ensure this quiet suburban town is brimming with 70s-era charm and effectively serves as a virtual playground filled with innocent townsfolk that players can either save or slaughter.</p><p>As Michael, your goal is to find, stalk, and kill the residents of Haddonfield before Halloween night ends. While the aptly named “Boogeyman” lurks in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike, the townsfolk NPCs are innocently living their lives, engaged in everyday household activities. In an effort to properly embody the personification of evil, players have the freedom to leverage the terrifying power of Michael Myers to creatively murder anyone unfortunate enough to cross Michael’s path. We’re offering a shocking amount of gruesome executions that are guaranteed to put huge smiles on the faces of horror enthusiasts like ourselves. We hope players have some fun with our interpretation of Michael’s inexplicable tendency to suddenly appear in completely unexpected places and catch victims off-guard with Michael’s “Shape Jump” ability as well.</p><p>Thankfully for the families of Haddonfield, our brave playable hero characters have a chance to thwart Michael’s murderous intentions and rescue their neighbors. As a Hero of Haddonfield, it’s your duty to warn those around you of Michael’s presence, convince the townsfolk NPCs to alert the authorities, and gather weapons and items that can be used to fight back against The Shape. With the right gear and some smooth-talking, you can even instruct the townsfolk to follow you to various points on the map, including a police-provided escape. For those looking to brawl with evil, it’s worth noting that while you can knock Michael down to buy precious time, he can’t be killed. However, with enough police presence, Michael can be detained.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>When players dive into <em>Halloween</em> for the first time, we want Haddonfield to feel like a living, breathing game world. Our team aims to elevate the unpredictability and tension of each match through a series of dynamic map features, believable NPCs, robust gameplay options, haunting visuals, striking audio, and much more. We’ve developed several asymmetrical multiplayer horror titles and fully understand the desires and expectations of our players, and have been hard at work constructing something genuinely worthy of the intellectual property with <em>Halloween</em>. We’re also thrilled to offer a standalone single-player component to this package that allows players to witness key narrative events of “The Night He Came Home” through the eyes of Michael Myers.</p><p>It’s an amazing moment to present gameplay to the public for the first time, and we appreciate you all sharing it with us! While we’ve given players some pieces to chew on, it’s only a taste of what we believe is shaping up to be a truly special and murderous sandbox horror experience, and we’re looking forward to sharing more in the coming months.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Halloween Gameplay + Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bua7X-ClkgY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/halloween-game-launches-september-8-2026]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In between the other big announcements during today's State of Play presentation, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-saros-gameplay-release-date-state-of-play/">release date and gameplay reveal for Saros</a> and our <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">first proper debut of Marvel's Wolverine</a>, PlayStation took some time to announce the PS Plus Essential games for October, headlined by Remedy Entertainment's excellent Alan Wake 2. We also learned that The Last of Us Part II will be joining the PS Plus Extra game catalog this coming Friday, September 26, 2025, to arrive in time for The Last of Us Day.</p>



<p>Alan Wake 2 will join the service for PlayStation Plus Essential subscribers on October 7, 2025, and joining alongside it will be the indie puzzle game hit Cocoon, and the physics-based comedy game Goat Simulator 3. Their arrival on October 7 also means that you have until October 6, 2025, to add Psychonauts 2, Stardew Valley, and Viewfinder to your library, if you haven't already, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-september-2025-psychonauts-2/">since those are the three games available to subscribers for September 2025</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>For PlayStation Plus Extra subscribers, The Last of Us Part 2 is just one of the games getting added to the service for October, with the rest of them surely getting announced within the coming weeks. We just got the news about The Last of Us Part 2 now because of today's State of Play presentation and its proximity to The Last of Us Day.</p>



<p>We also got a look at some of the games joining the Classics Catalog, which is exclusively for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers. Two of the titles are classic fighting games, Tekken 3 and Soulcalibur 3, which were marked as "<em>coming soon</em>" to the service.</p>



<p>The third game announced was the Lara Croft Tomb Raider Anniversary, which was also marked as "<em>coming soon</em>," and could imply that these three titles aren't necessarily what will be added to the Classic's Catalog for subscribers in October. We'll see what the full announcement of the PS Plus Extra and Premium games for October reveals when it arrives in a few weeks time.</p>

He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Podcaster Theo Von and The Pokémon Company probably don’t have a lot in common. But one thing they can apparently agree on is that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should probably stop using them to promote deportation campaigns.</p><p>The DHS posted a <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530">montage of ICE raids</a> to X on Monday accompanied by the original <em>Pokémon</em> theme song and the caption “Gotta Catch ‘Em All.” The clip also features images from the anime and text overlays using a sort of Temu version of the <em>Pokémon</em> font. A day later, the agency posted a video featuring a viral clip of Theo Von where he stares into the camera and says “<a href="https://x.com/vvsrak/status/1881803443691749635">heard you got deported, dude… bye</a>,” then tacked on stats about how many people had been deported so far under President Donald Trump.</p><p>Both The Pokémon Company and Theo Von objected to DHS using them to promote ICE raids. <a href="https://x.com/theovon/status/1970692062090797341">Von quickly took to X</a>, saying, “Yooo DHS i didnt approve to be used in this. I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos.”</p><p>The statement from The Pokémon Company was, unsurprisingly, a little more diplomatic. “Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property,” the company told the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pokemon-torches-dhs-over-gotta-catch-em-all-ice-raid-stunt/"><em>Daily Beast</em></a>. Fans have taken to social media to <a href="https://x.com/pokeBALLZdeep/status/1970573026711269397">urge</a> The Pokémon Company and Nintendo to <a href="https://x.com/ProXFirefly6/status/1970878963951219005">sue</a>, but at least one legal expert sees that as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/784312/pokemon-lawyers-wont-sue-dhs-for-that-video-former-legal-head-predicts">unlikely</a> — despite the companies’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">notoriously</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">litigious</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660815/nintendo-lawsuit-genki-switch-2-accessories">nature</a>. The Pokémon Company’s ex-legal chief Don McGowan told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this"><em>IGN</em></a> that “This will blow over in a couple of days and they’ll be happy to let it.”</p><p>The post featuring Theo Von has since been <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/theo-von-dhs-deportation-video-down.html?utm_source=flipboard.com&amp;utm_medium=social_acct&amp;utm_campaign=feed-part">removed</a>, suggesting that DHS is perhaps a little wary of angering the podcaster’s fan base. The <em>Pokémon </em>clip remains, however, and the Customs and Border Patrol X account even <a href="https://x.com/CBP/status/1970280164442714348">replied</a> with a GIF of Detective Pikachu under the caption “Border Patrol’s newest recruit.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785288/pokemon-theo-von-dhs-ice#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjA5MzU0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Terrence O'Brien</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/785288/pokemon-theo-von-dhs-ice]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield has always been defined by scale: sprawling maps, crumbling buildings, and squads working in sync to turn the tide of war. With Battlefield 6, Battlefield Studios is aiming to bring that same sense of chaos and unpredictability into the single-player campaign. After going hands-on with several missions, it’s clear this isn’t just a throwaway side mode – it’s a confident, varied experience that constantly shifts objectives, introduces new tools, and keeps the action fresh. From storming beaches under fire to chasing trains through collapsing tunnels, every level I played delivered a new surprise and kept me constantly excited for what I would experience next. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fearsome Foursome</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaign drops you into the year 2027 as part of Dagger 1-3, an elite squad of U.S. Marines. If you’ve played the recent multiplayer beta – or any Battlefield before – you’ll immediately recognize the squad archetypes. Carter fills the Assault role, Murphy handles Engineer duties, Gecko manages Recon, and Lopez rounds out the team as Support. Curiously, Lopez isn’t playable in the campaign, and Battlefield Studios declined to elaborate when asked why. Whether it’s a design choice or a story reveal saved for later, time will tell. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes the campaign stand out so far is how it blends traditional FPS action with light squad management. Each mission hands you a different Marine, but you’re rarely operating alone. You can call on your squadmates mid-fight to use their specialized abilities – Gecko tagging targets, Murphy blowing open defenses, Lopez keeping everyone supplied and revived. It’s not a deep tactical system, but it makes your squad feel integral to success, and it adds a dynamic layer that’s genuinely fun.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What makes the campaign stand out so far is how it blends traditional FPS action with light squad management.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The small touches sell the squad dynamic even further. Take out an enemy gunner, and your Marine calls out, “MG down!” Drop an engineer, and suddenly you know their SAM launcher is no longer a threat. These callouts double as gameplay feedback, helping you adjust tactics mid-fight. Even in single-player, the firefights carry the tension and layered pacing of multiplayer matches, with squads clashing and roles countering one another. It’s exactly the kind of squad-driven storytelling Battlefield fans have long hoped for.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Buckle Up and Hang On</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During my hands-on, I had access to three missions scattered across the campaign, and it was immediately obvious why these were chosen. Each mission felt completely different, with objectives that constantly changed the pace and approach. These three levels honestly felt closer to nine, and I had to remind myself partway through missions that I was still in that same level. `</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first one I played was Operation Gladius, the third stage in the story. It opens with an iconic “war-game” spectacle: storming enemy beaches inside an armored vehicle. From the moment it began, I was floored by the presentation. Mud and smoke obscured my vision while explosions rocked the shoreline. The waves sent our floating tanks rocking back and forth, while a hazy, smoke-filled sky gave me a preview of the battle I was heading into. As the gunner, I was tasked with taking out bunkers and enemy troops, and what could have been a straightforward turret section became a tense scramble to see through debris and support my squad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the tanks landed, I, still playing as Murphy the Engineer, began escorting a tank through a war-torn town toward City Hall. This section leaned into classic Battlefield gameplay: waves of enemies, constant destruction, all while keeping the tank operational, while Lopez resupplied and revived me. Gecko tagged threats from a distance, and Carter and I pushed the front line while entire buildings, balconies, and trees collapsed around us. For stretches, it felt like playing multiplayer condensed into an intense single-player package.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The town itself kept me on my toes. Enemies poured out of alleys, rooftops, and damaged buildings, but the destruction turned unpredictability into opportunity. Snipers hiding behind cover could be flushed out with grenades or RPGs, and alternate flanking routes allowed me to approach firefights in multiple ways. The level design rewards thinking like a Battlefield player: if the enemy can occupy a space, so can you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mission culminated in a massive push on City Hall, reminiscent of defending a hard-won capture point in multiplayer. My squad and I held the line against relentless waves while clearing buildings and mopping up remaining enemies. The chaos of the finale mirrored the opening sequence, cementing the sense that the campaign isn’t afraid to keep objectives moving, destruction constant, and action relentless.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A Great Script</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other missions I got to play further reinforced this variety. Mission five began with a tense apartment sweep, clearing floors with my squad while using a sledgehammer to break dow n walls. The shootouts were intense and had me checking my corners diligently as my thermal scope helped me spot the pesky PAX in the dimly lit apartment building. This section ended with a shootout between apartment buildings – a bit of a shooting gallery moment as I waited for enemies to pop up so I could take them down, but still enjoyable nonetheless.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Going underground, the squad and I continued to pick off enemies in smoke and dirt-filled tunnels. Luckily, my thermal-scoped rifle was still in my hands, or this mission would've been much tougher. The mission then pivoted hard into a high-speed car chase through subway tunnels. While one of the more scripted moments of my entire preview, it was still fun to live through the spectacle, even if I felt like I didn’t have much control over what was happening. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After a short jaunt through a construction site, the mission reaches its big explosive moment by blowing up New York’s Brooklyn Bridge. The once intact bridge then becomes the final stretch of this mission, as I was then tasked to make my way through the rubble to disable some transmitters. While completely in shambles, I never found myself lost as I made my way through the bridge, and instead got to take in a Levolution moment in a single-player campaign. Again, I know it’s a scripted set piece, but blasting my way through the ruins still felt like an organic way to push the intense moments of the story further. Overall, the fifth mission once again proved that Battlefield Studios is looking to up the ante every moment they can. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Room to Roam</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Mission eight was easily my favorite. Instead of tight corridors, it opened into a semi-open map that gave me room to experiment. Playing as Gecko, the Recon, I had a bomb-dropping drone and a vehicle I could hop in and out of at will. Jumping into a Jeep with my squad beside me immediately brought back Halo vibes, marking the first mission I played that genuinely felt like I could set my own pace. The initial objective was to take out a few SAM sites, and from what I could tell, it seemed like I could approach them in any order – though my limited playtime didn’t let me fully test that freedom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The sense of choice made the mission really enjoyable. I wasn’t funneled into predetermined vantage points, so it was up to me to drive around and find good positions for my squad to post up and take down enemies. The drone added a whole new layer of strategy. I could get a bird’s-eye view of the battlefield to scout and mark enemies, then rain bombs down until the enemy spotted and destroyed my drone, which would trigger a brief cooldown before I could deploy it again.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Firing missiles from a first-person perspective to take down helicopters and tanks was incredibly satisfying.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The objectives escalated quickly, moving from taking out SAM sites to guiding rockets with the Switchblade system against waves of enemies. Honestly, this part was awesome – I’ll take more Switchblade missions, please. Firing missiles from a first-person perspective to take down helicopters and tanks was incredibly satisfying, and it honestly makes me want a mini-game just for that mechanic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The mission wrapped up with a climactic firefight across a dam, the drone continuing to add another chaotic layer while letting me choose how to approach combat. There’s even a Battlefield version of a boss encounter, where an enemy helicopter circles the dam and needs to be taken down. This mission isn’t as explosively over-the-top as some of the others, but the freedom it offers makes it stand out, and it still includes some epic set pieces that are genuinely fun to experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing these missions, it’s clear that Battlefield 6’s campaign isn’t filler. Battlefield Studios is taking what makes multiplayer memorable – destruction, unpredictable firefights, and meaningful squad dynamics – and trying to translate it into single-player form. And so far, they seem to be right on target. Whether I was storming beaches, chasing trains, or raining fire from a drone, the campaign consistently kept me on my toes and surprised me with new objectives and moments of spectacle. If the full release keeps this momentum, Battlefield 6 could finally deliver a single-player experience worthy of the series’ scale and intensity – something we arguably haven’t seen since the Bad Company days.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-preview-chaos-destruction-and-surprising-variety]]></content:encoded>

          <p>For decades now, the <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> franchise has been associated with Microsoft's own DOS/Windows operating systems and, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/ms-flight-simulator-on-consoles-finally-a-next-gen-game-for-xbox-series-x-s/">more recently</a>, Xbox consoles (weird exceptions like <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/22409/microsoft-flight-simulator/">this 1986 Macintosh port</a> notwithstanding). However, that era seems set to end as Sony <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enWyMpM0k4E">announced during this evening's State of Play livestream</a> that <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> will come to the PlayStation 5 on December 8.</p>

<p>The move isn't entirely shocking for modern Microsoft, which has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-says-its-taking-four-unnamed-xbox-games-to-the-other-consoles/">publishing previous Xbox exclusives</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/we-run-a-business-why-microsofts-indiana-jones-will-be-on-ps5/">competing consoles</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/do-xbox-owners-have-a-right-to-expect-console-exclusives/">increasing numbers</a> for a while now. And <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em> has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-has-animals-ai-terrain-careers-and-flydoos/">been available on Xbox Series S/X for almost a year now</a>, as the name suggests, giving Xbox owners a "timed exclusive" at least.</p>
<p>Still, it's a bit striking to see a franchise that literally has the Microsoft brand name <em>integrated into its title</em> moving to a major non-Microsoft platform like this. The impact is a little bit like <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Advance">seeing a Sonic game on a Nintendo console for the first time in 2001</a>, after years of Sega <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/learning-from-history-sega-nintendo-and-the-first-console-war/">selling itself as the anti-Nintendo</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, for Sonic's big move to happen, Sega had to exit the game console business entirely after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/dreamcast-dead-in-march.1024162/">the market failure of the Dreamcast</a>. Now that yet another major Microsoft game franchise is going multiplatform, one has to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/why-microsofts-next-xbox-should-just-run-windows-already/">wonder what the future of the Xbox as a distinct console even looks like</a>.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RnC-0BRz2dY?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>"We run a business," Microsoft's Phil Spencer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/we-run-a-business-why-microsofts-indiana-jones-will-be-on-ps5/">said in a 2024 interview</a>. "[The video game industry] has been growing for a long, long time, and now people are looking for ways to grow. And I think that us, as fans, as players of games, we just have to anticipate there's going to be more change in how some of the traditional ways that games were built and distributed [are] going to change... for all of us."</p>

		<p>So, you know the DualSense controller? That, but Kratos. Or, in other words, take a white DualSense, put a big red stripe down one side and some nice red buttons.&nbsp;That’s all they have done really, and that makes it very annoying that I love it and want one.</p>

<p>“In honor of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war/">God of War</a>’s 20th anniversary this year, we were thrilled by the opportunity to celebrate this milestone with a new DualSense controller design,” said Associate Art Director Dela Longfish from Santa Monica Studio.</p>
<p>“When we were deciding how best to embody the series, we immediately thought the form of the controller lent itself perfectly to Kratos’ omega tattoo. No matter which God of War game you’re playing, the shape of his red ink against the gray of his ash-covered skin is one of the most iconic elements of Kratos’ look across both Greek and Norse sagas. Our team made sure to represent both of these key tones in the color selection for the controller to make every aspect an authentic homage to the design that has defined Kratos for over two decades. ”</p>
<p>“We hope fans enjoy the controller and can’t thank everyone enough for all of the support you’ve shown Santa Monica Studio over the years!”</p>

<p>The God of War 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Limited Edition DualSense will be available in limited quantities for a eyebrow raising recommended retail price of $84.99 / €84.99 / £74.99 / ¥12,480. Pre-orders start on October 3, 2025 at 10am local time at <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/">direct.playstation.com</a> (for U.K., France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) as well as participating retailers globally.</p>
<p>There’s still a couple of months left in the year so maybe we will get something else to celebrate God of War’s 20th birthday. Maybe a look at that highly rumoured next game set in Egypt? Maybe? Please? Go on Sony.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yet another previously Xbox console-exclusive game is making its way to PlayStation, with Microsoft announcing during today's Sony State of Play event that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is coming to PS5 on December 8, 2025. What's more is that at some point in 2026, through a free update, the game will also get support to be playable through PS VR2.</p>



<p>Today's announcement confirms what we've been hearing <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-might-be-the-next-xbox-game-coming-to-ps5/">for months now through multiple rumours</a> that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">next game to make the jump</a> from an Xbox console-exclusive to PS5 would be Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Even just last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-playstation-5-november/">there was a new rumour circulating</a> that Flight Sim was going to make its PlayStation debut sometime soon.</p>



<p>Now, not only do we know that Flight Simulator 2024 is making the trip, the fact that it'll have PS VR2 support means that potentially, the best way to play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on consoles in, say, a year's time (depending on when the update arrives), will be on a PS5 with a PS VR2 headset.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>With up to 125 highly detailed aircraft, we have developed the largest and most diverse fleet ever assembled for a flight simulator</em>," writes Jorg Neumann, head of Microsoft Flight Simulator at Xbox Game Studios, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-soars-onto-ps5-dec-8/">in a PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We have</em> <em>an incredibly wide range of aircraft: nimble ultralights</em>, <em>a wide variety of general aviation aircraft, famous bush trip planes, rotorcraft, eVTOLs, airships, steerable balloons, all the way to sleek business jets, a fleet of narrow and wide-body airliners and even heavy military transporters and fighter jets</em>."</p>



<p>This new version will also take advantage of the DualSense controllers haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, and it'll come with support for gyro controls to immerse you even more if you don't have a full flight-stick setup.</p>



<p>Now that Flight Simulator is confirmed, and we've already seen the likes of Forza and Gears of War make their way to PlayStation, we're left waiting on games like Starfield, and of course, Halo. At this point, it just feels like it's a matter of time until all of Xbox's first-party games are released on PlayStation a year after they are released on Xbox, if they don't just make them simultaneous releases. </p>

            <p>
Sony and Housemarque's sci-fantasy shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saros">Saros</a> got its first proper gameplay trailer at PlayStation's latest State of Play this evening. If you were hoping for more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a>, then pour yourself a huge brimming flagon of victory mead, for this is basically Returnal plus a gruff male lead, a sunnier shape-shifting wasteland, and a force shield that converts attacks into juice for your biggest guns.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Do people drink victory mead in the world of Saros? This is not a question answered by the trailer. Instead, we're treated to a series of agile bangfights with enemies of all shapes and sizes. Some are robotic. Some are skull-themed. Some have more arms than seems strictly necessary. Some are large enough to give Kratos the cold sweats. See that Sony? Did you a cheeky bit of license cross-pollination there.

<p>
As in Returnal - a game that took Housemarque's shmup pedigree and applied it to a third-person roguelike shooter - most of these creatures are partial to spewing the most fantastically patterned fusillades of energy projectiles. It's as though somebody had sneezed while downing their victory mead, and skilfully angled their lips and nostrils to produce a crowd-pleasing firework effect, rather than an excruciating faux pas. If you dislike being sneezed on by cosmic goblins, the game's horizontal dash looks very effective providing you manage its cooldown. 
</p><p>
The trailer blurb recaps the story premise. In Saros you play Arjun Devraj, voiced by Rajul Kohli. He's a Soltari enforcer exploring the lost colony of Carcosa in the face of an eclipse that causes the landscape to shapeshift. I don't find Devraj that compelling as a character so far, but he's got a cool coat so we'll call it even Stevens. There are also some sad holographic people you can query about Carcosa's plight.
</p>
<p>
The key differences I can see over Returnal are 1) that energy shield, which also comes in handy up against laser beam traps and the like, and 2) a Second Chance revive mechanic, which sees Devraj slamming his fist into the ground and resurrecting in sheer petulance at having accidentally taken 400 bullets to the jaw. Housemarque have been keen to emphasise that this is a gentler roguelike than Returnal, with "permanent resources and progression making every death valuable". See also the tagline, "Come back stronger". 
</p>
<p>
All we need now is a PC release date. The thing I'd most like to hear about next is the bestiary. I adored Returnal's lore writing. I thought the 3D bullet hell stuff was bonkers, too, but mostly I'm here for knotty descriptions of exceedingly odd fauna.
</p>
<p>
<em>Disclosure: RPS co-founder Alec Meer wrote for Returnal and is the lead writer on Saros.</em>

            <p>
After four whole years of silence, PlayStation and Insomniac have very graciously offered up a new trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Marvel's Wolverine</a>. With gameplay no less! Horrifically gruesome, violent, and bloody gameplay that is so intense you should probably give it 15 minutes or so if you've just had your supper.
</p>
<p>
Right, here's what's important. Combat looks like it'll be borrowing from Spider-Man, which itself borrows from the Arkham series, as in that sort of rhythmic punching kind of thing, albeit with a lot more slicing and dicing. I'm talking claws up the skull, claws cutting off limbs, claws ripping bodies apart. A lot of claw action! Edwin also wanted me to make sure I mention how "sad and tender his eyes look while he's slicing peoples' elbows off," because there was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBib2xkYfE4">behind the scenes featurette</a> shown after the trailer that more or less pointed out just that.
</p>

<figure>
<p>

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I?autoplay=1" title="Marvel’s Wolverine - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games">

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3pDMUWlA6I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
This featurette also confirmed who'll be playing Insomniac's Wolverine: Liam McIntyre, an Australian actor who is no stranger to superhero stuff (he was in the TV version of The Flash) or video games (he played JD Fenix in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-4">Gears of War 4</a>). I'm sure someone will have some kind of complaint about this portrayal of the character, but he does have the iconic yellow suit at least.
</p><p>
You'll also learn about how there's some dedicated blood tech made for this game, which makes sense considering just how much of the stuff they packed into just two minutes of gameplay. Mr. Wolverine will also be a bit of a jet setter, as the game will take him to both the Canadian wilderness and Japan.
</p>
<p>
There'll be some familiar comic book faces too, as Mystique made an appearance (arguably a more interesting protagonist for a game mechanically, but I digress), as well as Omega Red. Apparently there's some hints for other characters too, you'll have to wait for the "Top 10 Things You Missed In The Wolverine Gameplay Trailer" video that some YouTuber will push out by tomorrow to get a headstart on that SEO.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and there's a release window too! It'll be coming in the northern hemisphere's fall, 2026, but it is worth noting that's just on PS5. A PC release is all but guaranteed given that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-s-spider-man">Marvel's Spider-Man</a> 1 and 2 have both received one, just a good while after their initial releases. There's another look at the game coming in spring too, so for now, just enjoy Wolverine's grunting and screaming and all the mess he makes. Again, seriously, don't eat anything while watching this.

              <p>Classic sci-fi immersive sim <em>Deus Ex</em> is returning with a fresh coat of paint and updated features, compliments of Aspyr. The remaster about a futuristic society crumbling beneath the weight of feckless governments and wild conspiracy theories arrives at a hell of a time.</p> <p>“Question Everything. Trust No One,” reads the tagline to a game with many fans, including billionaire Elon Musk. <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1321245225755512832">He called the original “one of the best games ever” in 2020</a>. This new remaster promises visual upgrades and quality-of-life improvements similar to Aspyr’s existing HD remasters of the <em>Tomb Raider</em> games. Hopefully,&nbsp; <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em> will be the definitive way to replay one of the most important games of the century. At least it will make the PC version accessible on console. The PS2 version, <em>Deus Ex: The Conspiracy</em>, joined PS Plus earlier this year.</p>  <p>The irony of Elon Musk’s love for the game has haunted it in recent years. One of the game’s original writers, Austin Grossman, called it the immersive sim’s “worst legacy” <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-favorite-game-deus-ex-conspiracy-2000624003">in an interview earlier this month</a>.</p>

 <p>“That kind of political weight and social satire is a real common thread between&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dishonored</em>,” Grossman, who co-wrote the Warren Spector-directed hit with Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/deus-exs-influence-on-elon-musk-may-be-its-longest-worst-legacy-says-its-writer/">recently told&nbsp;<em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “It is the thing that Elon Musk likes, creepily. It is creepily in Elon Musk’s worldview. So that may be its longest, worst legacy.”</p> <p>Musk has been a lifelong gamer with a notorious career as an amateur Quake player back in college. Last year, however, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">he was caught cheating at games like <em>Diablo 4</em> and <em>Path of Exiles 2</em></a> by allegedly paying other people to boost his accounts. Trust no one, indeed.</p>
