Ubisoft's sparkling new version of the beloved Beyond Good &amp; Evil includes a touching tribute to Emil Morel, the veteran Ubisoft Montpellier developer who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-2-creative-director-emile-morel-dies">sadly died last year aged just 40</a>. 
</p>
<p>
A bouquet of flowers can now be found lying on a bench in Hillys' centre, with an envelope marked simply by the letter 'E'. 
</p>
<p>
I've checked with Ubisoft to see if this addition is indeed a tribute to Morel from the game's development team, and been told yes.

<p>
Morel served at Rayman and Beyond Good &amp; Evil studio Ubisoft Montreal from 2009, and helped craft the wonderful Rayman Legends as its lead game designer. 
</p>
<p>
More recently, Morel had taken on the role of creative director for Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 - the long-awaited successor which is referenced significantly via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evils-new-anniversary-edition-content-demands-bge2-is-made">new content added to Beyond Good &amp; Evil's 20th Anniversary Edition</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's fitting, then, that this new release also pays tribute, as we wait to see more of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, which remains in development. 
</p>
<p>
"For us, Emile was a close friend and a boundless source of positive energy," Ubisoft Montpellier <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ubisoft-montpellier_cest-avec-une-profonde-tristesse-que-nous-activity-7082727131201294336-I853/">wrote</a> last year. "We all valued his passion and the way he told stories.
</p>
<p>
"We will never forget Emile and his immense contribution to the BGE2 universe will forever endure."

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-official-reveal-trailer-ahead-of-gameplay-showcase/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will feature a ton of different armor options, and players will not be forced to sacrifice utility for looks, thanks to a "robust" transmog system.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/04/bespoke-armor-transmog-and-other-aspects-of-gear-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Game Informer</a>, the new entry in the series will feature tons of different armor options for both companions and the main character, Rook. Companions will have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot and a weapon slot, while the main character will also have a helmet slot, two weapon slots a belt, an amulet slot and two ring slots. Belts will play an important role, as they influence the potency of healing potions, and some of them can proc additional effects like invulnerability. The game will also feature plenty of bespoke gear that can only be equipped by certain companions or Rook's classes.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it seems like players won't be forced to equip gear in Dragon Age: The Veilguard they think does not look good. Game Director Corinne Busche confirmed the game will feature a robust transmog system that will allow players to apply the stats of a certain piece of gear to another with a different appearance. Both Rook and the companions' gear can be transmogrified as well, giving players the maximum amount of customization options for all their party members.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launches later this year on PC, Playstation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

In response, Furukawa said generative AI can be used “in creative ways,” but said its use “also raise issues with intellectual property rights.”</p><p>Artificial intelligence and its uses in games is one of the hottest topics within the video game industry, with some studios <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-neo-npc-prototype-is-a-glimpse-at-the-future-of-how-well-interact-with-games"><u>touting AI-generated NPCs</u></a> or <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/king-researchers-talk-about-the-results-of-using-ai-at-gdc-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>AI-driven level creation</u></a>, Others have expressed concern about its potential impact on jobs, particularly in art, quality assurance, and performance.</p><p>Generative AI thus far has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/15/1238111971/video-games-ai-artificial-intelligence-nvidia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>drawn criticism</u></a> from players and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24042070/gdc-state-of-the-video-game-industry-survey-2023-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>creators</u></a> due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/05/gettyimages-1197632699-1720174716875.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Shuntaro Furukawa (R), and Shigeru Miyamoto (L).

Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can be used in creative ways, but we recognize that it may also raise issues with intellectual property rights.</blockquote><blockquote>We have decades of know-how in creating the best gaming experiences for our players. While we are open to utilizing technological developments, we will work to continue delivering value that is unique to Nintendo and cannot be created by technology alone.</blockquote><p>Nintendo’s mixed statement here comes as its video game console rivals go all-in on AI.

This personal information sharing, one of the leading complaints amid the game’s ‘mixed’ Steam user reviews rating, is supposedly required because Nexon uses it to track what players are doing in The First Descendant in order to improve it. Lee Beom-jun insisted Nexon does not use players’ personal data, rather the nicknames they choose.</p><p>There is no explanation for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-dev-offers-solution-for-frame-rate-drops-delete-and-reinstall-the-game">The First Descendant’s ultra aggressive monetization</a>, however, which some players have described as “microtransaction hell.”</p><p>Despite all these problems, The First Descendant has enjoyed a big launch, with a huge 239,513 peak concurrent players so far on Steam. That’s enough to put the game in Steam’s top five most-played games. Sony and Microsoft do not share player numbers.

            <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment will exhibit at Tokyo Games Show this year.</p>
<p>The PlayStation maker's presence at the convention was confirmed along with the launch of the <a href="https://tgs.nikkeibp.co.jp/tgs/2024/en/">Tokyo Game Show 2024 visitor's site</a> yesterday (4th July). Sony hasn't had a major presence at the Tokyo Game Show since 2019.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, 731 exhibitors have been confirmed to be participating in Tokyo Game Show 2024, with the likes of Sega, Square Enix, Bandai Namco and Nintendo all in attendance. </p>

<p>"The event will be held on the largest-ever scale and will host a total of 3190 exhibition booths, exceeding last year's record in TGS history," the Tokyo Game Show social media account shared yesterday.</p>
<p>As to what Sony will exhibit during this year's show - which runs from 26th September to 29th September - that for now remains a mystery. One of PlayStation 5's biggest upcoming releases, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-channels-the-pure-game-design-of-nintendo-as-playstation-turns-towards-families">Astro Bot</a>, would have already made its debut by that time, with the adorable-looking platforming set to arrive on 6th September.</p>
<p>Other Sony releases this year include its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc">God of War Ragnarök on PC</a>. Concord is scheduled for PS5 and PC on 23rd August. Ragnarök, meanwhile, will make its PC debut on 19th September.</p>
<p>Perhaps, we could hear more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-officially-titled-on-the-beach-coming-2025">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, which we got our first proper good look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-sonys-playstation-state-of-play-2">back in January, during a State of Play</a>.

            <p>Obsidian have spent a lot of time tuning up Avowed's combat in response to negative reactions to the new action-RPG's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidians-first-person-fantasy-rpg-avowed-is-coming-this-autumn">initial reveal footage at an Xbox developer direct</a>, with gameplay director Gabe Paramo conceding that the team could have oiled the hinges and buffed the contacts a little more before showing the game off.</p><!--more-->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/avowed-interview-2024#section-creating-the-best-obsidian-rpg-ever-with-avowed">Windows Central</a>, Paramo noted that Obsidian had always planned to give the game's sword-and-sorcery component some love, but were persuaded by the reaction to prioritise this aspect before showing Avowed off again at this year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/xbox-games-showcase">Xbox summer showcase</a>. "Sometimes you can lose sight on the importance of the prioritization of some things," he told the site, adding that "we thought [Avowed] was good enough to show as is... A lot of that stuff we knew we were going to get to before shipping." The developers took the feedback in their stride: "We just went 'Okay, let's look at this, this is a big deal, people are noticing this, we should polish this sooner,'" Paramo said. </p>
<p>So where and how have they added some jazz? "We really analyzed the feeling and moment when the player swings their weapon and the moment of impact," Paramo explained. "Were there any delays, was there any system that might have been preventing it from being immediate?" The developers also "looked at posing... to give that visceral, immediate feedback" - posing being, in my very dim understanding of videogame animation, the introduction of character poses that are designed to catch the eye and stick in the memory. "We really focused on that, and the blood impacts, and VFX feedback, and the audio," Paramo went on. "We basically went and looked at all the pieces that make [combat] feel more juicy." </p>
<p>I find this story interesting not least because I'm always interested, and alarmed, to hear about what developers can change after showing a videogame off without giving themselves tonnes of extra work and losing sight of what they're making. Paramo's description sounds like it could be as elementary as changing some speed values somewhere, but it probably isn't. In my experience, every videogame production is a Jenga tower where every last piece is somehow the one right at the bottom.</p>
<p>Here's one thing Obsidian likely couldn't have introduced in response to reveal trailer feedback: Avowed's choice of a first or third-person perspective, because no, it's not as simple as yanking the camera out of your character's head. "[Third-person perspective] is definitely something that requires work to be done after you solidify and understand what game you're making," Paramo commented elsewhere in the piece. </p>
<p>"If I make a swing in first person, I now need to make a swing in third person, in another type of view. They're not shared meshes or animations -- they are different, and our system supports playing them at the same time," he went on. "If you look at your shadow, you'll be able to see the same third-person animations as the first-person representative mesh is doing. So, we had to do it early, because we basically needed to double the amount of animations." </p>
<p>There's more in the full chat, including thoughts on whether Obsidian considered adding multiplayer given the success of Baldur's Gate 3 on his front, and given that Avowed was  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidian-really-pushed-avowed-as-a-co-op-rpg-pivoted-to-single-player-in-eight-months">"really pushed" internally as a co-op RPG to begin with</a>. Tl;dr it would have messed with the game's storytelling, and Obsidian don't have Larian's long experience of mining the co-op coalface. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-release-date-details-everything-we-know">everything else we know about Avowed</a> at the time of writing.</p>

			<p>A modded Nintendo Switch with 8GB of RAM, instead of the vanilla 4, is almost the Pro model we never got, as it is capable of running multiple PC games rather well.</p>
<p>YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a> recently released a new video showcasing multiple PC games running on this modded system with 8 GB RAM, CPU running at 2.6 GHz, and GPU at 1.26 GHz using Box64 + Wine on an L4T Ubuntu 18.04 with custom kernel OS. While the low resolution is obviously expected, some of these games running particularly well. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, for example, manages to run at a respectable 30 FPS or close enough in most scenarios, as does Stray. An older game like Devil May Cry runs even above 30 FPS, which is definitely not ideal for a character action game but is impressive nonetheless. Despite some evident issues unrelated to the hardware, Fallout New Vegas even manages to run at 60 FPS in a small indoor location and at around 30 FPS in the more open areas.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time we have seen evidence of how the limited amount of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-ram-performance/">RAM</a> impacted the Nintendo Switch the most, as the modded system showcased in today's video was also able to run <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-oled-modded-8-gb-ram/">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at 4K resolution.</a></p>
<p>Thankfully, Nintendo seems well aware of the issue and will likely ensure that the Nintendo Switch successor has enough RAM to run modern games smoothly. According to shipment data, the console should sport 12 GB of RAM, which could deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12-gb-lpddr5x-ram-better-xbox-series-s/">better texture quality than the Xbox Series S.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-appears-to-be-teasing-another-secret-character<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The Japanese website for Sonic x Shadow Generations appears to be teasing another possible playable character.
</p>
<p>
The Sonic Generations remaster includes both classic and modern Sonic characters, as per the original release, as well as a brand new campaign for nemesis Shadow the Hedgehog.
</p>
<p>
Under the <a href="https://sonic.sega.jp/SonicXShadowGenerations/character.html?sideQuery=0&amp;charaQuery=0">character section of the website</a> all three characters are shown, along with a blank box with the words "coming soon". But who could it be?

</figure>
<p>

Perhaps the most obvious suggestion would be some form of Classic Shadow character to match Sonic. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-the-best-of-00s-sonic-with-a-big-dash-of-nostalgia">Sonic Team's Takashi Iizuka previously told Eurogamer</a> the game would not include Classic Shadow levels, though it will feature 2D elements in the level design.

</p>
<p>
Presuming this is a playable character to fit in existing levels, could Super Shadow be included as a separate character? Or could we see Metal Sonic as an additional, playable nemesis? (He's already a boss in Sonic's campaign)
</p>
<p>
Maybe it's not a bad guy at all, which would open the door to anyone: Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Rouge, or even Trip from Sonic Superstars. Dare I say it: Big the Cat fishing minigame?
</p>
<p>
However, as fan account <a href="https://tailschannel.com/tailschannel/07-04-24-statement/">Tails' Channel</a> suggests, this may not be a playable character at all and just a featured character. In short, don't get your hopes up just yet.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-release-date-leaks-ahead-of-potential-summer-game-fest-reveal">Sonic x Shadow Generations will release on 25th October</a> across PS5, Xbox One/Series X/S, Switch, and PC. That's ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jim-carrey-returns-as-dr-robotnik-in-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a>, which will feature Shadow the Hedgehog.

            <p>
Cut voice lines have been discovered for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree's final boss.
</p>
<p>
A dataminer discovered the lines in the game's internal files when comparing English and Japanese dialogue and shared to reddit.
</p>
<p>
The lines themselves don't offer any groundbreaking insight, but it's certainly an interesting decision to cut the lines. <strong>Major spoilers for the final boss follow</strong>.

<p>

The lines in question are attributed to Radahn, the DLC's final boss, who is completely mute in the final game.
</p>
<p>
The three lines read: "I am Radahn", "Born of red-maned Radagon, and Rennala of the Full Moon", and "A lion bred for battle".
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1duo7us/cut_dialogues_from_dlc_spoilers/">Cut dialogues from... (DLC Spoilers)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LaMi_1/">u/LaMi_1</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/">EldenRingLoreTalk</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
Of course, we already know who Radahn is from the base game, so this doesn't add to his character. But the decision to remove the lines does link to his relationship with Miquella.
</p>
<p>
It might seem strange that Radahn is silent, but my own interpretation is that - as Miquella's Promised Consort - he is essentially Miquella's voiceless puppet. After all, this is the Land of Shadow and a separate realm from the base game where the player already defeated Radahn.
</p>
<p>
Having Radahn speak would have given him agency away from Miquella's "brainwashing", as a popular fan theory noted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-final-boss-cut-dialogue-lines/">Game Rant</a> suggests.

</p>
<p>
What's more, the item description for the Remembrance of a God and a Lord acquired by defeating Radahn and Miquella states Miquella saw Radahn's "strength and his kindness". Having Radahn roar that he's "a lion bred for battle" would have undermined this.
</p>
<p>
Have you finished Shadow of the Erdtree? What did you think of the final boss?
</p>
<p>
Many players have criticised the DLC for its high difficulty, but in subsequent patches FromSoftware has eased the challenge. Last week the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">balance of Shadow Realm Blessings was revised</a>, while yesterday <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-1123">a couple of bosses were tweaked to make them easier</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dagon-by-h.p-lovecraft">Dagon: by H. P. Lovecraft</a> developers Bit Golem announced this week that they’ve raised 200,000 złoty (around $50,000) towards humanitarian aid charities aiding Ukranians, including the Polish Red Cross, Save the Children, and Voices Of Children. Dagon itself is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free game</a>, but has several pieces of paid DLC, all of which are currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481400/Dagon_by_H_P_Lovecraft/">on sale</a>.</p>

<p>The two-person Polish dev team - who have previously delved into less terrifying waters with work on Ultimate Fishing Simulator - have also hit 1,700,000 downloads of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> since launch in 2021.

<p>Alongside a new DLC for Dagon to thank their community, Bit Golem are currently working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873750/Pool_of_Madness/">Pool Of Madness</a> - quite literally, Lovecraftian pool.

		<p>We’re massive RPG fans here at TSA, and they don’t get much bigger than the Ys series. Ys X: Nordics is the long-awaited next entry in the series, and while it released in Japan last September, Western gamers have had to patiently wait for news of its release on these shores. Fortunately, they don’t have to wait too much longer, with the game’s release date set for the 25th of October, 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ys X: Nordics - Release Date Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iEK29mNDsI0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Releasing on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, you’ve got a host of places to play – sorry Xbox gamers – where you’re going to be exploring uncharted islands, engaging in fast-paced action combat, and experiencing adventures on the high seas with central protagonists Adol and Karj. Despite only releasing in Japan so far, it’s been well received so far, with an <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/15589/ys-x-nordics">Opencritic rating of 83</a>, and praise for its enjoyable storytelling and classic RPG styling.</p>
<p>A physical Limited Edition will be available to pre-order exclusively from the&nbsp;<u><a id="yiv0913458192LPlnk" title="https://store.nisaeurope.com/" href="https://store.nisaeurope.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NIS UK &amp; EU Online Store</a></u>&nbsp;today at 10:00am BST.&nbsp;A special bundle will also be available to pre-order which includes the Limited Edition and a Lil’ Adventurer Adol Plush and a Lil’ Pirate Princess Karja Plush Set.</p>
<p>With this being the tenth release in the series, Ys has clearly found a legion of fans over the years, and that shows little sign of slowing down with the recent announcement that we would also see a remaster of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/02/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana-announced-for-ps5-ps4-and-switch/">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghast</a>, originally release as Ys III: Wanderers from Ys, in the near future.</p>


<p>The most recent Ys title to release here was Ys IX: Monstrum Nox in 2021, and once again it received high praise from Miguel, our resident Ys expert, who awarded it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-review/">8/10</a>, saying, “Ys IX: Monstrum Nox is the most ambitious Ys game to date, delivering a larger focus on narrative and a much more involved and organic world to explore. The game stumbles under its ambitions a bit, with a slow opening chapter and a consistently struggling framerate. Despite those issues, though, this is easily one of the best entries in the long-running franchise, and while veteran fans will get a lot out of the callbacks sprinkled throughout the game, newcomers are still in for one of the best action RPGs of the year.”</p>
<p>Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more on Ys X: Nordics as we get closer to October 25th!</p>

			<p>Modding group Team Luminescent is seemingly working on native unofficial decompiled PC ports of Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the team took to X with the "biggest news" in the history of its Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl mod. A video was shared showing the booting of Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. According to the modding team, not only do the games boot, but main menu can be accessed as well. "It may not look too pretty now, but in time, it will be the best base for fangames/romhacks", the team <a href="https://x.com/LuminescentTeam/status/1808700107820577272" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>With Nintendo being notorious for taking down fan projects, emulation, ROM hacks, and what not, the team will be implementing legal protections to make sure the project won't be taken down. As such, no assets of the game will be included with the project, and these unofficial PC ports will require users to have a legal rip of the Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl roms. As<a href="https://x.com/LuminescentTeam/status/1808721795845140898" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> noted</a> by the team, users can "only use created assets or ones from the game."</p>
<p>Interestingly, once finished, these unofficial native ports will offer vastly improved performance compared to running these games via an emulator. "Additionally, it will run 100% natively on whatever platform you export to. This means *exponentially* better performance than running it through an emulator. Not to mention, inserting assets will be MUCH easier than it currently is with a romhack."</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-brilliant-diamond-and-shining-pearl-remakes-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</a> were released back in 2021 for the Nintendo Switch. Both versions are remakes of 2006's Pokemon Diamond and Pearl for the Nintendo DS.</p>
<p>It's an interesting project for sure, and we're pretty sure that Pokemon fans will be excited by this news. Earlier this year, we already <a href="https://wccftech.com/second-native-zelda-majoras-mask-pc-port-released-recompiled-project-adds-analog-camera-support-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported on native <span>recompiled</span> PC port of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a>.</p>

		<p>This is the week of too many free-to-play games. I wanted to start The First Descendant, I have started Zenless Zone Zero, but I mostly spent my time playing Star Wars Hunters which is a surprisingly enjoyable arena shooter for Switch and mobile. Other than that, it’s been Elder Scrolls Online: The Gold Road, and I checked out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/01/dustborn-preview-a-comic-book-masterclass-of-superpowers-puritans-and-punk-rock/">Dustborn</a> for a preview.</p>

<p>Checking in with the team, Aran has been playing Blacksad Under The Skin for review, and some Football Manager 24. He gave us a full rundown, saying, “I got sacked by United, hired by Nottingham Forest after they got relegated after only managing 15 points in the season. Came in, sold a load of players, got new ones in. We’re currently 4th in the Championship and are in the 4th round of the Carabao Cup, beating rivals Derby 8-0 in the 3rd round.”</p>
<p>After Death Stranding, Jim finally started on Cyberpunk 2077 despite having had it since launch! It was still in the cellophane! He told us, “I’m glad I held out as there have been plenty of major updates and quality of life improvements, as well as the free PS5 upgrade. I have to say that I really wasn’t gelling with the game’s opening couple of hours. However, I remember feeling the same way about The Witcher III and, sure enough, once the training wheels started to peel away, I felt more at home with Cyberpunk’s mix of FPS and RPG gameplay.”</p>


<p>Meanwhile, Reuben has been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, which will have a review in progress next week. He’s also been dipping back into Ace Attorney thanks to the recent Nintendo Direct with another playthrough of Spirit of Justice. He says, “It’s still the weakest of the Apollo trilogy, but damn if the writing isn’t stellar at points.”</p>
<p>Over in the US, Miguel has been playing a bunch of Elden Ring, but as of last night Zenless Zone Zero has officially launched so now he’s putting all of his free time into it and absolutely loving it. That’s not all though, as he says, “I’ve also been playing a bit more of my gacha game guilty pleasure Nikke Goddess Of Victory this week than usual bc theyve just launched a massive Dave The Diver collab where you literally play Dave The Diver as a “minigame” inside this anime girl game. Technology!”</p>

<p>Steve has finally played some Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and luckily he thinks it’s really good! He says, “Combat is functional but the story and worldbuilding are fantastic. I’ve also put some time into a couple of review titles, NES World Championship and Magical Delicacy. Started Sons of the Forest with my old man online group which is pretty fun.”</p>
<p>This week, Ade and his partner have been smashing through Diablo IV. He told us, “We’re really enjoying it, though oddly, I gotta say, we’re finding the game too easy. We’ve got it set to the 2nd World Tier (the other tiers are currently locked) but few of the bosses even slow us done, let alone stop us. Not sure if we’ve done something wrong (or right, I guess?) But hopefully the challenge will pick up, otherwise the combat is going to become pretty repetitive.”</p>

			<p>Today, Falcom and NIS America unveiled the Western release date for Ys X: Nordics. The single player action RPG will be available starting October 25 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731870/Ys_X_Nordics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/ys_x_nordics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/ys-x-nordics-0ed760?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/ys-x-nordics-announced-for-playstation-consoles-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in December 2022, the game launched in Japan on September 28, 2023, albeit only for consoles. A Windows PC port debuted in Asian markets on March 14, 2024.</p>
<p>Chronologically, Ys X: Nordics <a href="https://wccftech.com/ys-x-nordics-will-be-set-after-first-two-entries-in-the-series-first-footage-coming-early-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">takes place after the first two entries in the franchise</a>. There are also some major gameplay changes, as the game only features two playable characters rather than the usual party. New features include sailing and ship combat.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/guerrilla-games-provides-unconvincing-reason-as-to-why-lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-coming-to-xbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guerrilla-games-provides-unconvincing-reason-as-to-why-lego-horizon-adventures-isn%E2%80%99t-coming-to-xbox.919386/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/guerrilla-games-provides-unconvincing-reason-as-to-why-lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-coming-to-xbox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two months ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-forbidden-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Guerrilla Games had been working on LEGO Horizon Adventures, a spin-off title based on the post-apocalyptic franchise.</p>
<p>The official announcement came at Summer Game Fest 2024, when we discovered that the Dutch team had partnered with Studio Gobo to develop a fully multiplatform game scheduled to launch this Holiday on PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch. Well, not quite 'fully', as Microsoft's Xbox console is missing.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/astro-bot-team-asobi-lego-horizon-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Stephen Totilo's Game File</a> on the topic, Guerrilla Games Narrative Director James Windeler said:</p>
<p><em>Right now, we're just very much focused on pushing this hardware to its limits and making this game look as absolutely amazing as it can possibly be on this hardware, and you know, we don't really have anything to announce about Xbox right now.</em></p>
<p>To be honest, it's not really a convincing reason. The developers may be pushing PS5 to its limits, but the game is also launching on the Nintendo Switch, and the Xbox Series X is certainly at least as capable as the PlayStation 5 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-ps5-often-runs-games-better-than-the-allegedly-more-powerful-xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">albeit with some differences</a>). With that said, they didn't say never to an Xbox version, so it's not out of the realm of possibility. On the other hand, Sony really doesn't like publishing its games on its chief rival console unless it absolutely has to, like with MLB The Show.</p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures sadly won't support co-op online play either, as Guerrilla Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-switch-for-everyone-no-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> earlier. Still, it should be a fun romp, especially for kids.</p>
<p><em>In a far future, where giant mechanized beasts roam a landscape reclaimed by nature and humans live in primitive tribes, an ancient evil seeks to destroy the world…</em></p>
<p><em>Join hunter Aloy as she leads a colourful crew of heroes on a quest to save the meadows, forests, and mountains of Earth from a man called Helis, who leads a gang of sunworshippers that follow an Ancient Evil shrouded in mystery.</em></p>
<p><em>Dive into a thrilling adventure alone, or with friends with couch co-op or online play, customize your home in true LEGO style, and uncover stunning secrets from Aloy’s mysterious past along the way.</em></p>
<p>In other Horizon news, Rolling Stone has <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/umbrella-academy-steve-blackman-abuse-allegations-1235047142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tv-show-is-in-the-works-by-the-umbrella-academys-showrunner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netflix TV show</a> isn't moving forward anymore due to the allegation made against showrunner Steve Blackman.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Best LVOA-C Loadout in XDefiant [Season 1 Update]]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-lvoa-c-loadout-in-xdefiant/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-lvoa-c-loadout-in-xdefiant-season-1-update.919377/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-lvoa-c-loadout-in-xdefiant/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The LVOA-C was added to XDefiant with the Season 1 update, and many players that favour mid to long-range combat gravitated to it almost instantly. It hits hard and doesn’t offer much in the way of recoil from stock, but there’s plenty that you can do to make this weapon one of the most formidable ARs in the game. To that end, we’re breaking down the best LVOA-C loadout in XDefiant – all you need to do is unlock the weapon, acquire the attachments, and soak up the kills.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-lvoa-c-in-xdefiant">How to Get The LVOA-C in XDefiant</h2>



<p>The LVOA-C, which has a TTK that beats out the fan-favourite M4A1, is easy enough to unlock. If you’ve ever played Call of Duty, you’ll note that it’s a similar operating method.</p>



<p>To unlock the LVOA-C in XDefiant, you’ll need to progress to rank 20 of the battle pass, whereupon you’ll unlock the powerful AR free of charge. It’s a bit of a grind, but you can of course jump up the battle pass faster by buying tiers or securing the Premium Pass, which comes with 12 tier skips – you’ll only need to get through eight ranks to get the LVOA-C.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-lvoa-c-loadout">Best LVOA-C Loadout</h2>



<p>Here’s the best build for the LVOA-C in XDefiant:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compensator </strong>Muzzle</li>



<li><strong>Vertical Grip </strong>Front Rail</li>



<li><strong>Extended Mag </strong>Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Heavy Grip </strong>Rear Grip</li>



<li><strong>Padded </strong>Stock</li>
</ul>



<p>With this LVOA-C loadout, you’ll be keeping your recoil low while prioritising lead down range, with the extended magazine providing much-needed extra ammunition to beat XDefiant’s inherently slow TTK. You’ll be given boosts to avoid flinching when firing and the Padded Stock brings a strong control buff, which means that sustained fire and target acquisition will both be a walk in the park for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-alternate-attachments-for-the-best-lvoa-c-loadout">Alternate Attachments for the Best LVOA-C Loadout</h2>



<p>If you want to prioritise power and introduce more recoil, throw on the Chrome Lined Barrel and Barrel Extender, replacing the Heavy Grip with the Quick Draw Grip to claw back some ADS speed.</p>



<p>If fully negating your recoil is what you’re after, swap the Padded Stock for a Reinforced Stock and forgo the  Heavy Grip for the Grip Tape to increase your control of the weapon. Then, adding a Stabilizing Barrel and combining it with a Compensator is all you need to do to make the recoil on the LVOA-C almost non-existent – simple!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-another-push-into-nft/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Ubisoft has partnered with Double Jump.Tokyo to ‘accelerate’ global web3 game adoption, using an all-new platform called Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles to push a series of NFTs into the faces of gamers worldwide. This isn’t Ubisoft’s first foray into the blockchain-backed world of NFTs, though – toward the end of 2021, the firm revealed Quartz, a full-fledged NFT-based platform that fell flat on its face <strong>so </strong>fast.</p>



<p>Since then, Ubisoft linked up with Immutable to try again to make something valuable out of NFTs, but nothing tangible has yet come of that relationship. So, it’s Ubisoft hoping that the third attempt will be the best yet.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-here-we-go-again">Here We Go Again</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.doublejump.tokyo/post/double-jump-tokyo-and-Ubisoft-Accelerate-Global-Web3-Game-Adoption">a recent press release</a>, it was revealed that Ubisoft has partnered with Double Jump.Tokyo to integrate web3 mechanics into Champions Tactics, a new player-vs-player tactical RPG that Ubisoft is working on. Following successful integrations with other developers and publishers, Double Jump.Tokyo has joined forces with one of the most impactful names in gaming – but it’s not something that’ll go down well in the wider community. </p>



<p>In a statement, the CEO of Double Jump.Tokyo, Hironobu Ueno, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Joining forces with Ubisoft marks a significant milestone for double jump.tokyo. We are thrilled to explore the potential of web3 and digital ownership in gaming alongside Ubisoft. Partnering with a renowned global industry leader like Ubisoft empowers us to continue our unwavering pursuit of delivering exceptional games to communities while accelerating the worldwide adoption of web3 gaming technology.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ubisoft uncovered Champions Tactics last year, but it went relatively silent on the project until now. At the end of 2023, the firm released 9,999 ‘Warlords’ NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, making them free to mint and giving them the function of being ‘tickets’ for the impending release of playable characters: The Champions.</p>



<p>Through the power of Double Jump.Tokyo’s Oasys Layer 2 HOME Verse blockchain, players will be able to mint three Champions without any charge, with the offer going live from July 18. They’ll need three Champions in a squad to compete against other players, and each Champion they mint will have a unique look and range of abilities.</p>



<p>Will this latest venture be a success for Ubisoft?</p>

<p>It’s always exciting when Escape From Tarkov drops an update, especially when it’s right before the weekend. I don’t know about you, but I usually take a full Saturday off after a patch to check out what’s new, what’s broken, and whether or not I’m still terrible at the game (Spoiler: I am!). For now, let’s check out the Escape From Tarkov patch notes today!</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-escape-from-tarkov-patch-notes">Today’s Escape From Tarkov Patch Notes</h2>



<p>The most recent Escape From Tarkov update proves rather comprehensive. It’s a big one, with countless new tasks, additional customization, the ability to wipe your PvE profile, AI adjustments in the PvE game mode, balance adjustments, and plenty more.</p>



<p>If you consider yourself a hardcore fan of EFT, then you’ll want to parse through the following patch notes for the game line by line!</p>



<blockquote>
<h4>PVE ZONE offline single player</h4>



<p>For all players with access to PVE ZONE, raids for solo players will be run on the local PC. The game experience, as well as the operation of in-game mechanics, is completely identical to online play.<br><strong>For group raids, raids as a Scav, and raids on Streets of Tarkov, the game will utilize the servers.</strong></p>



<h4>Wishlist mechanics</h4>



<ul>
<li>Players can add an item to one of several pre-created Wishlist categories. Items added to Wishlist are displayed in a separate section of the Handbook;</li>



<li>Wishlist items have unique visual differences. When obtaining such items through various methods, the player will receive a corresponding notification. Players can customize the frequency of notifications in the game settings;</li>



<li>Added the ability to automatically add items needed for Hideout to Wishlist. The available options for this feature can be configured in the game settings;</li>



<li>The Wishlist persists after wipes. You can clear the list manually in the game settings.</li>
</ul>



<h4>In-game feedback surveys</h4>



<ul>
<li>Added a community feedback survey system within the game, available at the “Surveys” tab in the bottom menu;</li>



<li>Completing surveys helps improve the quality of the game based on community feedback;</li>



<li>Players can earn in-game rewards for completing surveys.</li>
</ul>



<h4>AI adjustments in PvE mode</h4>



<ul>
<li>AI PMCs now pick up items, loot crates and bodies, trying to choose more valuable loot;</li>



<li>They can also pick up weapons and equipment, and if they find better equipment, they replace theirs with it;</li>



<li>AI PMCs can travel all over the location. They build routes to points of possible loot concentration. Bots move in tactical formation. When they reach the destination point, they collect loot, and then can wait for enemies for some time, setting up ambushes;</li>



<li>AI PMCs now extract from the location if they have collected enough loot or enough time has passed since the start of the raid;</li>



<li>AI PMCs now sprint more often when moving in open terrain;</li>



<li>AI PMC level on beginner Ground Zero will be limited to level 20;</li>



<li>All AI will now react to the enemy if information about them came from any nearby bot. For example, if you are spotted by a bot and they yell, all bots regardless of faction will hear it and decide to move in your direction, take cover or perform other actions;</li>



<li>AI Scavs will now travel all over the location and search for valuable loot. Scavs are less picky about loot quality than AI PMCs. Scavs move between potential loot destinations in tactical formation if they are traveling in a group;</li>



<li>This is the first iteration of AI improvements within PvE mode. In future updates, we also plan to refine the tactical behavior of AI, as well as the interaction system between AI of different factions.</li>
</ul>



<p>In future updates, the necessary mechanics will be moved to PvP mode.</p>



<h4>New tasks</h4>



<ul>
<li>Added the Nostalgia quest line for the game’s life path, available only to owners of the Edge of Darkness edition bonuses;</li>



<li>Added a new quest line for obtaining Mark of The Unheard, allowing owners of any edition to obtain this item in PvE mode;</li>



<li>Added a new quest line for obtaining extended PMC pockets, allowing owners of any edition to obtain this item.</li>
</ul>



<h4>Customization</h4>



<p>Added new outfits for USEC and BEAR, available for purchase for “Lega” Medal. Purchasing these outfits requires high standing with Ref.</p>



<h4>PvE profile wipe</h4>



<p>Expanded the profile reset options in the profile page on the website. Now you can reset your PvE and PvP progress separately or together.</p>



<h4>Compensation for reporting players who violated game rules</h4>



<ul>
<li>Players will receive in-game currency compensation after the report that led to the blocking of the violator;</li>



<li>Compensation comes with an in-game message informing of a successful report. Compensation for several successful reports will be combined.</li>
</ul>



<h4>Balancing adjustments</h4>



<ul>
<li>Increased the spawn chance of the following optics:
<ul>
<li>VOMZ Pilad 4×32 25.4mm riflescope;</li>



<li>Burris FullField TAC30 1-4×24 30mm riflescope;</li>



<li>EOTech Vudu 1-6×24 30mm riflescope;</li>



<li>Leupold Mark 4 LR 6.5-20×50 30mm riflescope;</li>



<li>March Tactical 3-24×42 FFP 30mm riflescope;</li>



<li>Vortex Razor HD Gen.2 1-6×24 30mm riflescope;</li>



<li>Schmidt &amp; Bender PM II 1-8×24 30mm riflescope;</li>



<li>SIG TANGO6T 1-6×24 30mm riflescope;</li>



<li>Hensoldt FF 4-16×56 34mm riflescope;</li>



<li>Nightforce ATACR 7-35×56 34mm riflescope;</li>



<li>Schmidt &amp; Bender PM II 3-12×50 34mm riflescope;</li>



<li>Schmidt &amp; Bender PM II 5-25×56 34mm riflescope;</li>



<li>NcSTAR ADO P4 Sniper 3-9×42 riflescope;</li>



<li>BelOMO PSO-1 4×24 scope;</li>



<li>BelOMO PSO-1M2-1 4×24 scope;</li>



<li>BelOMO PSO-1M2 4×24 scope;</li>



<li>NPZ USP-1 “Tyulpan” 4x scope.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Reduced the recoil for the following bolt-action rifles:
<ul>
<li>Accuracy International AXMC .338 LM bolt-action sniper rifle;</li>



<li>Mosin 7.62x54R bolt-action rifle (Infantry);</li>



<li>Mosin 7.62x54R bolt-action rifle (Sniper);</li>



<li>SV-98 7.62x54R bolt-action sniper rifle;</li>



<li>Lobaev Arms DVL-10 7.62×51 bolt-action sniper rifle;</li>



<li>Molot Arms VPO-215 “Gornostay” .366 TKM bolt-action rifle;</li>



<li>ORSIS T-5000M 7.62×51 bolt-action sniper rifle;</li>



<li>Remington Model 700 7.62×51 bolt-action sniper rifle.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Increased the leveling speed of Hideout Management and Crafting skills;</li>



<li>Removed the hearing distance bonus from the Perception skill.</li>
</ul>



<h3>List of changes:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fixed the incorrect physics of character bodies and loot objects in offline raids;</li>



<li>Fixed the EFT and EFT: Arena interaction UI when interacting with Ref;</li>



<li>Fixed the cause of incorrect behavior of character bodies after death;</li>



<li>Fixed several localization errors in interface and tasks.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-how-big-is-the-escape-from-tarkov-update">How Big is the Escape From Tarkov Update?</h2>



<p>Despite the massive number of changes to the game, I’m continually impressed by Battlestate Game’s ability to shrink-wrap an update into such a small package for us. When I booted up the EFT Launcher, my game downloaded an 83 MB patch to bring it up to 0.14.9.5. It took mere seconds to finish the download. A little longer to unpack and check the file’s integrity before I could play. </p>



<p>All in all, I was back in-game in minutes.</p>



<hr>



<p>This is just one small update, though.

But because it's gone, and was so difficult to fully document, it can be tough to get a real idea of what the scale of the place was like beyond some old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLn_QTFVZgE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">footage, photos and first-hand accounts</a>. </p><figure></figure><p>It used to be the most densely-populated space on Earth!

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/04/netflixs-horizon-zero-dawn-show-has-been-scrapped/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix%E2%80%99s-horizon-zero-dawn-show-has-been-scrapped.919287/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/04/netflixs-horizon-zero-dawn-show-has-been-scrapped/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rolling Stone has published a troubling report about Steve Blackman, the showrunner for The Umbrella Academy, in which they say he has been accused of “toxic, bullying, manipulative, and retaliatory behaviour”. Sadly it’s yet another story of a alleged abuse, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic remarks, and a toxic workplace.</p>
<p>Blackman calls the claims “entirely untrue” and “completely absurd”.</p>


<p>As well as running The Umbrella Academy Blackman was also adapting Horizon Zero Dawn for Netflix along with an outer-space thriller series called Orbital. Rolling Stone reports that both of these projects are no longer moving forward.</p>
<p>The Horizon TV show was revealed by Sony in an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/27/gran-turismo-god-of-war-and-horizon-tv-shows-announced-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor briefing </a>in April 2022 but it was not until August that year we had more details, including the confirmation that Steve Blackman was going to be the showrunner. The synopsis was also revealed.</p>
<p><em>“Co-created by Steve Blackman and Michelle Lovretta,&nbsp;Horizon Zero Dawn is an epic sci-fi adventure series set a thousand years in the future, in a strange and beautiful world full of primitive tribes and high-tech machines, all built on the bones of the ‘Old Ones’ – the ruins of our present-day United States. The disaster that destroyed our world is long forgotten, but when these formerly peaceful machines mysteriously turn into dangerous hunters of all life, a young outcast named Aloy discovers that the only chance to save her world is to fight to uncover what happened to ours.”</em></p>

<p>A Horizon television show always seemed implausible as almost everything would have to be CGI, including the many robot creature, and that would be very expensive. In comparison something like The Last of Us can use real world locations, a log cabin in the woods is a log cabin in the woods, even if it’s a few years after a plague.</p>
<p>However all is not lost for Horizon fans as there is the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/07/lego-horizon-adventures-revealed-for-ps5-switch-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming LEGO game which will launch on PS5, Switch, and PC this Christmas.</a></p>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/umbrella-academy-steve-blackman-abuse-allegations-1235047142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rolling Stone</a></em></p>

Naoe is the fictional daughter of the real Fujibayashi Nagato; <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained"><u>Yasuke</u></a> is based on the real, 16th-century Black samurai of the same name.</p><p>Set during the late Sengoku period (or Azuchi-Momoyama era) of feudal Japan, Shadows begins in 1579 during a time of civil war within the country, complete with the era’s samurai, shinobi, Portuguese merchants, and Jesuit missionaries. The two protagonists converge as they find themselves on opposite sides of conflict: Yasuke served as a retainer to Nobunaga, the daimyo who led the Oda clan in its invasion of Iga; Naoe, under the leadership of her father, is part of the Igan resistance.</p><p>Here’s the official synopsis from Ubisoft:</p><p><em>Live the intertwined stories of Naoe, an adept shinobi Assassin from Iga Province, and Yasuke, the powerful African samurai of historical legend. Against the backdrop of the turbulent late Sengoku period, this remarkable duo will discover their common destiny as they usher in a new era for Japan.</em></p><p>Like Assassin’s Creed Mirage and the original AC before it, Shadows’ main targets can be assassinated in any order. “One thing that we really wanted is [to make] sure the world feels alive, and those targets are always in the world,” said game director Charles Benoit. “So it's possible that you’ll encounter some of them without really knowing about them before.</p><p>Quests, therefore, won’t point you toward your next target but will “guide” you with hints. “It's less of ‘follow a quest up to a point’, but it's much more, ‘I want to do this’ and then you'll find the way how to do it,” said creative director Jonathan Dumont. </p><h3>Feudal Japan Setting</h3><p>Assassin’s Creed is well known for its exploration of different places and eras with each new entry. This year’s game takes players to feudal Japan, specifically 1579 through the early 1580s. Shadows is set during the end of the tumultuous Sengoku period at the height of Oda Nobunaga’s power when the warlord overthrew the Ashikaga shogunate and began his campaign to unify the warring factions of Japan.</p><p>Central Japan, where Nobunaga held power, will serve as the center of Shadows. Locations we’ve seen in the hitherto released trailers include the Iga province and Takeda Castle.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3>Game Length and Map Size</h3><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is closest in size to 2017’s Egypt-set Assassin’s Creed Origins, according to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/japan-set-assassins-creed-shadows-is-around-the-same-size-as-assassins-creed-origins"><u>Dumont</u></a>. "It's in-line with the latest Assassin's Creeds that we've done," he said, referring to the series’ post-Syndicate RPGs. "On a scale level, maybe we can compare it a little bit more to the size of Assassin's Creed Origins.</p><p>"We did want to have a much closer to real life scale ratio,” Dumont added. “So because castles took a lot of space, and we really wanted the mountains to feel like mountains, [we've made] the environments feel wider in the game. But I would say around the same size as Origins."</p><p>Dumont didn’t comment on game length, though we’ll note Origins main story takes roughly 30 hours to complete, according to IGN sister site <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/46402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>How Long to Beat</u></a>.</p><h3>Does Assassin’s Creed Shadows Have a Modern-day Story?</h3><p>Ubisoft has yet to reveal details about Shadow’s potential modern-day segments, though it sounds like there will be one. Assassin’s Creed executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/assassins-creed-shadows-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game File</u></a>, “You are in the Animus,” when asked about the modern day in Shadows. He also revealed Assassin’s Creed Infinity will be known as the Animus hub and serve as a portal to the series’ modern-day sections moving forward.</p><p>This section will be updated as more information is announced.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 id="gameplay">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Gameplay</h2><h3>Yasuke and Naoe Differences</h3><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows allows you to switch between Yasuke or Naoe at will, with the exception of introduction quests and character-specific missions.</p><p>Naoe plays as a more typical assassin; she’s equipped with a Hidden Blade and the ability to kill stealthily by scaling walls and hiding in foliage. As Naoe, you’ll also have access to throwable kunai and her chained blade, which is swung around to slice through enemies and environments. The assassin is also given a grappling hook to improve traversal; it can be attached to the edges of roofs and other miscellaneous anchor points. “It's all physics-based, so there's a little bit of improbability sometimes when using it,” said Dumont. “There's a danger to using it, but you could also perform assassinations from it.”</p><p>Yasuke, on the other hand, has a more head-on approach to combat; the samurai’s heavy armor keeps him on the ground, where he excels as a master swordsman.</p><p>Each character has individualized skill trees and gear, though XP, collected weapons, and resources are shared.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3>General Combat</h3><p>Dumont says the team’s goal was to make Shadows’ combat feel “spectacular,” and to this end they’ve increased the amount of environmental items that can be carved up or destroyed and reintroduced instant kills with the Hidden Blade. “The thing that shines the most, I feel, in Assassin's Creed, it's really the Hidden Blade, the assassination, being able to stay hidden,” said Benoit. “So that's the core that we want to keep. What we needed to push forward [was to make it] feel a bit more modern in the approach.”</p><p>Shadows also adds duels reminiscent of those seen in Akira Kurosawa's samurai films. “When we have a mini-boss type of fighter, we really want it to feel like a duel,” said Benoit. “So this exchange of blocking, parrying, dodging. So it's always like a dance.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><p>Weapons you’ll acquire throughout Shadows include katanas, the kanabō war club, yari spears, shuriken, kunai, and the kusarigama (sickle on chain). Weapons have their own skill trees, and proficiency is increased by playing with each weapon. These can be found or crafted by gathering components throughout the game world. And yes, the ability to transmog is still here, allowing flexibility in the appearance of your gear.</p><p>Yasuke and Naoe will also be faced with a new enemy type: servants. These characters exist between civilians and enemies, and are able to raise alarms and call for reinforcements.</p><h3>Exploration and Traversal</h3><p>The big addition to Shadows world is a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-50-details-you-need-to-know"><u>light-dark system</u></a>, which has a major influence on the game’s stealth mechanics. Powered by an upgraded version of Ubisoft’s Anvil engine, Shadows global illumination system creates dynamic light and shadows that affect enemy vision. You can influence this by snuffing out lamps and taking out torch carriers. The degree to which you are hidden is displayed through a new light meter on the UI.</p><p>The light-dark system intersects with Shadows new seasons mechanic, which changes the terrain (and therefore how you interact with it) as spring turns to summer, fall, then winter. Seasonal differences include changes to weather/wind, bodies of water (swimmable or frozen), the height of grass, foliage, enemy positioning, and visibility. “Players will have to adapt constantly to what the environment is giving them,” said Dumont. The seasons will change as you progress through the main quest.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Eagle vision, which allows you to see characters through walls, returns in Shadows, though gone are the drone-like birds used to scout locations in Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. In an effort to reduce the amount of map icons, climbing to the top of synchronization points no longer unlocks a portion of the map, rather they provide a vantage point from which you can survey the surrounding area for highlighted points of interest. However, these locations still serve as fast-travel points.</p><p>Shadows will take you through Japan’s diverse landscape of towns, trading posts, farmland, mountains, forests, and historic castles rendered nearly to scale. Each castle serves as a type of bespoke dungeon, according to<strong> </strong>Benoit, who added, “It’s so big, it's like an adventure each time you go in the castle.”</p><h2>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Development</h2><p>Ubisoft Quebec is leading development of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The studio previously headed up development on Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, Syndicate, and Black Flag, as well as 2020’s Immortals: Fenyx Rising. Over a dozen other Ubisoft studios are providing development support.</p><p>Jonathan Dumont, creative director of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, is again overseeing the creative direction of Shadows. Charles Benoit, who served as a game designer on Odyssey, is the game director for Shadows.</p><p>Shadows was first announced in 2022 as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-announced-with-two-new-games"><u>Assassin’s Creed Codename Red</u></a>. It was officially named and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-dual-protagonists-and-more-revealed-by-ubisoft"><u>subsequently unveiled</u></a> in May 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Assassin's Creed Review</h3></div></output><h2>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Editions, Preorder Bonus</h2><p>Ubisoft is selling three <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-collectors-edition"><u>editions of Assassin’s Creed Shadows</u></a> — Standard, Gold, and Ultimate — as well as a GameStop-exclusive Collector’s Edition.

Just within the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/13/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator">character creator</a>, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Companions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit. The better Rook's belt, the better the potency of their healing potions, which are replenished by destroying green pots scattered about the world. That's not all, though, as higher-quality belts can proc [<em>editor's note</em>: proc is a term used as a shorter way of saying "programmed random occurrence"] additional effects like momentary invulnerability.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>When creating your character, you can immediately view aspirational armors, which won't play into Rook's class until the "mid-to-late game," according to game director Corinne Busche. You can also toggle Rook's starting gear and casual wear in the creator, giving you a pretty good look at how Rook will look in more laidback cutscenes, in combat, and how they might appear later in your Veilguard journey. Busche tells me a lot of the gear in Veilguard is bespoke to your Rook or their followers, which is to say, an armor piece for a Warrior-class Rook probably won't be in a chest for a Mage-class Rook. On a similar note, armor designed for companion Bellara Lutara can't be used for another companion like Lace Harding.</p>

<p>In just my few hours viewing Busche play the game as part of my visit to BioWare's Edmonton office for our current <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2024/06/09/cover-reveal-dragon-age-the-veilguard"><em>Game Informer </em>cover story</a>, I see a lot of armor to collect from things like chests scattered about Arlathan Forest, for example, and elsewhere. Some of it looks awesome, and some of it doesn't quite line up with my personal taste. That's how it goes in the genre of RPGs.</p>

<p>However, Busche tells me there is transmogrification, or transmog for short, in the game, and calls it "robust." This means you can take an armor's stats and apply it to a different piece of armor. In other words, if you have a really cool piece of armor you like and find a new piece with better stats but don't want to give up the look of your current armor, you don't have to. Transmog allows you to take that new armor's stats and apply them to your current armor, giving you all the benefits while keeping the visual style you prefer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transmog isnt just for Rook, though; you can transmog armor and other things for your companions as well. I don't get to see how Veilguard's transmog system works in-game, but just knowing it exists allows me to rest easy knowing my Rook will look as fashionable as possible while saving Thedas.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/guilty-gear-strive-anime-teaser-trailer-debuts-at-anime-expo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>During Anime Expo, Arc System Works unveiled a world premiere teaser trailer for its upcoming Guilty Gear anime, Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers, which is set to be released sometime next year. </p><p>Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Riders is a 3D CG anime adaptation of the eponymous fighting game that is being animated by <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/537/SANZIGEN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SANZIGEN</u></a>. While the teaser gave little away story-wise, the trailer did showcase the long-running fighting game's central characters, Sol Badguy and Sin Kiske. The trailer, which is stylized in a similar fashion to the game's cutscenes, pits the pair against a mysterious new foe named Unika, who has a grudge against Gears. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Arc System Works America (@ArcSystemWorksU) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcSystemWorksU/status/1808932912542462425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Guilty Gear stands head and shoulders above other fighting games series thanks in part to it being one of the flashiest anime fighters of all time. Consequently, Guilty Gear also has a reputation for being one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/QIjtNL7Pfqw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>hardest story timelines to follow</u></a>. A case in point is the fact that the story mode for Strive's predecessor, Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2, is essentially an uninterrupted hour-long anime unto itself. For folks wondering where Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Riders will sit in the series storied lore, here's a plot synopsis for the show:</p><p>"After the decline of the once robust fields of science and technology, a new energy source known as magic fuels the modern era," the official description reads. "Humanity creates forbidden biological weapons: Gears. Those Gears eventually stand against humanity in a rebellion. Although they manage to overcome in the struggle for survival known as the Crusades, humanity’s losses are so great that even after several decades pass, their emotional wounds remain unable to fully heal. </p><p>"Sin Kiske, the child of a human and a Gear, heads to his father Ky and mother Dizzy’s wedding ceremony. Their wedding breaks the ultimate taboo: a union between a human and a Gear. Even with the world at peace, it took many years for such a ceremony to come to fruition. Despite the complex array of emotions surrounding it, the wedding ceremony is met with blessings. When suddenly, a mysterious girl appears… The fated child inheriting Gear blood–and the mysterious girl who despises Gears. Their meeting would shake the world."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/guilty-gear-strive-review"><u>our review</u></a> of Guilty Gear Strive, we gave the game a 9/10, saying, "Guilty Gear Strive sets a new standard for anime-like fighting games with its visuals, stellar netcode, and flexible fighting system that encourages and rewards creativity."</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.
