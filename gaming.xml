      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As for the Terraria-specific content, players can tackle the game's Moon Lord as Palworld's latest raid boss. Terraria's Eye of Cthulhu is featured in the promotional art for the update, and this looks to be a Pal-type monster that players can fight and potentially catch. Six new weapons and seven armor pieces from Terraria have been added as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the update includes the addition of treasure maps, a new NPC mission system, more Pal skills, and several new items to craft for bases. There are also bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who have not experienced Palworld yet, this is a great time to jump into the game and explore the Tides of Terraria update. Palworld is currently on sale for 25% off its full price on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/" rel="nofollow ">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9nkv34xdw014">Xbox</a>, and the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/palworld/">PlayStation Store</a>.</p>

            <p>Sony is sticking to its guns, and won't be releasing its first party games day one on its PlayStation Plus subscription service.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/playstation-plus-15th-anniversary-interview-ghost-of-tsushima">GameFile</a>, vice president of global services at PlayStation Nick Maguire said the company was "not looking to put games in day and date" on PS Plus, and will instead stick with its current way of doing things.</p>
<p>This is, of course, very different from Xbox, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">often puts big first party releases such as Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and many more on Game Pass from the get go.</p>

<p>Sony, meanwhile, has added some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-prince-review">third party games like the excellent Blue Prince</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stray-launches-next-month-included-in-pricier-playstation-plus-tiers-on-day-one">Stray to PS Plus on the same day as their initial launch</a>.  But the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">likes of God of War Ragnarök and Horizon Forbidden West</a> - both from Sony's first party studios - weren't added to the service until around a year after their initial release.</p>
<p>"Our strategy of finding four or five independent day-and-date titles - and using that to complement our strategy of bringing games in when they're 12, 18 months old or older - that balance for us is working really well across the platform," Maguire continued, before adding:</p>
<p>"If there were six or seven great opportunities, then we would go for them as well."</p>
<p>When asked if the company had considered the benefit of putting its own first party live-service titles on PS Plus, with Concord -  the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-pvp-shooter-concord-is-firewalk-studios-first-game">debut game from Sony's FireWalk Studios</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PS5 and PC debut</a> - being used as an example, Maguire declined to give a specific comment. The Sony exec did say, however, that PS Plus has "proven itself to be a great way to introduce new players to franchises" when they arrive on the service.</p>
<p>"There's always going to be a moment for any game where there's the right time for it to go into Plus, when it's ready to reach a wider audience or… to find new fans or new parts of our platform that it hasn't already reached," Maguire said.</p>
<p>This month, Remedy's multiplayer Control spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/herere-your-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-games-for-june">FBC: Firebreak was available to all those on PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium tiers</a> day one. However, even when included on a subscription service, some live-service games still flop. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s Foamstars, for example, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/foamstars-season-pass-ends-with-ironically-titled-party-goes-on">failed to set the world alight despite being part of the PS Plus catalogue</a>.</p>

<p>Today's comments echo what the exec stated back in 2023, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-still-wont-be-putting-new-games-on-playstation-plus-day-one-says-exec">Maguire said putting games on to Sony's subscription service "a bit later in the life cycle" is working for the company</a>. Therefore, this will "continue to be [its] strategy moving forward," Maguire said at the time.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, meanwhile, Sony president Hideaki Nishino stated the company is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-will-continue-to-add-more-value-to-ps-plus-says-company-president-but-it-may-come-with-price-changes-too">open to adjusting the price of PlayStation Plus in the future</a>, as it aims to "maximise profitability".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-really-wont-be-putting-new-first-party-games-on-playstation-plus-day-one-any-time-soon]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II has a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> release date on 12th August, Ninja Theory and Xbox have confirmed. This enhanced release of the game is also coming as a free update to the game on Xbox Series X|S and PC at the same time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bOSjv1Nb1-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, how is it enhanced? Ninja Theory has outlined the new features that are coming to the game:</p>
<p>New features and upgrades included in the Enhanced release include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance Mode</strong> – Where the original release was optimized for 30fps to deliver an immersive, cinematic experience, the Enhanced update will include a ‘Performance Mode’ to optimize for 60fps. On PC, the game will offer a “Very High’ preset to push fidelity even further based on personal hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Dark Rot Mode</strong> – The Dark Rot from <em>Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em> has returned and offers an additional challenge for Senua in this optional game mode. The Dark Rot will grow each time you fail, and if it reaches Senua’s head, her quest is over and all progress will be lost.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Photo Mode</strong> – the Enhanced update will include an expanded and improved toolset, including a new ‘Motion’ tab for custom cinematic video capture.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Commentary –</strong> for those interested in the craft and creative decisions behind <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>, the Enhanced update includes over four hours of developer commentary from a variety of voices involved in the making of the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not explained here if or how the game will take advantage of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, but we’d anticipate that there’s at least a resolution boost to the Performance Mode.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/24/microsoft-explain-why-they-bought-ninja-theory/">Microsoft’s acquisition of Ninja Theory in 2018</a> came off the back of the success of Hellblade. The studio had struggled to find stability for quite some time, despite critically acclaimed games like Heavenly Sword, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and DmC: Devil May Cry. The first Hellblade was an experiment in small budget game development at AAA quality, and it was a major hit for the studio. It was also a PlayStation 4 console exclusive at its original 2017 launch before being ported to Xbox and Switch in subsequent years. That Microsoft’s acquisition meant that the sequel would be Xbox exclusive was unpopular with PlayStation gamers, to say the least. But Microsoft’s current cross-platform strategy is at least breaking down this barrier for one of the most visually stunning games of last year.</p>
<p>Playing the game last year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review/">we said</a>, “Just like its forbear, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is an oppressive, powerful and haunting example of the power of video games, and one that sets its own parameters for what a digital experience can be. It is a game that must be experienced, not least because, there’s nothing else quite like it.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-update-1-5-brings-huge-a-life-changes-new-threats-and-more.1228188/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.5, which brings yet more improvements to the game's much-talked-about A-Life system, as well as new threats to face and more.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-patch-14" rel="nofollow">May's Update 1.4</a>, Update 1.5's main feature is a big boost to the A-Life AI system, which, I think it's fair to say, was released in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">fairly incomplete state</a> when the game launched in November.</p>

<p>Per the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525346350588494399" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, the A-Life system now means "life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player's view". This means characters will continue to pursue their goals and live their lives away from what you're seeing, and there are other A-Life changes intended to make the game's AI more immersive as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.5-a-life-pointing.jpg?itok=CmT3ExGY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.5-a-life-pointing.jpg?itok=K51wC2rH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2</em>'s characters should act a little more believably now.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the new A-Life system, you can also look forward to a new hazard in the form of the Water Electric Tornado, and as the name suggests, you're not going to have a good time if you encounter it.</p>

<p>Of course, the new update also brings a ton of bug fixes and balance tweaks with it, so you might want to head back into the Zone if you've been having trouble with glitches. There's obviously no guarantee your particular issue (or "anomaly", hem hem) will have been fixed, but it's worth a go, eh?</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the long-awaited sequel to 2007's&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chornobyl&nbsp;</em>(which was recently renamed to reflect the Ukrainian spelling of the city upon the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-legends-of-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of the remastered version</a>).</p>

<p>Like the original, the game will have you exploring the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in search of artifacts, and you'll meet a full cast of characters, who have now been even further enhanced by the A-Life system.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. No mention of a PS5 version has been made yet, but given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">friendliness</a> with which Xbox has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">approaching</a> PlayStation in recent months, I wouldn't be surprised if a release is on the cards for the future.</p>

            <p>A work-in-progress version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>'s first big post-release patch is now testable on Steam, so you can hop in and check out the changes Funcom's making early doors before it rolls out for everyone in a few weeks.</p>
<p>A bunch of the changes the game's devs teased or confirmed during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">their recent AMA </a>and letter to players haven't found their way into the patch, or at least this early version. Though, you'll at least be able to try out PvE in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-enter-deep-desert">the Deep Desert</a>, something folks have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-deep-desert-is-getting-partial-warfare-pve-areas-so-you-can-gather-endgame-resources-without-being-pvped-to-death">demanded en-masse</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Alongside pointing folks to the freshly launch Dune: Awakening Public Test Client on Steam, where you can now test out patch 1.1.10.0, Funcom have released <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/announcing-public-test-client/">the notes</a> outlining what's in it.</p>
<p>Among the highlights is the news that "the PvE area near the shield wall has been expanded to cover row A, B, C, D and half of E within the Deep Desert." So, you'll be able to check out some Deep Desert PvE, which folks had been calling for to avoid being forced into PvP during Awakening's endgame, when you're hunting for the best gear and resources.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Sleepers, we have news!</p><p>Patch 1.1.10.0 is now live on the new Public Test Client.

<p>I have noticed a few folks on the social arguing that this PvE expansion is too big an adjustment - we'll have to see what the consensus is. Outside of that, Funcom have "reduced the frequency of Harkonnen attacks on certain Atreides bases (and vice versa) in Hagga Basin", set up the main menu's play now button to filter out private servers, and made sure "sandworms now linger for a bit around spicefields that have been recently harvested from".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can now use, claim and list items straight to and from the inventory of your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-get-ornithopter">Ornithopter</a> in the exchange. There are a bunch of handy minor tweaks to everything from base building to vehicles, combat and the UI. However, if you're hungry for the big PvP changes that the devs have teased, adjustments to the Landsraad, or just the ability to deposit all of your stuff at once, you'll have to keep waiting.</p>
<p>In the meantime, why not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-am-enthralled-by-dune-awakenings-in-game-radio-drama-and-bad-sitcoms">listen to the radio</a> and read our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-review">DA review</a>?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-first-major-patch-has-entered-public-testing-so-you-can-give-some-deep-desert-pve-a-go]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-yes-another-excellent-climbing-game.1228176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love a rock climbing game, despite the fact that I have hardly climbed at all since moving back to New York. Every climbing game seems to have its own unique take on the sport, from <a href="https://aftermath.site/new-heights-climbing-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hyper-realistic</a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-would-live-in-this-climbing-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fantastical</a>, from <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-jusant-gets-rock-climbing-right" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enjoying the view</a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/cairn-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focusing on what’s under your hands and feet</a>. The take of recent indie game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Peak</em></a> leans toward both fantasy and simplicity, doing away with the affectations of other climbing games to make things both easier and more difficult.</p><p>It’s pretty clear to me that <em>Peak</em> wants to be played co-op, and honestly I might have given up on my solo session if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a> hadn't praised playing it alone. The game opens with your plane crashing on a mysterious island, where you have to climb from a beach to a plume of smoke at the top of a mountain. With friends, I could see this being a hilarious or back-stabbing adventure; alone, I at first found it a bit challenging to make progress while managing my character’s weight and stamina. Without a friend to boost or pull me up a lengthy rock face, or companions to spread the weight of gear around with, I had to spend a lot of time circling the mountain looking for short climbs. But eventually I got the hang of it, making it to the top of the mountain and opening up new, more challenging areas to scale.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="PEAK Trailer: OUT NOW!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jrlUVhLBjG0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Peak</em> has its own approach to climbing mechanics. Instead of looking for handholds or routes, you can basically climb anything simply by pressing a button to attach to it. This relative ease is made complicated by your stamina bar, which, unlike other climbing games that use stamina as one of several meters, is the entire deciding factor in how far you can climb. You have just the one bar, and then things take chunks out of it: how much stuff is in your backpack, being hungry, getting injured. Each of these is represented by its own color and symbol, making it easy to understand why your whole stamina bar isn’t available.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aggro Crab/Landfall: The meter in the bottom left shows the impact of certain conditions on your stamina</figcaption></figure><p>Less easy is what you’re supposed to do about it, which is where a lot of the fun of <em>Peak</em> comes in. Dealing with hunger is particularly complex; in addition to packaged food you can find in suitcases scattered around the world, there’s also edible plants and fruits. They’ll all address your hunger, but they have hidden effects too. In my time with the game, desperate for food so I could regain stamina and make progress, I made my situation worse by carrying heavy coconut halves, or poisoned myself with mysterious berries. Other foods have positive effects; if you’re encountering something for the first time, there’s no way to know what it will do except try it out.</p><p>There’s also plenty of environmental hazards: In the first level, I regularly slipped on jellyfish if I wasn’t careful to scoot around them. In the second mountain, a jungle slope replete with rain and thorny vines, I wandered into…<em>something</em>: my screen went purple and my poison meter shot up, and of course I tumbled to my death. The mountains change on regular intervals, so while enough play will probably undo the mystery of these hazards, there’s still new things to discover and overcome.</p><p>All of this means that, alone, I frequently felt like I couldn’t make any progress when situations had taken too much out of my stamina and there was no one to help me address it. On the standard difficulty there’s also a time limit, enforced by rising fog, though you can lower the difficulty to turn it off. But once I accepted that I couldn’t make the long climbs of other games and had to get a bit more creative, <em>Peak</em>’s solo gameplay opened up to me. It became less about brute forcing my way up as quickly as possible and more about exploring and learning the land, strategically choosing my path to make little pieces of progress. And, the higher I got, the more tense things got: the riskier climbs and jumps felt, the more stressful deciding whether to eat a new food became. Every pathway and item required a careful balancing of risk versus reward, while the game’s straightforward mechanic and bright colors kept things feeling more goofy than grim.</p><p>I’m enjoying <em>Peak</em> on my own, though I’d love to try it out with friends. <em>Peak </em>started life as a game jam game between developers <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-crab-has-a-gun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aggro Crab</a> and Landfall, and has gone on to sell <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/im-gonna-crash-out-new-climbing-game-peak-has-sold-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week-outperforming-its-developers-most-popular-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million copies</a> in its first week, which means probably someone I know owns it and can be convinced to listen to me wax poetic about climbing while we fling and drop each other to our dooms.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review"><h3>Lies Of P: Overture Is The Best Parts Of The Game Executed With Confidence</h3></a><p>Lies of P: Overture proves the success of the first game was no fluke, and establishes a bold house style.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/adventure-gamers-online-casino-gambling-website-sale-parasite-seo"><h3>Adventure Games, Poker And Casinos Do Not ‘Overlap’, You Weirdos</h3></a><p>No normal person could type 'Recognizing the growing convergence between gaming and gambling'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/peak-climbing-impressions-review]]></content:encoded>

Because the lip on the Killswitch eliminated the buffer that was designed to absorb movement between the console and controller--which is needed to create a fulcrum point when you remove the Joy-Con 2s--several users had begun reporting that their console detached from the controllers far too easily.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"When holding the Switch 2 in a specific way, detachment between the Joy-Con 2s and [the] remainder of the console can occur," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/" rel="nofollow ">Dbrand explained</a>. "Some experience this issue. Some do not. This discrepancy is due to a manufacturing tolerance issue on the retaining lip that keeps the Joy-Con Grip attached to the Joy-Con. Anyone who suffers from the manufacturing tolerance issue can reach out and we'll get them better Joy-Con Grips in July. One nuanced point that got a bit lost in the prior update was that there <em>is</em> an alternative to the retaining lip. It's been tested and is already in-market on a few Switch 2 cases. It's adhesive. The problem with adhesive is that, given enough time or the wrong kind of stress, it will ultimately fail."</p><p>In our own testing, we did manage to replicate the issue with the Killswitch that several Switch 2 owners have experienced. The catch here is that this did require us to have our Switch 2 held at very specific angles to properly replicate, and we needed to apply some considerable force to the console as well.</p><p>While this appears to be an issue that some people are experiencing, the updated version will still be worth grabbing, as the Killswitch does offer some of the best ergonomic support, thanks to its design when compared to competitors like Satisfye and JSAUX. The Killswitch offers ridges for your fingers to rest in, resulting in a comfortable and natural grip.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dbrands-nintendo-switch-2-killswitch-grip-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6532032/" data-ref-id="1100-6532032">Check out our previous story on the Killswitch</a> for more details about the grip, including the unique dock adapter, optional travel cover, and bundle options.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">New platforms like the Nintendo Switch 2 are a siren call for many developers—and being selected by Nintendo to create a launch-exclusive title can be a huge boon for a game studio. So developers may have been surprised to see one of the few platform-exclusive titles at launch was a game called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/survival-kids-switch-2/">Survival Kids</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's published by Konami, but was developed entirely in-house by engine and in-app advertising company Unity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given Unity's prior aversion to developing games with its own engine (a practice sometimes called "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/business/dogfooding.html">dogfooding</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">"), it was surprising to see the company land in such a prominent position. But as producer Andy Dennison explained to Game Developer, this doesn't mean Unity is all-in on internal game development. The team cooked up </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to achieve two major goals: first, to make a game fully "end-to-end" with Unity to help Dennison's team with its main task: parachuting in to help Unity developers solve engine-specific technical problems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And second: to prepare Unity—and everyone who uses it—for the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="From ">From <span>Gigaya</span> to <span>Survival Kids</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity nearly began making games with its own software in 2022 with the game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://unity.com/blog/games/introducing-unitys-latest-sample-game-gigaya">Gigaya</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was meant to be a "sample" game and a commercial product. But just two months after the game was announced, it reportedly laid off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-is-reportedly-laying-off-hundreds-of-employees">the bulk of the development team</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and canceled the project.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2-shows-nintendo-s-strategy-for-a-social-future" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo Switch 2 shows Nintendo's strategy for an online social future</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the same year, Unity was quietly ramping up a division called "Unity Studio Productions" in the United Kingdom. Its first employee was Dennison, who leads the studio, primarily helping developers "behind the scenes" optimizing Unity. "You don't often hear about the work we do," he admitted in a recent chat with Game Developer, saying that the team's projects can range from short-term engagements like high-level performance profiling to larger long-term projects like porting or moving codebases from one engine over into Unity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dennison said that these smaller projects taught Unity plenty of lessons that could be used to improve the engine. "But they're always relatively narrow windows into [game] development," he explained. "You might only be looking at a specific problem or platform." That drove Unity to resurrect the idea of making a game entirely in-engine from end-to-end.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was in late 2022 that Dennison and his colleagues connected with Konami at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, striking it up with Konami Europe exec Richard Jones. There the two teams hit it off, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> entered development in March 2023.</span></p><p>Image via Unity/Konami.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a slew of Leamington Spa-area developers on the team (many veterans of Codemasters, Playground Games, and Rare), Dennison said the company was able to ship </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a relatively quick two-year period. With neither Konami or Unity relying on the game's success to prop up their financials, Dennison said the Studio Productions team could focus on "replicating what many of our customers go through."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They're building games with [schedules], with scope they have to think very carefully about, and a team they have to manage and look after," he observed. "I think that replication of our customers' day-to-day, and how they operate their businesses, was important as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's why he's glad the studio made what he called a "larger" game—not a platformer or mobile game Unity is more broadly used for. It also made Unity Studio Productions one of the first teams to get a look at two key Switch 2 features: GameShare and GameChat.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Survival Kids"><span>Survival Kids</span> is optimized for GameShare and GameChat</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Nintendo Switch 2 isn't a console with major new gameplay features like the Wii, Wii U, or the Switch. Its primary advancements come in the form of modest </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2s-dlss-support-to-be-a-big-part-of-future-nintendo-games">internal hardware upgrades and AI upscaling</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/design-opportunities-for-devs-from-our-time-trying-out-the-nintendo-switch-2">a Joy-Con mouse mode</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2-shows-nintendo-s-strategy-for-a-social-future">a slew of social features</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> marking Nintendo's first major foray into the world of online multiplayer games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dennison said Unity learned about the social features after work started on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but "the stars aligned" and the game became a strong testbed for two key features: GameShare and GameChat. Dennison was particularly proud of the work on GameShare, which allows one player to invite other Switch and Switch 2 users to their game session without installing additional software. "It's essentially an extension of split-screen technology," he explained. When players use GameShare with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, their device renders a separate in-game camera for each player and streams it out to other Switch devices. Unity had already been developing two-player split screen for local play, but found it could push and optimize the engine to support up to three players over GameShare.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We worked really closely with the platform team, who didn't have another test case for that at this stage because it's so new."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This also made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a test for how game designers can think about games players might want to play together over GameChat—the video/audio chatroom system built into the Switch 2. It's not as straightforward as just making a good multiplayer game. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/extended-reality/owlchemy-labs-dimensional-double-shift-shows-what-s-next-for-vr-development">Developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we've chatted with in 2025 have spoken about how "presence" and spaces where players can relax and form their own kind of play are part of an emerging trend particularly popular with younger audiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Dennison, once Nintendo explained how the Switch 2 would handle the chat components of the game, his team doubled down on the "emote system" as a tool for in-game socialization and cooperation. Players can tap an "emote" button to auto-play a "smart emote" that aligns to what they're mostly likely trying to communicate, or use a wheel-like interface to pick specific emotes like planting a flag. This emote makes a flag emoji pop up on the other players' screens, pointing them in the direction of their teammate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Focusing on emotes puts Unity in the same camp as Riot Games, which is counting on them to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/how-riot-games-is-preparing-for-the-next-generation-of-players">boost the socialization</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> aspect of its upcoming tag-team fighting game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2XKO</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dennison previously worked at Rare on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sea of Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so he's familiar with this kind of play. He still thinks the industry is only "scratching the surface" of this genre. "It's really encouraging communal play. I think there's another 20 years of innovation in that space, for sure."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just don't expect Unity Studio Productions to be the one doing that innovating. Dennison made clear that his team's first priority is "doing everything we can internally to make sure what we build is production-verified." It's the company's policy to make sure the engine is ready day zero for the launch of new platforms like the Switch 2, and in this case, making an original game was a great method for hitting that goal. It's not the team's primary focus now that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is out the door.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it could be again—under the right circumstances. "We would love to find the right opportunity to partner with someone again and the right "story" internally about the technology we're going to push on that next product," Dennison said. "I would certainly love to explore that—what opportunities are there for us?"</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<p>You can expect new building types too, allowing you to better improve your base. There's also an overhauled enemy base system, allowing foes you find out in the wilds to construct their own fortifications much like you do. The full list of changes and additions<a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1937709560053285318"> can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>Palworld took the world by storm last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-passes-5m-copies-sold-in-three-days">selling five million copies in three days</a>. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">later came to PlayStation</a>, but not before its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">developer was sued by Nintendo for copyright infringement</a>. Pocketpair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">described this development as disappointing</a>, removing some features as a result, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-mod-restores-gliding-feature-pulled-amid-nintendo-lawsuit">gliding was reintroduced thanks to fan mods</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-being-sued-by-nintendo-says-switch-2-port-still-possible">a Nintendo Switch 2 port of Palworld is still on the cards</a>, according to Pocketpair. As for right now, this Terraria crossover could very well lead to a new wave of interested players. After all, Terraria is no slouch itself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/terraria-has-sold-more-than-35-million-copies">selling more than 35m copies as of 2021</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/two-worlds-collide-at-last-as-palworld-tides-of-terraria-launches-today]]></content:encoded>

<p>Atari has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fatal_run_2089">Fatal Run 2089</a>, the upcoming racing revival for the Switch, will launch in Fall 2025.</p>
<p>The accompanying gameplay trailer gives us a fresh look at the new post-apocalyptic racer from developer MNSTR Studio, and we have to say, it's looking pretty decent so far. There's definitely a pretty heavy <strong>Mad Max</strong> vibe to the whole thing, and the brief snippets of dialogue sequences give us a good taste of the story.</p>
<p>We have to admit though, looking at the key features below, 20 levels doesn't really sound like a lot on paper. We might have to get a bit more context as to how long each one lasts and whether it's somewhat comparable to a proper race course you might see in a Mario Kart game, for example.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Hopefully we'll get a couple more good glimpses at the game ahead of its launch later this year, but we're certainly intrigued, at least.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 20 levels across four landscapes with branching paths, hidden shortcuts, and explosive set pieces</p>
<p>- Four larger-than-life boss fights that will each provide a unique challenge to players</p>
<p>- Classic arcade progression challenges you to beat the clock, or ARC decay, or it’s back to the start</p>
<p>- 63 different enhancements that can be dropped or appear in shops and 27 randomized add variety and unpredictability to each run</p>
<p>- 4 co-pilots with different skills and personalities add extra character to your adventure and ways to shape your playstyle</p>
<p>- Tailor your approach to one of seven vehicles with distinct performance characteristics: weave in and out of danger with a light ride or barrel through enemies with a heavy one. But you can only choose one car per run, no mid-trip switching.</p>

			<p>Sloclap's new football game, Rematch, has surpassed 3 million unique players and 1 million copies sold, the studio has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/playrematch.com/post/3lseohvckdc2a">announced</a>.</p>
<p>It's a big milestone for the studio and a strong follow-up from its previous martial arts hit, Sifu, and seemingly a clear sign that being available on Xbox Game Pass at launch was a major boon for the multiplayer game.</p>
<p>Rematch officially launched for everyone on June 19, and just in its first 24 hours, was able to hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/">1 million unique players</a> jumping onto the pitch, whether they bought the game or played it through Game Pass.</p>
<p>Now, less than a week from its official launch, and a week from its early access release for those who paid for the deluxe edition, it's tripled that number of players and still managed to hit a strong sales milestone.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ivx73oyahbwxlsm3yspl5jxe/app.bsky.feed.post/3lseohvckdc2a" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidvoyjxlkjdfbfv5exlp4pcg27aif6ns45mek4bz3f73gamodfqpu">
<p>Rematch has officially reached 3M unique players!For those keeping score, that's- 11.8M matches played- 55.6M goals scored- 33.5M assists- 69.1M savesThis is just the beginning.Thank you for being with us, in and out of the pitch!#rematch</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ivx73oyahbwxlsm3yspl5jxe?ref_src=embed">Rematch (@playrematch.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ivx73oyahbwxlsm3yspl5jxe/post/3lseohvckdc2a?ref_src=embed">2025-06-24T18:00:48.389Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">I reviewed Rematch for Wccftech</a>, and was happy to be able to report that none of the issues I have with the game come from the core gameplay. It's a very tightly-made game, which makes it all the more unfortunate that there are so many issues around the core gameplay in how it's all structured that bring the experience down. Issues like poor menu design, slow-progression, and the misclassification of actions while in games, like how a goalie punching the ball away from a shot on net instead of catching it is counted as an interception, instead of a save.</p>
<p>Still, none of these issues are worth stopping you checking it out, as many of them can thankfully be patched out, along with all the bugs that myself and 3 million other players have had to endure. And, not to beat a dead horse with regarding the launch discourse around the game, but if you're playing Rematch, for the love of all that is good in football, please learn to pass.</p>

            <p>Yesterday’s launch of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 laptop GPU was quiet, yet nonetheless featured a surprise: there’s also a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/rtx-5050-desktop-gpu-and-laptops/">desktop version of the RTX 5050</a>, set to release (exclusively in third-party garb – there’s no Founders Edition) in "the second half" of July. Quite the turnaround for the non-laptop XX50 lineage, which was widely assumed extinguished following 2022’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050-review">RTX 3050</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The RTX 5050 will replace the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-review">RTX 5060</a> as the cheapest of Nvidia's current-gen desktop GPUs, starting at $249. Budget buyers will need to make do with 8GB of last-gen GDDR6 VRAM, however, as well as a lighter smattering of CUDA cores: 2,560 to the RTX 5060’s 3,840. There’s obviously no desktop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-year-on-the-rtx-4050s-appeal-has-grown-but-better-laptop-gpus-loom">RTX 4050</a> to compare these specs to, though next to the RTX 3050, it does offer more memory bandwidth even if the total gigabyte count remains the same. Presumably there are also performance advantages, especially where ray tracing is concerned, that the RTX 5050 can glean from its updated Blackwell architecture.</p>
<p>'Course, while the RTX 5050 might make for a decent upgrade for current 3050 owners – especially those interested in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a> and frame generation – its $249 price tag does keep it nervily close to the $300 RTX 5060. Which, even with its driver issues, really isn’t a bad 1080p card itself, so we’ll have to see what the 5050 can do to coexist with its more core-rich, wider-bandwidth big brother.</p>
<p>I’ll admit, there’s a not-small part of me that hopes it can. We can raise eyebrows at the specifications and make "Fnar fnar new GTX 1030" jokes until our typing fingers are worn down to stumps, but there genuinely are vast numbers of PC players who are happy with below-max quality 1080p yet can’t reliably stretch to mid-rangers like the XX60 series. People, in other words, who haven’t been adequately served by the GPU market in years. Arguably since even before the RTX 3050, what with that GPU launching during the dark times of COVID-compounded shortages and price gouging.</p>
<p>Will the RTX 5050 fill that gap? I won’t know until I’ve tested one out. But I’d rather it ends up as a failed attempt, than a repeat of the RTX 40 series' failing to try at all.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-desktop-grade-nvidia-rtx-5050-after-all-and-its-out-next-month]]></content:encoded>

Each glimpse we get of him using his powers appears to be from one of two scenes in the movie. This final trailer shows him just a little more, but I still want to see that stretchy king smack someone around with long, flailing limbs.

We still don’t see more than the planet-eating invader’s foot in this trailer, and at this point, I guess we won’t get a really good look at him until the film premieres on July 25. These trailers have shown a lot of the same stuff each time—this latest trailer perhaps showing even less than previously—and the most charitable read I can give is to assume that Marvel is keeping this movie’s secrets close to its chest. The Fantastic Four’s debut is a big deal for the MCU, and maybe you don’t want to spoil every surprise and cool sequence, but in doing so it’s kept me from finding anything to latch onto.

Players take on the role of an agent from the secret organization ADAMAS, which specializes in investigating supernatural phenomena. Your mission will take you across both the human world and the Digital World: Iliad—and beyond the boundaries of time itself.</p><p>The game is developed by Media.Vision, the team behind the fan-favorite <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em>. Building on that experience, we’ve introduced new systems and immersive ways to express the game’s world, story, and characters to create a special experience for longtime fans and those just discovering Digimon games alike.</p><p><strong>What is a Digimon?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br><video id="video-976054-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/Q3o218u.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Q3o218u.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/Q3o218u.mp4</a></video></p><p>In this title, Digimon are electronic lifeforms that possess characteristics of both organic matter and electric signals. Early on, players will take on their first hostile Digimon encounter with their choice of a Digimon provided by ADAMAS. Defeat each Digimon type often enough to create an instance of it in a process known as Conversion. You can collect and train over 450 Digimon, each with unique traits and non-linear evolution paths.</p><p><strong>Attributes and Elements: How to Beat the Odds</strong></p><p>The turn-based battle system is built around the interaction of Digimon Attributes and Element. Their interactions create a battle environment where deeper strategies can emerge.</p><ul><li>Attribute: Vaccine, Virus, Data, Free, Variable, and others (seven total)</li><li>Element: Fire, Water, Plant, and others (11 total)</li></ul><p>Virus-type Digimon are weak to Vaccine-type, which are weak to Data-type. The other Attributes have their own strengths and weaknesses. Separately, each Digimon has resistances and weaknesses to the Elements.</p><p>For example, if your opponent is a Virus-type, attacking with a Vaccine-type Digimon will grant a +100% damage bonus. Additionally, using Water-type skills against them if they’re weak to water will further increase the damage multiplier! The reverse is also true—if both attribute and element matchups are unfavorable, the damage dealt will be significantly reduced.</p><p>Gain the battle advantage by obtaining a variety of Digimon through both converting Digimon and by Digivolving them. As digital beings, Digivolution is not linear—meeting certain conditions will unlock multiple evolution paths, and Digimon can even be De-digivolved to a younger form, allowing for flexible training strategies.</p><p><strong>Digimon <a title="Series > Persona [89 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>lities: Daring or Adoring?</strong></p><p>One of the new systems introduced in Time Stranger is Personalities. Each Digimon has one of 16 personality types, which influence stat growth, skill acquisition, and even digivolution conditions.</p><p>For example, a Digimon with a Daring personality will see higher growth in Attack and Defense, making it more suited for physical offense.</p><p><video id="video-976054-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/1iA99n8.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/1iA99n8.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/1iA99n8.mp4</a></video></p><p>They can also learn personality-linked skills that enhance combat capabilities. While a Digimon’s personality is initially determined when it is converted, it can be changed later through communication and training using special items in the Digifarm.</p><p>That means you can have two of the same Digimon that may perform differently based on their Personalities.</p><p><strong>Agent Skills: Lend a Helping Hand</strong></p><p>Another new system is Agent Skills, which represents the player’s own abilities as an ADAMAS agent. By completing missions, players earn points that can be used to unlock various effects—such as enhancing Digimon with specific personalities, increasing experience gain, or easing digivolution requirements. These skills allow for even more depth in how you prepare for battles.</p><p><video id="video-976054-3" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/ScVgZkG.mp4?_=3"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ScVgZkG.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/ScVgZkG.mp4</a></video></p><p>Agents also have unique abilities known as Cross Arts—powerful techniques that fuse the player’s Digivice with a Digimon’s power during battles.

			<p>Have you ever wanted to have a relationship with your toilet? No? Me neither. It sounds far too much like a euphemism to describe the morning after eating a particularly heinous kebab. Still, it’s definitely a question developer Sassy Chaps have asked themselves, and in response, they’ve created the sandbox dating simulator Date Everything, a narrative text-based adventure in which you can date, well, everything.</p>
<p><iframe title="Date Everything | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dlxxzmOXRf0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As we all know, AI is coming for our jobs. But for the protagonist of Date Everything, AI has already arrived. In a humorous – yet scarily believable – opening, our hapless lead has just got a new working at home job for a massive tech firm, only to instantly lose it again when they are promptly fired. It’s not all bad though, as they soon receive a mysterious parcel from another ex-employee.</p>


<p>This gift turns out to be a pair of near-magical glasses, named Date-viators – that turn every object in the house – well, around a hundred of them anyway – into sentient and eminently dateable entities. What follows is a very loose and delightfully daft conspiratorial narrative, which is nothing more than an excuse for the hilarity of trying to woo your boiler.</p>
<p>Characterisation here is over the top and completely charming, with gorgeous comic-book-like artwork bringing humanised curtains, shelves, and gym equipment to life. Each day you mooch around your house, using the handful of charges your glasses possess to chat to your furniture, before you head to bed – which you can also date – to allow your mystical specs to recharge.</p>


<p>Exploration takes place from a 3D first-person view, and it’s here that Date Everything is at it’s weakest. The frame rate on Switch during these first-person sections frankly sucks, with obnoxious controls that make even navigating around a kitchenette a ridiculous chore. It’s almost as if First-Person games were never a thing, with controls that haven’t been refined over decades of gameplay. However, put up with these clunky moments and you’ll find a lot to enjoy in Date Everything.</p>
<p>The script is razor sharp; sardonic, silly, often laugh-out-load hilarious and occasionally rather touching. As you chat to your household objects each day, you’ll learn more about them and their relationships with their fellow tables, TVs and tennis racquets. Often, you’ll have feuds to resolve by playing peacemaker, with the ultimate aim to bring harmony to your home, rather than to get intimate with your lamp – though both are possible. Voice acting is top-notch, with a who’s who of vocal talent from across the videogame industry.</p>

<p>My personal highlights include the Thor-like Gym-equipment called Kristof, the insecure office supplies named Penelope who just wants to be noticed and used again, and Rebel the… erm… bad ass rubber duck who hangs out in the bathroom. Sassy Chaps clearly take great pleasure in skewering modern culture, but they’re definitely equal opportunity mockers, with Microtransactions being lampooned with the money-obsessed and brilliantly named Michael Transaction. You can even date their own Deluxe Edition of the game, Lucinda, to hilarious effect.</p>
<p>It’s just enormous fun talking to these wonderfully conceived characters and undertaking their simple quests, and in doing so unlocking further characters to talk too. There’s no prescriptive order to chat to your objects either, you’re free to talk to, or not talk to, whoever you want. Whilst extended sessions with the game can reveal the limitations of the gameplay – which amounts to little more than reading and selecting the occasional response, let’s face it – in short bursts Date Everything is a sumptuous treat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It's no exaggeration to say that we fairly enjoy a bit of the old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania">Castlevania</a> here at Nintendo Life, having dished out very positive reviews to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_advance_collection">Castlevania Advance Collection</a> and, the equally fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_dominus_collection">Castlevania Dominus Collection</a> in more recent times.</p>
<p>Of course, grabbing physical editions of these beauties on Nintendo Switch has been a little tricky, especially since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/limited_run_reveals_four_castlevania_anniversary_collection_physical_editions">Limited Run Games' snazzy versions</a> have long since sold out. However, for those amongst us who weren't so quick off the block for LRG's offerings, Play-Asia has some exciting news.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Yes, pre-orders are now live <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/search/castlevania+advance#fc=prc:1.3003249458,o:6?affiliate_id=956097" rel="sponsored noopener">over on Play-Asia</a> for a bunch of Castlevania sets, with Anniversary, Advance and Dominion getting standard and deluxe versions. Fair warning, some of these are <em>very</em> nice. *clutches wallet tightly*</p>
<p>So, what have we actually got here? Well, the Castlevania Anniversary Collection comes in a standard version and a very slick collector's edition. Both of these versions will release on the 26th June, so not long to go!</p>
<p>Oh, and the deluxe version contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Castlevania</em></li>
<li><em>Castlevania II Simon's Quest</em></li>
<li><em>Castlevania III Dracula's Curse</em></li>
<li><em>Super Castlevania IV</em></li>
<li><em>Castlevania The Adventure</em></li>
<li><em>Castlevania II Belmont's Revenge</em></li>
<li><em>Castlevania Bloodlines</em></li>
<li><em>Kid Dracula (never released in English before)</em></li>
<li><em>History of Castlevania - Book of the Crescent Moon</em></li>
</ul>

<li><em>Encyclopedia: Detailed information on enemies, the 'DSS' system, the 'Tactical Soul' system and the 'Spell Fusion' system will help you truly master each game's unique combat system!</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, the Dominus Collection arrives on the 18th of September...so plenty of time to get saving, vampire slayers. Here's some more PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Three incredible action adventure games from the Castlevania series have finally returned, for the first time!

And you can also play it in its original format!

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> has a sizeable game update that promises to finally get the game's A-Life system working as intended. For those just joining us - perhaps because you only popped into existence the second you entered my field of view - A-Life is developer GSC Game World's noughties-era buzzword for the pervasive simulation of NPCs throughout the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-open-world-games">open world</a>, leading to unpredictable interactions and conflicts and the general sense that things are happening without your input. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Heart Of Chornobyl <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-devs-insist-complex-ai-simulation-of-enemy-patrols-is-in-the-game-its-just-broken">struggled to implement this at launch</a>, with supposed "roaming" bands of ragamuffins spawning right under the noses of players who promptly took to the Steam reviews to administer some wasteland justice. Our own James Archer had a few warm words in his otherwise positive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">Stalker 2 review</a>, calling the game "a captivating survival shooter, even with bits falling off".</p>
<p>Now GSC Game World say they've fixed it. They've also added "Water Electric Tornado" anomalies, together with official mod support via Steam Workshop, Mod.io and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/uk/p/stalker-2-zone-kit">Epic Games Store</a>, a couple of new guns, various quality-of-life tweaks, and the ability to loot mutant parts. Catch some of that in this showcase video.

<p>
The A-Life overhaul is the star attraction, here. Please find below some bullet points, meticulously scrounged from the pockets of the dead.
</p>
<blockquote><p>

- Life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player's view.
</p>
<p>
- Characters continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end.
</p>
<p>
- The player can meet the same stalkers after some time.
</p>
<p>
- Players may encounter more A-Life characters resting or interacting in various locations, adding to the world's immersion.
</p>
<p>
- Characters will no longer respawn directly in front of the player. When the player clears the mutants' lair, for example, those mutants won't simply reappear moments later.
</p>
<p>
- A-Life Director will no longer respawn characters at the edge of visualization. Instead, respawn moved further away from the player, while maintaining the Zone's population.
</p>
<p>
- Visualization range is slightly increased. Characters now appear in visualization range with relevant animations and equipped weapons. This reduces the "pop-in" effect and contributes to a more seamless character visualization.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Nice balance of tiny tweaks and gargantuan reworkings, there. On the one hand, allowing you to see further to avoid the impression of "pop-in" seems like a matter of moving some decimal places around. Allowing characters "to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end", on the other hand, sounds like it would require the attention of an actual genie. Can my third wish be "add a top-down view and turn the game into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>"?
</p>
<p>
The new guns are the Three-Line Rifle and the Kora handgun. The patch notes don't go into much detail about the new anomaly, but "Water Electric Tornado" seems fairly self-explanatory. As for the quality-of-life rejiggles, you'll now be able to see available artifact slots for armour in the upgrade tab, and there's an unlockable Fix all button in the technician's upgrade menu, to repair all equipped gear. The player stash window is now larger, and there's a reload renewal feature for all of the weapons. 
</p>
<p>
Read <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525346350588494399?l=english">the full patch notes</a> for more, including many a balancing change and bugfix.

They are mostly single-player games, including four first-party Sony blockbusters: <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em>, and <em>The Last of Us Part I</em>. Others include <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and<em> Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>, alongside no-brainers like<em> Grand Theft Auto V</em>. Less obvious top-performers are <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</em>, and <em>UFC 5</em>. </p><p>PlayStation’s global services VP Nick Maguire told <em>Game File </em>the company remains committed to bringing its big first-party games to PS Plus no earlier than 18 to 24 months after they comes out. Instead, it’s been wooing subscribers to upgrade to the priciest tier with PS1 and PS2 classics, while streaming for PS3 games has been rarer. “Through streaming, we’ll still continue to look at those ones,” he said. “We haven’t ruled them out. The opportunities are there. But there are a lot of PS3 games already streaming.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-2025-diablo-4-kof-15-price-monster-hunter-wilds-1851785063]]></content:encoded>

			<p>PlayStation Plus is about to celebrate 15 years this coming June 29, after the service was first launched on June 29, 2010. We've already heard about some of the celebratory actions the company is taking to commemorate the milestone that went along with the announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-celebrates-ps-plus-15-year-anniversary-reveals-july-2025-ps-plus-essential-games-including-diablo-iv-and-jusant/">July 2025 monthly PS Plus Essential games</a>.</p>
<p>Also part of the commemoration, Nick Maguire, vice president of global services at Sony Interactive Entertainment, spoke with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/playstation-plus-15th-anniversary-interview-ghost-of-tsushima">Game File</a> about the previous 15 years and where the service currently is.</p>
<p>After SIE president and chief executive officer Hideaki Nishino revealed that more players are choosing the PS Plus Extra and Premium tiers, Maguire backed up Nishino's comments, and added that "<em>Engagement in Plus has never been higher than it is right now,</em>" which is due in part to the restructuring of the service PlayStation announced in 2022.</p>
<p>The switch from the old PS Plus model to the current tiered model "<em>surpassed our expectations</em>," Maguire said. "<em>It's really given us a new way to reach the audiences with these games, and it's given new value to partners to find new people to play their titles. And just the engagement we see from it is really positive, in terms of the number of people choosing that Catalog and coming back month after month</em>."</p>
<p>Magurie did not talk about how the prices have gone up, only saying "<em>I think we just want to invest in Plus. We want to invest in the proposition, bring more value to users. And we're seeing high growth in Extra, Premium</em>."</p>
<p>When Nishino was asked about the price increases just a couple of weeks ago, he said the increases were part of Sony "<em>increasing value we bring to the players</em>," and it's clear from how many players continue to choose the Extra and Premium tiers that the increases aren't exactly hurting subscriber numbers.</p>
<p>On a separate matter, Maguire did make it clear that Sony has no intention of adding its first-party, PlayStation Studios-developed titles to the PlayStation Plus service on day one. Instead, PlayStation will continue to add third-party titles on day one where it sees a good fit, like how <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-and-battlefield-2042-headline-june-2025s-ps-plus-extra-and-premium-game-catalog-additions/">FBC: Firebreak</a> recently launched into the service.</p>
<p>"<em>We've sort of stayed true to our strategy across the board, where we're not looking to put games in day and date. Our strategy of finding four or five independent day-and-date titles - and using that to complement our strategy of bringing games in when they're 12, 18 months old or older - that balance for us is working really well across the platform</em>."</p>
<p>And, if the opportunities are there, Sony wouldn't stop at just four or five independent games. "<em>If there were six or seven great opportunities, then we would go for them as well</em>," Maguire added.</p>
<p>Maguire also declined to comment on whether he thought that adding first-party multiplayer games like Concord to the service would be a benefit, and if Concord might've had a better chance were it launched directly into the PS Plus service.</p>
<p>"<em>I think Plus has proven itself to be a great way to introduce new players to franchises. So I think there's always going to be a moment for any game where there's the right time for it to go into Plus, when it's ready to reach a wider audience or...to find new fans or new parts of our platform that it hasn't already reached</em>," said Maguire.</p>
<p>Beyond the price increases, and the lack of first-party games added to the service day one, Game File also had Maguire address, as much as he was willing, the other big topic of conversation players have around the service, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">games being removed from the catalog</a>.</p>
<p>He doesn't directly address the removal of older first-party titles, like how the Resistance games were recently taken off the PS Plus Game Catalog list, but said "<em>We've got 80 collections of games across the catalog, so we want to keep it fresh and bring in new games. Sometimes that means taking a few games out at the same time to keep the proposition interesting and help people find new games as well</em>."</p>
<p>The modern day subscription service is shaking up its offerings all the time. Whether its PlayStation Plus, Xbox Game Pass, Netflix, etc., things are added and taken away from them on a regular basis. But it remains mind-boggling that PlayStation would remove its first-party titles, especially when they're games that are difficult to play any other way if you don't have original hardware.</p>
<p>At the very least, Maguire says that he does read the comments players leave on PS Plus-specific posts, and that he thinks "<em>It can be helpful to understand where people are at, and, if we can, take that into our learnings in the future</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>I think we'll continue to listen and learn about what gamers want and try to bring more value in for them. We're very proud of what we've delivered in the last few years. And excited to sort of see the response and the engagement we get from players coming in</em>."</p>

			<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced will launch on PC and consoles on August 12, Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> today.</p>
<p>The enhanced edition of the second entry in the series, released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/">last year</a> on PC and Xbox Series X|S, will launch as a free upgrade for owners of the original release. On PlayStation 5, users will be able to purchase either the Standard Edition for $49.99, which includes the base game with some additional features, or the Deluxe Edition for $69.99, which includes the base game as well as a PS5-optimized version of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. Owners of the PlayStation 4 version of the first entry in the series will receive a free upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced has some new features over last year's release, making it the definitive edition of the game, no matter the platform. One of the biggest additions is Performance Mode on Xbox Series X, offering 60 FPS gameplay for the first time on consoles. On PC, the Enhanced edition will introduce a Very High preset to push visual fidelity further. The Enhanced edition will also make the game a Steam Deck Verified title, with optimizations aimed at delivering a smooth experience on the handheld system. Also coming with the new edition of the game is a new optional play mode that sees the return of the Dark Rot, an enhanced photo mode, and developer commentary.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team Ninja and Xbox have announced the PS5 release date for&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em>, as well as the new enhancements current owners on Xbox and PC can expect.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Xbox Wire, the followup to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5" rel="nofollow">arrive on PS5</a> on August 12th. This won't be the first time the franchise has appeared on PlayStation, of course;&nbsp;<em>Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>got itself a PS4 release, after all.</p>

<p>Still, the game's release on PS5 marks an increasingly friendly approach to PlayStation on Xbox's part. Many of the studio's games are making their way to PlayStation now, including upcoming titles like&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>.</p>

<p>Those include a new Performance Mode, which will allow you to play at 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X (but not S, unfortunately). The PC version will also include a new Very High graphics preset, allowing you to push more powerful rigs to their limit.</p>

<p>Additionally, Xbox and Team Ninja say that when the enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga&nbsp;</em>launches, it'll be Steam Deck Verified, so you'll be able to enjoy it on your handheld PC as well.</p>

<p>A new Dark Rot mode, which makes its return from the first game, will also be added to the sequel. Every time you fail, the Dark Rot will advance, and when it reaches Senua's head, you'll fail your run and all of your progress will be lost.</p>




<p>If you pick up the Deluxe Edition of&nbsp;<em>Hellblade II</em>&nbsp;on PS5, you'll also get a version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>enhanced for the PS5, so if you haven't played that game yet, now's your chance.</p>

<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, the sequel to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</em>. It once again follows Senua, who's on a quest to rescue her countrymen from the Northmen.</p>

<p>You can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461850/Senuas_Saga_Hellblade_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-II" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> on August 12th.</p>

You can also use unofficial Discord clients that are native to Windows on Arm. In recent weeks I’ve been testing an <a href="https://canary.dl2.discordapp.net/distro/app/canary/win/arm64/1.0.2/DiscordCanarySetup.exe">early version of Discord</a> that’s compiled for Windows on Arm and it’s just like using the app on an Intel-powered device.
