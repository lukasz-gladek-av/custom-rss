<p>343 Industries — now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-moves-to-unreal-engine-5-with-multiple-games-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Studios</a> — was working on the sequel to Halo Infinite. According to a new claim, Halo Infinite 2 was in development before it was ultimately cancelled.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh07V_QF5Oc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebs Gaming</a>, who has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-7-gets-new-lead-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">been at the forefront</a> of Halo coverage, says that Halo Infinite 2 was in development on the Slipspace Engine that was developed for the first Infinite game. That development, he said, continued until a leadership change in late 2022 where the decision was made to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-unreal-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">move the franchise</a> to Unreal Engine 5. That led to the cancellation of Halo Infinite 2 on Slipspace.</p>







<p>“343’s creative team spent a few months learning Unreal Engine 5 to prepare for the next project,” Rebs said. “This lasted until January 2023 when Microsoft laid off a significant amount of 343 employees, including the entire creative team.”</p>



<p>It was added that it’s unclear if the next mainline Halo game is Halo Infinite 2 but in Unreal Engine 5 or if it’s a different game altogether.</p>



<p>The report also mentioned that the campaign team that was let go “never felt supported” by the new leadership at the studio.</p>



<p>“The campaign team felt trapped in a bubble without studio-wide collaboration and clarity about what was happening at the studio,  and its plans for the future,” he said.</p>



<p>It was added that campaign content was possibly being outsourced with no replacement team being created.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Halo Studios for comment on this report. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-washington-state-is-doing-to-juice-local-game-development<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers are probably familiar with "country pavilions" at events like Gamescom and Game Developers Conference. They're areas organized by region-affiliated trade groups or governments that shine a light on game development in their regions—both to help games from those areas find an audience, and to convince investors and studios to open up shop in their area.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamescom 2024's country pavilion was a nearly overwhelming sight this year, with China, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, Brazil, Indonesia, Estonia, The Philippines, and other countries represented with booths large and small, each filled with developers demoing their games, pitching to investors, or soliciting the press.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One country was not represented: The United States. Or...was it? One solitary booth from the land of the red, white, and blue stood tall, though ironically, it was painted a more emerald green.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's because the pavilion belonged to the Washington State Department of Commerce, and it was staffed by creative economy development director Shannon Roche Halberstadt. A veteran of the Recording Industry Association of America, Halberstadt explained to Game Developer that she took the role with the Washington State government to help support game development in the state, already home to Valve, Microsoft, Nintendo of America, and a slew of triple-A game studios.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-" target="_self">Why is it so expensive to make games in the United States?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With companies like those already ruling the roost, why exactly would the state government trek all the way out to Germany to showcase the state?

"It's a really great place," she said. "You're around all these other companies. You're gonna have peers, you're gonna have people who are already in the industry. You'll be able to access support services. You'll be able to access networking and meetups...that community actually is a really important thing."</span></p><p>Image via Adobe Stock.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Department of Commerce can't tackle high housing costs on its own (Halberstadt deferred to the legislature on that topic), but she said there are other levers it's pulling to boost development in the region.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Funding from the state itself for startups and indies isn't likely to come any time soon, but she said part of her journey to Gamescom was to research how other countries support developers. She also wants the State to look into incentives like those for the aerospace or agriculture industries.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her primary concern however has to do with getting smaller studios in front of investors and publishers. It's another reason she came to Gamescom—she gestured to a table behind her, where game studio One More Game was showing off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790700/SWAPMEAT/">SWAPMEAT</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The game had picked up the "Creative Overload" award at the Devcom Indie Showcase just the night before, something that couldn't have happened unless the Department of Commerce had brought them to the event.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because of that award, they said, they were getting meetings with interested parties they wouldn't get at home.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though Halberstadt is new to the games business, she seemed up to speed on how traditional business development loans don't work well for game studios. "Game studios have a really difficult time accessing traditional financial products because the arc to product creation is so long," she said. "The financials don't work out for a bank down the street that's doing an SBA loan. It makes it really difficult." Her hope is that Washington's government can work with financial entities to incentivize loans that support game studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the state's game development economy is already self-sustaining, why does Halberstadt need to get involved at all? "You invest in water where the grass is green to keep it green," she said. "If you're not investing and you're not creating a space to develop new talent...the industry can go other places."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She gestured to the trade floor, where dozens of countries were eagerly pitching themselves as places for studios to land.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Video games can help artists earn a living">Video games can help artists earn a living</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As mentioned before, Halberstadt came out of the music industry, previously working at the RIAA.

Though her employer is concerned with tax revenue and GDP, she had far higher-minded inspirations. "There's so much great art that comes through video games," she gushed. "It's a way that people connect...it's such a great way of creating cohesion."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She joked that she'd </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>prefer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> if other states didn't invest as hard in their game industries so that everyone would come to Washington, but she acknowledged there's room across the country for different territories to lean on their different strengths and ultimately come together for a healthier business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What would she say to industry professionals pushing similar initiatives in other states?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just two words: "keep going."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa Tech.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>
With Stalker 2's November release looming, anyone looking to acquaint (or reacquaint) themselves with the series' acclaimed post-apocalyptic horror action ahead of its arrival will soon be able to do so on the go, with the original Stalker trilogy now set for a Switch release on 31st October - a little earlier than developer GSC Game World had initially announced.
</p>
<p>
Stalker comes to Switch with a choice of purchasing options. First, there's the Legends of the Zone bundle that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-stalker-trilogy-makes-its-way-to-xbox">launched for Xbox Series X/S and PS5</a> earlier this year, packaging together 2007's Shadow of Chernobyl, 2008's Clear Sky, and 2009's Call of Pripyat. That'll set you back £32.99/39.99 EUR/39.99 USD, but players looking for a slightly less concentrated dose of Stalker can alternatively buy each game individually, for £15.99/19.99 EUR/19.99 USD apiece.
</p>
<p>
All three games whisk players to an alternate version of the real-word Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine, which - thanks to a second nuclear disaster in 2006 - has become rife with mutants and anomalies, tempting adventures known as Stalkers to enter its boundaries. The series' acclaimed mix of bleak FPS survival horror and RPG elements should all be present and correct on Switch, with GSC Game World also promising some platform-specific features.

<p>
The Stalker trilogy on Switch (developed in collaboration with Mataboo) promises to be "fully optimised" with "refined visuals", and will include an "adapted shooting system" with gyro aiming, touch interface an controls, plus full handheld and TV mode support.
</p>
<p>
As for the eagerly awaited Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, that <em>isn't</em> coming to Switch, but it's due to launch for Xbox Series X/S and PC on 20th November this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-dev-diary-explains-hunting-and-feeding-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Chinese Room has released a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-hunting-and-feeding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new dev diary</a> that discusses more details about<a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-now-been-delayed-launching-by-first-half-of-2025/"> the upcoming title</a> Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2. This dev diary is the 19th dev diary that the team has released, and this one, in particular, dives into hunting and feeding in both combat scenarios and social scenarios. Both are possible as you roam the streets of Seattle. For this game, they've made sure to make feeding a fundamental part of the player's actions and strategies. "You'll be doing a lot of it- Phyre's a little-and-often kinda drinker; that helps keep the beast in check," says Senior Game Designer Max Bottomley. He goes on to explain how feeding is used throughout the game, and that feeding is predominantly used as a main source of healing, as well as being able to utilize discipline abilities.</p>
<p>While feeding in the game is very important, it's also a huge undertaking to ensure that you do it without being spotted. Getting spotted is a Masquerade violation, with more aggressive characters unwilling to let you feed without being attacked. As a result, it's important to isolate targets. "Feeding in the swing of combat is risky, but not impossible- if you're mindful of which direction you start a feed from, for example, your victim can help soak up a lot of gunfire for you!" says Bottomley.</p>
<p>The dev diary also explains the difficulties of trying to make feeding look good from a first-person perspective in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, "It doesn't really show you much at best and looks silly at worst, but a simple cut in and out of third-person can also be disorienting and feel a bit disconnected." Because of this, The Chinese Room decided to utilize both third—or first-person perspectives for feeding, allowing for cinematic action and continuity of motion.</p>
<p>The dev diary also discusses hunting in detail and Phyre's ability to use Heightened Senses, which enhances her sense of smell, allowing her to see, smell, and hear enemies. This also comes with a visual notification, and players are able to stalk their enemies via the scent of blood in the air.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Part of hunting and feeding in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is the Blood Resonance Events. While roaming the streets of Seattle, players will be able to track and hunt down NPCs that can become fully resonated using a specific type of blood to feed on. Once they are found, players can charm, fear, or anger to bend them to their will.&nbsp; These events are 'social feeding.' "Social feeding is a key part of the players' time in our Seattle and revolves around influencing the NPCs in certain ways- maybe you'll stumble upon someone angry that the ATM has stolen their card, and you can take that anger and feed on it," says Gavin Hood, the Project Lead Game Designer.</p>
<p>There are three more dev diaries listed to be upcoming, each discussing more details of the game, including the Blood Resonance events and fashion. The topic of the third diary will be announced at a later date.</p>

The pass also gives subscribers access to exclusive deals, online multiplayer, and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p></div><p>Whether the price increase is justified is a moot debate while these discounted codes are still available, but note that Microsoft seems to be upping the ante with its offering. For example, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> will be the first game in its series to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">hit Game Pass on day one</a>. </p><p>It joins a score of other first-party and even some third-party games that Microsoft will give similar treatment to after a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized">string</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889421/microsoft-acquires-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty-warcraft-king-gaming-buy-news-reports/archives/3">studio acquisitions</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-rare-you-experience-joy-as-pure-as-the-plucky-squire.1005315/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/plucky-squire-pc-switch-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently sat down to play <em>The Plucky Squire</em> because I'd heard it was like <em>Zelda</em>, and I like <em>Zelda</em>. I didn't know it also had <em>special powers</em>.</p><p>Having not really seen much about the game outside of seemingly everyone I know and respect on social media saying how incredible it is, I was mere seconds into it before I found myself smiling at the clean, childish art style that, well, is the stuff of storybooks.</p><p>A few minutes later, when it became clear I was literally playing <em>through </em>a storybook, that smile grew even wider. The pages were turning as I moved across map tiles, there was a kind old British man narrating proceedings, and before long I was whispering "oh that's lovely" out loud.</p><p>Then, oh, another trick! We can interact with the story as it's written on the page! The bad guy of the tale has fucked with the pages and some of the text laid across the map isn't describing events, it's been switched up to block them, so you need to complete puzzles in the world (book?) that involve moving the text--and you're in the book, so the text can just be picked up--around to fix the sentences, which changes what they're describing, which <em>then </em>changes the world itself. Seeing this for the first time I am not just smiling or whispering, I'm looking at my cat and saying "oh this rules", to which she replies "mew" (yes, it does).</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Plucky Squire | Gameplay Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJSMqtG0Kcs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>By the time <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is pulling its biggest party trick--leaping<a href="https://youtu.be/0DBGXN48tV4?t=177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> out of the pages of the book and into the real world</a>, which presents a whole new axis of movement and a fresh set of puzzle possibilities--I was sitting bolt upright in my chair saying, quite loudly now, "ahhhh wow this is <em>great</em>".</p><p>As you can hopefully tell by now, <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is a game that made me <em>feel something</em>. I can talk about it as a game if you want, review-style, about how it's a cute little <em>Zelda</em>-like, about how it's got some interesting puzzles and a neat twist and some lovely voice acting. I could spend a surprising amount of time gushing about the little hand cursor you control in the main menu, which is pointing while you point, but once you click/press a button it stops pointing and gives a thumbs up.</p><p>But I'd rather just talk around this game, about how it's just pure joy. Playing it makes me smile, and laugh, and through its setting is able to deliver both the best of video games and the best of children's books at the same time. It's not that I feel like a child while playing it, there's a certain distance and reverence in its tone that requires you to have grown up already to appreciate it, but there's absolutely an echo, a child-like feeling of happiness--pure, warm, reassuring--to be found on each page.</p><p>Every time I play <em>The Plucky Squire</em> (which I haven't finished yet) brings a nice little surprise: maybe some fights, maybe a scroll with some unlockable art I can enjoy later, maybe some funny dialogue. It doesn't matter what it is, really; it's <em>all </em>good.It's also pretty short,<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-perfect-length" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> but as we've established recently</a>, that's fine. A game knowing its limits is a good video game, and one that's able to make a grown man smile like an excited young child is a <em>very </em>good video game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">In late July, Humble Games--the publishing arm of the Humble Bundle digital storefront--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-game-publisher-humble-games-reportedly-lays-off-all-staff/1100-6525236/">laid off the entirety of its staff</a> in a surprising move that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/humble-games-layoffs-leave-developer-unable-to-update-its-game-or-release-it-on-switch/1100-6525328/">left some indie titles in a precarious position</a>. But now, ex-Humble staff have formed their own indie publishing company, called Good Games Group, and it appears that Humble Games parent company Ziff Davis is one of its first clients.</p><p dir="ltr">Led by former Humble Games leaders Mark Nash and Alan Patmore, Good Games Group will be working with various companies to bring indie titles to market, and according to a report from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-humble-games-staff-found-new-indie-publisher" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>, one of those companies is none other than Humble Games' parent company, Ziff Davis. Although Ziff Davis was ultimately responsible for the layoff that left them jobless just a few months ago, Nash and Patmore seem excited to get back to work.</p><p dir="ltr">"Good Games Group's mission is to bring exceptional indie games to the global gaming community," Patmore said of the partnership. "Partnering with Ziff Davis allows us to continue working with the amazing indie developers we collaborated with at Humble Games, while also allowing us to chart a new course for the future."</p><p>It's not yet clear exactly which titles Good Games Group will be responsible for, but <a href="https://www.goodgamesgroup.com/" rel="nofollow ">the new publisher's website</a> includes header and footer images featuring a number games previously published by Humble Games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ring-of-pain/">Ring of Pain</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/signalis/">Signalis</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/supraland/">Supraland</a>, to name a few. It's possible that the newly assembled team could be working on some of the same games it would have been responsible for if the mass-layoff had never happened. Initially, Ziff Davis <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-game-publisher-humble-games-reportedly-lays-off-all-staff/1100-6525236/">told GameSpot that the layoffs would have "no impact"</a> on its operations, with the company planning to have an outside consulting firm called The Powell Group handle any loose ends related to unfinished projects. Humble Games has yet to make a statement regarding the new partnership with Good Games Group, or whether The Powell Group is still in the picture.</p><p>Layoffs have hit the gaming industry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">especially hard in 2024</a>, affecting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">AAA studios</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-publisher-thunderful-to-lay-off-20-of-its-workforce/1100-6520404/" data-ref-id="1100-6520404">indie devs</a> alike.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-was-at-some-point-a-roguelike-game-with-arkham-like-combat/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Diablo IV, which just received its first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vessel of Hatred</a>d, was definitely a success for Blizzard. Even those who don't love the game must admit that, at its core, Diablo IV sticks closely to the tenets that made the franchise a tentpole in the genre.</p>
<p>However, as revealed by Jason Schreier (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/play-nice-book-excerpt-blizzard-diablo-iv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Wired</a>) in his latest book 'Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment', the first iteration of Diablo IV was something very different from what we got. Following Reaper of Souls, the higher-ups decided there wouldn't be a proper second expansion for Diablo III, so Reaper of Souls director Josh Mosqueira started working with a small team on a whole new concept. The project, codenamed Hades, employed an over the shoulder camera with action combat inspired by Rocksteady's Batman: Arkham trilogy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this concept even had roguelike elements such as permadeath. Whenever the player character died, the user would get some kind of perks to facilitate their next attempt. While intriguing, the idea quickly ran into some obvious issues. Batman: Arkham's signature action combat was designed for a single player game, while Diablo IV, like all the games since the very beginning, would need to support cooperative multiplayer. According to Schreier's retelling, it didn't take long for Mosqueira to realize that himself. He left Blizzard in July 2016, founding Bonfire Studios, which to this day appears to have made no games of its own.</p>
<p>Following Mosqueira's departure, Blizzard decided to scrap the project and go back to what made the franchise great in the first place. That obviously translated into a longer wait for fans, but given the Diablo IV we actually got, perhaps it is best that Hades did not materialize after all - such a radically different game might have killed the beloved franchise altogether.</p>

Details are scarce, though. In fact, all anyone seems to know is that it’s coming out in 2026 and might star Matt Damon. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193132" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Chainsaw Man's English-Language Cast Weighs In: Subs Vs.

Damon had a cameo in <em>Interstellar</em> and played a much larger role as Gen. Leslie R. Groves in charge of overseeing the top-secret creation of the atom bomb in last year’s <em>Oppenheimer</em>. So it wouldn’t be shocking if Nolan has warmed up to the idea of making him the protagonist of his next film.</p><p>But what that project will be about remains a complete mystery. While Nolan will reportedly write and direct it, rumors that it would be a father-son story or an adaptation of the British TV show <em>The Prisoner </em>have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/christopher-nolan-next-movie-lands-at-universal-1235617025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/christopher-nolan-next-movie-lands-at-universal-1235617025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both been shot down by <em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span>. The only thing that seems possibly set in stone is that whatever the movie is will begin filming in 2025. </p><p>Hollywood A-listers dropped whatever they were doing to appear in <em>Oppenheimer</em>, and it ended up making hundreds of millions domestically. So it wouldn’t be shocking if the next Nolan movie attracts even more high-profile talent, with cameos that sometimes border on being outright distracting and fourth-wall breaking (at least that’s how I felt about Damon in <em>Interstellar</em>). </p><p>So what subjects might Nolan tackle next? He’s already done comic book adaptations with the Batman trilogy, sci-fi action with <em>Interstellar</em>, <em>Tenet</em>, and <em>Inception</em>, and period pieces between both<em> Oppenheimer </em>and <em>Dunkirk</em>. <em>Insomnia</em> and <em>Memento</em> ticked the mystery thriller box. Does the <em>Prestige</em> count as fantasy? It certainly included magic. Maybe Nolan’s next movie really will just be a lowkey, slice of life tale. If anyone could will that into being a box office blockbuster hit, it’s him. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
