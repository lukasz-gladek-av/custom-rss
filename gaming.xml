                <p>Gearbox Software boss Randy Pitchford continues to speak out regarding the price point of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a>, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-is-a-mystery-even-to-randy-pitchford/1100-6531437/" data-ref-id="1100-6531437">remains a mystery</a>. Posting on social media, Pitchford said that first and foremost he does not want people to pay "any more than they should or are comfortable with." He's saying this after he controversially said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-fans-will-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen-if-borderlands-4-costs-80-says-randy-pitchford/1100-6531677/" data-ref-id="1100-6531677">"real fans"</a> will find a way to find $80 to buy Borderlands 4 if it costs that much.</p><p>"I always work with the intent and hope that a customer always feels they got the better end of the deal no matter what they pay," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1927802548326650365" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said</a>.</p><p>With his "real fans" comment, Pitchford said he was responding to a person who suggested Borderlands 4 would "fail" at $80.</p><p>"What I was trying to do was explain that it wasn't my call but that if a $10 price increase does happen (since that's obviously where the industry is going), it will be okay and that Borderlands 4 will be okay because it's a great game and there are a lot of fans who will see the value and want it," he said.</p><p>He said he "triggered some people" by using the phrase "real fans," going on to push back against the idea that he was trying to make "some big statement."</p><p>"I could see that it was being pressed into the idea that I was taking the audience for granted (which is a super shitty look, but it was not at all my intent and does not reflect at all how I feel)," he said.</p><p>Pitchford went on to say that, as an artist, he doesn't want to see price increases because that might limit how many people could play it. At the same time, Pitchford is a businessman and he said he understands that "business is a thing and that the market and economy are driving prices up."</p><p>"Sooner or later we're going to have to all adapt to that so that the creative engine can make at least as much as it spends to provide us with amazing content," he said.</p><p>Speaking at PAX, Pitchford said it's a "gnarly" time in the video game industry when it comes to economics.</p><p>"On one level, we've got a competitive marketplace where people who make [pricing] choices want to sell as many units as possible and they want to be careful about people that are price-sensitive," he said. "So there are some folks who don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are. There are other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing and there are tariffs for the retail packaging."</p><p>Borderlands 4 has "more than twice" the development budget of Borderlands 3, Pitchford said, adding that he hopes the game sells as many copies as possible so Gearbox can reinvest those funds into future products.</p><p>2K, the publisher of Borderlands 4, will set the price of Borderlands 4.

Reviewer Jessica Cogswell called the RPG "transcendent" and "greater than the sum of its parts," even when those parts are each "masterfully crafted."</p><p dir="ltr">Set in the fantasy world of Euchronia, players set out on a secret mission to assassinate a tyrannical would-be ruler, only for the entire kingdom to be thrown into political upheaval. Soon players are thrust into a competition to become the kingdom's next monarch, and along the way are joined by a ragtag group of heroes representing Euchronia's various fantasy races as they all seek to make the world a better place.</p><p dir="ltr">Metaphor: ReFantazio is every bit as stylish as Atlus' previous Persona work, with some of the most impressive menus and animations ever seen in a turn-based RPG. Persona fans will feel right at home with Metaphor's combat, too, which sees characters transform into different Archetypes to use unique powers. It also sports a standout soundtrack that feels unique to its fantasy universe yet still familiar to composer Shoji Meguro's previous Atlus work.</p><p dir="ltr">Other big <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/more-new-game-pass-titles-for-may-2025-include-2024s-best-and-day-one-releases/2900-6599/" data-ref-id="2900-6599">Game Pass additions in May</a> have included the newly released Xbox first-party title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and indie sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-train-2/" data-ref-id="5000-663832">Monster Train 2</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-2-joins-game-pass-today-as-battle-for-brooklyn-expansion-and-year-7-launches/1100-6531831/" data-ref-id="1100-6531831">The Division 2 (alongside the new Battle for Brooklyn expansion)</a> and the new game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/katamari-damacy-creators-new-game-to-a-t-launches-in-may/1100-6529669/" data-ref-id="1100-6529669">To a T</a> from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/katamari-damacy/" data-ref-id="5000-19797">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi.</p>

Each character boasts a unique skillset to challenge players to master different gameplay styles. Battle the hordes of the underworld on an assortment of playable maps drawing from various locales from the mythological story of Achilles such as Troy and Tartarus. Level up your character during each run to elevate them from hero to god of destruction as you gain stronger power-ups and abilities. Increase overall team stats between runs to increase your odds of winning the fight against Hades’ minions as you confront more lethal monsters and bosses.</p><p>Following the Trojan War, Hades, the god of the underworld, resurrected Achilles to use him in a conflict against the other gods. Once Achilles had served his purpose, Hades betrayed him, casting him into the depths of Tartarus and condemning him to eternal torment. Refusing to accept this fate, Achilles broke free from the underworld, rescuing many lost souls, including several who had fallen to his own sword. Angered by this defiance, Hades unleashed his dark minions to hunt down Achilles and all the souls he freed. Take on the mantle of Achilles or one of the many others rescued from Tartarus and prepare for a fight that will take you beyond the land of the living in the hopes of thwarting Hades and his army of the damned.</p><!-- AD: content -->

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, developer Unknown Worlds' exquisite deep sea survival game, is making its way to iOS and Android devices this July, meaning you'll finally be able to play it <em>actually underwater</em> (as long as your phone is waterproof, so please do check that first).
</p>
<p>
Subnautica, for some context, originally lauched in 2018 after a couple of years in early access, taking players on a mostly combat-free adventure far, far beneath the waves after crash landing on the ocean planet 4546B. It managed to combine its various strands of exploration, narrative, crafting, base building, and thalassophobia-inducing horror into a deeply satisfying whole, and ended up being a critical and commercial hit. So much so that a standalone expansion - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-below-zero">Subnautica: Below Zero</a> - followed, and a sequel's on the way.
</p>
<p>
But back to Subnautica's iOS and Android release. It's being created in collaboration with mobile developer Playdigious and promises the full-fat Subnautica experience - the one Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-review">called</a> "oppressively beautiful" and "well-wrought" back in 2018 - albeit with some mobile-specific tweaks. It's got an updated UI, for instance, alongside touch controls and support for MFi controllers if you'd rather play with proper buttons. That's in addition to iPhone 15 optimisation, GameCenter achievements on iOS, and cloud save support enabling progress to be share between iOS or Android devices.

<figcaption>Here's a quick look at Subnautica's mobile release.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL6HobdRpVQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
If all that appeals, Subnatica comes to iOS and Android on 8th July (via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subnautica/id6478639011">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unknownworlds.subnautica">Google Play</a> respectively) for the entirely reasonable price of $9.99 USD. In fact, it'll be even cheaper for a limited time, given the 10 percent launch discount that'll bring it down to $8.99.
</p>
<p>
As for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, that's currently set to launch into early access later this year. Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">shared a tiny bit of first gameplay back in April</a>, showing off a handful of new environments, some new aquatic creatures, and even a bit of base-building and co-operative swimming. Co-op is, of course, the sequel's big new feature, and it'll support up to four players. Subnautica 2 will initially be available for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and GamePass, and is expected to stay in early access for "about two to three years."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/atomfalls-wicked-isle-story-dlc-launches-on-june-3rd/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rebellion has announced that it’s British post apocalyptic survival game Atomfall will be getting bigger with the launch of its Wicked Isle story expansion DLC, which will be available from June 3rd. Those who purchased the Atomfall Deluxe Edition will get instant access to the new story content, as will those who buy the Deluxe upgrade pack which is available for £14.99, €19.99, or $19.99. The launch trailer for Atomfall Wicked Isle can be watched now.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Wicked Isle DLC Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5HdforNUuuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Atomfall’s Wicked Isle story takes place on Midsummer Island, which is close to the site of Windscale Atom Plant. As a result those who reside on the island and the environment have been subject to higher infection levels compared to those in Wyndham Village and the surrounding areas. The new content adds new enemies including pirates and druids, as well as more weapons to add to your arsenal including the Blunderbuss shotgun. New skills will also be available for your character to use. Wicked Isle is not a standalone story, but weaves into the main story beats of the main game. So much so, that new endings have been added to take into account the events that take place on Midsummer Island.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Atomfall review, Gareth said,<em> “Atomfall is an interesting game. It might not be wholly unique in anything it does, but it combines its core ideas in a way that feels fresh. A big part of that comes through the drip feed of the underlying story, whilst another is the glorious British countryside that makes up its maps. It likely isn’t going to blow your mind, but it’s an enjoyable journey and you would still be missing out if you didn’t give Atomfall a go.”</em></p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/674523/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-live-service</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/animal-crossing-new-horizons-was-a-glimpse-at-nintendo%E2%80%99s-online-future.1201617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/674523/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-live-service<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Tiger Borgia, a content creator focused on cozy games, has been pulling weeds in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> for over five years. </p><p>Given the current landscape in which game developers constantly release new updates to vie for the attention of audiences, Borgia’s dedication to <em>New Horizons</em> can come across as admirable. Nintendo has not released a major update to <em>New Horizons </em>since the <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> DLC in 2021. (Just this week <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/49112/~/how-to-update-animal-crossing%3A-new-horizons">the game was patched</a> in advance of the Switch 2.) The version of <em>New Horizons</em> Borgia plays today — the one where she pulls weeds and fishes each day — is more or less the same game that the company released in the spring of 2020. </p><p>At a time when seemingly every publisher is trying to capture a piece of the lucrative live-service boom, <em>New Horizons</em> showed Nintendo slowly inching its way into the space with more than a year’s worth of regular updates after launch. And that expansion into live service is something that could become an even larger part of Nintendo’s future with the Switch 2.</p><p>Speaking to <em>The Verge</em>, Borgia explains that two years ago she would have said yes to having more content in <em>New Horizons</em>, but her opinion has since changed. “Now I feel like the game should be left as is,” Borgia says via email. “<em>New Horizons</em> already had its moment. I would be open to the next Animal Crossing title being a live-service game, but I would be skeptical about paywalls and subscription fees.”</p><p>Since the release of <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> PUBG: Battlegrounds </em>in 2017, live-service games have become a core pillar of modern gaming. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-09-29/why-playstation-fans-are-cheering-ceo-jim-ryan-s-departure">Live-service games</a> — or what some call “games as a service” — don’t have a clear start and end. Instead, developers release a base game and continue to put out updates that add new characters, game modes, and other content to try and get people to play as much as possible.</p><p>The model has become a massively popular way to monetize games. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lj27nkyes22r">Industry analyst Mat Piscatella</a> published data saying more than 40 percent of all time spent playing on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles in the US in the month of January was spent playing the top 10 live-service games. And the trend has hit the developer side too: a <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">2025 survey from the Game Developers Conference</a> found that roughly 30 percent of all “AAA” developers are working on a live-service game. </p><p>Despite all the big numbers, Nintendo has been selective with the live-service games it develops. Creating a live-service game isn’t as easy as flipping a switch, and even major companies like Sony have struggled to enter the space; it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">recently shut down development on two such projects</a>. However, some fans are wondering if that could change with the Switch 2. </p><p>Previous titles like <em>Splatoon 3 </em>have already gotten live-esque service with regular <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23683377/splatoon-3-splatfest-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom">updates and events</a> — even if the earlier entries in the series were ultimately shut down. And <em>New Horizons</em> received a steady stream of updates initially. New features, like the Switch 2’s Discord-like social tool GameChat, could benefit live-service games that rely on online communication and logging in with friends regularly to play. Additionally, leaks from an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">October playtest</a> suggested that Nintendo could be working on some sort of MMO for the Switch 2, which could also fall under the umbrella of a live-service game. </p><p>But here is the most compelling argument that a shift could be on the horizon: Nintendo has already been investing in live-service games for years. If you look at Nintendo’s mobile games, entries like <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> already used a free-to-play model with in-game transactions at launch.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Some Animal Crossing fans welcome the possibility of adapting the mainline games to a live-service model. <em>New Horizons</em> is really good for people who like to get creative and design an island, but the game can run out of new content after players complete certain tasks and storylines.</p><p>Tom, an artist who played the game for more than two years, tells <em>The Verge</em> a live-service version of the game could have kept him playing even longer. “More updates would have made it <em>way</em> more likely that I’d have kept going, especially because it would keep friends coming back too,” he says<em>.</em></p><p>Additionally, the gameplay and structure of <em>New Horizons </em>could be the perfect fit for a live-service game, since it has seasonal events depending on the time of year and the region you play in. However, some of the fans I spoke to expressed skepticism. </p><p>“I was never expecting to get infinite content from Animal Crossing honestly,” Christi Kerr, a player who spent more than 700 hours playing <em>New Horizons</em>, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “I was used to old AC games where all the content came out at once, and you play it until you feel like you’ve done all you want. I thought the updates to <em>New Horizons</em> were fun, but also kind of frustrating as a <em>New Leaf</em> player.”</p><p>That’s not to say that players <em>The Verge</em> spoke to are completely closed off to the live-service model with the next mainline Animal Crossing game; it just needs to be done in a way that feels respectful to players’ time, money, and attention. Today, even beloved live-service games are regularly criticized by fans for requiring too much time to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteXPMaps/comments/1h45vb0/leveling_up_this_season_so_far_doesnt_seem_so_easy/">level up a battle pass</a> or for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/wa1348/patch_28_has_the_worst_puzzle_designs_in_genshin/">poorly designed events</a>. </p><p>“If Animal Crossing were to consider a live-service approach, I really hope that they would focus on seasonal events and quality-of-life updates,” Borgia says. “I would be nervous to say I hope for continuous new content like furniture and clothing, because that can easily turn into a microtransaction nightmare. I’d love to have more seasonal celebrations, challenges, and temporary NPC visitors.”</p><p>So far, Nintendo has shown a measured approach to live-service games. In the case of <em>Pocket Camp</em>, Nintendo ended up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312047/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-review-microtransactions">rereleasing it as a standalone game</a> free of microtransactions. Now, people who missed the boat on playing <em>Pocket Camp</em> initially and don’t like in-app purchases can still play the same game. </p><p>For the fans we spoke to, this is good enough. Animal Crossing doesn’t need to be some sort of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23583539/back-4-blood-content-updates-expansion-packs-good">never-ending forever game</a> that trudges on like a zombie throughout the years. As Kerr put it, it’s totally fine to have a game start and end, and then get a new one down the line. </p><p>“I would’ve been delighted to see updates like a live service game. [...] But like I said, I’m not bothered if the next Animal Crossing game sustains my interest for a while and then I’m done.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-games-series-tier-list<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Which Nintendo franchise do you think is the greatest?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As I’m sure you’re aware, the Nintendo Switch 2 is upon us. So, with a brand new console on the horizon, what better time to look back at some of the legendary publisher’s greatest games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For decades, Nintendo has given us some of the most famous and best-selling game series ever made, but here, I’ve picked out 18 of the most well-known ones to sort through. Yes, this list could stretch into the 100s, but we don’t want to be here all day, do we? From Super Mario to Zelda, we all have our favourites, and some (sorry Kirby) that we’ve just never quite clicked with. I’ve had a go at ranking them via one of our IGN Tier Lists, purely taking into account <strong>my personal enjoyment</strong> of each series over the years. Take a look at my tier list here:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/29/screenshot-2025-05-29-at-13-38-28-1748522322130.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Simon Cardy's Nintendo Series Tier List</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m sure it’s no surprise to see both Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda in my S-tier category. Two of the most influential and, crucially, very fun video game series to ever do it, it’s a no-brainer really. On the other end of the scale… I’m sure a few eyebrows will be raised at my placing of Super Smash Bros. in the C tier. Please let me explain myself before battering me in the comments, please. Smash Bros. has just never been my thing, I’m afraid. Not only am I not a fighting game fan, but in a time when lots of people grew up playing it with friends, I was simply enjoying other multiplayer and party games, whether those be TimeSplitters, Guitar Hero, or Call of Duty. I just don’t have the connection to Smash Bros. that so many do, and for that, I can only ask for your complete forgiveness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t agree with me? Think that Pikmin is better than Pokémon? Well, why not have a go at ranking some of Nintendo’s biggest series yourself in a tier list below, where you can compare your own S, A, B, C, and D tiers with the whole of the IGN community. </p><div id="nintendo-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Series Tier List</h3><h3>Nintendo Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s your favourite Nintendo series that hasn’t made it onto this list? Let us know in the comments, as well as why you’ve ranked the games in the order you’ve chosen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

<p>All 136 FBS schools are represented in CFB 26, while more than 300 real-world coaches have lent their likenesses to the game, which launches on July 10 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>CFB 26 also has expanded player types and abilities, including 84 total abilities and 10 new archetypes to help players customize their roster to their liking. Additionally, EA added a new "wear and tear" system that requires players to manage player fatigue and injuries.</p><p>The game also sports better AI, improved blocking and coverages, and a new "Dynamic Substitutions" system to help "show your opponent what your program is made of."</p><p dir="ltr">The Stadium Pulse system from CFB 25 has been "revamped" for CFB 26 to add new crowd-based challenges and things like "clock distortion" and "extreme screen shake" to help ramp up the intensity in pressure-packed moments. There are also 160 new school-specific chants in CFB 26, along with 10 new PA tracks--including "Enter Sandman" by Metallica.</p><p dir="ltr">The broadcast and commentary team from CFB 25 returns for the new game, including Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit, Rece Davis, Jesse Palmer, Desmond Howard, and David Pollack.</p><p dir="ltr">EA also said fans can look forward to improved Dynasty and Road to Glory modes, while the Road to the College Football Playoff mode has a new online progression format.</p><p dir="ltr">CFB 26 launches July 10, but people who buy the game's deluxe edition or the EA Sports MVP Bundle--which includes CFB 26 and Madden NFL 26--can start playing on July 7. There will also be a free 10-hour trial for EA Play members, which means Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have access, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The Standard Edition of EA Sports College Football 26 features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-cover-features-two-top-wide-receivers/1100-6531832/" data-ref-id="1100-6531832">Alabama's Ryan Williams and Ohio State's Jeremiah Smith</a>, two of the top-ranked wide receivers in the country.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-preorders-up-for-grabs-for-ps5-and-xbox/1100-6531106/" data-ref-id="1100-6531106">CFB 26 preorder guide.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Sales numbers for CFB 25 were never announced, but EA said recently that the game drove <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-FY25-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL1.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than $1 billion in "net bookings,"</a> which means revenue.

                <p>Subscription services for video games have grown over the years, but former PlayStation Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida has expressed concern about them. In an interview, Yoshida spoke about how the expansion of first-party titles could eventually lead to third-party studios being shut out of subscription services, as the companies could prefer to hedge their bets with a growing library of first-party releases instead of experimental games.</p><p>"If the only way for people to play games is through subscriptions, that's really dangerous because what [type] of games can be created will be dictated by the owner of the subscription services," Yoshida said to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/shuhei-yoshida-warns-subscription-services-could-become-dangerous-for-developers" rel="nofollow ">Game Developer at Gamescom LATAM</a>. "That's really, really risky because there must always be fresh new ideas tried by small developers that create the next wave of development. But if the big companies dictate what games can be created, I don't think that will advance the industry."</p>

<p>Yoshida added that Sony's approach is "healthier" as the company only adds first-party releases to its PlayStation Plus service after they've been on the market for a certain amount of time. Once sales have tailed off on a first-party game, it usually finds its way onto PS Plus, thus allowing more people to experience it for the first time.</p><p>In comparison, Microsoft's main selling point for Xbox Game Pass is that games developed by its internal studios are day-one releases on its subscription program, and third-party games have also been included in this strategy. So far, 2025 has seen day-one launches of big titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, Doom: The Dark Ages, and South of Midnight on Xbox Game Pass. The releases have been fairly diverse as well, with games like Pentiment, Grounded, and Hi-Fi Rush joining traditional fare like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Forza Motorsport.</p><p>Developer Rebellion's newest game, Atomfall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-release-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-report/1100-6531671/" data-ref-id="1100-6531671">was also "immediately profitable,"</a> and the studio recently spoke about<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925"> why it was a good business decision</a> to release it through Game Pass. At the same time, another developer has spoken <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-hurts-sales-says-dev-behind-xbox-game-pass-title/1100-6514084/" data-ref-id="1100-6514084">about the risks of Game Pass</a>, and Microsoft has also clarified its own statements on the service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/" data-ref-id="1100-6511503">potentially cannibalizing game sales</a>.</p><p>Yoshida did praise Microsoft for its backwards compatibility, a feat of engineering that he called "smart and very well planned" for its subscribers. PS Plus--and Xbox Game Pass--will be home to a day-one third-party release in June, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/">Remedy Entertainment's FBC: Firebreak will be available through those services</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-playstation-plus-may-2025-games-for-premium-and-extra-subscribers/2900-6587/">PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue was also updated this week</a> with a few more titles, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-june-2025/1100-6531805/">June's PS Plus games</a> includes a few recent titles from 2024 like the Alone in the Dark remake, Destiny 2: The Final Shape, and NBA 2K25.</p>

                <p>A federal court has blocked US President Donald Trump's plans to institute major global tariffs, a plan announced in April that sent global markets into a frenzy. Trump attempted to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement the tariffs, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-trade-court-0392dbd59f548e49ad4f64254ae3f94a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a three-judge panel rejected this</a>. What all of this means for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> and other gaming products, however, is unknown at the moment.</p><p>The ruling said Trump may still be able to implement import taxes of 15% for 150 days on certain countries where the US is in a major trade deficit, however.</p><p>The US government may have to refund companies that paid the tariffs. George Mason University professor Ilya Somin, who worked on a related tariff case, told <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/28/federal-court-strikes-down-trumps-april-2-tariffs-00373843" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Politico</a>, "Anybody that has had to pay tariffs so far will be able to get them refunded."</p><p>The US Justice Department is appealing the decision, and it's possible the case could be heard by the US Supreme Court if it goes far enough.</p><p>Nintendo cited Trump's tariffs as one of the reasons why Switch 2 preorders were initially delayed. While the Switch 2 price remains at $450, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">did raise prices on some accessories.</a> Microsoft raised Xbox console prices, citing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">"market conditions,"</a> but without mentioning tariffs specifically. Sony, for its part, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-prices-have-increased-in-some-regions-but-not-the-us/1100-6530829/" data-ref-id="1100-6530829">raised PS5 prices in April.</a> Tabletop gaming companies are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tabletop-game-publisher-is-very-publicly-suing-trump-administration-over-tariffs/1100-6531040/" data-ref-id="1100-6531040">affected by the tariffs</a>, too.</p><p>Whether or not gaming companies were baking the tariffs into their price increases is unclear; also unclear is whether or not companies will offer refunds. </p><p>Gaming companies might raise prices for any number of reasons, beyond a potential impact of tariffs. For example, experts agree that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to pay more</a> for their favorite products because the data shows they will. The Switch 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">about $50 more expensive than the original Switch</a>, adjusted for inflation, and Nintendo might be charging more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">simply because people will pay it</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has received a day one patch ahead of its release tomorrow.</p>
<p>Ready across all platforms, the update "aims to improve gameplay and stability" according to the (very minimal) <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>The changes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved handling of playable characters</li>
<li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li>
<li>Text adjustments</li>
<li>Balance adjustments</li>
<li>Added character scenarios</li>
<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>No further details are provided in the notes, so I hopped into the game to check out the changes.</p>

<p>Testing a single player expedition, it would appear the balance adjustments have made it slightly easier. While enemies are still aggressive, their health seems lower and my character stats appeared to be higher.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be my skill level has increased over the review period. But even a half-arsed run got me two thirds through the first Nightlord boss, which wouldn't have happened previously, so make of that what you will.</p>
<p>Still, I wouldn't take this as a sign that solo play is a viable option to complete the game. It's still very much intended to be a multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>One obvious improvement, though, is the "improved handling of playable characters", which relates to the game's parkour movement. It's now much cleaner jumping up the side of cliffs.</p>
<p>The remaining changes will need to be tested over a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sales-pass-30m">30m selling game</a>. It's out tomorrow across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam). Note that crossplay between platforms is not included.</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3573040/Squad_22_ZOV/">Squad 22: ZOV</a> is a new squad tactics game that just released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-did-not-suffer-a-security-breach-and-you-dont-need-to-change-your-password-says-valve/">Steam</a> yesterday, and claims to be "<em>officially recommended</em>" by the Russian military "<em>for use as a basic infantry tactic manual for cadet and Yunarmy training<strong>.</strong></em>"</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/steam-russian-military-propaganda-game/">Simulation Daily</a>, the game's <a href="https://squad22.online/">website</a> claims that the development team includes soldiers currently fighting in the war between Ukraine and Russia, and claims that it shows "<em>History as it</em> <em>is.</em>"</p>
<p>The website reads,"<em>Dive into 2014 and 2022-2024 events, through different campaigns and learn how people who lived in them saw what happened, how it affected their lives and changed opinions</em>."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/rf-en/how-russia-militarizes-youth-through-computer-games/">Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation</a> has already published articles about Squad 22: ZOV, and how it is Russian military propaganda that aims to "<em>mythologize the war and its participants</em>" from Russia's point of view, to bring young Russian men into the fold of the army.</p>
<p>"<em>The Squad 22: ZOV game is not just entertainment, but an element of propaganda aimed at justifying the war and creating a heroic myth about the Russian</em> <em>military,</em>" the Center for Countering Disinformation writes.</p>
<p>"<em>This is another step in the militarization of Russian society and its preparation for a long-term war.</em>"</p>
<p>It's unclear how exactly Squad 22: ZOV was able to get its Steam listing and pass through moderation checks. Valve has not yet commented on the game, nor has it taken action to remove the game like it recently did with a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-game-promoting-sexual-assault-removed-from-sale-in-uk-australia-and-canada/">game explicitly depicting sexual violence</a>, or how it removed a game depicting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-counter-terrorism-unit-demands-steam-withdraw-controversial-shooter-from-sale">conflict between Israel and Palestine</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has revealed the release date for the next major&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>update, which will bring a rework to the evidence system and more next month.</p>

<p>Arriving on June 24th, the Chronicle update will introduce "a total overhaul of evidence collection", according to Kinetic, along with three new evidence types, a redesign for the journal, and a new UI for the main menu.</p>

<p>One of the new evidence types, Sound, will require you to use the brand new Sound Recorder device to capture subtle audio cues in your environment. Each tier allows you to detect "deeper layers of audio", with ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and paranormal sounds all available to be recorded.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-staircase.jpg?itok=Mf8ajJun 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-staircase.jpg?itok=N4fnReB3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New evidence types are available for you to collect in the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>Chronicle update, due in June.</figcaption></figure><p>As for the journal, it's getting a complete redesign. The "Photos" tab is being replaced by one titled "Media", which will house your proof, including photos and videos you've taken, as well as the new Sound category.</p>

<p>If you want to complete an investigation, you'll have to fill your journal with different types of evidence, and you can look forward to "new paranormal moments to capture", including EMF spikes and "fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms".</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s Chronicle update also brings an overhaul to the way evidence works; the first instance of each media type captured will be marked as "Unique", while subsequent captures will be marked as "Duplicates", and smaller rewards will be given for those.</p>

<p>Other changes in Chronicle include a reworked leveling and progression system (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-ascension-update-release-date" rel="nofollow">yes, another one</a>), as well as a new main menu UI that should make navigating&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s options easier.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s Chronicle update lands on June 24th. The game is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/phasmophobia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-brings-new-area-and-more-next-week.1201566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebellion has announced that the first major piece of story DLC for&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>,&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>, will be launching next week. It'll be purchasable separately if you don't own the Deluxe Edition, but if you do, you'll already have access to it.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle&nbsp;</em>launches on June 3rd. It'll add&nbsp;a new location to&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>in the form of Midsummer Island, and while you're there, you'll also uncover new weapons, new leads, and even new endings.</p>

<p>As you've probably already surmised,&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle&nbsp;</em>is built heavily around&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s folk horror elements; if you haven't played the main game yet, I won't spoil, but suffice it to say you're not just dealing with bandits and trigger-happy military types.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date.jpg?itok=pWwwjFPe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date.jpg?itok=8pakGODG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atomfall</em>'s Wicked Isle DLC is coming next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Head of design Ben Fisher says that because Midsummer is closer to the Windscale plant than the rest of&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s world, "the levels of infection in both the people and the environment are higher than on the mainland".</p>

<p>As such, you'll be encountering new enemy factions, some of which may be too infected to reason with. A new pirate bandit faction will also be present on Midsummer, and it'll be up to you how you deal with them.</p>

<p>New weapons include a blunderbuss, a new bow, and "the Beekeeper's Staff", which feels to me like a not-so-subtle reference to Nic Cage's terrible 2006 remake of the British folk horror classic&nbsp;<em>The Wicker Man</em>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but new skills will also be available, and you'll be able to use your new upgraded metal detector to help you find loot caches with even more useful stuff in them. In short, if you love&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, you'll probably love this as well.</p>




<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in March</a>,&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>proved popular at launch, reaching <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-player-count-1m-stats" rel="nofollow">a million players by its first weekend</a> (having been released on the Game Pass service on day one).</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/atomfall/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atomfall/9NC4WDL5KZBL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle&nbsp;</em>will be launching across all three platforms on June 3rd. Make sure to check out our Erren's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atomfall-review-british-invasion" rel="nofollow">review of the base game</a> to see what she thought of it.</p>

Alongside Switch 2 support comes new features, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642093/nintendo-switch-smartphone-app-zelda-notes">first announced in early April</a>, making it easier to access screenshots on other devices and adding mobile notifications for GameChat invitations.</p><p>The most useful update to the app is that the Switch 2 will be able to upload screenshots and videos to it through the cloud. The Switch 2’s album will have a new Upload to Smart Device option for manually sending screenshots, as well as an automatic uploads feature where the 100 most recent screenshots and videos on the console will be available in the app.</p><p>Files will be stored in the cloud for up to 30 days, Nintendo says, but can be downloaded from the app to a mobile device’s camera roll to be saved permanently. If you attempt to upload more than 100 screenshots and videos, the oldest screenshots will be overwritten. A free Nintendo Account is required to use the feature, but a paid Nintendo Switch Online membership is not.</p><p>Sharing screenshots from the original Switch was a more cumbersome process requiring a smartphone to scan a QR code on the console and then connect to a temporary Wi-Fi network to transfer the files wirelessly.The Nintendo Switch App will also let you see when you’ve been invited to a GameChat call and includes the Zelda Notes features for the Switch 2 editions of <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. Although not active in the app yet, the feature will include achievements, spoken directions to areas you mark on a map, and access to additional Princess Zelda recall memories.</p><p>The Nintendo Today app also received an update today with new features including the ability to link its calendar with your own calendar app so you can see upcoming Nintendo events and game release dates as part of your personal schedule. There’s also the option to favorite content and filter news so you only see what you’re interested in, and the app now lets you zoom in on images.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This fresh mechanic will add a new dimension to gameplay, revealing subtle clues that might otherwise be drowned out by terrified screams. Available in three upgrade tiers (T1, T2, and T3), this new equipment unlocks deeper layers of audio detection, as players will be able to record audio from ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and Paranormal Sounds like those detected by the Parabolic Microphone.</p><p><strong>Journal Overhaul</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The “Chronicle” update will redefine how ghost hunters gather evidence. The journal will get a full redesign, where the Photos tab will be replaced by a brand-new Media tab. This tab will organize all captured proof into three sections—Photos, Videos, and new Sound Recordings—offering a richer, more immersive investigation experience where players can log photographic, visual, and new haunting audio evidence all in one place. Investigators will now need to fill a full book of unique media to complete a perfect investigation, with new paranormal moments to capture—from EMF spikes to ghostly interactions and fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Redesigned Evidence System</strong></p><p>“Chronicle” will also introduce a revamped media quality system. The first evidence capture of any media type will be marked as “Unique”, granting extra cash and XP rewards at the end of each contract. Any subsequent captures of the same evidence type will be classed as “Duplicates”, offering smaller rewards. The new system will also add tier bonuses based on the equipment used and adds all media captures into the Reward Multiplier, making every shot, sound, and sight count even more toward player’s final payouts.</p><p><strong>…And More!</strong></p><p>In addition to the evidence collection overhaul, Sound Recorder, and revamped media quality system, the “Chronicle” update will introduce a reworked levelling and progression system, and a brand-new Main Menu user interface. Behind the scenes, the <em>Phasmophobia</em> team has also been hard at work exorcising bugs to polish the experience for players—and there are still plenty of secrets waiting to be uncovered when the update drops.</p><p>This year, <em>Phasmophobia</em> will also see the highly-anticipated rework to Grafton Farmhouse, following Bleasdale Farmhouse’s recent overhaul. Grafton, an abandoned, crumbling home, will soon feature updated visuals, redesigned layouts, re-themed rooms, and a haunting new attic. The revamped Grafton Farmhouse arrives after “Chronicle”—stay tuned for release details!</p></blockquote><p><em>Phasmophobia</em> is available now in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,553 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [235 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,259 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,254 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The notes don't go into too much more detail than that, though, as you can see the whole list of patch notes below:</p><h2>Patch contents</h2><ul><li>Improved handling of playable characters</li><li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li><li>Text adjustments</li><li>Balance adjustments</li><li>Added character scenarios</li><li>Bug fixes</li></ul><p>These patch notes also came with some warnings about the PC version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. There is an issue where the game won't boot up on PC. However, this can be resolved by opening the Properties menu for Elden Ring Nightreign from your Steam library, navigating to the Installed Files submenu, and selecting the Verify Integrity of Game Files option.</p><p>Then, once the game is booted up, some PCs "using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops." Bandai Namco has not clarified which graphics cards in particular are affected or how severe the frame rate drops are, but says it is "currently investigating the cause." It's recommended that players set the graphics settings to Medium or Low and install the latest graphics-card drivers to avoid these performance issues in the interim.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches today for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

Ahead of its launch, publisher Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for the game that is a must-watch (probably not for a reason you can guess).</p><p>Titled "Bring Me To Life Trailer," this Nightreign trailer utilizes Evanescence’s popular song, "Bring Me To Life," to great effect to create something that’s more like an AMV (anime music video) or something you’d see on VH1 or MTV in the early 2000s. Perhaps it’s because I’m a millennial (born in 1995, so just barely), but this trailer just feels right.</p><p><strong>You can check it out for yourself below:</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ot6j_qqYQaM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ot6j_qqYQaM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>If you’ve been watching Nathan Fielder’s <em>The Rehearsal</em> on HBO after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-feature/2025/05/11/equal-parts-boring-and-intense-visiting-the-set-of-the-last-of-us"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> finishes up on Sunday nights, you might have already had “Bring Me To Life” on your mind for reasons I won’t spoil here – you should watch <em>The Rehearsal</em> if you aren’t already. While it was fun to imagine Fielder had something to do with this trailer’s existence, a Bandai Namco source confirmed that’s not the case.</p><p>While waiting for the game to download, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Elden Ring Nightreign review</a> to find out why I gave the game an 8 out of 10.</p><hr><p><em>Are you picking up Nightreign tomorrow?

This marks the third round of layoffs at the publisher this year.</p><p>Black Panther was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/07/10/black-panther-game-announced-by-ea">first announced</a> to be in development in July 2023 as part of a three-game partnership between EA and Marvel. The first game revealed for that initiative is an upcoming <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/09/20/motive-studio-announces-single-player-iron-man-game-as-first-part-of-new-eamarvel">Iron Man title</a> developed by Motive Studios, the team behind the 2023 Dead Space remake and Star Wars Squadrons. Black Panther was the second title; the third game has yet to be announced.</p><p>EA formed the Seattle-based Cliffhanger Games to develop Black Panther. At the time of its reveal, Black Panther was very early in development; Cliffhanger was still hiring staff. Because of this, we know very little about what the game would have been beyond what Cliffhanger described at the time as a “single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game.” It also would have been the character's first solo starring role in a video game, having previously appeared in supporting roles.</p><p>In an unfortunate twist of fate, Cliffhanger was led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions. Cliffhanger’s staff also partly consisted of former Monolith talent who worked on Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Monolith Productions was shut down by Warner Bros. in February and had its own superhero game, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2021/2021/12/09/monolith-open-world-wonder-woman-game-in-the-works">Wonder Woman</a>, canceled.</p>

</article>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-studios"><em>IGN</em></a> reports that Cliffhanger’s staff were informed of the shutdown via an email from EA Entertainment president Laura Miele. She explained that the closure was part of EA’s larger goal to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities” as the publisher aims to focus on developing a small batch of franchises: Battlefield, Apex Legends, The Sims, and Skate. Despite this initiative, Miele’s email also states that Motive’s Iron Man, Respawn’s third Star Wars Jedi game, and BioWare’s next Mass Effect title will remain in production. EA Sports, which is a separate division from EA Entertainment, is also said to be unaffected by today's events.&nbsp;</p><p>Employees working in EA’s mobile and central teams were also impacted. Miele states EA will work to find new positions for affected employees in other parts of the company. It is unclear exactly how many employees have lost their jobs, though <em>IGN </em>believes the number is less than 300.</p><p>This news follows the round of layoffs that hit the publisher last April, which included 100 employees at <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/update-respawn-suffers-layoffs-amid-team-adjustments-cancels-two-early-projects">Respawn Entertainment</a>. This resulted in the cancellation of incubation projects that included a Titanfall title. BioWare also saw layoffs in January due to a restructuring aimed at focusing all resources on developing the next Mass Effect. In February 2024, EA laid off <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/02/28/ea-lays-off-670-employees-cancels-respawns-star-wars-fps">over 650 employees</a> and canceled an upcoming Star Wars first-person shooter by Respawn. That particular round of layoffs saw CEO Andrew Wilson state that the publisher was “moving away from the development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.” &nbsp;</p><p>Black Panther fans now only have <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/20/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-is-skydances-captain-americablack-panther-game-arriving-next">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> to look forward to. Developed by Skydance New Media and led by former Uncharted creative lead Amy Hennig, it stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, the grandfather of T’Challa, alongside a soldier and a Wakandan spy, battling Hydra during World War II. That title was recently <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/13/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-to-early-2026-to-add-more-polish">delayed to 2026</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/676167/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-test-hands-on<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>I don’t want gaming to become another streaming subscription service that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23901586/streaming-service-prices-netflix-disney-hulu-peacock-max">keeps going up in price</a>. I don’t want to put even more power in Nvidia’s hands, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/672637/nvidia-rtx-5060-review-meddling-gamersnexus-wake-up-call">particularly not right now</a>.</p></div><p>But I can’t deny that the company’s $20-a-month* GeForce Now is a near-perfect fit for the Steam Deck. I’ve been covering cloud gaming for 15 years, and this is the very first time I’ve wanted to keep playing indefinitely.</p><div><div><p id="what-is-geforce-now"><h2><strong>What is GeForce Now?</strong></h2></p></div><p>For the uninitiated, Nvidia’s GeForce Now is a game streaming service that farms the graphical processing power out to the cloud. Instead of controlling a game running locally on your Steam Deck’s chip, you’re effectively remote-controlling an RTX 4080-powered* gaming rig in a server farm many miles away, which you sync with your existing Steam, Epic, Ubisoft, Xbox, and Battle.net accounts to access your games and savegames from the cloud.</p><p>*Nvidia’s GeForce Now also technically has a free tier, and a “Performance” tier, but I recommend you ignore both. For me, it was the difference between playing many games through a clean window or a dirty window, the difference between playing <em>Alan Wake II</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> with full ray tracing or none at all, the difference between comfortably stretching to 4K or not.</p></div><p>Handhelds have already become my favorite way to play games. The Steam Deck is comfortable and easy to pick up whenever and wherever the mood strikes. But neither my Deck nor my aging desktop PC have kept up with the latest titles. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> can look like a fuzzy mess on a Deck, and I’ve never seen <em>Alan Wake II</em>, <em>Portal RTX</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> in all their ray-traced glory on my RTX 3060 Ti desktop.</p><p>But today, with Nvidia’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2Fdownload%2F" rel="sponsored">just-now-released GeForce Now app</a> for the Steam Deck, I can play every one of those titles at near-max settings, anywhere in my home, for hours and hours on a charge. And if I dock that Steam Deck to my 4K TV, it can output 4K60 HDR and/or ray-traced graphics that put <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the PS5 Pro</a> to shame.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23561989/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-4080-price-reflex-hands-on-cloud-gaming">When we tested GeForce Now’s last big upgrade in 2023</a>, Tom and I agreed it wasn’t <em>quite</em> on par with playing on a native PC.</p></div><p>But on a Steam Deck, where I’m either playing on a low-res handheld screen or sitting across the room from a TV where I don’t notice so many imperfections, it can feel like the best of both worlds.</p><p>Here’s what <em>Expedition 33 </em>looks like running natively on my Steam Deck today, versus the Deck with GeForce Now:</p><p>The best part might be this: while handhelds like the Steam Deck barely get two hours of such a game at potato graphical settings, I could get 7 to 8 hours of GeForce Now. I saw the cloud gaming service consistently sip under 7 watts from my Steam Deck OLED’s 49.2 watt-hour battery, barely more than the system consumes at idle.</p><p>And the new native app makes it a cinch to set up, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147034/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-script-install">no more web browser-and-script workaround</a>: just hold down the power button and switch to desktop mode, download the app, run it, and scan QR codes with your phone to link your various accounts.</p><p>Oh, you’d best believe there are caveats. Giant gaping gotchas galore, which I’ll explain as we go. But after testing the service for nearly two weeks, I’m starting to believe in cloud gaming again.</p><p>Now, you might be wondering: how the heck am I playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/667900/doom-the-dark-ages-clair-obscur-expedition-33-parry-season">a game where timing is so critical</a> via remote control? Here’s the first big caveat: you need a low-latency internet connection, a good Wi-Fi router or wired ethernet, and you need to be within range of Nvidia’s servers for the magic to work. Download speed isn’t as key: 50Mbps should suffice for 4K, and you can get away with less.</p><p>But I’m armed with a AT&amp;T Fiber connection, and I live maybe 30 minutes away from Nvidia’s San Jose, California servers, which makes me a best-case scenario for this tech. Still, Nvidia has over 35 worldwide data centers now, including 14 distinct locations in the United States, and my colleagues with Xfinity and Spectrum cable internet in Portland and Brooklyn tell me <em>Expedition 33</em> played just as well for them.</p><p>“The latency was negligible to the point that I wasn’t missing parries,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner">Cameron Faulkner tells me</a>, saying he nailed the Sad Troubadour on the first try. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> and I found we needed to adjust our timing a bit, but I wound up playing roughly half the game over GeForce Now and almost never looked back.</p><p>Even with the best of connections, though, GeForce Now isn’t bulletproof. Once or twice a day, my seemingly stable gameplay session would at least briefly unravel into a choppy mess.</p><p>In single-player games like <em>Expedition 33</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> I could easily forgive a few minutes of trouble, but my colleagues <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio Di Benedetto</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/erick-gomez">Erick Gomez</a> saw it in otherwise stable twitch shooters where lag could be a bigger issue. “I saw a handful of lag spikes / hiccups that would definitely screw anybody over in a competitive shooter, but thankfully they weren’t at the worst times and they soon subsided,” Antonio tells me.</p><p>You also give up some of the Steam Deck’s portability. While you can plug and unplug the Steam Deck from a TV dock and seamlessly switch between big screen and small screen play, you can’t just put the Steam Deck to sleep without ending the session and losing unsaved progress. (Unlike, say, <a href="https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng">Chiaki.</a>) And although the native GeForce Now app supports 4K60, a big leap up from 1440p, you may find yourself squinting at tiny text because it doesn’t scale the UI appropriately.</p><p>Also: while GeForce Now also supports a lower res but smoother 1440p 120Hz mode on TVs and even other gaming handhelds, it doesn’t offer a 90Hz mode for the Deck OLED yet. I tested at 60Hz instead.</p><p>Speaking of portability, public Wi-Fi generally isn’t good enough for GeForce Now, and neither are most cellular connections — even with four bars of Verizon 5G UWB service and a wired USB tether to my phone, my stream quickly deteriorated into the jumble you see below. Only the very best cellular connection in my entire neighborhood, a spot right under a 5G tower where I can get 1,200Mbps down and 30 millisecond ping, felt playable to me.</p><p>And, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23561989/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-4080-price-reflex-hands-on-cloud-gaming">as we’ve discussed previously</a>, only the $20-a-month Ultimate tier truly shows what cloud gaming is capable of. <em>Expedition 33</em> looked substantially worse on the Performance tier (Epic spec, native resolution, vs. Medium spec, 50 percent resolution with DLSS) and<em> Indiana Jones</em> went from gorgeous to just “playable while handheld” for me.</p><p>But the biggest caveat with GeForce Now may be outside the company’s control: you have to bring your own games, and yet you only can bring games where Nvidia has explicitly struck a distribution deal.</p><p>Nvidia has made progress: 165 of my 457 Steam games are now available to play, up from 85 two years ago. The company offers over 2,100 games in total across Epic, Battle.net, Ubisoft, Xbox, and GOG too. But Nvidia has no games from Sony, so I’m not playing <em>Helldivers 2</em>, no games from Rockstar, so I’m not playing <em>GTA V </em>or <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, and no <em>Elden Ring</em>, no <em>PUBG</em>, no <em>Schedule I</em> or <em>Football Manager</em> or <em>FIFA</em> or <em>NBA</em> or <em>The Sims.</em> We never quite know which games GeForce Now will get, or when, or if they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21168645/nvidia-geforce-now-2k-games-titles-bioshock-borderlands">might disappear</a>.</p><p>Cloud gaming has never felt like a better deal, now that the service has matured, now that handhelds can make such good use of it, and now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again">buying your own GPU is such a ridiculously expensive proposition</a>. Maybe I’ll defer my own next GPU upgrade in favor of a subscription.</p><p>But it’s not for everyone — you should definitely try a $8 GeForce Now Ultimate day pass first — and there’s still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547334/cloud-gaming-xbox-xcloud-microsoft-streaming-google-stadia-amazon">a lot of mental friction</a>. I’m not looking forward to the day that Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289443/nvidia-geforce-now-monthly-playtime-caps-performance-membership-1440p">alters the deal further</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Black Panther was being developed by the now-closed Cliffhanger Games, which was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-ea-studio-dedicated-to-open-world-action-adventure-will-be-led-by-former-monolith-studio-head"><u>formed in 2023</u></a> with some former developers of the much-loved Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-announces-black-panther-game-from-some-of-the-developers-behind-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor"><u>headed up by Kevin Stephens</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an email sent to staff from EA Entertainment president Laura Miele, reviewed by IGN, Miele said that these changes, alongside other recent cancellations and layoffs, are being done to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/04/17/black-panther-game-1713382773197.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Black Panther game logo. Image credit: EA.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"These decisions are hard," Miele wrote. "They affect people we’ve worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We’re doing everything we can to support them — including finding opportunities within EA, where we’ve had success helping people land in new roles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the news, EA staff and others who worked on the game took to social media to wave goodbye to Black Panther, and call on other companies to snap up developers affected by the studio closure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was a part of this incredible crew,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kortizart.bsky.social/post/3lqawcpmp222v" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said concept artist Karla Ortiz</a>. “We were working on such an amazing and stunning game. Detailed, rich, beautiful. It breaks my heart the world wont see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It also breaks my heart to say goodbye to the team. What an honor to work with you all. What a sad day.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ortiz continued: "... every dev there wanted so badly to release the game. It was beautiful and such great care was given.” “We were so excited to show the world! It was truly special.” Then: “All I can say is that we had something phenomenal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Senior Environment Architect II, Freddie Lee, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stringerseven.bsky.social/post/3lqbar2qlgk2m" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>: “Welp this happened today. It has to be said that during my short time there, I've had the honor and pleasure to work with people like Karla who's art inspired myself and the team, and also instilling confidence and growth into my professional artwork. This team was, and is GOAT.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: "took us by complete surprise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game designer Sophie Mallinson <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sophmallinson.bsky.social/post/3lqavusellk2g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>: “this is a ✧˖° dream team °˖✧ and you should snap up anyone who was working on this project. So sad that we might not ever get to see a black panther ARPG developed by the creators of the Nemesis System!!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ex-Respawn developer Rayme Vinson, now principal technical designer at Gravity Well, also touched on the game Black Panther might have been, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rayme.bsky.social/post/3lqavykwesk2d" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>: “When they shut down the Star Wars FPS, we got to see this game up close and talk to their dev team, because they could take on some of our folks. What they were building was ambitious and special and I was legitimately excited to play it someday, even if they'd only done 1/4 of what they planned.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patrick Wren, senior encounter design on Jedi Survivor at Respawn, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/witdarkstar.bsky.social/post/3lqaui6cjp22t" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simply said</a>: “Morale has been at an all-time low. I can say that much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cuts come hot on the heels of multiple other rounds of layoffs and cancelations at EA over the last few years and especially in 2025. Just last month, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn"><u>laid off roughly 300 individuals</u></a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted"><u>around 100 at Respawn, while canceling an in-development Titanfall game and another incubation project</u></a>. Earlier this year, EA restructured BioWare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams"><u>moving some developers to other projects</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect"><u>laying off others</u></a>. In 2024, there was a massive restructuring at EA that resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work"><u>670 workers</u></a> laid off company-wide, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-hit-by-layoffs-amid-eas-ongoing-reductions"><u>around two dozen workers at Respawn.</u></a> And in 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs"><u>50 jobs were cut at BioWare</u></a> and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs"><u>unknown number were cut at Codemasters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA is now focusing on a small handful of franchises: Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends. It insisted it will continue with its Iron Man game at Motive and the third Star Wars: Jedi game, as well as maintain its mobile business, while Bioware works on the next Mass Effect. EA Sports, which operates the likes of FC and Madden, is a separate division to EA Entertainment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
