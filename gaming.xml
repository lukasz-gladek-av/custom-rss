            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-delayed-september<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has announced a&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>delay, with the chilly city-builder now set to arrive in September to give the devs time to respond to user feedback collected during the recent beta period.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/4203628368742496775?l=english" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>&nbsp;directors&nbsp;Jakub Stokalski and Łukasz Juszczyk say that the user feedback from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-system-requirements-beta">the game's beta</a> contained "many keen observations on areas we could improve or add to the final game".</p>
<p>The pair say that in order to do justice to the information gleaned from the beta, more development time is needed, which is why the new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>release date is September 20th, representing a delay of about two months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-delayed-city.jpg?itok=MynrmNhN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-delayed-city.jpg?itok=ltT3SD2X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>needs a little more time to cook (or should that be thaw?).</figcaption></figure><p>To placate disappointed fans, 11 bit goes into some detail regarding what's changed and what will be included in the game owing to the extra development time.</p>
<p>Several game mechanics have been tweaked to ensure a smoother&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>experience, including temperature and heat, workforce management, and the addition of a brand new resource, plus more.</p>
<p>The game's UI and UX have been enhanced in an "extensive" fashion; it'll now have a clearer HUD, a new construction menu, and more clarity and readability when it comes to the Idea Tree.</p>
<p>Another new enhancement, Zoom Stories, allows you to zoom in on your citizens and follow their individual lives, seeing what they're up to so that you can feel more connected to the lives of those who live in your city.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>will task you with building and maintaining a settlement in the midst of a harsh post-apocalyptic winter. You'll have to scavenge for supplies, manage resources and citizens, and make difficult moral decisions that will have a lasting impact on your city.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>when it arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10008442/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/frostpunk-2/9PN2K1LQN94D" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 20th.

        <p>Dare u seek the Loss fish?</p>

            <p>When the ageing, silent character you play in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/selfloss">Selfloss</a> performs a roll, it is a tumble of such poignant melancholy I spent the first five minutes of my time with its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086620/Selfloss/">Steam demo</a> just keeling about in the starting area. It’s a ponderous, pained roll, creaky and ancient. If it has i-frames, the ‘i’ stands for “I would like to not do that again for at least five minutes, please.” Each time you roll, or sprint, your character wipes beads of sweat from his brow, and you can tell the exertion is genuinely taxing. My man is exhausted. Also, surrounded by fish, both symbolic and literal.</p>

<p>After chatting to a long man, reminiscent of a stretched, ghostly goose, I reach the crest of a bright hill, and meet a very large woman with fish earrings, who points toward a stony, somewhat desolate island atop which sits a ruined fort. I climb down the cliff face, hop in a wooden boat, and off I go.</p>
<p>There’s a web-like purple mucus plant blocking my way to the island. To get rid of it, I have to shine my light staff at some globules. At the ruins, I meet my first hostile creatures: lumbering meatball folk, who you deal with using the staff’s light beam. They go down easy, but there’s still something chunkily tasty about the haptic buildup (I’m using a Dualsense) and sound swell, culminating in a popped-spot crescendo.</p>

<p>I do reckon that if you’re not using a controller, you’ll miss out on a lot of what’s great in Selfloss’s moment-to-moment. Just moving around is imbued with weight and presence and all those other words that mean “pad shake make game feel real.” There’s a touch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons">Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons</a> about it, both in the genre sense and how much is communicated through the controls. The staff can be a little tricky to line up with the fleshy nobules you need to burst to navigate the place, but the simple act of aiming it using the analogue stick feels very natural, and you can even plonk the staff down to shine at yourself, washing off any poison goop you might have got over you during traversal.</p>
<p>I shine my staff at a totem, unlock a bridge, cross it, and ungunk a whale so it may return to the sky. Next meet a big man in a hut, and learn I’m in a place called Leeway - a sort of purgatory for those not yet ready to die. The big lady I met earlier is named Marena, and she runs things here. Sometimes, she imprisons people for years to do her bidding until they’re ready to, quote, take on the form of a fish to ascend. Ah, so the big whale I freed was a trapped soul? So many mysteries, most of them fish related.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Goodwin Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I exit the hut through the back, which sends me tumbling through space. After a cryptic message about orcas, I find myself in a garden. Inside another hut, I find a note that explains what “Selfloss” means - its a ritual meant to “heal the wounds of someone who has lost a loved one”. To perform it, I’ll need an item of personal value and “the essence of the Loss fish.” I’m actually really into all this, despite the fact I can’t stop laughing at the idea of a.) a fish trying to emote the concept of bereavement and b.) the mental image of several fish arranged on a beach like ‘<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/loss">Loss</a>’.</p>
<p>I grab a backpack, a hat, and a sickle, hope in another boat, and it’s off to more adventure. I hope there’s fish and bet there will be, but I’m also very into Selfloss’s quite singular melancholic tone, and how it contrasts with what’s a fairly easy-going experience so far. Something you could play when you’re physically exhausted, and perhaps want to get spirituality exhausted too. Still, there’s undoubtedly some loveliness nestled underneath all the meatball demons and gunk. It’s got its fishhooks in me for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-remaster-comparison/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the first Dead Rising Remaster comparison videos has been released, comparing 2006's Dead Rising to the upcoming Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster.</p>
<p>Totally out of the blue, Capcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a 'remaster' of 2006's Dead Rising yesterday in the form of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. Going by the announcement trailer, however, we're looking more at a remake of the 2006 game as the visual upgrades are quite major, and the game's main protagonist has seemingly underwent some kind of makeover.</p>
<p>Following the announcement trailer, YouTube channel '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSMt2Sn7mXo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>' released a comparison video, which clearly shows the vastly improved visuals. Then ago, it also shows how Frank West&nbsp; has been waiting for this remaster and aged around 20 to 30 years. Going by the comments under the video, fans of the game clearly aren't happy with the "new" Frank in the remaster. Check out the comparison video below and tell us what you think.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster | Original vs Remaster | Teaser Trailer Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OSMt2Sn7mXo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is slating a release on the "new generation" platforms sometime later this year. Likely, we're looking at a PS5 and Xbox Series X\S release, and hopefully, PC as well. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the game.</p>
<p>We've included some details about the 2006 version of the game below (from the official press release back then):</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising features an open level of freedom and offers a vast array of gameplay possibilities. As part of a real time system, time is dynamic in Dead Rising, marching on whether Frank is actively engaged or if simply stationary. Time also plays a role as zombies become more powerful when the sun goes down. Though they move slowly during the day, the zombies become stronger and faster at night, making it even more dangerous for players to survive. The unprecedented numbers of enemies come in never-ending waves and consist of a diverse population of former humans that have retained some memory of their previous lives, which is reflected in their behaviour and appearance. The variety of different stores in the mall offers players an endless supply of resources including vehicles, makeshift weapons and more. Players will also encounter other survivors along the way and by helping them can acquire valuable clues as to what has happened.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186582/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-torrent-scared<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="uxLfg9">There is nothing better than a trusty steed. Every adventurer needs a creature who can ride into the depths of hell and back and serve as a constant source of support throughout the trials and tribulations of becoming a hero. But as the new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a><em> </em>DLC reminds us, every creature has its limits. And now even Torrent — the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22957071/elden-ring-torrent-ultimate-horse-companion">ride-or-die horsey of the Tarnished</a> — can’t take it anymore, and he won’t be summoned in a particular region of the game. </p>
<p id="ZupqqN">FromSoftware released <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> on June 21. The extensive expansion adds loads of new super-tough boss fights, enemies, and new regions to explore. One of such spots includes the Abyssal Woods, a hazy forrest imbued with darkness at every turn. It turns the creepy dial way up and apparently, it’s too much for poor old Torrent. If you walk into the woods while riding the mount, your ghost horse will disappear and the game flashes the following text: “The spectral steed is frightened and cannot be summoned.” In other words, Torrent won’t let you ride him in the ominous woods. </p>

<p id="S3TEEV">The moment took many players by surprise. Just a single clip of Torrent disappearing got more than 211,000 views on TikTok. The is the same summon who was willing to face all the evils of the base game with you — there’s a literal <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">lord of blood</a> who looks like a beast from hell. The most-liked reply the viral video above said, “how is the horse scared of this but bro looks at elden beast with 0 fears.”</p>
<p id="YOBqae">Look, I don’t get it, but I won’t judge. Maybe Torrent wanted to leave before, but he just didn’t work up the guts. The entire woods is basically like the horror section of <em>Erdtree,</em> and it would be a lot easier if Torrent were there to race players past the creepy, skulking Aged Ones. Regardless, it looks like the Tarnished will have to figure out this challenge on their own. </p>
<p id="S4gcFO"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is available to play on PlayStation 5 and Windows PC. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/frostpunkgame/status/1806266817972699510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, the Frostpunk 2 team announced that the game’s anticipated release is now delayed until September 20, 2024.</p>



<p>During the Xbox partner preview showcase last March, Frostpunk 2 previously <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/frostpunk-2-july-release-date-announced-at-xbox-partner-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got a release date</a> for July 25, 2024. However, the devs offered a lengthy explanation for their decision.</p>



<p>In today’s post, the team cites a combination of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/frostpunk-2-gets-beta-and-new-gameplay-deep-dive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent Beta’s</a> feedback, and “the existing backlog of features.” Fans quickly supported the decision, dedication, and communication of the team. </p>



<p>The devs added that “we believe that these additional features are something you deserve to see in-game from day one, not in a patch added after the release.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just over two months ago, you had the chance to play the Beta, and we greatly appreciate the feedback you shared with us. Your observations, along with the existing backlog of features that we were already working on, made us realize that we can prioritize things better to… <a href="https://t.co/iTMG3853DG">pic.twitter.com/iTMG3853DG</a></p>— Frostpunk 2 (@frostpunkgame) <a href="https://twitter.com/frostpunkgame/status/1806266817972699510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In a corresponding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/4203628368742496775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on Steam</a>, the developers also specified which features they plan to improve. </p>



<p>That includes key gameplay changes affecting temperature, workforce management, direct-use abilities, protest mechanics, and even a new resource. There will also be improved UI and UX, such as the HUD and easy visibility. </p>



<p>Lastly, the devs explained that Frostpunk 2 will now get a “Zoom Stories” feature. This allows players to zoom in and watch citizens’ everyday life.</p>



<p>The Steam post says that “we’ve only mentioned a fraction of it,” so there will be other improvements before launch.</p>



<p>Frostpunk 2 will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S when it releases in September 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-no-shame-in-playing-elden-ring-in-co-op<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Elden Ring fans are divided on Shadow of the Erdtree's difficulty, but there should be no questions about whether or not it's right to rely on the game's online co-op.</h2></div><section><p>If you’re finding yourself struggling against one of Shadow of the Erdtree’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hardest-bosses-ranked">many difficult bosses</a>, you shouldn’t be afraid to call for a little back-up.</p><p>Since the launch of Shadow of the Erdtree, there has been a lot of talk about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-down-to-mixed-on-steam-as-players-complain-about-the-difficulty-and-performance">how difficult the DLC is</a> proving with director Hidetaka Miyazaki even admitting that the developers were trying to push players past their limits with this new DLC. Having beaten the DLC during the review window, I absolutely agree that FromSoftware is trying to do different things with Shadow of the Erdtree, making players think differently when it comes to challenging bosses.</p><p>I changed my build and I re-spec’d my character multiple times during my playthrough, and in the back of my mind I kept thinking, “maybe I’ll have to hold off beating the DLC until it launches and I can get some help with fighting [Redacted].”</p><p>In the end I did finish the DLC before the review embargo went up, but instead of jumping to start a new game, I’ve been camping around some of the bosses I had the most trouble with during my time beating the game — mainly Rellana, the Twin Knight, and Messmer the Impaler — to leave behind my summon sign and help new players on their quest through the Elden Ring DLC. It’s a lesson I learned from a dear friend of mine, Solaire, the jolly co-operator from the very first Dark Souls game whose incandescent aura was meant to teach players that co-op in Dark Souls isn’t just a tool, but a divine calling.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/03/09/solaire-switch-1520621950357.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>I miss you, man.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The frequency in which I’m getting called in to help someone fight a boss, I think, proves how little issue most players have with summoning online players to help. And one of my close friends playing the DLC now is trying to do so without any summons at all, NPC or otherwise, for their first playthrough which is also a valid way to play. But to anyone saying that summoning an online player or even an NPC to help with a boss is somehow “cheating” is ridiculous, and furthermore, plain wrong.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If online co-op is such a shameful thing in a FromSoftware game, why introduce it in Dark Souls through one of the best characters to ever grace a Souls game?</p></div><p>The hardliners calling for there to be only one “right” way of playing a FromSoftware game — without NPC or online co-op — can’t be easily dismissed. I’ve seen enough comments online from new players struggling with a boss but too scared to ask for any kind of help because they believe it’s wrong, when in fact it is a part of the FromSoftware experience woven into the genre itself.</p><p>To return back to Solaire, if online co-op were such a shameful thing in a FromSoftware game, why introduce it in Dark Souls through one of the best characters to ever grace a Souls game? The knight Solaire and his willingness to help players defeat the game’s toughest bosses is one of the earliest and most enduring memes to come out of Dark Souls, but shouldn’t overshadow his lesson of cooperating with others to overcome great challenges.</p><p>But more than that, co-op in any FromSoftware game is a new dimension to the experience. Playing with others against particularly hard bosses, especially on higher New Game Plus difficulties, is no walk in the park, and there’s a dread of seeing your summoned partner die part way through the fight. Or on the flip-side, overpowering a boss with a partner, unleashing chaotic combos and massive damage is an experience that’s too rare in a FromSoftware game too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There’s also the learning aspect of co-op. Even if your party ends up wiping against a boss, you might learn a new tactic or strategy from your summoned partner that you can then take into the boss by yourself, learning from an online stranger like an apprentice learns from a mysterious master.</p><p>Miyazaki is adamant about several things, that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-says-making-elden-ring-easier-would-break-the-game-as-shadow-of-the-erdtree-launches">making Elden Ring easier would ruin the game</a>, and that FromSoftware is a studio that enjoys designing challenging and difficult games. But as FromSoft fans also know, nothing the team does is ever done without reason, and that is precisely why co-op and summons have been a mainstay in every FromSoftware SoulsLike since Demon’s Souls. It is as much a part of FromSoftware’s DNA as a poison swamp.</p><p>I believe the guiding philosophy of FromSoftware when it comes to difficulty is that all the tools to beat one of its games are readily available. It’s all a matter of how you want to go about it. If you’re finding yourself coming close to beating a boss but not making it over the final third of its health bar, maybe a few more hours of grinding for levels will help. If you find that the weapon you used for most of your game is suddenly coming up short, there’s likely a stronger version of your favorite weapon hiding somewhere nearby. There are also <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring">plenty of guides online</a> you can use.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It is as much a part of FromSoftware’s DNA as a poison swamp.</p></div><p>And if you’ve exhausted all the options above, there’s no reason you can’t look around for a golden summon sign to call on a little help from an unknown friend online. Think back to the early days of Elden Ring when the hardest boss in the game was Malenia, Blade of Miquella. FromSoftware often makes some of its games’ hardest bosses optional and there’s a chance that if Malenia was mandatory, many people would never have finished the game. Thankfully, a naked, pot-headed warrior named ‘LetMeSoloHer’ ushered many a player to the promised land (beating Malenia).</p><p>Ultimately, the FromSoftware community is a joyous and collaborative one at its core. Reddits house lore hounds who share secrets freely with one another, trading theories on different character backstories. Build guides are made so players can learn how to create their perfect characters, and nothing beats summoning a partner, trading the customary gesture like the bow or wave, and heading into the fog gate together.</p><p><em>Matt T.M.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/retrospective-a-producer-s-guide-to-team-buy-in<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Image via Pexels user fauxels.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Intro">Intro</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A game producer facilitates an efficient work environment by assigning tasks, clearing blockers, and planning schedules. However, all this work can fall by the wayside if the team isn’t invested in the vision of the game. But, in an industry full of creative and passionate minds, how do you get everyone’s interests aligned? The answer varies from team-to-team, there is no one way to establish a strong team culture, and that’s the fun of it!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Below, I reflect on my experience leading production on a 47-person carnival themed arcade racing game named </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fastival</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. More specifically, on three ways in which my team modified the physical space of a studio to increase team morale and productivity.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Room Layout">Room Layout</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One challenge when discussing room layout (in the context of game development) is the need to balance collaboration and distraction. How do you create a space in which people can easily work with one another, but not get in each other’s way? This question was on the top of my mind when it came time to restructure our studio’s space. Like a mad chemist, I spent a lot of time considering various special compositions. Who would work best with each other? What departments needed to be near one another? Which developers were the most talkative, which were quiet? Finally, I decided on a layout (pictured below) and proudly unveiled it to the team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The three Track teams each had their own table in the center of the room. I placed them in the middle of the space because the track team was essentially the glue pulling the artist and programmers together. I placed the Race Logic team, who worked on lap counters and player positions with the UI team, so that the UI team could have assistance in getting their blueprints hooked up to art assets. I could go on and on, but you get the point- it made sense, it was efficient, it fit the team, or so I thought. This ended up being the worst milestone the team experienced throughout the game’s development. While this room layout is not the sole reason for the disappointing milestone, I knew something needed to change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And so, moving into the next sprint (Alpha), I dusted off my Photoshop skills and tried my hand rearranging the room- again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key driving difference between the first layout and this new one was the focus on the team’s wants and needs. The three Track teams did not enjoy making tracks on an “island” – isolated away from other track designers. The designers enjoyed playtesting and comparing ideas with one another, so I placed the teams right next to each other. At Alpha, the artists had started to shift from proxies to textured assets, the look of the game was taking shape. Consequently, I moved the artists to the middle of the room where the whole team could walk by and admire the game’s visual progress. Did the physics team need to walk a bit further to talk to the track designers? Absolutely- but it didn't matter because the designers were happier (and as a result, productive) in their new location.&nbsp;The new layout paid off. The Alpha milestone was our most successful milestone and proved to be instrumental in us getting greenlit to publish on Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, it would be extremely naïve and arrogant to say my swapping of a few tables fixed every issue we had previously encountered. It definitely didn’t. Although, in the fast-paced atmosphere that is game development every bit of productivity counts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I thought I had created the lean-mean productivity machine in my first layout. However, by gaining a pulse on the team, and being willing to adapt to their needs, we came up with a new solution that wasn’t as productive at face value, but ultimately saw the most success. The mutually beneficial space we created not only made work more fun but built a foundation of trust that aligned the team’s goals for the game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Decorate">Decorate</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another great way to enhance physical space is to fill it with decorations to celebrate the team’s progress. This is a very practical yet often overlooked step. The team and I were so busy with other priorities that we let this slip. The room was empty and stagnant. This atmosphere bled into the team culture as our studio became a place where we just “clocked-in, clocked-out” rather than a space where we were creating something fun. This became even more of an issue when considering we were creating a vibrant and energetic carnival themed game. Our own studio did not reflect the product we were creating, and as a result members of the team began to lose faith in the game. Realizing this needed to change, I took it upon myself to make a trip to Party City. I’ll be honest, I was pessimistic. The idea of decorating seemed juvenile, especially given the carnival theme. Nonetheless, I found some party flags, banners and streamers, and with some help from teammates decorated the studio before the team came in the next day. I was shocked how such a small change made such a big difference. People lit up when they entered the studio for the first time. Suddenly the room itself was an embodiment of the game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fastival</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I played videos of various carnivals from around the world on the screens in the studio, it felt like we were in a completely new space. This decorative pass brought a second wind of energy to the team and played perfectly with the lighthearted spirit we were replicating in our game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Projecting Progress">Projecting Progress</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This doesn’t apply to just decorations, however. As we got closer to our Launch deadline and the work was waning, so was the energy of the team. This was a delicate situation to navigate as we needed to make a final push to get our game across the finish line, however the last thing I wanted to do was create a crunch culture and tarnish the team dynamic in the final moments. As lead producer I knew the tasks that needed to be done to get our game to the best quality possible, but I wanted to present those tasks in an engaging way. In response, I created a swim lane chart listing the high-level priorities. I projected this chart onto several walls around the studio. The chart was a living document, so as tasks were completed, I could move them through the various stages of production.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The chart served as a physical marker of progress, and a reminder that their hard work was contributing to the success of the game. To prevent this chart from becoming a stress inducer, and encouraging crunch, we gamified the process. Every time a task was moved from “In-Progress” to “Complete”, I would announce it, move the task on the screen, and the whole team watched and celebrated the accomplishments.&nbsp; It was a small thing but making it a part of the studio environment not only focused the team on the highest priority items, but also gave them something tangible to rally behind. This all culminated in a great moment when on the final day of development, we were left with 0 remaining “To-Do” and “In-Progress” tasks. The collective joy shared by the team in that moment will stay with me for a long time.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is no one way to cultivate a cohesive team and generate buy-in. Hopefully this blog gave insight into very small things you as a producer can do to break up the monotony, engage the team, and make a space in which people enjoy coming to work.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Capcom has announced its digital showcase - Capcom Next - will take place next week.</p>
<p>The broadcast will last for 25 minutes, and provide us with updates on Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (which is slated to release next month, on 19th July) and Resident Evil 7's move to iPhone/iPad and Mac.</p>
<p>The highlight of this show, however, will surely be the first look at Capcom's Dead Rising remaster, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-slapstick-zombie-mall-adventure-dead-rising-is-being-remastered">announced quite out of the blue last night</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/showcase/next/en-us/">showcase</a> will air at 11pm UK time on 1st July, across Capcom's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p7hiMS0Hct4">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/capcomusa">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/capcomusa/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@capcom">TikTok</a> platforms. It will not include any updates on Monster Hunter Wilds, the studio has said.</p>
<p>As for that Dead Rising remaster, the studio has billed it as "an updated release with a brand new look", and coming to "newest generation of platforms". Capcom is yet to share a launch date for the upcoming release, but perhaps we will find this out next week.</p>
<p>Eurogamer rather liked Dead Rising when the game made its original debut all the way back in 2006.</p>
<p>"It may not be licensed by George A. Romero," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-deadrising-x360">wrote Tom Bramwell at the time</a>, "but it was certainly inspired by him, and it replicates a lot of the feelings he inspired in the viewer. And as I plunge yet another sickle into someone's neck and jerk their head off with my foot, showering myself in blood, I can't help but think that he'd rather approve of it."</p>
<p>
Hopefully this remaster will evoke a similar sentiment.</p> <div>

<p>We were introduced to an exciting Zelda game during this month’s Nintendo Direct. For the first time in the franchise’s history, players will step into the shoes of Princess Zelda, offering a fresh and unique perspective. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, set to release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-september-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 26, 2024</a>, and is now available for pre-order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested players can pre-order The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo Store</a> or other retailers such as <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom--nintendo-switch/411895.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameStop</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch/6509219.p?skuId=6509219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>. The base game will cost $59.99, with no pre-order bonuses or special editions available. This means you won’t miss out on anything if you decide to pick up the game on release day.&nbsp;But, if you want to play the game on launch day, pre-ordering is the way to go, as the stocks might end up being sold out at certain retailers. Players will also have the option to redeem Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers while pre-ordering from the Nintendo Store.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will follow a similar art style as The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening. Zelda has been tasked with helping people who are being kidnapped through strange rifts. Among the kidnapped is a certain swordsman she needs to find, too. Zelda and her companion, fairy Tri, must use the Tri Rod to create Echoes to overcome all obstacles. Echoes are the new gameplay feature that can imitate objects in the environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Echoes can be water blocks, old beds or even rocks; players must find all types of echoes and understand how they can be used to get around Hyrule. With the help of these imitations, you will need to solve puzzles and defeat enemies that come your way. As with all the Zelda titles, there will be a lot of creative freedom as players can think up their combinations with all types of varying Echoes to get further in the story.&nbsp;</p>

These ogres were known to cause no end of problems for the humans they came upon, leading them to be feared and hated, regarded as monsters and demons.</p><p>One day, a trio of soon-to-be folk heroes named Momotaro, Kintaro, and Issuntaro decided enough was enough, and set foot upon the land from whence the ogres came: Onigashima. Their goal was to confront the ogres on their own turf and take them down once and for all… and so they did.</p><p>After a long struggle, Momotaro and his crew successfully defeated the leader of the ogres: the beautiful yet dreaded Iroha (CV: Yukari Tamura). And with Iroha’s defeat, the ogres themselves fell to ruin, and peace once again reigned for humanity. Momotaro, Kintaro, and Issuntaro were heralded as heroes, and they all lived happily ever after…</p><p>Or did they?!</p><p>Tokyo, present day.</p><p>Iroha, having used an ancient technique for reincarnation upon herself just moments before her demise, has lived many lives in many forms. Finally, after nearly giving up hope, she discovers the last surviving ogres: a trio of sisters bearing the name of their ancient homeland, Onigashima. She (or, now, he, as a male cat) raises them as her/his own, strictly teaching them the ways of the sword so that one day, s/he may lead them into battle against Momotaro and reclaim the ogres’ rightful place in society.</p><p>And fortunately for them, Momotaro is indeed still out there! Specifically, a guy named Momotaro—who happens to be a 37th generation descendant of the original—just so happens to have been toiling day in and day out as a host in the red light district, and has finally reached his breaking point. He has PLANS now, and suffice it to say, they’re not exactly folk-heroic!</p><p>So, hey, this was supposed to just be a petty revenge story, but with Momotaro suddenly turning evil due to systemic depression, maybe the ogres can actually be the good guys this time around! Lucky… them, I guess?</p><p>What even IS this story, anyway?!</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Playable Characters</strong><ul><li><strong>Ran</strong> (voiced by Yoko Hikasa) – The middle sister. Always has a sword at the ready. Innately controls fire, so many of her techniques are fire-related. More of a doer than a thinker, Ran is the type who will hit first and ask questions later. Comes across as stoic but reliable.</li><li><strong>Hana</strong> (voiced by Ayumi Takeishi) – The eldest sister. Armed with a whip and a longbow. Don’t let her gentle voice and calm-seeming personality fool you: she’s 100 percent sadist. If you cross a line with her, she’ll mess you right up. Generally serious and confident, she’s nonetheless the voice of reason among the three.</li><li><strong>Yume</strong> (voiced by Hina Kino) – The youngest sister. <a title="Games > Outward [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outward">Outward</a>ly flaunts her metal club, but also has bombs at the ready. Does not think things through, ever. She acts purely on instinct at all times. Educated through games and anime rather than textbooks, with expected results. Lures you in with her cuteness, but then absolutely demolishes you with words and weapons alike as you approach. Most definitely hazardous to your health.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Non-Playable Characters</strong><ul><li><strong>Iroha</strong> (voiced by Shigeru Chiba) – Legal (?) guardian of the three Onigashima sisters, and general chief of their operations. Possesses the reincarnated soul of the ogre leader who died hundreds of years prior. Struggles every day to raise his charges as true ogres, teaching them everything s/he knows. Yet, in the end, is still just a cat.</li><li><strong>Momotaro</strong> (voiced by Yoji Ueda) – Momotaro the 37th (Momotaro XXXVII?). Presently works as the #1 host in Kabukicho. Though probably not for much longer, all things considered! Basically, he’s the last boss. He’s had enough of the host life, and now wants to try his hand at being a supervillain. Turns out, he’s well suited to the role!</li><li><strong>And Many More, such as…</strong><ul><li><strong>Tsuru no Ongaeshi</strong> – The Vengeful Crane.</li><li><strong>Urashima Taro</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>System</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Story Mode</strong> – Select from the three Onigashima sisters and challenge main missions and side missions as the tale progresses, leveling up and earning items and money (to spend on items via online shopping, of course!) that help teach you new skills and toughen your stats for the inevitable face-off against Momotaro! Between each mission, listen to witty and often fourth wall-breaking banter among the girls, their cat guardian Iroha, and a wide variety of villains. This story doesn’t take itself very seriously, and neither should you! Just kick back and enjoy the ride!</li><li><strong>Cooperative <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [341 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a></strong> – Up to three players at once can join the fray in this chaotic frenzy of a mode, wherein a number of enemies not seen anywhere else can be encountered, and a vast fortune can be earned through contiguous beatdowns and massively one-sided fights (I mean, it’s three of you against one boss enemy! OF COURSE you’re going to kick yokai tail!).</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A new Elusive Target has entered Hitman's world of assassination, as players will have a month to take on the MMA Legend Conor McGregor. The former UFC champion will be playing The Disruptor, a notorious fighter who has risen to the top of the ranks and has a past shrouded in mystery. Pay no attention to the giant "McGregor" tattoo on his abdomen.</p><p>The Elusive Target can be found on Hitman 2's Isle of Sgàil, a secret refuge for the world's billionaires, and tasks Agent 47 with eliminating McGregor so that amateur MMA fighter--and Quantum Leap CEO--Tim Quinn doesn't suffer a brutal beatdown when he steps into the ring.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmlfSLcdDAU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HmlfSLcdDAU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This mission will be free to play for everyone through a free starter pack in The Ostentatious--an Arcade contract featuring The Disruptor Elusive Target. You'll be tasked with completing multiple missions that escalate in difficulty, and if you fail, progress will restart from the first level and the contract will be locked for 12 hours. There'll also be new premium DLC featuring cosmetics inspired by McGregor.</p><p>Elusive Target missions are one of the more-challenging modes in Hitman. The people marked for death don't show up as a red silhouette when you search for them using Agent 47's instinct vision, so you have to find them, observe their patterns, and wait to perfectly execute your plan to take them down. This isn't the first time that players have had a chance to take down a celebrity, as shortly after the release of Hitman 2, a character modeled on and voiced by actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-still-kill-sean-bean-in-hitman-2/1100-6463369/" data-ref-id="1100-6463369">Sean Bean</a> was inserted into the game.

		<p>In life, the simple things are best. A peaceful walk through an autumnal forest, eating a melted marshmallow fresh and squishy from the barbecue, a classic Victoria sponge cake. When it comes to video games, the same life rule applies; and what better example than the old-school arcade racer? Thrills, spills, and no more complexity than going eye-dissolvingly fast in a mostly straight line. Horizon Chase 2 is the epitome of this ideology, it also has amongst the best local multiplayer features I’ve ever encountered.</p>
<p><iframe title="Horizon Chase 2 Launch Trailer | Out Now on PlayStation 4 &amp; 5 and Xbox Series &amp; One" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B_kr1WraP5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Horizon Chase 2 is the sequel to the 2018 original, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/31/horizon-chase-turbo-review/">Horizon Chase Turbo</a>, and it shares a great deal with its forebear – bright and bold 90’s visuals, easy-to-pick-up controls, and crazy fast top speeds. This then, is the most traditional of sequels: mostly more of the same, but bigger and better.</p>


<p>The visuals are an example of this design approach, having seen a noticeable improvement in detail, though thankfully retaining their charming old-school aesthetic. Whilst the array of vehicles is more limited than in the original game, they can each now be upgraded to a far greater extent, as well as being customisable. Swap out the tires, change the chassis, or splash out on some new paint – these options are hardly going to give Forza a run for its money but they are a neat addition.</p>


<p>I must say, the choice of available vehicles all play it rather straight. I found myself missing the comical cars like the Learner-Driver, the Camper-Van, and the Handy-Man Sedan. Perhaps these lighter-hearted mobiles will be released as DLC, but for the moment players are stuck with the sportiest of sports cars and little else.</p>
<p>Track design meanwhile, benefits from weather effects and more varied courses. The track will split into divergent paths before combining a little while later, whilst the cars can be battered by a passing sand storm. New pick-ups add a shade of complexity too; boosts litter the track, and nitro can be gained in segments rather than in one power-up. Also, players rejoice, no more fuel meter! Getting rid of this abomination was a smart move on behalf of the developers, lowering a big hurdle for new and young gamers alike. Now, rather than worrying about collecting fuel, players can just focus on the fun of going very fast.</p>
<p>And what speeds Horizon Chase 2 reaches! This is a super-slick game with an eye-wateringly fast frame rate to match, and the visual velocity is kept up even in four-player split screen.</p>

<p>There is far more online functionality this time out, which is a welcome addition, but it’s in local multiplayer that Horizon Chase 2 belongs. Along with regular races and tournaments, other players can easily drop into any event throughout the extensive world tour mode. They can even help out whilst racing, gathering collectibles that all go towards the primary player’s overall progress. Helping out your kid unlock a brand-new vehicle is one of those special multiplayer moments that Horizon Chase 2 has in droves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-update-adds-options-to-change-console-graphics-settings<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Capcom has released another update for Dragon's Dogma 2 across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>While the majority of adjustments have been made across all devices, the team has also added some console specific updates with this patch. It has now added the option for those on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S to change graphics settings to high or low, as well as the option to turn 120Hz output on or off.</p>
<p>Capcom said turning graphics settings down to low on consoles should improve Dragon's Dogma 2's frame rates, adding: "Further frame rate improvements are planned for future updates as well."</p>
<p>As for that 120hz option, Capcom stated while this setting "does not guarantee 120fps", it "may make the game display more smoothly" should your monitor support it.</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition to the above, this update takes aim at a number of the usual bugs and fixes across the board. For example, players will no longer be able to enter areas they weren't meant to be able to, and the prices for precious stones in Vermund should now be correct.</p>
<p>It has also added the function to sell items from the storage menu and the option to turn the Arisen's visibility on or off in photo mode.</p> <div>

<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 has been a hit for Capcom, with the game selling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-sells-25m-as-fixed-frame-rate-arrives">2.5m copies in under two weeks after its release</a>. Back in April, the company actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-success-boosts-capcoms-expected-profits">revised its full-year earnings forecast</a> following this success, combined with the success of its other popular releases over the last year.</p>
<p>The game is "a huge improvement over the original, and a captivating journey from beginning to end," reads Eurogamer's five star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-review">Dragon's Dogma 2 review</a>.</p>

        <p>Developer aims to use these tools to produce dynamic interaction between objects</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Roblox is working towards providing players the ability to create characters and objects with "4D generative AI".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/06/robloxs-road-to-4d-generative-ai">recent post to its blog</a>, the developer explained that 4D generative AI will focus on interactivity when creating people, objects, and environments.</p>
<p>These 4D generative AI tools aim to make 3D objects more dynamic by using generative AI text or voice prompts to create a drivable race car, for example.</p>
<p>"With 4D generative AI, Roblox has opened up a new frontier for experience and asset creation," the developer explained. "While the challenges are new, our process for innovation is well honed.</p>
<p>"We will combine our internal research and development teams, university collaborations, and rapid iteration of prototypes in partnership with our community."</p>
<p>Last year, <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>spoke to Roblox CTO Daniel Sturman <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/robloxs-top-tech-officer-talks-ai">about its conversational AI tool Roblox Assistant,</a> and how the company intended to use generative AI across various aspects of its platform.</p>

            <p>
The release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has reawakened the typical Soulsborne debate around high difficulty, but even the game's creator struggled to play it.
</p>
<p>
In an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Guardian</a>, FromSoftware's Hidetaka Miyazaki discussed playing Elden Ring in the run up to Shadow of the Erdtree but struggled as he's not a very good player.
</p>
<p>
"Leading up to the release of any game, I'll be very hands-on playing it and getting as much time on it as much as possible," he said. "But after the release, I tend to not want to touch it, because I know I'm going to either find things that I left on the table or issues that will bug me. And once I become a player, I'm powerless to do anything significant to change it. So once a game is out in the wild, I tend to not play."

<p>
He continued: "But in preparation for Shadow of the Erdtree, I played through the main story of Elden Ring. I want to preface this by saying I absolutely suck at video games, so my approach or play style was to use everything I have at my disposal, all the assistance, every scrap of aid that the game offers, and also all the knowledge that I have as the architect of the game ... the freedom and open-world nature of Elden Ring perhaps lowered the barrier to entry, and I might be the one who's benefiting the most from that, as a player, more than anyone else."
</p>
<p>
As an open world game, Elden Ring is more approachable than previous FromSoftware games, and provides players with plenty of options to help: be that co-operative play, extra summons, or simply wandering off to grind for runes. And if Miyazaki is relying on these features to finish the game, so can you.
</p>
<p>
It is somewhat amusing, however, that Miyazaki conjures these dark, terrifying worlds for players to battle in, but struggles to play them himself. No wonder he admitted to being a "huge masochist" in a <a href="http://soulslore.wikidot.com/das1-game-no-shokutaku#toc0">previous interview</a>.

</p>
<p>
"There are some areas that are designed to be funny and with humour in mind, but I think a lot of the time things we try to take seriously or try to approach from a serious or dark place tend to get construed as humour," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-on-originating-the-soulslike-genre">later told Eurogamer</a>. "But it's not a calculated thing, we don't set out to make a lot of these games and characters funny. I think it is just interpreted this way and is construed in that way due to the player and the environment they're playing in. A lot of it is not intentional."

</p>
<p>
Legendary player <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-legend-let-me-solo-her-is-back-but-with-a-new-name">Let Me Solo Her has now returned for Shadow of the Erdtree</a> to help players struggling with bosses, so look out for a summon sign if you're struggling.

</p>
<p>
FromSoftware also released an update for the game this week that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">adjusts the balance scaling of Shadow Blessings</a>, which should make the DLC a little easier.

            <p>Development on slip-slidey <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tribes-3-rivals">Tribes 3: Rivals</a> is set to slow, just months after its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tribes-3-rivals-is-out-in-early-access-now-for-another-shot-at-making-tribes-popular">early access launch</a>, as developers Prophecy Games say it’s not proving successful enough to "support the studio."</p>
<p>In a post ominously titled "<a href="https://www.tribes3rivals.com/news/tribes-3-player-update">Tribes 3 Player Update</a>", Prophecy first announced that anyone who’d paid up microtransaction money in Rivals – as well as their previous game, extraction shooter Starsiege: Deadzone – would receive an equal amount of credit to spend in their upcoming "sports shooter" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2950580/Ultra_Strikers/">Ultra Strikers</a>. Then, the bitter chaser: both Deadzone and Tribes 3 will go on the backburner, while Ultra Strikers becomes the studio’s main effort.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"These credits are meant to give back to players who supported us in early development", the post reads. "We’re doing our best to support Tribes 3 with limited updates (along with an upcoming discount sale to bring in more players), and plan to return to Starsiege Deadzone once the company has the resources, but unfortunately neither game had enough success yet to support the studio and can’t be our main development focus right now (as much as we love them).</p>
<p>"Thank you for your support. Going forward, we’ll continue to focus on updating existing games as much as we can, while creating new games players enjoy. We love making games, we love playing games, and thanks again for giving our games a shot and being part of the community!"</p>
<p>It's true that Tribes 3 didn’t launch into the same cult hit status as previous Tribeseses – according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2687970/charts/#max">SteamDB</a>, its daily playercount dropped into the low hundreds within days of its early access release back in March. But it’s hard to see a way forward now that its remaining players can only expect small, sporadic updates at best.</p>

<p>I don’t mind admitting: this one stings, friends. Tribes 3 might have launched without much meat on the bones, with the combined-arms bombast of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tribes-ascend">Tribes: Ascend</a> looking a long way off, but I could see and feel it improving with several of its earlier patches. Especially the updates to the series’ signature skiing movement, which did eventually deliver the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/notes-from-the-tribes-3-rivals-playtest-its-fun-but-is-it-tribes">sense of breakneck pace I was hoping for</a>. Unfortunately, the game’s chances of riding that momentum into a new era of movement shooteriness seem slimmer than ever.</p>
<p>For many, that may not be a surprising outcome: certain sections of the Tribes fandom are famously suspicious of attempts to make a new version of the thing they like. In hindsight, maybe I too should have hardened my heart, given Ascend’s grim fate. But then isn’t there another way of looking at this? I waited a decade for more Tribes, and even if it wasn’t finished, and even if it was for only for a matter of weeks, <em>I had it</em>. Sometimes, letting yourself be hurt again isn’t an entirely bad thing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A new update on the upcoming Street Fighter movie has revealed that it will be released in 2026, despite the project losing its directors.</p>



<p>In an update to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date-despite-reportedly-losing-directors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Sony Pictures confirmed that the movie will be released on March 20, 2026, but the company did not reveal who will now direct it. </p>



<p>So far, all we know about the project is that it’s being produced alongside Street Fighter publisher and developer Capcom, with directors Danny and Michael Philippou walking away from the project due to scheduling. </p>



<p>There has yet to be any official announcements on who will be cast in the film.</p>



<p>Street Fighter has already had two films, which were perceived pretty poorly by audiences. The 1994 film was given a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1058516-street_fighter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">20% audience score</a> on the&nbsp;review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes but did accumulate $100 million at the box office though on an estimated $35 million budget. 2009’s Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li didn’t fair much better either with audience ratings, coming in at <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/street_fighter_the_legend_of_chun_li" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">18%</a>.</p>



<p>It’s unclear when we will get more updates on the upcoming movie, but with less than two years until its intended release date, information could trickle through soon.</p>

        <p>Xbox is the most popular controller among players, according to Valve</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>More players are choosing to use a controller while playing games on Steam, according to Valve.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4142827237888316811">update issued by Valve</a>, it found that since 2018 daily average controller use has increased from 5% to 15%, with 42% of these sessions involving Steam Input, which allows players to use different types of controllers.</p>
<p>There are over 300 supported controllers that players can use on Steam. Valve found that the Xbox controller is the most popular choice, with players opting to use that in 59% of sessions compared to 26% for PlayStation controllers and 10% on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Steam recently added support for a new wireless Hori controller, which is officially licensed by Valve and is fully compatible with the platform on desktop and Steam Deck. It's set to launch on October 31 in Japan, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-official-steam-controller-is-on-the-way-yes-for-real/1100-6524544/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">GameSpot</a>.</p>

		<p>Capcom has announced a mini summer showcase, with Capcom Next: Summer 2024 set to take place on 1st July at 11PM UK time (3PM PDT). The stream will run for 25 minutes and focus on three upcoming game releases.</p>
<p>Capcom has already confirmed what they will be showing off, so don’t <em>expect</em> many huge announcements, but you can still keep your fingers crossed for some surprises.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p7hiMS0Hct4">watch the stream when it goes live on YouTube here</a>.</p>


<p>They will explore the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/26/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-announced-by-capcom/">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a>, which was announced yesterday and promises “a brand new look” for the newest generation of consoles.</p>

<p>There will also be updates on Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, which launches on July 19. The game looks to be an interesting fusion of strategy and action as players escort a Spirit Stone Maiden through the world, trying to cleanse villages and then enlist rescued people to fight back against the Seethe. Here’s the most recent gameplay trailer:</p>

<p>Rounding things out, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> for iPhone, iPad and Mac will also be shown during the stream. Capcom has ported Resident Evil Village and Resident Evil 4 to Apple’s platforms in the last few years – Village first arrived for Mac in 2022 before it and RE4 were ported across in late 2023 after the launch of the iPhone 15 Pro. It’s only this latest Pro model phone that is powerful enough to handle AAA games of this scale, while the minimum for Mac and iPad is to have an M1 chip, which first debuted in 2020.</p>

            <p>You will be able to arrogantly ignore the advice of your wife and councillors in whole new ways in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>, thanks to a small but mighty update to the game's message settings. Players are due to be given much more granular control over what scrolls and missives appear on their troubled monarch's war table, thanks to the free update that will accompany the Roads To Power DLC. Paradox talk about this and other upcoming changes (including a new start date) in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/?emclan=103582791465554434&amp;emgid=4188991669958508422">update post on Steam</a>. Some rulers among you will be excited by all the Byzantine bureaucracy that will headline the DLC. But real kings care about filtering information in extremely picky detail. Still don't know why this is big Crusader Kings news? Come with me, you insolent wretch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Customisable message settings is an oft-requested feature by CKIII players. If you have ever juggled organizing a feast in the castle with a war in Andalusia and a spymaster who keeps trying to poison your favourite accountant, you will know how important it is to keep a clean feed of information flowing into your hands. You'll soon be able to do that with much more control, judging by <a href="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images//36033026/d98ce6080638ff63907d49d1dc72050c98d740fa.png">this screenshot</a> of the upcoming quality-of-life feature. </p>

<p>God, that's an exciting menu. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-ii">Crusader Kings 2</a> and other Parastrats like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> have long enjoyed a similar feature that lets you decide, in itty-bitty detail, which message types you think are important, and which you don't give two figs about. But Crusader Kings 3 still doesn't have those options. So you're forced to trust the game's own info-sorting, meaning you sometimes miss significant events, or get endlessly informed about dozens of things for which you simply don't care.</p>
<p>This is due to make persnickety players like myself, who want to tailor their own story, very glad. Message settings have probably been on the drawing board at Paradox for a while, given the howling cries from the masses yearning for the feature. "I hate it when I suddenly notice bits and pieces of land around me suddenly belonging to a different ruler," says one such <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/imbk3n/can_we_please_please_have_message_settings_back/">kingly wail</a>. "I found out I had grandchildren years after they had died without even realizing they were born in the first place," says another noble soul. Yes, Crusader Kings continues to have the <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJvXWoHUAAAC49x.png:large">best out-of-context storytelling in PC games</a>, even when the players are complaining.</p>
<p>The free update that adds this feature isn't coming until September, alongside the release of the paid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3-is-getting-two-new-expansions-in-2024">Roads To Power DLC</a>. But it's the smallest-but-powerfulest addition to the game that I have heard about for a while. Thematically, it is like choosing which of your messengers deserves to be let into the throne room, and which to dismiss with a firm breaking of the legs (to steal Nic's summary of the feature from our chat in this morning's meeting, please don't tell him).</p>
<p>The Steam post that covers this goes over plenty of other features, not to be sniffed at. Some will accuse me of burying the lede for only addressing now the addition of a new start date, for example. Players can currently start the game on the year 867 or 1066, but will soon be able to begin on the year 1178 too. That date was chosen partly because of the various scoundrels and saints alive at that time (hi, Genghis), with Paradox saying they "want to give you as many options for worthy historical figures as possible". But it's also a good time period to coincide with the new mechanics of the Road To Power expansion, they say. </p>
<p>There are yet more details, including chat about the new "Administrative government" features. But I'm not going into that. Go read it yourself to learn about changes to vassal directives (tasks your underlings must carry out, often very reluctantly), and to sip upon plenty of chat about the Byzantine Empire, a confusing realm for which I do not care. Give me Vikings or give me death (or Spain... or North Africa... or Ireland... or...)</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nice-you-can-kill-conor-mcgregor-in-hitman%E2%80%99s-new-dlc.912915/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186771/hitman-conor-mcgregor-elusive-target-ufc-disruptor-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="OadpWD">Agent 47’s next assassination target is Conor McGregor, the MMA fighter and star of this year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24049549/road-house-jake-gyllenhaal-trailer-release-date-amazon-prime"><em>Roadhouse</em> remake</a>, developer IO Interactive announced Thursday. McGregor will serve as the next <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/18/16673752/hitman-elusive-targets-return">elusive target</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23537193/hitman-3-renamed-free-games-2-3-steam"><em>Hitman World of Assassination</em></a><em>,</em> and he’s available in all versions of the game from June 27 through July 29.</p>
<p id="XVYMbb">McGregor’s <em>Hitman</em> character is known as The Disruptor, and he’ll be portrayed in game as — what else? — an MMA fighter. The Disruptor is set to compete against Tim Quinn, the CEO of Quantum Leap, who previously appeared in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22237877/hitman-3-review-io-interactive"><em>Hitman 3</em></a> mission “The Farewell.” According to IO Interactive, stakeholders at Quantum Leap fear that Quinn will be humiliated by The Disruptor, and have tasked Agent 47 with taking down McGregor’s character before the match can happen.</p>
<p id="tpWQik">The Disruptor mission sends players to the island of Sgàil “during a conclave of the secretive Ark Society, an organization composed of the world’s most rich and powerful people,” IO Interactive said in a news release. The mission will be available to play for free for <em>Hitman</em> newcomers as part of the game’s Free Starter Pack. </p>

<p id="5Thxll"><em>Hitman World of Assassination</em> players can also access the mission for free, and can purchase a $4.99 Disruptor DLC pack, which offers a new fur-coat cosmetic, as well as kettlebell, resistance band, and cane items, which you can presumably use to kill Conor McGregor. That DLC pack also offers permanent access to The Ostentatious, a two-level Arcade contract featuring The Disruptor elusive target. </p>
<p id="hFWQQ2">The ability to eliminate McGregor virtually should be cathartic for the UFC fighter’s detractors, whether they’re wroth over his general attitude, his clownish performance in the unnecessary <em>Roadhouse</em> remake, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67152914">sexual assault allegations levied against him</a>, or his <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/conor-mcgregor-ufc-champion-timeline-arrests-abuse-1234772835/">history of out-of-the-ring violence</a>. </p>
<p id="IxHNci">If killing Conor McGregor sounds like your cup of tea, the Disruptor elusive target mission is available starting today on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X versions of <em>Hitman World of Assassination</em>.</p>
<p id="isaxAj">The Hitman series has included celebrities as elusive targets before, notably with actors <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/18/12213078/hitman-gary-busey-outer-helmet-protector-protector">Gary Busey</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/28/18113485/hitman-2-sean-bean-elusive-target-mark-faba-undying">Sean Bean</a> serving as limited-time assassination victims in <em>Hitman</em> and <em>Hitman 2</em>, respectively.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/someone-is-already-beating-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-bosses-at-level-1<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Those Scadutree Fragments aren't hurting, though.</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> DLC <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> has been out for less than a week, and we already have absolute sickos beating the new content's bosses at level 1. Just because they can!</p><p>A content creator known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lastdarkhope9988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LastDarkHope</a> has been quietly plugging away on their YouTube channel for the last few months, defeating Elden Ring boss after Elden Ring boss with absolutely no rune levels gained, and no equipment leveled up. That's impressive enough on its own, but when the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC dropped last week, this incredible player simply started beating those bosses too. Again, this is without using runes to level up at all, and without using any smithing stones to upgrade equipment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Critically, LastDarkHope does seem to be using Scadutree Fragments. These fragments only impact the DLC content, but they do give damage negation and damage output increases that are far from negligible. As we've mentioned elsewhere on site, the Elden Ring community has been <em>really </em>struggling with the difficulty of some of Shadow of the Erdtree's bosses. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-scadutree-blessings-are-the-answer-to-elden-ring-dlcs-difficulty">Scadutree Fragments are the DLC's way of countering its heinous difficulty</a>, and you're very much encouraged to seek them out if you're having trouble. But it seems that even these buffs weren't enough for many, pushing FromSoftware to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-first-patch-in-update-1122">drop a patch today</a> that increases the benefits from earlier Scadutree Fragments before leveling out their buffs later on.</p><p>That said, what LastDarkHope is doing is still a wildly impressive feat. Most people who are struggling with these bosses and stocking up on Scadutree Fragments are doing so at levels well beyond 100, while LastDarkHope is still stuck at 1. No 60 Vigor, no wildly high Intellect or Strength, and no ability to wield certain weapons with specific stat criteria. What's more, they don't even seem to be going that hard on Scadutree Fragments despite collecting a few. Checking out their most recent stream, it looks like LastDarkHope was barreling around Castle Ensis with just three Scadutree levels. That's certainly lower than I'd personally be comfortable with, and I'm running around with a level 168 mage trying to sneak attack dudes with Comet Azur.</p><p>At the time this piece was written, LastDarkHope had just published a video defeating Chief Bloodfiend and seems to have tackled at least some of Jagged Peak - though no video of the very curse-able Bayle just yet. What's extra interesting is that LastDarkHope doesn't seem to have finished all of the regular Elden Ring bosses yet - ultra-hard Malenia, for instance, isn't listed, nor are the final bosses of the base game. We'll be keeping an eye on their run to see how it progresses...as well as on the certain parade of ridiculously hard runs that other content creators start to drum up in the coming weeks and months. We reached out to LastDarkHope for comment for this story but haven't yet heard back.</p><p>If this somehow isn't impressive enough for you, as we were on the cusp of submitting this story, another wild kill emerged from a different content creator and threw us for a loop. GinoMachino posted their own video of a Level 1, no weapon enhancement, no Scadutree Fragment, <em>no hit</em> kill on legacy dungeon boss Rellana. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GinoMachino" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GinoMachino has been on a roll</a> performing all sorts of challenging Elden Ring feats, but this is one of their first cracks at the new DLC, with more almost certainly to come.

But if you just want to finish the DLC for yourself before reading about what others are doing, we highly recommend loading up on Scadutree Fragments even if you're level 500. <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_Scadutree_Fragment_Locations">Here's a guide to get you started</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

This problem has dogged Dragon’s Dogma 2 since launch, despite various updates released since.</p><p>With the release of this new update (check out the patch notes below) comes a fix for issues around CPU overload in certain situations (this was blamed for Dragon's Dogma 2's frame-rate problems). Capcom said this should improve frame-rates in areas with lots of NPCs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S versions now have the option to change graphics settings to high/low. Turning the graphics settings to low “should further improve frame-rates”, Capcom said. Players on Steam can already achieve the same results by changing their graphics settings. “Further frame rate improvements are planned for future updates as well,” Capcom added.</p><p>Also on console is the option to turn 120Hz output on/off. “If your monitor supports 120Hz output, turning this on may make the game display more smoothly,” Capcom said, before warning: “This setting does not guarantee 120fps.”</p><p>There are a number of other improvements to Dragon’s Dogma 2 made by this update, including the welcome addition to sell items from the storage menu. The maximum number of items of one kind that can be put in storage is increased from 99 to 999. It should now also be easier to find oxcarts in the field.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon's Dogma 2 Title Update June 27 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Dragon's Dogma 2 arrived more than a decade after its predecessor and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-sales-hit-25-million-11-days-after-launch"><u>proved a monster hit for publisher Capcom</u></a> despite <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-is-polarizing-its-community-and-its-not-just-the-microtransactions"><u>controversy</u></a>, selling 2.5 million units in 11 days amid <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-mods-undercut-capcoms-controversial-microtransactions-dish-out-infinite-save-slots"><u>microtransaction</u></a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-pc-performance-is-a-mess-but-it-didnt-have-to-be"><u>performance complaints</u></a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-review"><u>In our 8/10 review</u></a>, IGN said: "More of a redo than a sequel, Dragon's Dogma 2 is a strange and wonderful action-RPG that bolsters the original’s strengths without addressing its weaknesses."</p><h2>Dragon's Dogma 2 title update June 27, 2024 patch notes:</h2><p><strong>[PlayStation 5 / Xbox Series X|S / Steam]</strong></p><p>Adjustments and additions to the storage.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Adding function to sell items from the storage menu.</li><li>Adding function to equip armor from the storage menu.</li><li>Adding function to equip armor from the storage when changing vocation in a vocation guild.</li><li>Increasing the maximum number of items of one kind that can be put in storage from 99 to 999.</li><li>Adjusting so that when an item is put in the storage beyond the maximum limit, the maximum number of items are automatically put in storage.</li></ul><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/27/ss02-01-gl-1719479057340.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><ul data-cy="list"><li>Adding the option to turn the Arisen's visibility on or off in photo mode.</li><li>Adjusting so that it's easier to find oxcarts in the field.</li><li>Fixing issue where Venator's Leggings, Ring of Predominance, and Comforting Neck Wrap were unobtainable.</li><li>Fixing issues that caused players to be able to enter areas they should not be able to.</li><li>Fixing issue with purchase pricing for precious stones in Vermund being incorrect at some shops.</li><li>Fixing issue where the oracle's guidance would not account for a necessary character being dead.</li><li>Fixing issue where some gathering points would not regenerate until the next playthrough.</li><li>Fixing issue where incorrect NPC portraits were displayed.</li><li>Fixing issues around opening the door in the Ancestral Chamber.</li><li>Fixing issue with hair display on characters of maximum height.</li><li>Fixing issues around CPU overload in certain situations.</li><li>Miscellaneous bug fixes.</li></ul><p><strong>[PlayStation 5 / Xbox Series X|S]</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Adding option to change graphics settings to high/low.</li><li>Adding option to turn 120Hz output on/off.</li></ul><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
