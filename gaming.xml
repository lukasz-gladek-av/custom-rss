			<p>After much <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">teasing</a>, a Stellar Blade sequel has been confirmed to be in the works.</p>



<p>As reported by Genki_JPN on X, the sequel to the popular action role-playing game originally released on PlayStation 5 last year has been confirmed to be in active development by Shift Up in a new financial report. Details on the game are scarce, but the Korean developer confirmed the second entry in their series will retain the action-packed gameplay of the original while incorporating an expanded universe and improved gameplay. In addition to developing a new entry in the series, the developer is planning to create various works related to the Stellar Blade franchise to expand the IP.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Shift Up say they are currently developing a Stellar Blade sequel that will have an expanded worldview and enhanced gameplay!</p><p>"We are actively pursuing the franchise development of the 'Stellar Blade' IP and are currently developing a sequel to 'Stellar Blade'.</p><p>This sequel will… <a href="https://t.co/zpLoYw0S5s">pic.twitter.com/zpLoYw0S5s</a></p></div>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1963102317886283809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Besides the possibility of a new entry in the series being discussed various times in the past, no one will likely be surprised to learn that the Stellar Blade series will continue, given the fantastic success of the game on both PlayStation 5 and PC. On Steam, in particular, the game became a smashing success right from release, selling 1 million units in three days and becoming the <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-fastest-selling-korean-game-steam/">fastest-selling Korean game</a> on the platform to date. Hopefully, the game will hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-switch-2/">other platforms</a> as well, as it is an action RPG that deserves to be enjoyed by as many players as possible.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's glowing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review</a>.</p>

              <p>Nintendo is adding a welcome fifth game to its grown up Mature section of the Nintendo Switch Online on September 4, with the arrival of 1998’s <em>Forsaken 64</em>. The six-degrees shooter is a total classic, and a superb addition to the top-tier version of Nintendo’s subscription service–although you’ll be hard-pressed to work out why it’s still considered an M.</p> <p>In the mid-90s, with the arrival of 3D graphics cards, developers were suddenly handed a whole other axis in which to explore. The stand-out example of this new-found freedom was 1995’s&nbsp;<em>Descent</em>, know as a “six degrees of freedom” game, where you controlled a floating ship that could orientate itself however it wished in 3D spaces. That shooter was created by Parallax Software, a name you might not recognize until I tell you the studio split in two, one half becoming Volition. (The other half became Outrage Entertainment which developed the incredible <em>Descent 3</em>.) So, the developer best known for <em>Saints Row</em> and&nbsp;<em>Red Faction</em> essentially launched a whole new genre, and it was into this that publisher Acclaim Entertainment released <em>Forsaken</em> in 1998.</p> <p>OK, that’s perhaps a somewhat generous way of observing just how derivative Probe Entertainment’s <em>Forsaken</em> was of&nbsp;<em>Descent</em> and its 1996 sequel, but it remains the case that&nbsp;<em>Forsaken</em> was outstanding in its own right. While wantonly lifting weapon types, power-ups and indeed the entire concept of flying a ship through 3D tunnels from its–uh–inspiration, the game became a pioneer of the growing 3D graphics market, and a solid six-degrees shooter in its own right.</p>

  <p>The N64 version of&nbsp;<em>Forsaken</em> came out just a week later, despite being partly developed by a different Acclaim studio, Iguana UK, and even having its own unique version of the storyline. The PC and PlayStation version of the game had you playing as a nefarious rogue attempting to plunder a nuclear-destroyed Earth for its treasures as a get-rich scheme, while <em>Forsaken 64</em> took a more noble interpretation, casting you as someone trying to take down those looters. It plays out the same, but Nintendo players had the moral highground.</p> <p>It’s obviously this version that’s due to arrive on the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service September 4, as part of its higher tier “Expansion Pack.” Except, for reasons that aren’t immediately clear,&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em> is to be part of the separate <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Nintendo-64-Nintendo-Classics-Mature-2592474.html">Nintendo 64 – Nintendo Classics: Mature</a> app. That currently hosts&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>,&nbsp;<em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man</em>, all of which were originally released with an M rating in the ’90s. However,&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em>‘s rating is a bit more confusing. The game was released with an M rating in the US, both on the box and the cartridge, <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/3485/forsaken-n64/">but despite the ESRB then and now rate the game as a T</a>. There’s some speculation this might be because the game featured a cheat where pressing Z, Down, C-Up, C-Left, C-Left, C-Left, C-Left, C-Down on the Start screen would unlock a Gore Mode, which would easily bump the game up from T to M in those days. If that cheat has been preserved for this release, then Nintendo presumably erred on the side of caution. Although of course this is all made a nonsense given&nbsp;<em>Golden Eye 64</em> remains a T and in the main app! And it all looks so gorgeously innocent and mild some three decades later.</p> <p>This release will support all the original 4-player multiplayer modes, which are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCerd9OfTLY">still super-satisfying today</a>. The only real challenge this faces is being added on the same day&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> comes out.</p>

            <p>Fighting game players are up in arms following news that RTS - a gaming talent agency and owner of the Evo tournament series - has been acquired by the Saudi Arabian mega city project Qiddiya.</p>
<p>This news came yesterday afternoon via an official statement by CSO at Qiddiya Muhannad Aldawood, who wrote on Linkedin: "Excited to share that Qiddiya has acquired full ownership of RTS, a strategic step that will further strengthen our esports business and unlock new opportunities across the broader gaming ecosystem. And most importantly, this will enable Qiddiya to keep fueling the continued growth of Evolution Championship Series (EVO), the world's largest fighting game event since 1996, with unlimited [potential]."</p>
<p>The response online from fighting game community members was largely one of disappointment, as various fans of the genre came out to express sadness at the new owners and emphasised the importance of supporting grassroots community-run events. Saudi Arabia has been criticised by Human Rights organisations for its prolific use of slavery,  the death penalty, and more.</p>

<p>Professional <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> player ChrisCCH, who previously refused a place at the Saudi-owned Esports World Cup, <a href="https://x.com/ChrisCCH_/status/1963035397988221121">wrote on X</a>: "Not terribly surprising, but still unfortunate news. Sad for the LGBTQ+ members of the community, and also worried about the scene becoming increasingly funded by money that will disappear as soon as the funders get bored."</p><p>Sajam, a popular commentator and content creator within the fighting game space, <a href="https://x.com/Sajam/status/1963045416716652659">stated</a>: "I think the news personally just makes me want to think about more ways to create cool stuff for the rest of our community. It feels like the pieces that belong to fighting game fans are shrinking all the time."</p>
<p>With a general distaste around Evo following the news, some have looked to other American alternative events to attend, including CEO. One user on X Roycebracket <a href="https://x.com/roycebracketfgc/status/1962914707955699911">summed up their thoughts</a> with: "CEO is about to become the real evo" while LandedIt took a more humorous approach, writing: "Glory to Alex Jebailey ceo 2026 4 jebaillion entrants".</p>
<p>In response to the news, Evo general manager Rick Thiher posted his own statement: "Everything I have worked on in fighting games has been with the ambition of bringing our communities together. Inclusivity, community, and connectivity matter to me. It’s deeply personal that they remain part of what I work on and that the future of Evo respects that."</p>
<p>Whether or not this uproar on social media actually manifests into a material impact on the future of Evo remains a question mark: there's a big difference between expressing displeasure on Twitter and taking actual action.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/madden-26-review/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As tick follows tock, runs follow blocks, and the Raiders enter another rebuild phase, we have the yearly arrival of Madden. While there are alternatives out there, rightly or wrongly, it remains the NFL’s premier simulation. Despite some players experiencing burnout after more than forty entries in the franchise, it continues to push, improve, and tailor its experience for modern players and the latest consoles, and this year’s earth-shattering change-up for Madden 26 is that it’s come to the Nintendo Switch 2, making it the first handheld Madden in years.</p>
<p><iframe title="Madden 26 Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EZrgXXHSaBQ?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>More impactful is the fact that Madden 26 on Switch 2 is the same game that PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series gamers are getting. There’s no legacy edition, no simple roster update, and no sense that you’re playing a version of the game from several years ago. This is the full Madden 26 experience, but on the go, and it makes for the most addictive and easily accessible entry we’ve had in a long time.</p>


<p>There’s two absolutely huge time-sinks in Madden 26, and they’re the classic combo of Franchise mode and Ultimate Team. Franchise mode remains the choice for the purist: pick your team, pick your coaching style, and then attempt to wrangle your team all the way to the Super Bowl through multiple years, taking control on the field and in the back office.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of the real-life sport, it’s the mode that makes you feel as though you’re genuinely part of it, and EA have made significant changes to the way Franchise functions in an effort to make it feel more realistic and more involved. Personally, I think they’ve done a great job. You’re in control of your full staff team, and they’ll come to you with suggestions and pointers, giving you a nudge on a player that’s worth trading for, or helping you to evaluate your team’s overall health. Players will also come to you to discuss their position within the team, and you must choose how to motivate them and what you expect from them in their role.</p>


<p>Trading is a little messy, and some of that is because the menu controls aren’t labelled clearly, and they’ve opted for some buttons to take double duty while others, like the shoulder buttons, don’t do anything. There are definitely a few other behind-the-scenes quirks in Madden 26, and you have to hope that someone will notice and make a few changes in a patch, especially for players who are going to spend a lot of time in the menus.</p>
<p>Ultimate Team is the other key draw here. Collect player cards, complete challenges, upgrade your team, and take your team out against other players to see how it fares. Ultimate Team thrusts a lot of stuff at you for free, and if you’re the patient type, you can get away without spending extra money on buying card packs. At least for a while.</p>
<p>Madden Team has a way of insinuating itself into your psyche, and sooner or later – sooner in my case – you’re going to break and spend your real-life money on a bunch of ephemeral player cards with slighter better stats than the ones you own. I do this every year, and since I’ve never got too carried away, I remain perfectly happy with my choices. If you have anything against predatory monetisation, or you’re nursing an addictive personality, perhaps this, and likely all of EA and 2K’s sports games, are not for you.</p>

<p>The Switch 2’s menu performance is nowhere near as snappy as that found on the PS5, and Madden Ultimate Team is where you’ll feel that the most. It’s not diabolical, nor truly off-putting, but it is slower. If you’re the sort that wants to rush through team selection, optimising your cards and opening packs, the Switch 2 is the slowest place to do that. However, you can do that with Switch 2 anywhere you want, assuming you have an internet connection. You can’t take your PS5 on the bus.</p>
<p>The need for an internet connection is something that Madden largely relies on these days, and while you can play Franchise Mode offline, it prevents the EA servers from helping out with any simulations you might be doing, and you’ll be without the live rosters available with the online version. This is a bit fiddly on Switch 2, as an active connection is much less of a guarantee, and I did find myself waiting for everything to sync up a few times when I was waking up the Switch 2 from sleep. Still, this is (disappointingly) nothing new for the franchise or gaming in 2025.</p>
<p>Outside of Ultimate Team and Franchise Mode, there’s also Superstar, which once again lets you create your own character, fight your way through the NFL draft and then build your position and importance in your team. I still like this – who doesn’t enjoy putting themselves in the game, and supplanting Brock Purdy as the lead Quarterback for the 49ers – and you can tailor your player so that he fits exactly with how you think you’d play in real life. You might need a good imagination. There’s more of a documentary feel to Superstar, and Madden 26 as a whole, and I think it’s a great fit, feeling as though you can put more of yourself into the player than ever before.</p>

<p>Performance is going to be the key question mark over the Switch 2 version, and it’s fair to say that Madden 26 plays a competent game of gridiron on the handheld. It’s not the fastest, or the smoothest, but the player models look decent, the animations remain intact, and all of the features you’ll find in the PS5 version are present and correct. Frankly, it’s remarkable and exactly what I was hoping for. After struggling with previous Maddens on my ROG Ally and the non-existent support for Steam Deck’s Linux OS, this is truly the only viable way to play Madden 26 on the go. It’s excellent, and it’s been a long time coming.</p>
<p>There is a gentle caveat to that; there remains the slight shonkiness in the menus and in some of the on-field action that we’ve come to expect from Madden. I genuinely think that this is the best it’s been at launch for a number of years, and none of it truly detracts from the experience, but in an ideal world everything would function perfectly, and all the jank would be gone. Still, the team will undoubtedly continue working on it throughout the season, until we arrive at Madden 27.</p>
<p>I have to talk about the EA Music in Madden 26, if only because it’s one of the best sports game mixes I can remember. The 166 track lineup is all over the shop in terms of genre and timeline, jumping from 50 Cents’ In Da Club through to We Go On by Bia and then The Contract by TwentyOnePilots, before taking a sojourn into rock and metal with Bush’s Machinehead, Electric Callboy’s Elevator Operator and Korn’s Freak on a Leash. Hell, there’s Megadeth, Chappell Roan and Lizzo nestled up against each other. If you’ve got an eclectic taste in music, it’s absolutely spot on. If you don’t, you can turn off all the songs you don’t like.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 Digital Edition hardware revision, reportedly set to launch in Europe soon, will feature a rather critical change that makes the new release effectively feel like yet another price increase for the system.</p>



<p>As reported today by the ever-reliable billbil-kun on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps5-slim-numerique-chassis-e-vers-une-reduction-du-stockage-ssd-60471">Dealabs</a>, the new CFI-2100 console model discovered back in June 2025 via certification documents filed in Japan is set to launch on September 13 in Europe for €499, the current price of the system. The new hardware revision has been created to optimize production costs, something that is reportedly being achieved by including an SSD with a smaller capacity than all the current Digital Edition models, 825 GB instead of 1 TB, a critical change for a system that cannot run physical games without an additional purchase. The new PlayStation 5 Standard Edition hardware revision, on the other hand, will retain the 1 TB SSD when it launches at a later date. The system's packaging will also feature a visible 825 GB label, so it should be easy to distinguish between the current and the next hardware revisions.</p>



<p>Although this new PlayStation 5 Digital Edition hardware revision is being released to avoid another price increase, it effectively feels like one, as those purchasing the system in the future will get less than others did at the same price. This new release comes during a tumultuous time for console gaming, as both <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">Sony</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">Microsoft</a> increased the price of their systems worldwide in the past few months, making this console generation the first one where systems were cheaper at launch, at least on paper. Hopefully, the global economic situation will improve in the future and prevent other price increases, which would be as disastrous for users as for publishers, as some of them, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-high-price-playstation-5/">CAPCOM</a>, believe that the high price of systems is impacting the sales of games.</p>

            <p>Last month, the beloved PlayStation published <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> made its Xbox debut, after months of many asking and developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-helldivers-2-on-xbox-would-need-sony-and-phil-spencer-to-duke-it-out-arrowhead-community-lead-says">Arrowhead joking the move would require "Sony and Phil [Spencer] to duke out" for a port to happen</a>.</p>
<p>And, it seems like this debut has gone down rather well with Xbox players. If you head over to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/browse/top-paid-games?PlayWith=XboxSeriesX%7CS">Xbox website now</a>, you will see that Helldivers 2 is currently listed as the "Top Paid" game on the store.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to data from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across">Alinea Analytics</a>, Helldivers 2 shifted 926k copies on Xbox six days after its release. To compare, the PlayStation version of Helldivers 2 sold 633k copies six days after its own launch last year.</p>
<p>On the same day that PlayStation's Helldivers 2 arrived on Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">Xbox's Gears of War series also landed on PlayStation</a> thanks to a revamped edition of the original game known as Reloaded. According to Alinea Analytics, this chap has sold 259k copies on PlayStation.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has opened up all manner of possibilities for gamers and Nintendo itself. With Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 being one of 2025’s biggest and best games, it would only be fitting if the Switch 2 could welcome the GOTY contender onto the console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-teases-new-content-and-other-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> could already be 2025’s Game of the Year. That’s how revered and successful it is. It’s the highest-rated release this year, and a wider reach could introduce even more players to its unreal world. While it’s anything but official, a new quote from its developer suggests all hope isn’t lost.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It would look good. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.nintenderos.com/nintendo-switch-2/sandfall-interactive-esta-explorando-lanzar-clair-obscur-expedition-33-en-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintenderos</a> has reported that Sandfall Interactive isn’t ruling out bringing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to the Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>



<p>“We have some possibilities that we will explore, but at the moment we cannot confirm anything,” was the company’s official response when prompted by Nintederos on a Switch 2 port.</p>



<p>Reports are circulating that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/many-developers-still-dont-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many developers are struggling to get Switch 2 dev kits</a>. This understandably holds back many games and is likely to delay a ton of future third-party ports to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With Sandfall not ruling out a Clair Obscur Switch 2 crossover, this could be the reason why an announcement is taking so long. We’ll keep you updated on the situation and developments on a future Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>Will you buy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 if it arrives on Nintendo’s new hardware? Or are you busy and impatiently waiting for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-franchise-sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>?

            <p>Stop banging on about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, Bertie. But it's weird, isn't it, when a game you've wondered about the existence for, for a long time, is finally within touching distance, finally nearly here. It's just a game, it's not a magical object, and yet it feels more than a game too. The hype bubble fascinates me.</p>
<p>But enough of that! It's 3rd September and we're back with another daily roundup and chat-a-long of all of today's gaming news. Let's get it, as American people say in YouTube workout videos.</p>

            <p>Good news for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-ultrawide-gaming-monitors">ultrawide monitor</a>-owning Nic Reubens of the world: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will, unlike its narrow-eyed predecessor, natively support stretchy displays up to the 21:9 format when it finally releases tomorrow. Silksong marketing-man-at-large Matthew Griffin shared some demonstrative screenshots <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1963104885722730672">on Xitter</a>, confirming that it won’t require any of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1566566333">weird bodging</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> did to fill out those bigger screens.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Maybe that’s not of great concern to the metroidvaning masses: Steam’s most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">hardware survey</a> suggests that players whose primary monitor tots up to either 2560x1080 or 3440x1440, the two most common 21:9 resolutions, make for less than 4% of users. But dammit, accounting and accommodating for offbeat niches is what PC gaming does best, and Silksong launching with ultrawide support indicates it was built as such from the start. That’s important, as modding in or otherwise forcing ultrawide ratios on games that weren’t expecting them can sometimes reveal, around the edges, visual clunkiness that innocent 16:9 eyes were never meant to see. Unloaded chunks of level, enemies whose animations haven’t started yet, that sort of thing.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Team Cherry</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s the second positive update on Silksong’s techy credentials in recent days, after it was quietly marked as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> Verified on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/">Steam store page</a>. That was arguably more of a formality, given the original runs and controls just fine on Valve’s handheld, and Silksong (while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-faster-prettier-and-harder-yet-still-feels-like-a-safe-sequel">prettier to my eyes</a>) doesn’t seem to make much in the way of extra hardware demands. Though speaking of resolutions, Hollow Knight never officially supported the Deck’s 16:10 aspect ratio either – I confess that I forgot to check this when I played Silksong at Gamescom last month, but you’d think that if 21:9 is doable, 16:10 would be an absolute doddle.</p>
<p>We’ll find out tomorrow (Thursday 4th September), I suppose, when Silksong finally beats the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-videogame-vapourware-no-silksong-allowed-edition">vapourware</a> allegations. Here be the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-time">exact release times</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-hints-that-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-was-unfinished/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-hints-that-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-was-%E2%80%98unfinished%E2%80%99.1287243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is likely going to go down as Hideo Kojima’s final-ever MGS title. The director has since moved on to create Kojima Productions, but an interesting social media post from him seemingly reaffirms a long-standing theory.</p>



<p>The Phantom Pain is still an unbelievable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid</a> game. Its open nature and complete freedom and flexibility to complete MGS missions in all-new ways were another evolutionary step forward for the series. If you’ve played it, though, you’ll know the game’s final official moments are abrupt and, dare I say, unfinished?</p>







<figure><figcaption>We nearly had it all. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-written-concept-death-stranding-3-wont-make/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> has been quick to distance himself from his former work in recent times—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he won’t play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. After all, why wouldn’t he? <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-tops-uk-physical-sales-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a> is another acclaimed piece of media, and Kojima is busy working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojimas-od-is-reportedly-safe-from-recent-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OD</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physint</a>.</p>



<p>But a September 3 post from Kojima seems to highlight and double down on the notion that Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain was incomplete when it was released. Kojima natively posted an article by <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/metal-gear-solid-v-phantom-pain-hideo-kojima-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inverse</a> to his X account: “10 Years Later, Hideo Kojima’s Unfinished Masterpiece Is Still Influencing Games Today.”</p>



<p>This is likely Kojima hinting at the theory that a whole chapter was missing at the end of The Phantom Pain. Kojima and Konami infamously fell out toward the end of The Phantom Pain’s development, and necessary missions and storytelling ended up on the cutting-room floor.</p>



<p>The Phantom Pain’s original Collector’s Edition notoriously featured concept art and footage of the unfinished episode, which supposedly wrapped up the game’s story. To this day, The Phantom Pain is considered an incomplete and unfinished game, which is unfortunate, as it’s probably the last piece of Kojima-created MGS content we’ll ever get.</p>







<p>Do you still enjoy The Phantom Pain even with its missing content? Are you still hoping and praying that Kojima makes another MGS title one day? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced another game coming to the mature corner of its Switch Online subscription service. That game is shooter Forsaken 64, which first released on Nintendo 64 all the way back in 1998.</p>
<p>When Forsaken 64 arrives on 4th September, it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-adds-mature-games-selection-starting-with-perfect-dark-and-turok">join the likes of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Perfect Dark for those members aged 17 and up</a>.</p>

<p>"You are a ruthless mercenary, sent to the condemned remains of Earth as part of a covert operation codenamed Forsaken," the official blurb teases. "Your mission is to infiltrate and destroy the last bastions of the mechanised terror that wiped out all life on the planet. Earth is a death trap riddled with merciless mechanoid adversaries and gangs of rival bounty hunters, and you'll have to brave them all astride your anti-grav pioncycle to make your fortune...or meet your doom." Sounds chill.</p>
<p>As per Nintendo, players will be able to join in either single or multiplayer mode. "Then, select your bike," the company says, noting that each bike has different attributes, and each biker has a "different attitude". So, just find the one you vibe with the most, and drive on into the fray.</p>
<p>"The availability of weapons, enemies, and powerups changes depending on the level you play, so stay sharp," Nintendo closes. You can check out a trailer for Forsaken 64 below.</p>

            <p>Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot could have been saved from cancellation by Take-Two.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through">Bloomberg</a>, the publishing giant was in talks with Embracer - which owns Perfect Dark co-development studio Crystal Dynamics - and was willing to acquire the project from Microsoft. Had this deal gone through, the plan would have been for Take-Two to then fund and publish Perfect Dark itself.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>However, according to Bloomberg's sources, this deal was ultimately never realised due to "disagreements over long-term ownership of the Perfect Dark franchise". Crystal Dynamics was therefore forced to abandon the game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">lay off staff towards the end of last month</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-announced">Perfect Dark reboot was initially announced back in 2020</a>, with Microsoft studio The Initiative set to lead development. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-co-developed-by-crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics was then brought in to support</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>The reboot did not have a smooth time of things, however, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-made-little-meaningful-progress-since-2020-reveal">it was said "little meaningful progress" had been made</a>. In 2024, it was then said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-in-a-very-rough-state-and-a-big-protracted-mess">Perfect Dark had become "a big, protracted mess"</a>, and was in a "rough state".</p><p>Things seemed to be taking a turn for the better later that year, though, and we were treated to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">first gameplay trailer for Perfect Dark</a>. However, this glimmer of hope was soon extinguished, and in July of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Microsoft pulled the plug on Perfect Dark and closed down The Initiative</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We all love a new MMORPG, but what about testing a new one out before it launches? Chinese publisher Netease are on something of a tear lately, with the recent launches of Destiny: Legacy and Fragpunk sitting alongside huge hits like the Overwatch-eradicating Marvel Rivals. While they remain mobile specialists, Sword of Justice is a brand new Chinese-influenced MMORPG which is coming to both mobile platforms and PC, and it’s looking spectacular. If MMORPGs are your sort of thing, as of today you can <a href="https://qnv2.ux-jp-01.easebar.com/qnv2/a553d3e2-50a1-4860-8f35-3f9aef06139e/?shortlink=cdens2o1&amp;c=PR%20Pitch&amp;pid=CBT%20PR%20Pitch&amp;af_xp=custom&amp;source_caller=ui#/">sign up for the upcoming closed beta</a> which starts on the 26th of September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sword of Justice - Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ob_tjShS5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Developed by ZhuRong Studio, as the team head towards Sword of Justice’s international launch, the Closed Beta Test will take place on a North-American server, with players from the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil able to experience the game. The Closed Beta Test will start on September 26th at 10:30 AM EDT and you can <a href="https://mail.yahoo.com/d/folders/1/messages/AOp8cjmuZ2gpK30GMV29XNhi5Ng?.intl=uk&amp;.lang=en-GB#:~:text=https%3A//swordofjustice.onelink.me/PNY2/cdens2o1">sign up for the beta</a> until September 16th at 11:59 AM EDT.</p>
<p>Sword of Justice is an open world MMORPG for PC and mobile devices that’s completely free to play, with the team promising that there are no pay-to-win elements. Set in a world inspired by the Northern Song Dynasty in 12th-century China, Sword of Justice allows players to live out their martial arts dreams in a stunning Eastern aesthetic world. It does look deeply impressive, and, as we’re seeing with titles like Infinity Nikki, mobile games are pushing the envelope in terms of gameplay and visuals to a point where they sit happily alongside fully fledged consoles.</p>


<p>A major feature that players can experience in the Sword of Justice Closed Beta Test is the implementation of path tracing on PC and ray tracing on mobile devices. Path-tracing is a visually stunning effect, offering near-photorealistic reflections and lighting. Coupled with the game’s dynamic weather system, Sword of Justice offers gorgeous visuals that they liken to CGI movies, providing an ultra-realistic presentation of its world. If your phone is up to snuff, it’s well worth checking out, just to see how far the technology has come.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in finding out more, there’s plenty of information on the <a href="http://swordofjustice.com/en/index.html">official website</a>. We’ll definitely be watching this one with interest!</p>

            <p>
Another one for the "not news, but news to me" pile: you can download a free updated version of classic 4X space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim Starships Unlimited from creator Andrew "APEzone" Paul Ewanchyna's website. Originally released in 1999 - an era of relative mental calm, before the Broadband Blight - it's a turn-based affair with four ages of technology to discover, a range of alien factions who (in the original version, anyway) all look like gurning hoover attachments, and the prospect of zesty tactical combat involving ships of your own design. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There are few pleasures in the games journalist's life richer and more poignant than the opportunity to write about a game you'd totally forgotten you played. I didn't recognise Starship Unlimited at first, when I saw it on the 4X subreddit. The madeleine-soaked-in-tea moment was a screenshot of ships in orbit featuring firing ranges - arcs and wedges of yellow, red and green painted onto an invisible tabletop around each craft. I adored those firing ranges as a kid. I used to field highly specialised fleets consisting of acutely near-sighted, 360-degree firing escort cruisers and tunnel-vision artillery vessels that couldn't win a dogfight against a cactus.
</p>
<p>
The free version <a href="https://apezone.com/posts/201114/">available on APEzone's site</a> is Starships Unlimited 3.5 - sadly, Ewanchyna doesn't seem to have preserved the older versions, including the one I played with the (imo) very <em>best</em> nozzle-faced aliens. If you're interested, you'll need to sign up with your email to access the download page.</p>
<p>As ever with these projects, part of the thrill is the weird time-traveller condescension that comes from digesting a set of two-decades old system requirements. 50MB of HD space? Woah, guess I'll have to suck it up and delete my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> install. 64MB of RAM? I'd better close all applications before starting this game. Vintage spec sheet notwithstanding, Starship Unlimited seems to run happily enough on a current-gen Windows PC, like the Dell thinkpad I'm writing this on.
</p>
<p>
Stumbling on this has charged my torpedo tubes and suffused my phaser banks with rampant enthusiasm for games involving genuinely tactical fleet combat. Any lesser-known favourites you'd like to share? Anything new and unexpected, or old and unfairly overlooked?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the Little Nightmares series, Swedish development studio Tarsier Studios entered the map of survival horror fans with some rather unique experiences that managed to blend the genre's staples with some puzzle and platforming elements that made the franchise rather popular. Having had to leave the franchise behind after getting acquired by Amplifier Game Invest in late 2019, Tarsier Studios started working on Reanimal, a survival horror game featuring everything that made their survival horror series so popular, with some choice enhancements, including co-op.</p>



<p>Although Tarsier Studios isn't adding co-op as an answer to Supermassive Games doing the same in the third entry in the series the Swedish studio has created launching this year, the gameplay similarities between Reanimal and Little Nightmares 3 were uncanny, with setting and characters doing most of the differentiating work. In the Tarsier Studios' developed game, two players, or a player with an AI-controlled partner, will take on the role of an unnamed brother and sister as they traverse a hellish version of their home and attempt to save three friends. As they make their dangerous journey through this world, the two will have to cooperate to solve puzzles, which include activating different contraptions at the same time, moving objects to create platforms upon which the other can climb to reach important items or switches, and avoiding getting captured by massive enemies.</p>

			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Beginning after getting stranded on a beach, the Reanimal Gamescom demo provided a decent look at the game and what its co-op-focused experience offered. While the puzzles were nicely designed, but not very surprising, I felt the game was at its best during a hectic escape sequence where the players had to combine stealth and platforming to escape from a nicely designed and animated giant doll-like creature.  These escaping sequences were undoubtedly the highlight of the short demo, and the most hilarious, which made it easy to look past the puzzle design, which was too familiar at times, even with the tweaks made necessary by the co-op approach of the game.</p>



<p>Familiar is possibly the best way to describe what I have seen of Reanimal during this year's Gamescom. While an around 20-min session is obviously not enough to paint a whole picture, there's no denying that Tarsier Studio's first game after the Little Nightmares series will not disappoint fans of the series looking for an experience carrying the developer's trademark style when it launches sometime next year on PC and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned insider Tom Henderson has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-rayman-games-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided</a> an overview of Ubisoft's 2026-27 game lineup, which includes several new installments in big franchises.</p>



<p>According to Henderson's sources, the next Ghost Recon game is reportedly called Project Ovr and may ditch the AnvilNext 2.0 engine in favor of Epic's Unreal Engine 5. The game is also supposedly switching perspectives: the most recent games, 2017's Ghost Recon: Wildlands and 2019's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint, used a third-person view with an optional first-person view only available when aiming weapons. However, most of the previous entries in the 24-year-old franchise were in first-person, and Project Ovr should return to those historical roots. </p>



<p>Ubisoft is also making two new Far Cry games, which in itself is entirely unsurprising. It's one of the publisher's most successful franchises, as evidenced by Far Cry being one of only three IPs (the others being Rainbow Six and Assassin's Creed) that were deemed critical <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when establishing the new subsidiary</a>. About a year ago, job ads for a new Far Cry title were <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-far-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> online. Tom Henderson revealed that the two projects are codenamed Blackbird and Maverick, with the former being a regular sequel and the latter an extraction shooter that could be canceled before actually launching. There's also supposed to be an engine change here from the proprietary Dunia to Massive's Snowdrop.</p>



<p>Then there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-project-red-japan-project-hexe-witchcraft-infinity-hub-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Hexe</a>, the next mainline Assassin's Creed game that is being spearheaded by Clint Hocking (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, Far Cry 2, Watch Dogs: Legion). Unlike most of the recent entries in the IP, it won't have roleplaying elements. Its setting has already been announced to be dark and medieval, likely based around witch hunts, as suggested by the codename. Finally for the sequels, Henderson is adamant that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still happening.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is also looking to deliver on three long-awaited remakes: <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-continuing-to-progress-according-to-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Splinter Cell</a> (Project North), <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-it-is-still-deep-in-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia</a> (Project Rewind), and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (Project Obsidian). The remaining lineup for 2026-27 should include Assassin's Creed Invictus (the Fall Guys-like multiplayer spin-off) and two new IPs, an extraction shooter set in World War II (Project Crest) and a game inspired by Nintendo's Animal Crossing (Project Alterra). Beyond 2027, there will be more Assassin's Creed games, The Crew 3, and The Division 3.</p>



<p>What do you think of this lineup? Is there anything that excites you?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-being-beaten-to-the-steam-launch-punch-by-its-number-one-rival.1287201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam later this year, but in a new announcement, it was confirmed that it’s being beaten to the punch by its number-one competitor, Arena Breakout: Infinite. In a post on Steam, the Arena Breakout team confirmed that on September 15, ABI will hit Steam, delivering a free-to-play extraction experience to many expectant fans.</p>



<p>This does mean that those interested in extraction shooters have a couple of months to try out Arena Breakout: Infinite before Escape from Tarkov hits Steam at some point this year, after the game’s 1.0 release on November 15.</p>



<h2 id="h-arena-breakout-infinite-heads-to-steam">Arena Breakout: Infinite Heads to Steam</h2>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite has been playable for quite some time, but fans have had to use a proprietary launcher offered by MoreFun, the game’s developer. With ABI coming to Steam on September 15, one of the most popular and free extraction shooters is set to hit an entirely new audience.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Arena Breakout: Infinite is in eighth place on the Steam wishlists chart, sitting just behind ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 but ahead of Dying Light: The Beast and ARK 2.</p>



<p>It has more than <strong>two million wishlist spots</strong>. Escape from Tarkov’s Steam page isn’t yet live, so it has <strong>zero</strong>.</p>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite has managed to keep a core audience pleased over the last year or so, with MoreFun rolling out constant updates, including new maps, modes, weapons, and various collaborations. In July, the studio pushed out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinites-cyberpunk-2077-crossover-introduces-new-events-weapon-skins-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Cyberpunk 2077 crossover</a> that few people saw coming.</p>



<p>I sat down with MoreFun Studios at Gamescom 2024 to learn about some critical aspects of the game. I was interested in their rationale around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-offline-mode-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having no ‘offline mode’</a>, and learned more about their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-facul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revolutionary AI NPCs</a> that could understand live voice commands.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073620/view/496079294980687187?l=english&amp;curator_clanid=3693985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Steam</a>, MoreFun promoted the game with every ounce of pulling power possible, flexing everything available in the game when it hits full release on the platform in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>It might have been seen as a carbon copy for a while, and even came under fire from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-dev-arena-plagiarism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlestate Games for alleged plagiarism</a>, but Arena Breakout: Infinite has managed to hold its own over the last year or so. It looks superb on the surface, has plenty of meat on the bones, and despite some sketchy microtransactions, is <strong>free to play</strong>, and that’s a huge advantage.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Arena Breakout: Infinite on Steam when it drops on September 15? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fcd6f6dd4267/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>Resident Evil</strong> series has seen pretty strong representation on the Switch, but it's perhaps safe to say that fans aren't best pleased with some titles being relegated to 'Cloud Versions'.</p>
<p>We're still waiting to see whether Capcom is keen to re-release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">RE2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_3_-_cloud_version">RE3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_7_biohazard_cloud">RE7</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_village_cloud">RE Village</a> natively on the Switch 2, but for now, it seems the company is <em>potentially</em> considering bringing its latest entry to Nintendo's new hardware.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is due for release on <strong>27th February 2026</strong> and, according to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Dusk Golem</a>, who has been known to leak RE news prior to official announcements, the game is supposedly being planned for release on both the Switch 2 and the PS4.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xwpohy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's what they had to say via <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963021049014190354">X</a> (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/resident-evil-requiem-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I won't be at around the bush, Resident Evil Requiem should be releasing in PlayStation 4 &amp; Nintendo Switch 2, seems this was kinda' known behind the scenes &amp; in the grapevine.</p>
<p>"I'm not the first person to say this publicly actually, just corroborating. Talked about it with five different people in the last few weeks and know another guy with a good reputation said as much less than a week ago. So not from me, but I have been hearing the same thing.</p>
<p>"Unsure if it'll be at launch, and my guess is it'll be a different version with different tech, sorta' like the 360 / PS3 &amp; Wii / PS2 era, since some features of Requiem like ray tracing are focused on modern platforms.</p>
<p>But if the question is, is it happening or not, the answer pretty much is, yeah it's happening."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, as mentioned, if Requiem were to come to the Switch 2, then it may not release day-and-date with the scheduled launch in February. As for the visuals and performance, well... that seems somewhat obvious, right? Still, if this is true, then it's not <em>entirely</em> surprising. <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en">Capcom's president recently</a> stated that the initial response to the Switch 2 caught the company off-guard, so it seems reasonable to assume that it'll want to take advantage of the exceptionally strong sales.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem will star Grace Ashcroft, daughter of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a>'s Alyssa Ashcroft, who is instructed to investigate a series of strange deaths at the sinister Wrenwood Hotel. The game will also pay a visit to the ruined wasteland of Raccoon City, and it's heavily rumoured that RE veteran Leon Kennedy will play a role, possibly as a second playable protagonist.</p>
<p>The Resident Evil franchise will also be celebrating its 30th anniversary next year, with Capcom recently launching a <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/30th.html">dedicated website</a> to commemorate the milestone.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-76-c-a-m-p-revamp-is-out-now.1287195/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Bethesda Game Studios released a Fallout 76 update that includes a major revamp of the C.A.M.P. feature, which allows players to build their own home bases within the game world.</p>



<p>The enhancements have been detailed in an official developer preview by Fallout 76 Game Director Jon Rush:</p>



<p><em>We wanted to create an update that empowers our amazing building community by making it easier to build and giving you more tools to build with. C.A.M.P. Revamp features a revised workshop menu that streamlines navigation, allowing you to build quicker than ever before. We've arranged our thousands of items into main categories and subcategories. For example, our lighting main category now has multiple subcategories, such as freestanding lights and wall-mounted lights. An equally exciting addition within C.A.M.P. Revamp is that we're getting rid of our building restrictions regarding placement, allowing you to toggle snapping, intersecting, and free place anywhere. We see and hear you, Sky Campers. These changes allow you more freedom than ever to build in Appalachia. And to really show off our wonderful community's creativity, we'll be kicking off a series of exciting monthly camp building competitions later this year with huge prizes.</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout 76: C.A.M.P. Revamp - Developer Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hlz9Bqp26BU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As with any decent patch, though, C.A.M.P. Revamp doesn't actually improve just player bases in Fallout 76. For example, the Caravan event has been modified to ensure that players will get rewarded if the Brahmin is alive, even if they do not complete the route. The event now also has a maximum duration of seven minutes. </p>



<p>Item locking has been introduced as a means to prevent accidental scrapping of important items. Moreover, the developers (who have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-new-content-double-eleven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working alongside Double Eleven</a> for several years now) have pushed a new batch of combat balancing tweaks:</p>



<ul>
<li>Improving the manual aiming experience.</li>



<li>Improvements to the V.A.T.S. formula.</li>



<li>Providing significant buffs to melee and ranged weapon damage.</li>



<li>Boosts to damage-over-time effects.</li>



<li>Increases to weapon ranges.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>The new season, 'Appalachian Modern Living,' is now live in Fallout 76. In other Fallout news, take a look at the first trailer for the TV show's second season, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">airs on December 17</a>.</p>

<p>The most prominent Resident Evil leaker has doubled down on the claim that Resident Evil Requiem will release on Nintendo Switch 2 and PlayStation 4, albeit with a version that has some reduced visual effects. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about this, but with new power behind the claim, Dusk Golem has stressed that ‘five different people’ have corroborated this with them.</p>



<p>Fans are sceptical about Resident Evil Requiem dropping on PlayStation 4, but for the most part, they’re welcoming the Switch 2 release claims with open arms.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-resident-evil-requiem-coming-to-ps4">Is Resident Evil Requiem Coming to PS4?</h2>



<p>In a post <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963020567076077587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a>, Dusk Golem bolstered their claim that Resident Evil Requiem, which is shaping up to be one of 2026’s most highly anticipated titles, is coming to PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I won’t beat around the bush, Resident Evil Requiem should be releasing in PlayStation 4 &amp; Nintendo Switch 2, seems this was kinda’ known behind the scenes &amp; in the grapevine. I’m not the first person to say this publicly actually, just corroborating. </p>



<p>Talked about it with five different people in the last few weeks and know another guy with a good reputation said as much less than a week ago. </p>



<p>So not from me, but I have been hearing the same thing. Unsure if it’ll be at launch, and my guess is it’ll be a different version with different tech, sorta’ like the 360/PS3 &amp; Wii/PS2 era, since some features of Requiem like ray tracing are focused on modern platforms. But if the question is, is it happening or not, the answer pretty much is, yeah it’s happening.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth highlighting a few critical points about this post before going any further. While reputable, Dusk Golem stresses that much of this post is <strong>guesswork </strong>and that the ultimate delivery is built on a foundation of ‘<strong>pretty much</strong>‘.</p>



<p>Users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6zqzw/dusk_golem_doubles_down_on_resident_evil_requiem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Reddit</a> were quick to pick up this comment and try to rationalize it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Capcom’s president said that the price point of PS5 (in Japan, but he also mentions others regions) is a “barrier” for (people to buy) Monster Hunter Wilds. He also said Switch 2 reception was ahead of their predictions.</p>



<p>It’s not so hard to guess that a PS4 or Switch 2 port is coming after that.</p>



<p>But yeah, still crazy see publishers aiming games for PS4 while we see rumors about PS6.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On August 20, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new gameplay surfaced online</a>, showcasing the stunning visuals present in Resident Evil Requiem, which was revealed in June during Summer Game Fest.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-camp-revamp-update-notes-new-season-22-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-76-c-a-m-p-revamp-adds-long-awaited-features-to-build-mode.1287177/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 76 continues to live its best life, with Bethesda Game Studios pouring updates into the MMORPG ecosystem and fleshing out the post-apocalyptic landscape that joined the franchise way back in 2018. The latest update, C.A.M.P. Revamp, adds new build rules, a reworked UI, item locking, and introduces Season 22: Appalachian Modern Living.</p>



<p>This supersized update (1.7.21.25) is available to download now, and it’s set to change how you build C.A.M.P.s in Bethesda’s popular open-world multiplayer shooter that was, once upon a time, hugely divisive. It’s now the number-one played major Fallout game, how about that?</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-76-update-1-7-21-25-notes-in-full">Fallout 76 Update 1.7.21.25 Notes in Full</h2>



<p>In a post <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1962933445375480295" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a>, the team at Bethesda Game Studios outlined everything added in the C.A.M.P. Revamp update.</p>



<p>I have to lead with this, as I’m particularly excited about it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Snapping Items</strong></p>



<p>Items can still snap together in the way that they used to, but now items that used to require snapping are allowed to not snap. Over-snapping your walls to get wallpaper on both sides is also possible now. Walls can also be built beneath the floor, and upper floors can be attached to walls without the need for a staircase.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you know how insane it is that we can now add wallpaper to <strong>both sides of the wall?</strong> That has been a bugbear for me since day dot, and I’m so happy it has now finally been resolved.</p>



<p>Players will now also be able to alter the rules that control their C.A.M.P. builds, choosing between three new options:</p>



<ul>
<li>Snap Mode (Normal) – Place items the way you’re used to.</li>



<li>Collision Mode – Items will not auto-snap but will consider collisions.</li>



<li>Free Mode – No snapping and no collisions.</li>
</ul>



<p>Placement restrictions have also been opened up, which means that players can make some items float or break the rules of physics to create more interesting, free-flowing builds. Foundations have also been adjusted so that items that <strong>used to require </strong>them no longer will.</p>



<p>Before we go any further, here are the update sizes for 1.7.21.25:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC (Steam)</strong>: 9.9 GB</li>



<li><strong>PC (Microsoft Store)</strong>: 23 GB</li>



<li><strong>Xbox</strong>: 26.4 GB</li>



<li><strong>PlayStation</strong>: 25.6 GB</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-workshop-2-0-explained">Workshop 2.0 Explained</h3>



<p>Fallout 76 now has ‘Workshop 2.0’ in this latest update:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Coming along in this update is a complete rework of the Workshop menu! With a refreshed focus on findability and organization, this new UI should make it a lot easier for you to get to the items you need. We’ve been testing this internally and are excited for you to get your hands on it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This update incorporates a stack of new categories and subcategories, and there are <strong>dozens </strong>of them to make searching for and controlling furniture and item types a more granular process.</p>



<p>The modify menu has also received a sizeable facelift, with edit mode, wallpapers, locks, and blueprints all being overhauled. The team has also added a ‘Replace’ mode, which allows you to swap placed items without needing to scrap and rebuild them. Again, that’s a lifesaver for avid C.A.M.P. builders.</p>



<h2 id="h-elsewhere-in-the-season-22-update">Elsewhere in the Season 22 Update</h2>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios also added Item Locking as part of the update that introduces Season 22: Appalachian Modern Living:</p>

<p>On October 7, ‘Mischief Night’ returns to Appalachia, and the arrival of Season 22 brings about changes to combat, manual aim, V.A.T.S., weapon mods, and perks. There’s so much to learn about these combat changes that Bethesda penned <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/3T4SEomfktJyMolMvpvUp5/fallout-76-c-a-m-p-revamp-combat-release-notes-full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an entirely separate blog post</a>.</p>



<p>I can’t stress how huge this update is. It impacts everything from fishing (added in Gone Fission), world events, creatures, skill books, outfits, and food. It’s super sizeable, but it’s still not the ‘biggest update ever’ that Bethesda has been touting for a while.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Stellar Blade was one of the standout titles of 2024, emerging as a new IP with fantastic combat mechanics and an intriguing story. It also helped that the protagonist, Eve, was able to lure in many gamers on account of her character model being just a little bit scandalous.</p>



<p>Insane body model aside, Stellar Blade represented something fresh and energetic, and it offered intense boss battles, a killer soundtrack, and a lot of meat on the bones, enough to keep gamers occupied for many hours.</p>



<p>Now, a sequel has been confirmed as being in development.</p>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-2-is-being-developed-by-shift-up">Stellar Blade 2 is Being Developed by Shift Up</h2>



<p>In a recent financial update, Shift Up confirmed that a sequel to 2024’s Stellar Blade is in active development. It was just a few <strong>weeks </strong>after the game was released that Shift Up announced an intention to make a sequel, but now those cogs are actively turning.</p>



<p>Here’s a snippet of that <a href="https://dart.fss.or.kr/dsaf001/main.do?rcpNo=20250814004388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">financial report</a>, translated by <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/1963102317886283809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki_JPN</a> on X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are actively pursuing the franchise development of the ‘Stellar Blade’ IP and are currently developing a sequel to ‘Stellar Blade’.</p>



<p>This sequel will inherit the action-packed nature of the original ‘Stellar Blade’ while incorporating an expanded worldview and enhanced gameplay, further solidifying its position as a franchise IP. We anticipate that this will result in even greater success than the original.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stellar Blade continued to be a rampant success this year, with Shift Up releasing the game on PC. The anticipation was so high that it hit one million sales <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-pc-hit-1-million-sales-faster-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19 times faster</a> </strong>on PC than it did when it originally launched on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>It was also said earlier this year that the intention is to release a Stellar Blade sequel by 2027, so we won’t have to wait too long. Not only that, but Shift Up is considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-devs-are-considering-a-switch-2-port-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Switch 2 port</a> for the first Stellar Blade game.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade was one of my favorite games of 2024, which is strange, because the genre isn’t usually one that would attract me. I was won over by the post-apocalyptic setting, the accessible boss battles, and the plot. Definitely the plot.</p>



<p>Do you want to see Stellar Blade 2 emerge soon? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
