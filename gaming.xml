According to the post, the layoffs are due to the fact that the company has completed one of its "mandates," and presumably has no other work to reassign the employees to.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>"Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end," the statement reads. "It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>"These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition."</span></span></p>

<p>Fable, set for release in 2026.</p>

</article><p><span><span>The statement goes on to mention that, despite laying off people related to that former, unnamed mandate, "Eidos-Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development." The only public project the developer is currently working on is Fable, which it's assisting the main team at Playground on, but it's unclear whether that's a project Eidos-Montréal will continue to work on or the mandate it recently completed.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Over the past few years, layoffs have decimated the gaming workforce, affecting tens of thousands of people. The last news story posted on </span></span><span><span>Game Informer</span></span><span><span> before our closure last year was about </span></span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/31/bungie-lays-off-over-200-employees-announces-plans-for-deeper-integration-with-sony"><span><span><span><span>200 people losing their jobs at Bungie</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>. On the other hand, one of the first stories written upon our return was about </span></span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/24/united-videogame-workers-cwa-is-the-first-industry-wide-video-game-union"><span><span><span><span>the creation of a gaming industry-wide union</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>As always, the hearts of </span></span><span><span>Game Informer's </span></span><span><span>staff are with those affected by these layoffs, as well as those still at the studio.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/31/take-two-ceo-on-gta-6-release-date-we-want-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-the<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In a video interview with <em>Bloomberg</em> last Friday, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick discussed, among other topics, <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/news/2023/12/04/grand-theft-auto-vi-revealed-with-first-official-trailer-alongside-2025-release">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. Although he, unsurprisingly, doesn’t spill the beans on the release date, Zelnick provided some insight into Take-Two and Rockstar’s reasoning for keeping fans waiting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the interview, Zelnick was asked the million-dollar question: when is GTA VI launching and why is Take-Two/Rockstar keeping it such a big secret? Zelnick responded:</p>

<p>“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property. And I’ve been around the block a few times, and I’ve been in every entertainment business there is. We want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. And we do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we’ve found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement, on the one hand, and balance the excitement on that anticipation. And we don’t always get it exactly right, but that’s what we’re trying to do.”</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0M53-LKlECk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Earlier in the interview, Zelnick was asked to explain the 12-year wait between GTA V, released in 2013, and GTA VI, providing additional context for Rockstar’s release cadence:</p>

<p>“Well, there are really two reasons,” says Zelnick. “We set an intention to rest our intellectual properties. So some of our competitors come to market very regularly, maybe even annually, with their titles. We only annualize our sports entertainment titles. For our non-sports titles, we think you need to create enormous anticipation, on the one hand. And of course on the other hand, it takes a long time to develop these big robust experiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do, and perfection’s a pretty high bar. It takes a long time. And the reflection of that approach is in the success of Grand Theft Auto V, which has actually excelled in three console generations, which is extraordinary…so think of the high bar that that creates for us, of course, but much more so for the consumer.”</p>

</article><p>Grand Theft Auto VI was announced in December 2023. Set in a modern-day Vice City (which is modeled after Miami and South Florida), it appears to star two protagonists, including the series' first female lead, although Rockstar has not yet divulged details on these characters or their relationship with each other. The reveal trailer became a massive success, <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/news/2023/12/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-surpasses-100-million-views-breaks-record-for-most">garnering over 100 million views</a> in just a few days and setting a YouTube record for most views within a 24-hour period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is slated to release sometime this year on consoles. A PC version has yet to be confirmed, though if it does launch on the platform, it will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter">likely arrive later</a>.

Eidos-Montréal, the Embracer-owned studio currently providing support on Microsoft's Fable reboot, is laying off "up to" 75 members of staff, saying it doesn't "have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services."
</p>
<p>
News of the layoffs - which follows 97 job cuts at Eidos-Montréal last year - was confirmed in a <a href="https://x.com/EidosMontreal/status/1906728993061020142">statement shared on social media</a>. "Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members," the studio wrote, "as one of our mandates is coming to an end. It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don't have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.
</p>
<p>
"These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market," the statement continued, "and we are working to support them through this transition. Eidos-Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development."
</p>
<p>
Eidos-Montréal's most recent game, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, released in 2021 when the studio was still owned by publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>. Following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">purchase by Embracer Group in 2022</a>, however, it was reportedly set to work creating a new game in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> series - a project that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-in-development-for-two-years">canned last year amid a devastating programme of "restructuring" and cost cutting at Embracer Group</a> that resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">over 4500 job losses across the company</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, it's been confirmed Eidos-Montréal is assisting Microsoft's Playground Games as the Xbox studio attempts to get its long-awaited - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-fable-reboot-delayed-into-next-year">recently delayed</a> - Fable reboot over the finish line. Today's statement suggests Fable isn't Eidos-Montréal's only project, but it's unclear what else the studio may be working on at present.
</p>
<p>
Layoffs have continued to blight the games industry in 2025 following an already devastating few years which have seen over 25,000 employees lose their jobs since the start of 2023. So far this year, <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">1200 layoffs have been recorded</a>, affecting workers across the likes of Unity, PlayStation, Ubisoft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a>, Sumo Digital, Splash Damage, Bossa Studios, Night School, and Cyan, Inc. Results of a GDC State of the Games Industry survey shared earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gdcs-state-of-the-games-industry-survey-says-one-in-ten-respondents-laid-off-in-2024">revealed one in 10 of the 3000 developers canvassed were laid off in 2024</a>.

                <p>ROG has released a brand new teaser trailer for a seemingly new handheld device that it's working on. Though this announcement is exciting as is, the official Xbox X account offered a cheeky response to the trailer, fueling rumors that a collaboration between the two companies could be in the works.</p><p>Originally shown on Twitter, ROG's trailer shows a the company's mascot, Omni, messing with some sort of technological chamber. When it goes inside, the machine's shaking causes a ROG Ally and a controller to fly into the chamber with it. Unable to stop the process, Omni then emerges from the chamber, merged with the handheld and controller, hinting at some sort of new handheld being int he works.</p><p>Xbox then <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to the trailer with a meme,</a> seemingly confirming that it's involved somehow.</p><p>There have been reports of an Xbox handheld in the works, and that Microsoft would be working with third-party vendors in order to make them. This initiative is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/" data-ref-id="1100-6530020">reportedly called Project Kennan,</a> could very well be the same handheld device ROG is teasing in its latest trailer.</p><p><span>In other Xbox news, Microsoft is also reportedly developing its </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next generation console already</a><span>. According to current rumors, the system will</span><span> reportedly be </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/" data-ref-id="1100-6529996">more like a PC than a traditional console</a><span> and is </span><span>scheduled for a 2027 launch. It's also possible that this handheld could be a stepping stone to see if Microsoft could create a first-party handheld for the next Xbox like Valve with the Steam Deck or Sony with the PlayStation Portal.</span></p>

With the launch of Season 3 and return of Verdansk, Activision is looking to crack down on cheaters and provide a hacker-free experience for players. Part of this change will finally give console players the ability to turn off cross-play in standard Black Ops 6 multiplayer matches, as this feature was previously only available to disable in Ranked Play mode.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Season 3 is also bringing other new anti-cheat efforts. Activision recently released a new blog that detailed several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-call-of-duty-is-stepping-up-efforts-to-fight-cheaters/1100-6530471/">changes for Call of Duty Season 3 meant to help prevent cheaters</a> across Black Ops 6 and Warzone. This includes shutting down several Call of Duty cheat providers, upgrading Ricochet features, and making changes to Ranked Play. The publisher is even going as far as issuing temporary bans and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-is-cracking-down-on-call-of-duty-camo-cheaters/1100-6530470/">removing illegally-obtained camos mid-match</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This Call of Duty season is so massive that the update will be split up for release over two separate days. Black Ops 6 arrives for multiplayer and Zombies on April 2, while Warzone will go offline temporarily and return with its own update on April 3.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-season-3-adds-iconic-mp-map-new-zombies-plus-jay-and-silent-bob/2900-6380/">The Season 3 update for Black Ops 6</a> adds a brand-new battle pass, more DLC weapons, operator skins, multiplayer maps, new game modes, and the Shattered Veil Zombies map. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-season-3-roadmap-highlights-verdansk-event-omnimovement-changes-and-bots/2900-6375/#7">Season 3 of Warzone</a> adds the Verdansk map with classic features, original Gulag design, and 150-player matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision has released the full <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-3-patch-notes-black-ops-6-and-warzone-update-adds-major-movement-changes-camo-hub/2900-6387/#1">patch notes for Season 3 of Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>, which in addition to the cross-play changes, details movement adjustments and weapon balances across both games.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> developer Capcom has announced that layered weapons, Arch Tempered Monsters, PC improvements, and new monsters are all headed to the hit action-RPG. However, players could be waiting awhile for all these new features to drop.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-a-massive-milestone-free-item-pack-coming-to-celebrate/1100-6530490/">Monster Hunter Wilds selling 10 million copies</a>, Capcom released a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter/" rel="nofollow ">letter from the game's director</a>, which includes some information about future updates. Amongst those announcements was the reveal that layered weapons, which is the ability to change the appearance of weapons, is coming in the future, although no other details were given. The letter also revealed that Arch Tempered monsters will be added in the future, starting with Arch Tempered Rey Dau on April 30 as part of a limited-time event quest. These fights will offer even more challenging hunts than normal Tempered monsters.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="936014795" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <p>
Following recent claims Microsoft's much-rumoured handheld Xbox will arrive later this year in collaboration with an unspecified "PC gaming OEM", hardware manufacturer ASUS has shared a teaser trailer suggesting the machine is real and set to be revealed soon.
</p>
<p>
Word that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">Microsoft was partnering with a third-party company to release an Xbox-branded handheld this year</a> first surfaced via Windows Central, which reported the device was being developed under the codename Keenan and would look "unmistakably 'Xbox'", sporting familiar design sensibilities and even an Xbox guide button.
</p>
<p>
Skip ahead a couple of weeks and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXzXhezpSF4">ASUS has now shared a teaser</a> for what appears to be its next-generation ASUS ROG Ally gaming handheld - a video that doesn't perhaps <em>immediately</em> scream Xbox with its magenta hues and weird dabbing robot. However, at one point during its brisk runtime, a ROG Ally and Xbox-style controller are seen hurtling through the air before disappearing into a machine where some sort of fusing process unfolds.

<p>
The inference is clear enough, but Microsoft's involvement in the project was seemingly all but confirmed when Xbox's official social media account <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708">replied to ASUS' teaser post</a> with the side-eye monkey meme. Obviously, all this stays in the 'speculation' bucket until either party is ready to go beyond memes and teases, but the pieces are undoubtedly starting to fall into place.
</p>
<p>
According to Windows Central's previous report, this year's Xbox-branded handheld will be something of a stop gap while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">Microsoft continues developing its own Xbox gaming handheld</a> internally. The company's said to be targeting a 2027 launch for this other machine, which will reportedly arrive alongside an Xbox Series X/S successor and "several new controller options".
</p>
<p>
However things pan out, it's a pretty exciting time in the world of handheld gaming - not least because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">Sony is reportedly also working on its own handheld device</a> in the form of portable PS5, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo's hugely anticipated Switch 2 is just days away from its big reveal</a>.

Fingers crossed for Baldur’s Village.” </p><p>Larian Studios decided to move on to other projects instead of making <em>Baldur’s Gate 4</em>, and an executive at Hasbro, which owns Wizards of the Coast, recently told fans the company is taking its time with the project but will have details to begin sharing soon. “We’re going to take a very measured approach,” VP of digital games Dan Ayoub <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>IGN</em></a></span> earlier this month. “We’ve got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We’re starting to think about, okay, yeah, we’re ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we’re going to have some other things to talk about around that.”</p><p>Apparently someone at Hasbro or Wizards thinks a fan mashup of <em>BG3</em> and one of the most popular games of all time in a non-competing genre might get in the way of whatever it’s doing with the franchise. Vincke wasn’t impressed with the move. “Free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> on Monday. “Imho they shouldn’t be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property.”<br></p><p>He continued, “Protecting your IP can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled. There are good ways of dealing with this.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And now, Vincke has responded to the takedown as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wizards-of-the-coast-scores-pr-masterstroke-bullies-bg3-stardew-mod-that-had-swen-vinckes-personal-approval-off-the-internet-with-a-dmca/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by PC Gamer</a>, the mod in question is entitled "Baldur's Village" and incorporates Baldur's Gate 3 characters into Stardew Valley. The mod <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/swen-vincke-stamps-seal-of-approval-on-stardew-valley-mod-that-yoinks-the-baldurs-gate-3-cast-out-of-d-and-d-and-into-a-cosy-pastoral-life/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released earlier this month</a>, and shortly after, Vincke took to Twitter to praise it, saying "So much love went into this - amazing work!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, just weeks later, the mod is gone. According to a Nexus Mods spokesperson speaking t PC Gamer, Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Baldur's Gate IP holder Wizards of the Coast has issued a DMCA takedown of the mod. "Hopefully, this is an oversight from WotC, who often use external agencies to hunt down violating content, and they will revert their decision," said the spokesperson. "Fingers crossed for Baldur's Village."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, just today, Vincke commented on the situation again on Twitter, once again expressing support for the mod while acknowledging that IP protection is tricky:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Protecting your IP can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled.

"Imho they shouldn't be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property. Protecting your IP can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled. There are good ways of dealing with this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's possible this is part of a larger crackdown from Wizards of the Coast around Baldur's Gate. As we learned at the Game Developers Conference earlier this month, we're supposedly going to hear more about what the company has planned for the IP "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says">in pretty short order</a>", so maybe this free Stardew Valley mod was somehow in conflict with that. Or maybe it was a mistake that will quickly be rectified. We've reached out to Wizards of the Coast for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

I realize $400 seems like the lowest possible price for the tech, and Nintendo is known for never selling consoles at a loss, but I also think there’s a reason it went for the LCD instead of the OLED. I have a feeling it’s going to be $350.</p><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen:</strong> Finally, I get a chance to bring out my magical crystal ball that can tell the future.

Also I think it makes a separate bundle with a game for $500 an easy upsell. There will also be some question about how much of the sticker price is in anticipation of consequences from Trump’s ongoing trade war. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b7cbe8f4a008feb85b78bf15c582bf3f" data-recommend-id="image://b7cbe8f4a008feb85b78bf15c582bf3f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1333" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A photo shows a store shelf for Nintendo products.

The only thing I really desperately want and need at the launch of Switch 2 is a shiny new 3D <em>Mario </em>game. Give me a new <em>Mario </em>game as big and awesome as <em>Odyssey</em>, and I’ll buy a Switch 2 on day one. Considering the last big 3D <em>Mario </em>game was <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, released in 2017, it seems like we are due for a new one.</p><p><strong>John Walker: </strong>It’d be weird if there weren’t a new <em>Super Mario</em>, right? My wish is for something that realizes the amazing promise of <em>Bowser’s Fury</em>, an open-world-ish 3D <em>Mario</em> game with all the imaginative innovations Nintendo could do with all that space. It’d be <em>crazy</em> if there weren’t <em>Wind Waker</em> and <em>Twilight Princess</em> remakes, but then it’s been <em>crazy</em> that those haven’t happened for every year of the original Switch, too. Can we all agree to collectively boo if there’s word of a <em>Pikmin 5</em>?</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> <em>Breath of the Wild 3 </em>and a <em>Pokemon MMO</em>.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> <em>Donkey Kong Country 6</em>, some first-party gimmick party game called, like, <em>Mouse Attack</em> or something, and a port of <em>Sea of Thieves</em>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8997bcdff410a320304a57d189ed8068" data-recommend-id="image://8997bcdff410a320304a57d189ed8068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 displays a patent for the Joy-Con mouse functionality.

Paying extra for this will also be the only way to utilize voice chat. The Virtual Console will return to the eShop, but NES games will be $10 each, with $10 added on for each subsequent console generation. There will be no built-in social media sharing.

That would be a really boring answer. Another option is that C stands for connect and this will be the button you use to sync stuff or maybe even connect to an OG Switch? The wildest idea I’ve come up with: The C button stands for camera. In this scenario, you’ll be able to hit it, and the Switch 2 controller will become a virtual in-game camera controlled via motion in games that support photo modes. The truth is that I don’t know what the C button will do, but hopefully it’s not something annoying that makes me hate using the Switch 2.</p><p>  <strong>John Walker:</strong> I’m at my most pessimistic here. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307">I’ve bemoaned previously</a></span>, I think this is just going to be a better Switch, and as such lack that Nintendo weirdness you’d usually expect in a follow-up console. I really hope I’m wrong, and that mysterious button causes games to climb out of the screen or something. </p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard: </strong>C stands for “Car horn,” so the Switch 2 honks if you press it.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach: </strong>The C button stands for ChatGPT integration and will summon a Shigeru Miyamoto MiiBot that gives you tips for playing games. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7bbe6298886a467edc1476828a1292f9" data-recommend-id="image://7bbe6298886a467edc1476828a1292f9" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 sits in a dock.

Interestingly, I wonder if the Steam Deck’s success in recent years has helped devs get better at optimizing settings for a portable, smaller device with a limited battery. If so, that could be very helpful for Switch 2 ports.</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> It will be powerful enough to run old Switch games like they should have run on the last one, god willing.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> People are going to be asking for a Switch 2 Pro by Christmas. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="25d90edbff26f6fa55f946ab4205712b" data-recommend-id="image://25d90edbff26f6fa55f946ab4205712b" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cartridge is shown being inserted into a Switch 2.

I expect that for the following 20 months or so, getting your hands on a Switch 2 will involve scanning Discord servers, religiously following Wario64 on Twitter for stock updates, and being ready to drop everything at a moment’s notice to snag one before a thousand resellers show up with bots to vacuum up any units that arrive in warehouses or stores. Or you might be able to pay triple the price to get a Switch 2 via eBay. But don’t do that. Don’t reward the resellers.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> Absolutely not. I think pre-orders might be touch-and-go, especially if there’s little to no scalper protection and resellers are inflating demand. But I also think Nintendo delayed this console by a full year to make sure it had enough stock so that you could walk into a Target or Best Buy once school is out and upgrade to a Switch 2. The alternative is Nintendo risks a small but not insignificant group of Switch owners upgrading to a PS5 or Steam Deck instead. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="477cfa797b2be5fdf0b5ff67d0836cea" data-recommend-id="image://477cfa797b2be5fdf0b5ff67d0836cea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Master Chief Collection appears on Switch 2.

Rockstar brought the <em>GTA Trilogy</em> to Switch, as well as some other games. But <em>GTA V </em>remains unavailable on Nintendo hardware. That’s a huge market that could be buying Shark Cards in <em>GTA Online</em>. And with <em>GTA 6</em> unlikely to arrive on Switch 2, <em>GTA V </em>might be the next best thing. And hey, maybe a <em>GTA IV </em>port, too. I also wouldn’t be shocked if some more Xbox games arrived on Switch 2.<em> Forza Horizon 5 </em>on a Switch 2 sounds splendid. </p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> I expect Microsoft to load up the Switch 2 with former Xbox console exclusives including <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>, the rumored <em>Gears of War </em>anthology, <em>Diablo 4</em>, and a bunch of other games. <em>Elden Ring</em> is a riskier but more exciting bet. But I’ll go big and say <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> comes to Switch 2 before the end of 2025!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered makes its bow on PC, broadening the game’s availability. The survival title already looked unbelievable on consoles, so let’s tell you its PC specs and system requirements to have you clacking at Clickers in no time.</p>



<p>The Last of Us Part 1 Remastered came to PC, so it makes sense for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-2-remastered-announces-free-no-return-content-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> to follow suit. Naughty Dog’s award-winning sequel is here in all its remastered and revitalized glory. It features the complete dual-narrative of The Last of Us Part 2 but comes with lots of new features.</p>



<p>Not everyone’s PC setup is the same. This is why system requirements are important before a game’s release. Naughty Dog has unveiled the entire list of PC specs and requirements here, and you should look to see which tier you are compatible with.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_part_ii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Part 2</a> Remastered’s requirements are split into four categories: <strong>Minimum, Recommended, High, and Very High</strong> settings. Minimum is what you need to run Part 2 at all. We need to hit these requirements to ensure the game works and we don’t run into any problems.</p>



<p>The game runs better the closer you get to “Very High.” This is reserved for the most elite gaming configurations though, so don’t be disheartened if you fall short of the requirements.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s every set of system requirements for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/want-to-know-the-best-way-to-gain-attention-on-steam-add-a-demo-<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2023 gave Steam quite the scare. The premiere PC gaming marketplace saw a major downturn in revenue for new games, pushing Valve to put significant work into new features that would drive engagement and sales on the platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Their main priority? Pushing developers to add demos and putting those demos in front of as many players as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In 2023, Valve actually made less money from new games, it actually declined," said game marketing strategist Chris Zukowski. "All of 2024 was them pushing out features, thinking that they needed to fix the issue. They Flooded the store with features that all focus on demos. Valve was saying, in not so subtle terms, that everyone needs to make a demo."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Everything is demo oriented">Everything is demo oriented</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zukowski gave a talk on navigating these new Steam features at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. We sat down with him after the talk to dive into the topic in more detail. The main point of the talk was that demos are the key to getting discovered on Steam. It's natural, according to Zukowski, that interest in your game will have a greater chance at visibility if you give streamers a way to play.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For most games, social media doesn't work," Zukowski said. "And the reason is streamers can play a demo. Streamers can't play a screenshot. They need the demo, and when they play it on stream, it brings their audience."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/-the-public-are-kinda-crazy-palworld-developer-pocketpair-underlines-the-human-cost-of-success" target="_self" data-discover="true">'The public are kinda crazy:' Palworld developer Pocketpair underlines the human cost of success</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the majority of the talk was focused on demos, Zukowski also elaborated on what else developers can do to get exposure for their demo and game. It involves launching a page, gathering some sort of audience, and then running a playtest in order to drum up interest. Developers only have one shot at releasing a demo and leaving a good impression, and a playtest can give them a chance to "iron out the kinks" according to Zukowski. He estimated, from extensive data, that 100 concurrent players may be the threshold to being discovered by the algorithm.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The real revelation is that a demo launch is front page featuring now," Zukowski said. "It's big, but you have to have an existing audience and you have to have enough players simultaneously playing your demo for the Steam algorithm to put you on the front page."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zukowski was insistent that you can't just throw a game page up on Steam, launch a demo, and then expect success. It's not that easy for developers to get discovered in a marketplace that sees thousands of new games released every year.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The playtest is like priming the pump," Zukowski said. "It's getting the pump working."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/senua-s-saga-hellblade-ii-dominates-bafta-games-awards-2025-nominations" target="_self" data-discover="true">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II dominates BAFTA Games Awards 2025 nominations</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zukowski brought up several specific examples of games using this method within the past year. Some had been near dormant for months, sometimes years, before running a playtest and then launching a demo. Those games' wishlist numbers shot up soon after.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A common mentality: release demos close to a game launch, so that players could try the experience and have it be top-of-mind when the full game hits. Zukowski refutes that idea, saying that momentum doesn't play a role in smaller game launches. The games are so small that a big influx of players, especially a long way from launch, is better than trying to set up some sort of curated event around launch.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The good, the bad, and the AI slop">The good, the bad, and the AI slop</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One point brought up during Steam Next Fest was that these new demo and discovery features elevated almost every game who utilized the feature on Steam, including what some journalists called "AI slop."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Day one of Next Fest, everyone gets a certain amount of impressions," Zukowski said, adding that wishlist numbers will impact how many impressions a game may get at first. On day two, Zukowski pointed out that Steam had given visibility to everyone, including games many considered poor quality. "That's Steam giving everyone visibility."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Steam's algorithm then gives certain games more of a boost based on impressions and other statistics. Games that don't get that attention will sink to the bottom, having wasted their chance at gaining players while showcased on the front page.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/astro-bot-and-black-myth-wukong-take-the-lead-in-gdca-2025-nominations" target="_self" data-discover="true">Astro Bot and Black Myth: Wukong take the lead in GDCA 2025 nominations</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The system that Steam is using for demos is brand new. It's not even a year old in its current iteration. The main question that popped into my mind was, "How well with all this work in a few years after demos have flooded the store just as much as other games have?" Zukowski's answer was that discoverability isn't that much of an issue to begin with.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He showed me a graph that he had removed from his talk, as it would "take too much time to explain" as part of his current presentation. It showed how many games were released per year on Steam and how many games of that number actually received more than 50 reviews.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From 2019 to 2024, several thousands more games were released each year, culminating in over 18,000 games in 2024. However, only a little over 4,000 of those games actually received more than 50 reviews. The same went for every year, where only a fraction of the games released picked up any traction on Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think the problem is that [...] a lot of people are making their first game. They don't know how to make the type of game the Steam audience likes, or aren't skilled enough, or it's just their first game. I think the biggest limiting factor is not visibility, Steam gives us a ton of visibility," Zukowksi said, adding that Steam players have a certain taste. "Demos give everyone a better chance to see these games and make a judgement."</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been an massive success for publisher Capcom, but not everybody's happy on PC, where the game has been repeatedly lambasted for its poor performance. Finally, however, a month after its release, Capcom has revealed a first round of performance-related PC improvements is coming later this week.
</p>
<p>
Capcom shared the news in a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter/">lengthy post from Monster Hunter Wilds game director Yuya Tokuda</a> over on the official Monster Hunter website. After thanking players for their support amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-rises-beyond-another-impressive-milestone-in-first-month">Wilds' impressive 10m sales milestone</a>, Tokuda began detailing some of the improvements the developer is targeting in response to player feedback.
</p>
<p>
The big one, for PC players at least, is the promise of improved game stability. "The team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements where possible," Tokuda wrote, "especially on the Steam version. This will be an ongoing process, where we'll aim to make continual steps forward in this area and respond to critical issues."
</p>

<figcaption>Here's Alex with the full lowdown on Monster Hunter Wilds' PC release.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yhacyXcizA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The good news is Capcom's first round of performance-related PC improvements is set to arrive very soon - as part of Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1 this Thursday, 3rd April. This'll include a promised reduction in VRAM usage, as well as an upgrade to the DirectStorage version on Steam - both of which "should result in an overall improvement in stability for our PC players", according to Capcom.
</p>
<p>
Notably, VRAM usage and DirectStorage issues were both highlighted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">Digital Foundry's review of Monster Hunter Wilds on PC</a>, in which Alex Battaglia detailed the games "profound performance problems" and "substantial" technical issues. At the time, Alex advised "caution" for higher-end GPU owners, but flat-out recommended anyone with lower-end graphics cards "avoid" Wilds until Capcom could improve the situation - so hopefully this week's update will bring meaningful changes ahead of promised "continued improvements" in future patches.
</p>
<p>
Away from PC performance, Tokuda highlighted some other areas the team is targeting. There's talk of weapon balance adjustments, for instance, which are set to be implemented "gradually" with each new title update. As for quality of life changes, Capcom says it's currently looking to make it easier for players to access information they require through UI/UX improvements, alongside "additional adjustments... to further enhance the overall feel of the game to curate an even smoother gameplay experience."
</p>
<p>
Capcom says to expect changes making it easier to restock items, check skill information, participate in multiplayer quests, and use the Seikret. Additionally, improved camera behaviour during hunts is also on the developer's to-do list. More generally, the team is planning to "take a wider look at overall gameplay flow, which encompasses a range of things, such as the in-game economy, balance and other areas." This, it says, will "require more time for preparation".
</p>
<p>
Alongside the aforementioned PC performance improvements, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-content-update-detailed-ahead-of-next-weeks-release">this week's Monster Hunter Wilds title update</a> introduces a new social hub and a range of new monsters, including bubble dragon Mizutsune, a High Rank version of Zoh Shia, and the arch-tempered Rey Dau. Notably, Tokuda's blog stresses additional tough monsters are on the way, following criticism of Wilds' low difficulty at launch. May's update, for instance - which previously appeared to be relatively small in scope - will bring tempered variants of Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad. Additionally, more "challenging monsters will also appear in future updates".
</p>
<p>
"We will continue to add new elements and content to make Monster Hunter Wilds even more enjoyable for all hunters through our free content updates," Tokuda concluded, "while at the same time making further improvements and adjustments to the game."

<p>As mentioned in its initial announcement, the game will support 1v1, 2v2, and free-for-all formats.

The press release also confirms that gameplay demos will be coming to both dedicated Riot and tabletop events.</p>

<p><em>Riftbound: League of Legends Trading Card Game</em> is the latest expansion to Riot's multimillion-dollar franchise.

<p>The <em>Riftbound: League of Legends Trading Card Game</em> will be available in China in Summer 2025, in English-speaking countries October 2025, with additional regional rollouts following in 2026.</p>

Since then, Rockstar has shared no new official screenshots, videos, or trailers for the upcoming open-world sequel.

The CEO laughed and gave a big grin before answering that the date is a secret because they want to keep fans excited. </p><p>“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property,” said the former 20th Century FOX President. “And I’ve been around the block a few times and I’ve been in every entertainment business there is, and we want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.”</p><p>Of course, he fails to mention that at this stage Rockstar Games likely hasn’t committed to a release date yet. And any internal dates or milestones are still very fluid.

And we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation. I don’t always get it exactly right, but that’s what we’re trying to do.”</p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">We at <em>Kotaku </em>predict, based on various factors</a></span>, that<em> GTA 6</em> will arrive in late October.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-mario-kart-9-1851772264?_gl=1*g6doqr*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0NzM3OS40Ni4wLjE3NDM0NDczODIuNTcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-mario-kart-9-1851772264?_gl=1*g6doqr*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0NzM3OS40Ni4wLjE3NDM0NDczODIuNTcuMC4w"> And with theSwitch 2 reportedly launching in June</a></span> and Take-Two’s <em>other</em> big game, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, arriving in late September, I’d hazard a guess that <em>GTA 6</em>'s second trailer might drop in early August or perhaps the last week of July.

            <p>IGN Entertainment (Eurogamer's parent company) has officially announced that IGN Live will run in LA from 7-8 June, 2025.</p>
<p>The fan-focused event, which takes place during summer's video game event season, is being held in downtown Los Angeles at Magic Box @ The Reef. Currently the confirmed list of studios, publishers, and brands includes Netflix, 2K Sports, Lenovo, and Arcade1Up, with more set to be announced soon. IGN Live will feature playable games on PCs, consoles, and handheld devices, plus gameplay and trailer reveals, celebrity panels, merch giveaways, a live DJ and more. It's not just video games, either, with the show aiming to be a celebration of games, movies, TV, comics, collectables and more.</p>
<p>Tickets can be bought now from <a href="http://ign.com/live">IGN</a> at a reduced price compared to buying at the door.</p>
<p>Ticket prices are detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early bird, single day tickets: $15 USD</li>
<li>Early bird weekend/VIP tickets: $30</li>
<li>Regular pricing, single day tickets: $25</li>
<li>Regular pricing, weekend/VIP tickets: $40</li>
<li>Single day tickets at the door: $30</li>
<li>Weekend/VIP tickets at the door: $45</li>
</ul>
<p>Act early if you want the cheapest prices, with early bird tickets only available until 30th April. A VIP pass also includes a goodie bag containing exclusive items valued at $40. You can still save money on the door price if you buy tickets online after 30th April.</p>
<p>If you can't make it to LA in June, IGN will be livestreaming the entire weekend event across IGN platforms, including IGN.com, YouTube, Twitch, social channels, and more.</p>
<p>IGN Live 2024 saw a number of big-name guests and reveals including <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-might-debut-an-unnamed-tolkien-character-ign-live-2024">The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power cast</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/phil-spencer-talks-xbox-showcase-studio-closures-xbox-handheld-and-more-ign-live-2024">Xbox’s Phil Spencer</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/assassins-creed-shadows-why-its-the-right-time-for-the-series-to-go-to-japan-ign-live-2024">Ubisoft discussing Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/johnny-rico-recruits-roughnecks-for-starship-troopers-extermination-ign-live-2024">Casper van Dien talking Starship Troopers: Extermination</a>.</p>

<p>Sort-of-E3 replacement, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-dates-confirmed">Summer Game Fest</a>, kicks off on 6th June, and it's fair to expect showcase videos from the major players at around that time, too, with reveals of games due this year and beyond.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
