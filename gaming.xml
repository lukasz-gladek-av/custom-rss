		<p>Annapurna Interactive has announced a trio of new games in a digital showcase for Tokyo Game Show 2025, all three of which can be played by visitors to the Makahuri Messe this weekend. From the residential care of D-topia, to musical RPG action of People of Note and classic action-adventuring of Demi and the Fractured Dream, let’s dive in:</p>
<h3>D-topia</h3>
<p><em>Coming in 2026 to PS5, XSX|S, Switch, Switch 2 and PC</em></p>
<p><iframe title="D-topia | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/up28VDHtDgU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from Marumittu Games, assume the role of a resident maintenance worker at the D-topia residential facility, addressing citizen’s concerns, solving puzzles and uncovering secrets. Is this AI managed utopia everything it seems? There’s puzzle-adventuring with exploration and narrative choices that aims to get back to the human heart as opposed to the AI management.</p>

<h3>People of Note</h3>
<p><em>Coming in 2026 to PS5, XSX|S and PC</em></p>
<p><iframe title="People of Note | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXjlS7DLP4I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developed by Iridium Studios, People of Note is a musical narrative adventure wrapped around a turn-based role-playing game. It’s a full-on musical with heartfelt song and choreography through musical sequences, but that’s also fed into the battle system and game mechanics through musical expressions and abilities.</p>
<h3>Demi and the Fractured Dream</h3>
<p><em>Coming in 2026 to PS5, XSX|S, Switch, Switch 2 and PC</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Demi and the Fractured Dream | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWZHj4OraIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Demi and the Fractured Dream is a tribute to classic action-adventure games from developer Yarn Owl, focusing on nostalgic hack and slash combat and environmental puzzle and platforming. Demi is a voidsent person who’s been born into the world of Somnus and is now seeking away to escape his fate, following a mysterious voice and helped by an acolyte on his adventure across dangerous lands.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Mario Kart World review, Stefan said, <em>“Mario Kart World takes that big and bold step into a different style of racing. A big open world, bigger lobbies, and a Battle Royale style multiplayer mode add up to a Mario Kart that is both familiar and refreshingly new. It’s not as tightly tuned as Mario Kart 8 was, but this is still a lot of fun, and essential for the Nintendo Switch 2.”</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot%E2%80%99s-fighting-game-2xko-to-launch-early-access-on-october-7.1306257/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Riot Games has announced the launch date for the early access version of 2XKO, its long-awaited fighting game. 2XKO will open its gates to all PC players on October 7, just as the currently ongoing Closed Beta ends. </p>



<p>The developers said the newest playable characters, Vi and Blitzcrank, have been quickly adopted by the fans, who have also already organized many community tournaments during this Closed Beta test. Meanwhile, Riot has been tuning matchmaking and fixing bugs, and they reckon everything has held up well enough so far, giving them the proverbial green light for the next step.</p>



<p>The early access version will add Combo Trials, a full season worth of content, and also permanent unlocks; that is to say, there will be no more resets from October 7 onward.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="2XKO Early Access Announcement | Dev Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_ge1A4vZ-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>There will be five seasons in 2026, each adding a new champion, Ranked reset, Battle Pass, and more. This means that 2XKO's tenth champion will be released when Early Access goes live on October 7. A dedicated gameplay reveal trailer and developer update are coming soon.</p>



<p>Being a Riot game, it's no surprise that they already have a plan for the competitive scene. To begin with, the developer is sponsoring 22 community-run tournaments in 2025 as part of the so-called First Impact Program. Each First Impact event, starting with EVO France (October 10-12), will receive a bonus from Riot, and there will be an additional prize for winning as a duo. </p>



<p>2XKO has long been known as Project L, a game spearheaded by the Cannon brothers, former developers of the fighting game Rising Thunder. The project got its final name in February 2024, when Riot also <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a 2025 release window for both PC and consoles</a>. It looks like they didn't quite make it in time for consoles, which won't be a part of this early access debut.</p>



<p>2XKO is a free 2v2 fighting game featuring iconic League of Legends champions. Players can team up with or against friends for explosive showdowns, and master a variety of unique tag and assist mechanics to defeat the enemy duo.</p>

With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>Grand Theft Auto 6</u></a> on the horizon, Rockstar’s continued interest in the RP community has fans hoping for nopixel servers on console versions of past and future GTA games.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re excited to support the nopixel team as they create the future of GTA RP. <a href="https://t.co/pyb9SzfrfZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/pyb9SzfrfZ</a></p>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1970518900287721679?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Nopixel 1.0 launched in 2016, three years after GTA 5’s original release date, as a PC server where players can immerse themselves within the world of Los Santos by roleplaying as everything from taxi drivers and EMS to police officers. Various updates have arrived for the massively popular roleplay offshoot in the years since, but nopixel V marks the team’s first official collaboration with Rockstar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not quite clear what exactly nopixel V is. The announcement itself promises to bring its updated take on GTA 5 RP to the Rockstar Games Launcher and other PC platforms “soon,” pointing fans to <a href="https://www.nopixel.net/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its website</u></a> for more news and to sign up for invitations.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A roster of content creators confirmed to be involved in nopixel V is also <a href="https://www.nopixel.net/roster" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available on its website</a> and includes names like Valkyrae and Pokimane. More names will be unveiled in the near future, with the next announcement tied to a countdown that ends in one week. While there's still much about nopixel V to be revealed, official presence on the Rockstar Games Launcher and other PC platforms is still a significant change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, those eager to play GTA 6 had begun speculating about what Rockstar RP servers would look like when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-officially-working-with-gta-roleplay-server-team-sparking-fresh-excitement-about-gta-6"><u>the company announced it was working with the FiveM and RedM team at Cfx.re back in 2023</u></a>. That excitement then only increased when popular musician Faheem Rashad Najm a.k.a. T-Pain teased in 2024 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/t-pain-confirms-hes-working-on-gta-6-gta-5-nopixel"><u>he was working on GTA 6</u></a> but had been asked by Rockstar to stop engaging with RP servers like nopixel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I used to be on nopixel, then I started working on GTA 6, and they told me I couldn't do RP anymore because it kind of goes against... they had this whole speech, like, 'What if somebody took your album and re-recorded it, and more people were listening to that,' and I'm like, 'Okay, I kind of get that, but I was having a good time. Alright that's fine,'" T-Pain said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with Rockstar doubling down on its support for fan-driven RP servers, some believe it’s only a matter of time before the company announces roleplay support in GTA 5 on consoles, or even for GTA 6. However, Rockstar has yet to announce plans for this kind of support.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">GTA 6 should have roleplay on Consoles 👀</p>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1970519280299991152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">it's for GTA 6 too but i can't prove it <a href="https://t.co/07k8ETC7HU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/07k8ETC7HU</a></p>— _Seven_🍀🌊🐊🐉 (@Seven97490) <a href="https://twitter.com/Seven97490/status/1970520834788991278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll know more about Rockstar’s GTA RP plans when more information about nopixel V is revealed.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> 3 has been officially revealed by Sega's Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.</p>
<p>As with the previous Kiwami games, this will be a remake from scratch of the 2009 PS3 game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a>, with updated graphics and gameplay.</p>
<p>More exciting still is the reveal of an additional spin-off, Dark Ties.</p>

<p>News of Kiwami 3 leaked last week, but was revealed today at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VZM3ysP4vg">RGG Summit</a> as part of the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>The game has been remade in the studio's Dragon Engine, but 16 years later the region of Okinawa in Japan has changed since the original production, meaning the visuals have been totally redone.</p>
<p>As for Dark Ties, this will take place back in Kamurocho as players follow Yakuza 3's villain Yoshitaka Mine ahead of the events of the main game, to understand how he became Kiryu's adversary.</p>
<p>Dark Ties will be a separate game, but will come packaged alongside Yakuza Kiwami 3 to offer a complete story.</p>

		<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has revealed Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, a long-awaited remake of a classic entry in the series and a new spin-off to go alongside. The bundled pair will launch on 11th February 2026 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, PS4, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/za9rjoTdG_M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 is exactly what you’d want it to be, a modernising remake of the first PS3 Yakuza game, revitalising another chapter in Kazuma Kiryu’s story for current consoles. While the game has been playable through a port of the PS3 era trilogy, it was a pretty sharp step back from the quality found in the PS4 remakes of the first two Yakuza games – Yakuza Kiwami and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/23/yakuza-kiwami-2-review/">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> – which made use of newer game engines and technology built for Yakuza 0 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/16/yakuza-6-the-song-of-life-review/">Yakuza 6</a>. Even those remakes are getting on a bit, though. Kiwami 2 was released way back in 2017 (and localised in 2018).</p>
<p>Still, Yakuza 3 did have its own innovations compared to the PS2 originals. Seamless Battle allowed for more connected fights without a loading screen, Chase Battle added higher paced fights through more environments, Revelation brought a new way to learn Heat Actions, and there was a first person view.</p>
<p>One of the great things here is that the Nintendo Switch 2 is being included on day one. Switch 2 owners had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/yakuza-0-directors-cut-review-switch-2/">an enhanced port of Yakuza 0 at console’s launch</a>, which is being followed up by a fresh port of Yakuza Kiwami and Kiwami 2 later this year. Clearly this was all part of the plan to bring this new audience up to speed in time for Kiwami 3!</p>

<p>Alongside the remake of Yakuza 3 is Dark Ties, telling a brand new story around the character Yoshitaka Mine. Here’s a little blurb:</p>
<p>Having once led a succesful startup company, he plunged himself into the dark world of the yakuza by choice after losing everything. Left with an empty heart, the pursuit to find true bonds drives him forward once again in a dramatic journey colored by exhilarating boxing-based combat, and a variety of engaging side experiences.</p>
<p>Two men will walk different paths that converge to shake the very foundations of fate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amazon Japan has briefly listed a release date for Nioh 3, <a href="https://twitter.com/Renka_schedule/status/1970717557629047193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as spotted by X user Renka_schedule</a>, where the game is slated to launch on February 6, 2026. The store has since taken down those pages, likely after being contacted by KOEI TECMO, but the date is nonetheless most likely correct. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-announced-with-action-packed-trailer-launches-in-early-2026-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was already officially confirmed to launch early next year</a>, after all, and it is also nearly an anniversary for the franchise, given that the first Nioh debuted on February 7, 2017.</p>



<p>The Amazon Japan listing also mentioned a Treasure Box edition that includes the following physical items:</p>



<ul>
<li>B5-size official art book</li>



<li>Selection soundtrack CD</li>



<li>Original desk mat</li>



<li>Sunekosuri fur ball key chain</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nioh 3 was unveiled during June's State of Play and may be shown once again at September's State of Play, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-returns-on-september-24-with-35-minutes-of-updates-and-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to air later today</a> starting at 2 PM Pacific Time / 5 PM Eastern Time / 11 PM Central European Time. It is for sure going to be shown in the TGS 2025 Official Program tomorrow at 8 PM Japan Standard Time. In the broadcast, General Producer Yasuda and Producer Shibata will appear with host Hatsune Matsushima to share the latest updates on the game and face off against a formidable boss in the new "Heian Period" stage, wielding the Samurai-style "Dual Swords" and Ninja-style "Tonfa" weapons.</p>



<p>One of the biggest differences compared to the previous Nioh games is the ability to switch at any time between the samurai and ninja combat styles. Another big addition is the open-field environment, which replaces the mostly linear environments found in prior installments to improve the sense of exploration. Also, in a change from the previous two games, Nioh 3 will be released simultaneously for PlayStation 5 and PC, instead of launching only on PlayStation consoles and debuting later on PC.</p>



<p>Our Kai Tatsumoto will be able to play the game at TGS 2025. Look forward to his report soon.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-0-directors-cut-announced/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-yakuza-0-director%E2%80%99s-cut-announced-at-rgg-summit-2025.1306230/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-rgg-studio-rgg-summit-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RGG Summit 2025 livestream</a> that just ended, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced a new game called Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, confirming last week's leak that <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-leaked-by-rgg-studio-sega/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed exactly to this type of news</a>.</p>



<p>The developer describes Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties as an 'extreme' remake of the 2009 action/adventure game, promising to overhaul every aspect of the classic title. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio says that the bustling streets of Okinawa and Tokyo will be brought to life in stunning detail, and the reimagined combat elevates the brutal brawling action to new heights. Added scenes deliver more depth and emotion to the beloved story, and new and enhanced side experiences immerse players in the world like never before.</p>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 also includes a brand-new side game called Dark Ties, centered on Yoshitaka Mine. Narratively, it is a prequel where Mine plunges into the dark world of the yakuza by choice after losing everything. Left with an empty heart, the pursuit to find true bonds drives him forward once again in a dramatic journey colored by exhilarating boxing-based combat and a variety of side experiences. Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is already available to pre-order across all platforms (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2) ahead of the scheduled launch of February 11, 2026. </p>



<p>The Standard Edition is priced $59.99, while a Deluxe Edition is available for $74.99. All pre-orders are getting the Legendary Lad: Ichiban Kasuga bonus, which adds Ichiban Kasuga (the new protagonist in the most recent Yakuza games) to the Ryukyu Gal Gang. The Deluxe Edition also includes the Legendary Character Outfit pack, the Legendary Lads &amp; Gals Pack, the Customization Pack, the Flip Phone Customization Pack, and the Legendary BGM CD Pack.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The developer also announced Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, an enhanced version of the 2015 game (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-0-scheduled-january-24-2017-americas-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actually launched in January 2017 in Western countries</a>) featuring dual audio with a new English voice track, new cutscenes to expand the narrative, and a Red Light Raid online co-op multiplayer mode that will be released at a later date. Save data from Yakuza 0 is incompatible with the Director's Cut, and there is no option to upgrade for existing owners, who would have to repurchase the game. Yakuza 0 Director's Cut will be released on December 8 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>



<p>On the same day (December 8, 2025), Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio will launch Yakuza Kiwami and Kiwami 2 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X. A Yakuza Series 20th Anniversary Bundle that includes Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2 will also be available for PC and PlayStation 5, though only as a physical edition. </p>

<p>Experience a brand-new tale in Dark Ties</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sega isn't slowing down any time soon when it comes to the Yakuza series, and with this in mind, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has today announced it's bringing <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a></strong> to the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms next year.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://youtu.be/7VZM3ysP4vg">RGG Summit 2025</a>, the talented studio confirmed this particular entry would be arriving on <strong>12th February 2026</strong>, with <a href="https://www.sega.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties">digital pre-orders going live today</a> and physical version pre-orders to follow in the "coming days".</p>
<p>As mentioned in the official game description, the third entry originally made its debut on the PlayStation 3 in 2009, and it's now been "reimagined with cutting-edge visuals and modern technology". It also comes with the brand-new tale, Dark Ties. Here are some more details about what you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally debuting on PlayStation 3 in 2009, <strong>Yakuza 3</strong> has been reimagined with cutting-edge visuals and modern technology. This evolved edition brings Okinawa to life, featuring more intense battles, added cutscenes that bring depth to the story, and minigames chock-full of replay value. Kiryu's back in the brawl, continuing the fight to protect those he holds dear.</p>
<p>This title also includes <strong>Dark Ties</strong>, which stars Yoshitaka Mine, Kiryu's adversary. Follow Mine on his journey from working as a venture company's founder to becoming a full-fledged yakuza member. After losing everything, Mine sets off in an attempt to form a connection that would fill the void in his heart. Kazuma Kiryu and Yoshitaka Mine live in different ways.</p>
<p>Walk alongside them as their paths intersect, throwing both of their fates in the balance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This latest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yakuza_kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> game announcement follows the release of Yakuza Kiwami on the Switch eShop last October.</p>
<p>Since then, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a> has been released on Switch 2, and this will be followed by Yakuza Kiwami and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> for the Switch 2 this November. It's also been confirmed Yakuza Kiwami 1 &amp; 2 for the Switch 2 <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1970714949006827656">are getting separate physical releases</a>, but they're both Game-Key Cards.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Skate Early Access Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-early-access-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skate-early-access-review.1306176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA’s <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/faq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Skate FAQ</u></a> is very clear about what 2025’s new early access iteration represents for the series as a whole. “This isn’t a sequel, remake, or a remaster,” states the brief explanation. “It’s the evolution of the Skate franchise.” The first part I wholeheartedly agree with. This is not Skate 4, and it certainly isn’t a remake of the originals by any stretch of the imagination. The second part is not entirely untrue either: It <em>is </em>an evolution, of sorts. That is, it’s certainly changed. A lot. Unfortunately, this means this new version of Skate bears little semblance to the late-2000s originals I love – and I’m currently finding it impossible to warm to its sanitised, homogenised, and monetised reinvention. Yes, Skate has evolved dramatically, but it’s done so to blend into its free-to-play, service game-dominated surroundings – like moths in the sooty cities of the British Industrial Revolution. I don’t think I’ve ever compared a game to an insect before, but perhaps it makes sense when I find it this repellant. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before I get too deep into why it’s offputting, there are a couple of true strengths that I can identify in Skate’s early access launch – the first of which are the sound effects. When it comes to capturing the nuanced array of skateboarding sounds – the hiss of spinning wheels, the friction of plywood on varied surfaces, and the clink of metal on metal – the team has done a terrific job. Ignoring the music and dialogue (which I’ll discuss later), Skate absolutely nails its sounds. This stuff is the symphony of skateboarding and, when you’re in a real flow, there’s an almost meditative rhythm to it. The pops and pings, the scrapes and squeaks – these sounds are just soothing, and I don’t know how else to explain it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It must also be established that the feel of Skate, when you’re on a board at least, is still supreme. I adore the wild, arcade wackiness of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater – and I respect the punishing, twin-stick precision required by the likes of skate sims like Session – but Skate’s controls are my jam. Just about everything I crave is wrapped up in its approachable yet deceptively deep system. Tricks on the right stick, turning on the left, grabs on the triggers, and grinds on… how good you are at lining them up. There’s a lot of depth to unlock once you get the hang of it. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The feel of Skate, when you’re on a board at least, is still supreme.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, the new Skate doesn’t <em>quite </em>look and feel identical to the older games. Turning appears a little stiffer, and probably lacks a bit of the more pronounced and organic lean from the early Skate games. The grind assist is also considerably too sticky by default, and there’s definitely jankiness present in the transition skating; I’m experimenting with the pump settings but haven’t quite cracked a consistent solution to always getting the momentum I want and not getting randomly bogged down. Skitching is absent, and there are other missing tricks. Overall, however, it’s entirely familiar enough to be instantly intuitive to me as a returning player. At a minimum, Skate has done a fine job of reconstructing that buttery, legacy street skating feel from the original games. That’s an important thing to bring back if you’re going to use the classic name.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, that’s all it brought back.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Streaming the Cube</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Making Skate an exclusively online experience was an immediate and utter mistake. During my first session on the day of its early access launch I was unceremoniously disconnected during a random challenge and kicked out of the map, back to the main menu. The error message here was comically emblematic of my thoughts on the overall situation. Something went wrong? Yes, something certainly went wrong with Skate. But it went wrong long before I started playing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I am, of course, aware that server problems and queues are typical of day one of a new online game (although I’m still waiting in queues the week after launch). The community has come to accept this compromise as the opposite side of the free-to-play coin. For me, this is uncharted territory. The last time I waited in an online queue I was buying concert tickets, but at least I got seats to Metallica out of it. Skate is giving me no such joy. It does not benefit from being an online-only live service. It has new priorities, like selling $25 clothing ensembles. To pass the downtime I played a bit of the existing Skate trilogy (all of which are parked on my Xbox courtesy of backwards compatibility and will work just fine offline today, tomorrow, and in 10 years time).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a deeply unfortunate twist, playing the new Skate is regularly just as annoying as <em>not </em>being able to play it. From the get-go it’s evident every shred of the personality of the originals has been ruthlessly and shamelessly cut away in favour of infantilised garbage. Every part of Skate has been corporatised and Disney-fied, from art style to attitude.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every part of Skate has been corporatised and Disney-fied, from art style to attitude.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember the authentic human characters that accompanied your skater as you progressed through the story modes of the old games, who would blurt in sympathy as you tumbled down the dam for the tenth time, breaking every bone in your body? Well, forget anything like that. Your “filmer” in the new Skate is… an AI app, called Vee, who just may be the single worst video game character I’ve ever encountered. Vee’s dialogue is beyond nauseating, and is delivered in a faux-robotic fashion that makes it doubly awful. It’s essentially a simulation of AI slop – like having a friend that only speaks to you like they’re reading the captions on a Tik-Tok video. The low-fi and realistic filmer approach of the old Skate games is greatly missed. In 2025, this could have been emulated easily by just giving us an in-game friend with a phone. Instead, we have an ill-conceived chatbot who regards my successful tricks as, “Algorithmic!”, refuses to stop “edu-skating” me on the fact “footy” means “video footage,” and mines 35-year-old LL Cool J songs for quips even my mum would wince at. “Your female parent said knock those objectives out?” Good grief.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Holy Cow Oh My God</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly the “human” cast is no better. They’re saddled with an inauthentic, overwritten script stuffed with cringeworthy sentences no person would ever say aloud, and lines I’m not even sure the voice actors quite understood before reading. Skate’s fascination with the term “skater eyes” (which is inexplicably capitalised in the captions like some kind of proper noun) is simply baffling. It’s referenced with such heavy regularity that it sounds like the name of an in-game function you can personally toggle on and off to highlight particular parts of the environment like Batman’s Detective Vision (like certain things that <em>are </em>automatically covered in a yellow mask during some challenges) but it isn’t. It’s just a hackneyed slang phrase Skate has invented and overuses far beyond the point of parody. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who <em>says </em>the word “BEEP” instead of cursing, even mildly? Everything that's even a fraction edgy or mature has been masked under layers of corporate coddling, like those soft, squishy curves that stop toddlers from splitting their heads on the corner of the kitchen bench. You can, I guess, mute the dialogue – but that doesn’t make it immune from criticism. Besides, the dialogue is also just one part of a cavalcade of complaints I have about the current state of Skate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why was it so important, for instance, to concoct an in-universe explanation for the fact that nobody in Skate’s new city of San Vansterdam can suffer any injuries? Making skaters invincible thanks to the medical miracle of “ImpervaTEK” doesn’t make Skate <em>better</em>; it just feels like it’s here because some suit was worried about the optics of children playing a game where people tossing themselves off buildings might have to be depicted as being seriously hurt. As a result, Skate’s traditional post-wipeout x-rays and bone-snapping sound effects are totally gone (as are bloody scrapes, grime, and wear on skaters and their boards). </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/vlcsnap-2025-09-23-15h14m21s304-1758605064301.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2009's Skate 2 is proof if you want to make a skate omelette you need to break a few legs.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My sons began playing the original Skate games from about the moment each was old enough to hold a controller. I vividly remember them cackling uncontrollably at how many bones they could break as their characters tumbled and fell, their skeletons squelching and shattering. Skate 2025 seems totally toothless in comparison. It treats its audience like babies.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>10 Things I Skate About You</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Skate’s art style doesn’t do it any favours, either. The stylised approach may be crisp and colourful, but it’s also vanilla and boring. The doe-eyed, Sims-style character models do absolutely nothing for me, and this cartoony u-turn is a truly unwelcome departure from the realistic approach the series previously took. I don’t like their plastic beards, or their chunky pants, and I certainly don’t like being surrounded by them at all times – particularly when other players have a habit of visibly stuttering, lagging, and even floating as they move by. It’s also a complete eyesore having everyone constantly clipping into each other, all plonked in front of the same shop counter – or teleporting and gathering atop the same ramp. I don’t know where I start and everyone else begins. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a real sterility to the city that the simplified visual style can’t shake. Plain walls, impossibly clean surfaces – San Vansterdam just isn’t a place that feels legitimate or lived-in. It feels fake because it looks fake. There’s not enough granular detail or texture. Hell, sometimes there’s no texture at all, like when the roads appear to glitch and turn into a featureless, uniformly black surface. That happens a lot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">San Vansterdam isn’t all that interesting to skate around, either. The map is a largely flat downtown area, broken up into four quadrants that aren’t particularly distinct from each other. You can skate across it in about two minutes. There’s no zany hill descent, or dam drop, or wild spillway – nothing I’m drawn to gravitate towards like I am in Skate 2’s San Vanelona. There was a sense of reward in finding a neat place to skate in the original games, because the maps primarily felt like cities – not skateparks. The DNA of San Vansterdam is that everything is skatepark-adjacent. Top of a building? Skatepark. Inside a church? Skatepark. At this point, designing the city to be an unrestrained skate utopia just feels like too much – like it’s a big, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater level instead of a city you can skate in. It’s weird when the original Skate games were entirely antithetical to that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of pro skaters, don’t expect to see any of those old faces in the new Skate. This obviously means no cleverly edited live-action intro montage packed with recognisable skaters in silly situations. Starting with a memorable short film may have become a tradition for the original trilogy, but that idea appears to have been firmly kickflipped to curb. More disappointingly, however, it also means no pro challenges – no real-life skaters to meet and speak to as you progress through what constitutes the campaign at the moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could pros come to the game later in this fashion? As a live service… maybe, I guess. But I’m very pessimistic they’d add the same level of personality they injected into the original Skate games. Those had brief cutscenes with back and forth between the pros and your sarcastic filmer. Is John Rattray going to have a conversation with a disembodied app on a floating video camera? I doubt it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it stands right now, the campaign feels weak: part lengthy tutorial, part service game treadmill, where miscellaneous skating tasks are rationed out every 24 hours. Some of these are satisfying enough, and they do reward a certain degree of mastery of Skate’s classic controls. There <em>are </em>stints of Skate where I’m absorbed to some degree, sure, but there’s surprisingly little to it right now – particularly considering how immediately the daily challenges have begun to repeat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of solo content, there are no competitions, no death races, no games of S.K.A.T.E. No magazine cover shoots, or sponsorship challenges. The campaign missions, or “tours”, here are really just a series of lessons. It’s clumsily paced, too, since the only way to unlock new tours is to complete an extensive amount of goals from the miscellaneous trick challenges that are refreshed on a daily basis. That is, many hours after completing a daily objective that required me to do multiple manuals, I found myself sleepwalking through a separate tutorial mission about <em>how </em>to manual. And this after Skate confirmed with me I’d played Skate 3 before I even set foot on a board. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skate sure does love its collection missions, though. In these you must skate a certain line while hitting a predetermined amount of floating wheel bearings, or perhaps skate through some basketball-sized bird poo. Either way, it’s mobile game-inspired fluff. I’m not a bored toddler in a restaurant being handed an iPad while his parents peruse the dessert menu, so this is just not my scene. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The whole progression loop is simply geared around collecting enough in-game currency to open loot boxes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That only became more evident when I realised the whole progression loop is simply geared around collecting enough in-game currency to open loot boxes. Want to rank up? You need to return to the store to trigger that. Hey, while you’re at the store, why not open some boxes of crap with all your in-game credits? I didn’t bother opening any for the first few days because I wasn’t interested, but I eventually realised the boxes also contain additional reputation points that are important for leveling up your neighbourhood rank and unlocking new fast travel spots – so you basically have to open them. This means sitting through the unskippable “Congratulations!” animation for each individual one – that I assume has been meticulously modelled for maximum poker machine potency – every single time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which boxes? These ones, just past all the premium items you need to hand over real money for instead. Wait, why are there bundles of items priced at 1600 Skate-bucks when Skate-bucks are available in increments of 500 and 1050? Oops. Guess you’ll have to buy more than you need.

		<p>LilliLandia Games, which is a Tencent Studio, has announced a new fantasy simulation game called Animula Nook. It is being billed as a lilliput game and for those who are not sure what that means, lilliput comes from Jonathan Swift’s Guilliver’s Travels. Lilliput is the island where the six inch tall Lilliputlians live, and that should give you a clue of what to expect in Animula Nook.</p>
<p><iframe title="Animula Nook | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvaGN-R2ntc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Animula Nook, what is normal sized to us tower above the characters that live in this world. House plants are towering trees and forgotten little things like buttons can be major resources. This is essentially The Borrowers the videogame. The key features have been detailed by LilliLandia Games, and you can read the list below.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Discover a tiny yet immense world:&nbsp;Venture into vibrant landscapes hidden in plain sight. Explore lush, resource-packed houseplant forests, delve into the mysterious depths of a forgotten well, and navigate other awe-inspiring (and sometimes perilous) corners of your home. Every expedition is an adventure, whether you are unearthing rare materials or meeting a new friend.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Collect beyond the ordinary:&nbsp;In this tiny world, sunlight, raindrops, gentle breezes—even forgotten scents—become precious materials waiting to be discovered. Coins, buttons, and other small wonders are scattered throughout the land—each one not just a resource, but a lost treasure waiting for a new purpose.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Build with everyday objects:&nbsp;Milk cartons become charming houses, teacups turn into bustling cafés, and spice jars transform into tiny, glowing shops. Use the objects around you to build, decorate, and customize a miniature haven with unique furniture and personal touches. Start on your desk, then expand your creations across windowsills, cabinets, or even inside a vibrant, living vivarium.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Befriend the world’s tiny folk:&nbsp;This miniature world is full of life. Meet a delightful cast of residents, from tiny humanoids to whimsical beings you’ve never seen before. Exchange gifts, create memories, and watch as your bonds deepen over time. As you grow closer, their stories will unfold in more personal and surprising ways. With enough care, you might even convince them to move in- just be sure to build them a space they’ll love.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Define yourself in every detail:&nbsp;Customize your character, express yourself creatively, and make the world truly yours. With an endless assortment of outfits, accessories, furniture, and tools, everything you create is a reflection of you.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Convenient creative tools:&nbsp;Bring your ideas to life with intuitive tools that make creativity effortless. Sketch blueprints for builds, dismantle objects into modular components, and see your imagination come to life with ease.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Animula Nook has been confirmed for PC, PS5, Switch 2, and Mac.</p>
