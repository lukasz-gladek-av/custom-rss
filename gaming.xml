Following EA's announcement, the NBA 2K account <a href="https://x.com/NBA2K/status/1939805441468342727" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a cryptic message</a> that suggested college basketball might be in the works for the NBA 2K series.</p><p>"The campus has been quiet for too long," the post said.</p><p>A spokesperson for 2K, meanwhile, told GameSpot, "2K is the undisputed home of basketball gaming. We have a strong history with college hoops and are exploring exciting new ways to bring athletes and schools to life. Class is in session."</p><p>2K Sports previously published the College Hoops 2K series, featuring real schools from NCAA universities. 2K shut down the series after College Hoops 2K8, which was released in 2007. EA's own NCAA Basketball series was discontinued after 2009's NCAA Basketball 2010.</p><p>On June 30, EA announced it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-college-basketball-game-16-years-after-the-last-one/1100-6532831/" data-ref-id="1100-6532831">making a new college basketball game</a>. It also came to light that the Collegiate Licensing Corporation sought bidders to make a new college basketball game, with multiple parties submitting bids, though none were named outright. The CLC's proposal called for women's basketball teams to be included alongside men's teams.</p><p>From the wording of the NBA 2K social media post, and the fact that it came from the NBA 2K account, it sounds like this won't be a new College Hoops game but instead a college mode within NBA 2K--which is something fans have been asking for. However, that's not confirmed at this stage.</p><p>There is a lot of money in college sports video games, as EA's recent College Football 25 made more than <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$1 billion in revenue</a> and was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">2024's No. 2 best-selling game overall in the US. </a> Any new college basketball games or modes likely won't be made in partnership with the NCAA, which broke off with video game publishers years ago due to a variety of legal and financial reasons.</p><p>EA's new college basketball game isn't expected to arrive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-college-basketball-game-16-years-after-the-last-one/1100-6532831/" data-ref-id="1100-6532831">until 2028</a>, while the next NBA 2K title is due out this year. Whether or not any college basketball mode is added to the game this year is unknown, however.</p>

            <p>
Last week, Riot Games announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">pulling the plug on promising Minecraft-like sandbox game Hytale</a> after over a decade of development. Since then, several notable names have been linked to possible revival efforts as fans search for a way the project could be saved, but now one of those name - Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone - has distanced himself from reports he could help resurrect Hytale.
</p>
<p>
Hytale, to give you the potted history, started development in 2015, and was an attempt by developer Hypixel to combine the mini-games found on its hugely popular eponymous Minecraft server with its own RPG-like, Minecraft-style sandbox experience, built from the ground up. It generated enough buzz that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games heavily invested in the project before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquiring Hypixel in 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last week, however, Riot announced it was ending development on the still-unreleased project as it "became clear we couldn't bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise." At the time, there was suggestion Hypixel had unsuccessfully attempted to shop the game around to "investors or acquirers who could continue to help carry Hytale forward", leading to employee layoffs and the studio's imminent closure.
</p>
<p>
Fans, however, weren't quite ready to give up after a ten year wait for Hytale, and took to social media in a bid to convince industry figures they should pitch in to help save the project. Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone, for instance, was <a href="https://x.com/not_mynes/status/1938700223511159281">accosted on Discord</a> by a fan eager to save Hytale. After receiving the sales pitch - "I assume this investment would pay out for you too" - Barone responded noncommittally, "Possibly, but I would have to hear more about what the plan is, why it failed initially (behind the scenes), etc."
</p>
<p>
With fans perhaps reading more into that "possibly" than was ever intended, Barone has now released a follow-up statement clarifying his position. Noting that his widely shared original comment was "not a public message [he] was trying to convey", Barone <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">told Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, "I'm not actively doing anything to make this happen. If something were presented to me, I would be open to entertaining the idea, that's all. It's not something I am thinking about too much, since I'm focused on working on my next game."
</p>
<p>
Barone is currently developing spooky chocolate-making life sim Haunted Chocolatier, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">announced in 2021</a>. Work paused temporarily while his attention shifted back to Stardew Valley and its unexpectedly massive 1.6 update, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-hes-back-working-on-next-project-haunted-chocolatier">development resumed last December</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while Barone's focus is currently elsewhere, there's perhaps still some hope for Hytale fans. Original Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme - who departed the company following its acquisition by Riot - has also become embroiled in the community's Save Hytale campaign, telling fans he's willing to "reach out" to Riot with a possible $25m investment proposal. This, he explained, could potentially allow for a "very early access release with temporarily removed features", as development with a "relatively small" team was spun up again.
</p>
<p>
"Keep your expectations extremely low," he <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1938944710334148817">cautioned on social media</a>, "because usually when large companies shutdown a project like this the chances of revival are next to impossible. Yes, I made the decision, I will give my best to save Hytale... It's the least I can do to the same community that gave me the opportunity to be where I am today... It will take months to get answers and months to get done. I will share as much as possible as I go through the process."

            <p>Borderlands 4 includes a slider that lets you mute Claptrap.</p>
<p>Claptrap, for those unaware, is Gearbox's talkative robot companion who is often considered to be the Borderlands series' mascot. He first popped up in the original Borderlands game, and was most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-black-joins-borderlands-movie-cast-as-claptrap">voiced by Jack Black in the Borderlands film adaptation</a>.</p>
<p>While Claptrap can be a source of comic relief, some players have found him a tad annoying, and now Gearbox has come up with a solution to quite literally dial him down a touch: that aforementioned Borderlands 4 slider.</p>

<p>This slider will allow players to adjust Claptrap's volume, from 100 percent to mute. Teasing the feature, Borderlands 4 narrative director <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1939780570365796763">Sam Winkler said</a>: "I wrote some lines just for this feature and it includes maybe the dumbest most niche reference to a certain terrible accent in a certain classic immersive sim."</p>
<p>In a subsequent response to one social media user who suggested Gearbox shouldn't have "caved" to those less keen on Claptrap's vocals, <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/with_replies">Winkler joked</a>: "I pitched that you should be able to put him from zero percent to 200 percent but I think the government said no."</p>
<p>So, will you be muting Claptrap on Borderlands 4's release, or turning the volume up as high as your tech will allow?</p>

            <p>Howdy, pardner. Been a while, ain't it? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-online">Red Dead Online</a>'s just gotten a fresh update that surprisingly adds some new missions, three or so years after Rockstar gave up on delivering major updates to the cowboy sandbox. Oh, and one of them looks to involve you investigating some zombie plague outbreaks.</p>
<p>Sounds a bit Undead Nightmare-ish to me, and these sudden new additions have folks wondering if Rockstar's trying to bring the game back from the grave.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rockstar look to have pre-emptively shared some details about the contents of RDO's July update with some of its <a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1939768963572896202">community</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/1logs5w/monthly_discounts_and_bonuses_july_1st_to_august/"> members</a> yesterday, and among the usual list of monthly in-game discounts and bonuses, revealed that some new content's dropping.</p>
<p>"Author Theodore Levin needs your help investigating the bizarre and unexplained in Strange Tales of the West," the studio purportedly wrote, "a new set of four eerie Telegram Missions available tomorrow in Red Dead Online. Track down undead plagues, rogue automations, swamp beasts, and more." Yep, undead plagues.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>New Red Dead Online content coming tomorrow as part of the event month, announced in a community email:</p><p>Strange Tales of the West includes a set of new Telegram missions, book author Theodore Levin (from the singleplayer) needs help investigating “bizarre and unexplained”… <a href="https://t.co/9OenzdOPiD">pic.twitter.com/9OenzdOPiD</a></p></div>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/1939765713310220411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>As of this writing, there isn't a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire?tag_id=736">Rockstar Newswire post</a> formally announcing the arrival of these missions, but the update appears to have gone live as of 5am EDT/10am BST today, July 1st, with one player already having <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/1lox584/holy_shit_its_real/">shared a screenshot</a> showing a notification inviting them to help Levin. Meanwhile, another's been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/1loz0jo/robots_with_fire_bows_in_the_old_west_way_to_go/">shot by a robot with a fire bow</a>.</p>
<p>While these do look to just be a few extra missions, their arrival's still raised some eyebrows among those still playing the game, with folks wondering how they came to be and why they've been deployed now.</p>
<p>You see, the past few years have been pretty lean in terms of new stuff being added to Red Dead Online, with Rockstar having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-abandon-major-red-dead-online-updates-to-focus-on-gta-6">made the call in 2022</a> to cease major updates, so they could focus on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>. GTA Online's still been recieving regular updates with plenty of fresh additions in that time, so you can see why RDO players felt compelled to organise an in-game funeral for the online cowboy thing a few years ago.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Rockstar for comment.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how expansive these missions are and whether there's any other stuff in the works for the few outlaws still roaming the west.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/red-dead-online-just-got-some-surprise-new-missions-and-one-involves-investigating-undead-plagues]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is "happy" with the critical reception of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach, and has spurred on fans to fight back against war and climate change.</p>
<p>Speaking at the London leg of the Death Stranding 2 World Tour that Eurogamer attended, Kojima was asked by host <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> for his final thoughts on the evening's events, which included performances from Caroline Polachek and Chvrches.</p>
<p>"We have a lot of things right now," said Kojima. "We have war, we have climate change, we have a lot of earthquakes, we had the pandemic, we have a lot of things. And we have maybe a dark future a little bit. But today, if we gather like this and if we are going to be connected, we can fight and battle all these things."</p>

<p>Kojima dedicated the evening - also attended by actors Norman Reedus and Léa Seydoux - to the memory of Low Roar lead singer Ryan Karazija, who passed away in 2022 due to complications of pneumonia. Low Roar's music was a key part of the first game's identity and Kojima had wanted to use more of the band's music in the sequel.</p>
<p>"When I was creating Death Stranding 2, I wanted to contact him and there was Covid so he couldn't come to Japan to perform so I was trying to write an email," explained Kojima. "But then I got this sad message that Ryan passed away and that was so tragic when I first heard that. I also heard from his relatives that he does have some new songs and I decided to put in his new songs in Death Stranding 2.</p>
<p>"So I think he's watching us somewhere. In Death Stranding 2 there's this line 'death is not the end, it does not separate us'. I still feel connection with Ryan so I'm going to cherish this relationship with Ryan. And I hope everyone will feel that way too."</p>

<p>Singer Caroline Polachek, meanwhile, performed the game's title song On The Beach for the first time at the event.</p>
<p>"I am always terrified the first time I perform songs, but I've gotta say I've never sung a song that feels more like playing a video game than that song," she said. "It has so many rollercoaster dips in it."</p>
<p>Kojima was introduced to Polachek's music by the team at KindaFunny, which eventually led to the pair collaborating on the song. "If I hadn't received that CD, this connection would never have happened," said Kojima.</p>
<p>Polachek explained more about the writing process for On The Beach. "I often keep special songs in a treasure chest for when they have the right moment, and this was one of them," she said.</p>
<p>"Hideo explained to me the concept of Death Stranding 2 and I was so taken by the ethical conflict in the story and also how far that carries back into Death Stranding 1 as well. This idea of: is extinction a good idea, is it a bad idea? And how provocative that is, actually. One of the things that's special about this song is the verses are really evil and looming and then the chorus is so innocent and has this feeling of being saved. And I really liked the match between the song and these ideas. He sends me a synopsis of the game and I take it away and study it. And about a month later we had the song."</p>
<p>The lyrics to On The Beach are a riddle, though the singer didn't want to give it away. "In this case I wanted to pick up the gauntlet that Hideo threw down, which is how many strands of the game can you put into the song but in a way people won't necessarily be able to read until they've played it," she said.</p>
<p>Polachek also admitted she was "so nervous" to send Kojima her first recording of the song, and Chvrches later mirrored this sentiment after their performance of the title track from the first game. This was the first performance from Chvrches in two years, with the band confirming they've been back in the studio for six months writing a new album.</p>
<p>In a previous interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-isnt-interested-in-appealing-to-the-mass-market-but-death-stranding-2-playtests-proving-popular">Kojima stated he's not interested in "appealing to the mass market"</a> and, despite playtests of Death Stranding 2 proving popular, he wished it "was a bit more controversial".</p>
<p>The reaction would suggest otherwise. While sales figures haven't been released, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-topples-mario-kart-world-from-uk-physical-sales-top-spot-but-still-some-way-from-beating-the-original">Death Stranding 2 did top the UK physical charts last week</a>. And with such a strong critical reaction, it's no wonder Kojima is feeling "very happy".</p>
<p>"A busier, louder, and more emotionally resplendent take on this singular hiking sim," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Death Stranding 2 review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-happy-with-death-stranding-2-critical-reception-spurring-fans-to-fight-and-battle-against-war-and-climate-change]]></content:encoded>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam">Steam</a> update includes a new, heavily upgraded performance monitor, stacking readouts for framerate, CPU, GPU, and memory usage data on top of the previously basic FPS overlay. It’s "a first step," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500576552635859540">so say Valve</a>, "towards helping Steam users more easily understand their game and system performance," and as such includes some counters and metrics that you won’t see even on game-math classics like MSI Afterburner.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The most straightforward of these is the option to separate framerate counts by both traditionally rendered frames and any extras that might be served up by frame generation tech such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a>. Existing hardware monitors can usually measure either the raw, un-generated frame count or the combined total, but to my knowledge, Steam’s the first to keep track of both separately – allowing you to see precisely how much of that on-screen smoothness is down to 'real' frames versus the generated ones. Handy stuff.</p>
<p>This new overlay (which, by the way, can be customised to show varying degrees of details, similar to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>/SteamOS performance monitor) offers some other convention-breaking counters too. The CPU usage monitor is one: in addition to a standard, percentage-based figure showing average CPU core usage, it can also display a second percentage that denotes the current busiest core, specifically how much it’s working relative to its base clock speed. Hence why it sometimes reads above 100% - that’s when the core is running at its higher 'boost' clock speed, to get more done when thermal headroom allows it to.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Idris approves. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Valve/CD Projekt Red</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is useful info, not because anyone secretly wants to sit an arithmetic exam when they sit down to play games, but because average core usage doesn’t give the full picture when a game perhaps isn’t taking advantage of CPU cores like it should. Showing, in real time, that the busiest core is in fact working its little silicon arse off could help diagnose performance problems that may not otherwise have a clear cause.</p>
<p>There’s a similar troubleshooting benefit to how the Steam monitor counts VRAM availability, which takes into account the amount of system RAM that temporarily holds graphics data. Some monitors, and the VRAM counters you often see in graphics settings menus, only consider the GPU’s own memory alone, so if the Steam overlay says you’re maxing out your supply, you can be more sure that you really have squeezed out every last gigabyte of possible memory. That’s my understanding, anyway. I’m still just a humanities graduate, and this thing makes an awful lot of numbers.</p>
<p>Having played around with the monitor myself, I have noticed one bug, which you can see for yourself in that header screenshot: the generated frames counter sometimes doesn’t show in full, so what should be a count of three-hundred-and-something frames looks like 30. I sort-of fixed this by switching DLSS Multi Frame Generation from 4x to 2x and back again, but hopefully a more permanent amendment is due. Already, though, this is another mostly-great feature that Steam has almost nonchalantly slotted into itself. A repeat of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-record-game-clips-with-steam">Game Recording</a> launch, but for helping when things break, rather than showing off.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-updated-pc-performance-monitor-is-quietly-clever-and-not-just-because-it-digs-into-frame-generation]]></content:encoded>

That's a major improvement over Borderlands 3's Pandora, which had enough loading screens to test the players' patience. </p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/30/the-seamless-open-world-of-borderlands-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, senior project producer Anthony Nicholson noted that the Borderlands 4 team didn't initially set out to make Kairos an open-world environment. However, the power of Unreal Engine 5 "gave us other advantages to be able to do things and kind of went into being able to make a seamless world and things of that nature."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>World-building director Jason Reiss added that there are "a lot more 360 combat areas where players can enter into spaces from any direction, including from the air--and we have to account for that now with all these crazy movement abilities. It's been all about, 'Let's create a large, dynamic, awesome place where players can feel like badasses.'"</p><p>In this expanded world, enemies can be spotted from further away, and they aren't just waiting around to fight players. Instead, an effort was made to make the enemies "be alive and doing things from... far away, where they need to look like they're naturally a part of their environment whenever you're looking at them through your scope from a mile away," said lead game designer Josh Jeffcoat.</p><p>One of the side missions will involve players helping Claptrap recover some of his mementos from previous adventures, while others will vary between story-based missions to specific activities related to Kairos' various regions.</p><p>Gearbox recently debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-story-trailer-shows-off-the-sinister-timekeeper-and-claptrap/1100-6532590/">a new story trailer</a> that put the spotlight on the game's villain, the Timekeeper. The Borderlands 4 team also revealed that there are<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-more-skills-per-character-than-the-last-two-main-games-combined/1100-6532628/" data-ref-id="1100-6532628"> more skills per-character</a> than the last two main games combined. In part because of the sheer amount of new content in the game, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has warned that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-borderlands-4-to-hit-game-pass-or-be-dirt-cheap-for-many-years/1100-6532782/" data-ref-id="1100-6532782">may be several years before Borderlands 4 has a significant drop in price</a>.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 12. It will also be released on Switch 2 at a later date.</p>

            <p>To overcome the first enemy you meet in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/key-fairy">Key Fairy</a> (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugles_(snack)">Bugle</a> with big eyes and bat wings), you zip around the woods with a grapple, avoiding its circling and collecting the stars it dispenses. When you collect three, it turns friendly and apologises for attacking you. "Worry not, little bird", I reply from a set of dialogue options. "My cloak is thick." The next screen is inhabited by three cyclopean worms chanting about the "eels of creation". I like it here very much.</p>
<p>Brought to life with spacious, enchanting and playfully layered electronic music and hand-drawn art  (you can change the colour palette to something cooler or monochrome if you wish), Key Fairy's forest is a place I want to live, and I'm very grateful for even a short opportunity to spend time in it.</p>

<p>You'll find the demo on Key Fairy's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878580/Key_Fairy/">Steam page</a>, which also has one of the loveliest descriptions of making things I've read in a while:</p>
<blockquote><p>"An adventure made just for you! We forged this forest out of blood, and ink, and thought. Come, join us for a while, we are only small, and there is space enough to share."</p></blockquote>
<p>"The Forest Contains…"</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Dozens of unique monsters</li>
<li>Fast paced, frenetic engagements</li>
<li>Trinkets by the bagful, for you to collect</li>
<li>Whimsy</li>
<li>hundreds of hand-crafted rooms</li>
<li>People, with hopes and dreams</li>
<li>Sounds (if you walk softly, you may hear them)</li>
<li>The truth</li>
<li>An ungodly quantity of keys</li>
<li>Pages and pages of hand-drawn art</li>
<li>A sword! (not to be used as a weapon)</li>
<li>No secrets. we promise there are no secrets in the forest...</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The full game's release is still to be announced. Do visit the forest if you get a chance. It's a marvellous place.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/key-fairy-is-a-hand-drawn-pacifist-folkloric-bullet-hell-and-its-demo-actually-lives-up-to-how-interesting-that-description-is]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Capcom has announced that is doing a collaboration with K-pop group Aespa, along with virtual idol Naevis. The collaboration with Aespa will consist of a new outfit for Juri which will release on July 4th. This outfit will be only be available for a limited time, with that timeframe being a year. After that it will be gone. You can see the the outfit and hear some of Aespa’s Whiplash track in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Street Fighter 6 x aespa Special Collab with naevis Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NNXmO0LLsjQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Naevis is a virtual idol that began as a sidekick for the group Aespa, before being spun off to be a solo artist. Naevis’ has been confirmed as a real time commentator. It is worth mentioning that being a virtual idol means that Naevis is not a real person, and has been created using generative AI. The option to use Naevis as a real time commentator in Street Fighter 6 will also be available from July 4th.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/30/street-fighter-6-review/">Street Fighter 6 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Street Fighter 6 review, Nick said, “Street Fighter 6 doesn’t need recommending to hardcore fighting fans – you all already know how incredible it is – but do I recommend it for more casual players?

			<p>To everyone's surprise, members of the Monster Hunter Wilds development team will give a talk on performance optimization later this month while the game continues to be affected by all sorts of technical issues.</p>



<p>As confirmed on the <a href="https://cedec.cesa.or.jp/2025/timetable/detail/s67ad32469773b/">CEDEC 2025 official website</a>, programmer Yuichi Ito and AI Engineer Takanori Nakamura will host a talk on July 24 during this year's edition of Japan's largest annual conference for game developers regarding the challenges of optimizing the latest entry in the series and how the team reportedly managed to <em>"maintain stable operation"</em> while realizing the game's core features, a statement many will inevitably find funny, at the very least, considering how the game doesn't run well on anything other than the very top end PC hardware and with upscaling and frame generation on top.</p>



<p>A few months since launch, Monster Hunter Wilds' performance is just as disappointing as it was back in February. <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4/">Title Update 2</a>, which went live yesterday, introduced some VRAM utilization improvements but has not addressed the many issues the game still has on this front. The new update also introduced some stability issues that are causing crashes on a variety of system configurations, but these, at least, will be addressed soon with a new 1.020.01.00 patch announced today. The patch will also address another issue in the PC version of the game that may cause unstable performance when equipping ranged weapons.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn how the game still manages to be a great new entry in the series despite the performance issues by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a>.</p>

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mod put together over the course of a 40 hour-long charity modathon will see you beamed up by aliens you're investigating on behalf of a quirky conspiracy theorist. Its creation alone has <a href="https://donate.tiltify.com/9bfd5162-8a13-4012-908f-e64b4598976d/details">raised over $5,800</a> (about £4.2k) for the American <a href="https://www.alz.org/">Alzheimer's Association</a> so far.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-elder-scrolls-voice-actor-is-teaming-up-with-top-fallout-4-modders-to-livestream-a-48-hour-modding-jam-for-charity">wrote about the plans to livestream this mod's creation</a> last month. The team behind Fallout 4's popular <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872">Sim Settlements mod</a> are behind it, having teamed up with Wes 'Sheogorath' Johnson, a number of other voice actors and a group of prominent Fallout modders to make a cool thing with a bunch of moving parts in one weekend.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Their creation, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/94745?tab=description">Transmission Zeta</a>, is now available to download via Nexus Mods. It looks like a fun time, though you might not dig the questline it offers if you're not down for plenty of silliness and Fallouty meta humour.</p>
<p>In line with what viewers voted for during a <a href="https://x.com/simsettlements/status/1932626360859820127">June 14th planning stream</a>, that questline is all about aliens. The Zetans from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> Mothership Zeta DLC have returned to The Commonwealth to get up to some abduction antics, along with various other cameos from across the Fallout series. You'll investigate with the aid of Clark, a zany conspiracy theorist voiced by Johnson, and the mod's fully-voiced follower, a vault dwelling con artist called Arlen.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The 40 hour Modathon is over, and you raised just shy of 10k across our events - and there's still one more to go!</p><p>Amazing work from all the modders who poured themselves into this!</p><p>Join <a href="https://twitter.com/GopherGaming?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GopherGaming</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/WesJohnsonVoice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WesJohnsonVoice</a> tomorrow to watch the reveal of what we've assembled! <a href="https://t.co/c7CsW4Xb63">pic.twitter.com/c7CsW4Xb63</a></p></div>— simsettlements (@simsettlements) <a href="https://twitter.com/simsettlements/status/1939538383539417571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>As you play through the quests and explore a new dungeon, one of which is called "V.A.T.S in Spaaace!", you'll gain some custom alien-themed weapons and armour made by modders Neeher and Niero. There's also a player home in the form of a houseboat with its own robot butler that modder Elianora's cooked up.</p>
<p>In order to start the mod's questline once it's installed, the modders write that you'll need to "simply pass through any load screen by fast traveling or entering and exiting a building", at which point a strange new radio station will pop up on your Pip-Boy. If you're not in the mood for modding or just want to get a taste of what you're in for, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0v7JSrvqB8">YouTuber Gopher</a> has livestreamed a playthrough of Transmission Zeta as part of the modathon.</p>
<p>If you are planning on playing the mod, you'll need version 1.10.163.0 or greater of Fallout 4 and all of its DLC aside from Far Harbor and the high-res texture pack.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to investigate this weird blue light that's just begun beaming down from the heavens outside my house.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-fallout-4-quest-mod-has-you-investigating-alien-abductions-for-an-iconic-elder-scrolls-voice-actor]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Although&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/" target="_blank">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>&nbsp;is not focused on combat, the new entry in the series by Kojima Productions introduces new tools and a slew of improvements that make </span>it more fun and convenient to take on all sorts of enemies, ranging from human enemies to BTs. Stealth has been likewise been improved, and the game now provides you with so many tools to clear enemy camps without getting spotted by the enemy.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't take long to notice how fighting enemies and sneaking around still feels  a little cumbersome. Sam's mobility is still quite limited, and is only partially improved by equipping a Battle Skeleton, and enemies seem to be able to spot the porter no matter how careful you are, often turning camp clearing into a head-on combat affair, which doesn't feel great for the same reason sneaking doesn't. As such, you will eventually start avoiding enemy camps completely.</p>



<p>However, there's <strong>a way to make stealth and combat way more enjoyable in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong>, and it's so game-changing that it's really surprising to see how the game doesn't highlight this during what essentially is the long tutorial sequence in Mexico. This trick improves things to much that it makes the game feel more like the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain that we never got.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Before infiltrating an enemy camp, find a safe spot some distance away, <strong>hold the Triangle button to drop your entire backpack</strong>, and try moving around. You will instantly notice how agile Sam is without cargo encumbering him. The difference is really night and day: you can now sprint and slide faster, and consistently double jump after sprinting if you have a Battle Skeleton equipped. Not having cargo on your back also makes it harder for enemies to spot you, meaning that you will have a much easier time sneaking into camps and taking enemies down one by one without getting spotted.</p>



<p>One may argue that dropping the backpack will leave you with a limited number of items that you can use, as only those Sam is carrying in his suit will be available, but this is hardly a problem. The contrary. If you have infiltrated an enemy camp already, you will have noticed how many resources, tools and weapons can be found scattered around, and you can just pick them up on the spot and use during your current infiltration. In many ways, this mirrors the premise of the Metal Gear Solid games where Snake has to procure almost everything he needs to complete his mission on site.</p>



<p>While leaving your backpack behind doesn't help a lot against BTs, as they rely on sound to spot Sam and taking them on directly doesn't reward you in any significant way, leaving your cargo behind helps a lot during boss battles. The increased mobility makes it easier to dodge enemy attacks, and Sam's evasive maneuver, which can be used while aiming, becomes way more useful. As such, always drop your backpack before fighting most enemies, and you will have a much better appreciation of the mechanics of <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, and a much better time overall.</p>

            <p>The team over at Halo Studios will be giving us the "official scoop" for what it's been working on this October.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Halo Studios - née 343 Industries - laid out further details for this year's Halo World Championship event. Here, the developer addressed the "fair amount of speculation" that has been making the rounds recently regarding what it has been working on.</p>

<p>"We don't usually comment on such matters, but this time we want to enter the chat and share a little more perspective for Halo fans who might be on the fence about whether to attend this year's event," the <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-june">post on Halo Waypoint reads</a>.</p>
<p>The studio went on to confirm that, while speculation can be "fun" at times, those looking to get the official word of what is going on "won't want to miss this year's Halo World Championship". That is taking place in Seattle, between 24th - 26th October.</p>
<p>In the same post, Halo Studios noted during last year's event <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">it introduced Project Foundry</a>, its experimental look at how the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-halo-on-unreal-engine-5-means-for-ps5">Xbox flagship franchise will look developed in Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>
<p>As for what the studio could be working on right now, the latest blog post affirmed multiple projects were in the pipeline. One of those projects may well indeed be the rumoured Halo Combat Evolved remaster, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-new-trailer-for-gears-of-war-reloaded">which even Xbox head Phil Spencer teased last month</a>. Then there was the chatter earlier in the year that<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-getting-halo-and-another-big-xbox-game-with-microsoft-set-to-be-a-very-big-supporter"> Xbox was planning on bringing Halo to Switch 2 at some point</a>.</p>
<p>Who can say for sure. For now, we will just have to sit tight, and wait to see what October's Halo World Championship event has in store for us all. Stay tuned!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-official-scoop-on-whats-happening-with-halo-will-arrive-this-october]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It seems like Red Dead Online is suddenly getting some new content, and it's also zombie-themed. The update set to go live later today at 5 AM Eastern Time will <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/1logs5w/monthly_discounts_and_bonuses_july_1st_to_august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">include</a> the so-called Strange Tales of the West, a set of four new Telegram missions where players will aid author Theodore Levin in investigating the unknown. They'll be able to track down undead plagues, rogue automations, swamp beasts, and more by collecting Mr. Levin’s letter from any Post Office or their Camp’s Lockbox, or simply by launching Telegram Missions from the Player Menu.</p>



<p>Telegram Missions, including the new Strange Tales of the West, are paying out 3X Gold, RDO$, and XP. Naturalists also reap rewards with 3X RDO$ and XP on Sample Sales, 3X Role XP and XP on Legendary Animal Sighting Missions, and 2X RDO$ and XP on Wildlife Photography.

<p>Red Dead Online never really took off as much as GTA Online did. Arguably, the much slower pace worked well for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single player masterpiece that is Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, but not nearly as well in online multiplayer. It's been three years since Rockstar openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-online-support-seemingly-slowing-down-to-focus-on-gta-vi-and-gta-online/">acknowledged</a> that they would focus more on making content for the much more successful GTA Online, and it's been a while since RDO got anything new, which is why its fans are now positively surprised. Plus, the zombie theme certainly appears to be a nod to Undead Nightmare, the acclaimed expansion released for the first Red Dead Redemption game.</p>

            <p>"Mark Tyburn dreams of building the perfect video game," reads the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD">sales blurb</a> for Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser's novel A Better Paradise: Volume One: An Aftermath, a title so resplendent with drive-by colons that you could easily guess this man spent thirty years working in videogames. "Kurt Fischer dreams of being a rich and successful executive. Daisy Tyburn dreams of having the ideal father. John Tyburn Smith dreams of fitting in. NigelDave just dreams of becoming human."</p>
<p>PleaseDon'tLetThatBeATypo, I immediately prayed to every god I knew the name of, and a few I made up on the spot. <em>Please let NigelDave be real</em>.</p>

<p>NigelDave is real. He's some sort of sentient AI, I think. And without really knowing anything about the setting, I actually quite like the idea of an AI picking two blokey first names in a sort of Ford Prefect, nicely inconspicuous way. He only wants to be loved, he says.</p>
<p><em>
I</em> love you, NigelDave.</p>
<p>A Better Paradise is Houser's multimedia project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dan-houser-a-better-paradise-video-game-novel-grand-theft-auto-writer/1100-6532850/">note Gamespot</a>. Produced by his company Absurd Ventures, it's got its own <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/abetterparadise/audiofiction">audiofiction series</a> starring Human Traffic's (and The Walking Dead's) Andrew Lincoln. Absurd Ventures also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-studio-is-making-an-open-world-action-adventure-game">announced last year</a> they were making an "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> action-adventure" set in the same universe.</p>
<p>A few of the novel's other characters also have voiced intro videos online. Here's a quote from Daisy Tyburn who, may I remind you, "dreams of having the ideal father". <em>The statistically perfect dad</em>. What's the Bechdel test but for before the character has spoken?</p>
<p>"<a href="https://youtu.be/sGLPNgVSpYQ">I watch the people</a>, and the people are like robots and the robots are like people. People watch their screens and the screens watch people."</p>
<p>Gods, it's like reading Candide all over again. No one man should have access to such a dangerous combination of wit and prescience.</p>
<p>"Set in the near future, A Better Paradise tells the story of the ill-fated development of an ambitious but addictive video game project that goes very wrong," continues the blurb. "As the software they developed starts to produce unexpected and disturbing results, the project is shut down and abandoned. Until now."</p>
<p>The book is out this year, October 14th. Here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/7GGKr1uCFAc">13 minute analysis of Grand Theft Auto 6's beer bottles</a> to keep you going in the wait for that game's release, currently slated for May 26th, 2026.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-and-red-dead-redemption-writers-new-novel-is-about-ill-fated-game-development]]></content:encoded>
