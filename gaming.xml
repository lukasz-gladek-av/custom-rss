          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/" data-ref-id="5000-507834">Hytale</a> revolves around your ability to discover new resources and craft items using those resources. You can craft blocks for building a base, gear to fend off mobs, and weapons and tools to progress into more advanced biomes on the map. However, most of the items you're able to make in Hytale are crafted at different workbenches.</p><p>Workbenches are like Crafting Tables from Minecraft, but Hytale is different in that certain workbenches can craft specific items and materials. Whether you're playing solo or in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-multiplayer-in-hytale/1100-6537377/" data-ref-id="1100-6537377">Hytale multiplayer</a>, if you want to craft all sorts of items in Hytale, you'll need to know the recipes for every single workbench in the game.</p><h2 id="How_to_unlock_workbenches_in_Hytale">How to unlock workbenches in Hytale</h2><p>When you start Hytale, you won't be able to immediately make all of these crafting stations. Instead, you have to unlock your first workbench, which is done by using the crafting recipe for the regular workbench (3x Stones, 4x Tree Trunks).</p><p>This is done by going to your inventory by pressing "Tab" and selecting the workbench from the crafting menu. With the required resources in your inventory, you can click "Craft," and your first workbench is now ready to be placed down.</p><p>A regular workbench is how you craft all other workbenches in Hytale, so you always want to ensure you have one readily accessible. Fortunately, all it takes is any Stone and Tree Trunks to craft, which are always around you, regardless of what biome you're wandering around. Oak Logs are likely to be the first Tree Trunks you can get after leaving the spawn cave.</p><h2 id="How_to_craft_all_workbenches_in_Hytale">How to craft all workbenches in Hytale</h2><p>In total, there are eight craftable workbenches in Hytale, and each one has a different use when it comes to crafting certain items, materials, etc. To have a fully functioning base that can produce any kind of item in the game, you'll want to ensure you have a spot for all eight workbenches.</p><p>Of course, knowing what the workbenches are is only half the battle; you'll also need to know how to craft them and what is craftable at the workbench itself. Below, you can see every workbench, its crafting recipe, and what the workbench is able to produce.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Workbench Name</th><th scope="col">Crafting Use</th><th scope="col">Crafting Recipe</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Workbench</td><td>Starter tools and weapons</td><td>3x Stones<br>4x Tree Trunks</td></tr><tr><td>Armorer's Workbench</td><td>Armor</td><td>2x Copper Ingot<br>5x Stones<br>10x Tree Trunks</td></tr><tr><td>Builder's Workbench</td><td>Base-building items</td><td>3x Stones<br>6x Tree Trunks</td></tr><tr><td>Farmer's Workbench</td><td>Food/crop items</td><td>6x Tree Trunks<br>20x Plant Fiber</td></tr><tr><td>Alchemist's Workbench</td><td>Potions and healing supplies</td><td>5x Gold Ingot<br>10x Bone Fragment<br>10x Venom Sac<br>20x Stones</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture Workbench</td><td>Base furniture and decorations</td><td><p>4x Stones<br>6x Tree Trunks</p></td></tr><tr><td>Arcanist's Workbench</td><td>Teleporters and magical items</td><td>10x Thorium Ingots<br>20x Essence of the Void<br>30x Linen Scraps</td></tr><tr><td>Salvager's Workbench</td><td>Used to salvage and destroy items</td><td>5x Tree Trunks<br>5x Stones<br>6x Iron Ingots</td></tr></tbody></table><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4635460-4bdebd6ec1c85a7c3be45231a86dc5ca.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635460" data-ratio="0.53686274509804" data-width="2550" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4635460-4bdebd6ec1c85a7c3be45231a86dc5ca.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635460"></a><figcaption>Some of the craftable Workbenches in Hytale</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4635460-4bdebd6ec1c85a7c3be45231a86dc5ca.jpg"></figure><p>There are also four other crafting stations in Hytale that aren't clearly marked as workbenches, but they perform very similarly and are able to craft additional items.

    <article>
      <p>Yesterday, news broke that as part of layoffs affecting around 10,000 people at Meta, the company had <a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-ubisoft-unity-layoffs-2026/"><u>closed three VR studios</u></a>: Sanzaru, Armature, and Twisted Pixel. Now former Meta employees tell Aftermath that <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> developer Camouflaj has suffered heavy layoffs as well, and that in-development game projects have been canceled.</p><p>Speaking under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, former Meta employees said that Camouflaj is now made up of “just a handful of employees” who are working on "the new user experience for upcoming hardware." Studio heads, they told Aftermath, have been let go, and active game projects under development have been shut down. Additionally, they say, a sequel to <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> was in development at Sanzaru – rather than Camouflaj – but as of yesterday, Sanzaru no longer exists.</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Meta for additional details, but did not receive a response as of this publishing. A Meta spokesperson <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-game-quest-vr-facebook-deadpool-sanzaru-twisted-pixel-layoffs-2000659376?ref=aftermath.site"><u>told Kotaku</u></a> that Camouflaj was affected by layoffs but is not shutting down.</p><p>While Camouflaj is best known these days for Batman: Arkham Shadow, it got its start with <em>Republique</em>, a 2013 stealth action-adventure that drew on studio founder Ryan Payton's history as a producer on the <em>Metal Gear</em> series. Camouflaj also released <em>Iron Man VR</em> in 2020.</p><p>A handful of Camouflaj employees have taken to LinkedIn to mourn what they’ve lost.</p><p>"I was a part of the recent Meta layoffs that hit Camouflaj," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kaitlinspangler_hey-everyone-i-was-a-part-of-the-recent-activity-7417305593205403648-l6wM?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGs78MBAu8ABzhFGUjynFfCNjxCGUPune0"><u>wrote</u></a> senior animator Kaitlin S. "It's been an incredible 12+ years with the team, and I am so proud of what we accomplished in that time! I will miss the Camouflaj team a great deal. It was an incredible group of game devs."</p><p>"Like many folks in the industry right now, I was recently impacted by layoffs at Meta and Camouflaj," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordan-santiago-pearson_like-many-folks-in-the-industry-right-now-activity-7417335554993860608-keUE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGs78MBAu8ABzhFGUjynFfCNjxCGUPune0"><u>wrote</u></a> cinematic and level designer Jordan Pearson. "I can’t begin to describe my gratitude for my time there. I initially joined the studio early in my career and had the opportunity to grow from intern to production assistant, then into level design, and before I knew it I was taking the lead on cinematic design &amp; implementation in <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>. Camouflaj gave me space to take ownership and follow my passion for storytelling. I'll always be thankful to the teammates who trusted me and mentored me. I’ve never before worked with such talented, compassionate people."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-ubisoft-unity-layoffs-2026/"><div><p>Bad Day</p><p>Two weeks into the year, too many layoffs</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

<p>Oh God, it’s happening…. perhaps.</p>



<p>Recently, Shiina posted a roundup of the latest Fortnite news in a short YouTube video. One rumor suggested that a nostalgic duo from a live-action TV show could be coming to the game as early as next week.</p>



<p>Shiina said that if that is true, it could be The Office, as they had heard the collaboration within the works. Their tone made it clear this was not a lock. Whether Jim Halpert and Pam Beesley or Dwight Schrute and Michael Scott, The Office has no shortage of iconic duos that could be added to the game.</p>

<p>Fortnite recently announced a collaboration with South Park, which includes map exchanges, new skins, and limited-time Quint (5-Player) playlists. Over time, Fortnite has also partnered with The Simpsons, Adventure Time, WWE, and more.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming will continue to monitor the story and report whether or not The Office is officially coming to Fortnite, but as we all know, you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. Michael Scott said that Wayne Gretzky said that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Two Months Later, Only 10,000 Escape from Tarkov Players Have Finished the Game]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-player-count-finished-game/</link>
            <guid>1406497</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two months ago, Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0 and was officially released as a <strong>full game</strong>. It was the most monumental milestone in the studio’s history, and the game’s director called it the most significant moment of his life. The release of Tarkov 1.0 introduced the game’s ultimate ending, achievable after completing an all-new campaign.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and just <strong>10,489 players </strong>have managed to complete the game. It’s not known exactly how many people <strong>play </strong>Escape from Tarkov, but on Steam alone, you typically have around 25,000 concurrent players at peak times – and that’s the minority platform <strong>by far</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-people-have-completed-escape-from-tarkov">How Many People Have Completed Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, confirmed that, at the time of writing, 10,489 players had <strong>escaped from Tarkov</strong>. When Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0 in November, this became the ultimate goal for fans worldwide, but also emerged as one of the toughest challenges ever presented in the extraction shooter space.</p>



<p>To make it to the game’s ending, an entire campaign with some hefty quests must be completed, and players then need to contend with a final ‘gauntlet’ through a new map, Terminal. This is the final mission and arguably the toughest thing Tarkov players have ever faced.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">10489 players escaped fromTarkov so far. Beasts! 🫡</p>— Nikita Buyanov (@nikgeneburn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/2011537504126845148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>If that wasn’t enough, players need to escape from boarding a boat, but depending on their squad size, <strong>not everyone </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-ending-zubr-seats-changes-battlestate-games/">is guaranteed a spot</a> on said vessel. That means that, for one or two players, it’s a trip back to the lobby and a second go at the final gauntlet.</p>



<p>It took <strong>two weeks </strong>for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/">first player in the world</a>, <strong>Tigz</strong>, to successfully escape from Tarkov. He did this while streaming live, and the broadcast was tuned into by several Battlestate Games employees, including Buyanov himself.</p>



<p>Many players have followed in his footsteps, but 10,489 users represent a serious minority group in the assumed <strong>millions </strong>of Escape from Tarkov owners. In August 2025, Nikita gave fans a glimpse at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-player-count-how-many/">how many people were playing</a> Escape from Tarkov <strong>PvP </strong>on a random Sunday evening, and the number was around 45,000.</p>



<p>That doesn’t include PvE, which should equal another 30,000 – 40,000 (if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/">Nikita’s PvE player count</a> claims are accurate). That means almost 100,000 concurrent players were enjoying Tarkov on a Sunday evening, and extrapolation means that just 10% of those players would have completed the game, two months after the opportunity became available.</p>



<p>We can safely say very few Tarkov players have managed to accomplish the ultimate goal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Legacy of Kain Creator Reveals New Game ‘Deadhaus Sonata’ 30 Years Later]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-creator-reveals-deadhaus-sonata/</link>
            <guid>1406482</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In 1996, Denis Dyack created Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, a game that would go on to spawn another four titles over the next seven years. The series license was secured by Crystal Dynamics in the late nineties, pulling control away from Dyack, who would then go on to direct and produce Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem, Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes, and Too Human.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, Denis Dyack will be fully unveiling his new game, dubbed a spiritual successor to Legacy of Kain arriving 30 years later. It’s called Deadhaus Sonata, and it’s an action RPG being pieced together by Apocalypse Studios. On social media, the team shared a short trailer, and the title is available to wishlist and <strong>examine closer </strong>on Steam.</p>







<h2 id="h-deadhaus-sonata-the-dead-do-not-sleep-forever">Deadhaus Sonata – ‘The Dead Do Not Sleep Forever’</h2>



<p>The Deadhaus Sonata team published a short trailer for their upcoming narrative-driven RPG on social media, showcasing some of the gameplay mechanics. The account was established way back in 2018, so the game has been in development for quite some time.</p>



<p>Fans of a vampiric tale will be enthused by Deadhaus Sonata’s blurb:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The creator of Legacy of Kain is back. Become the undead in a third-person narrative-driven action RPG where your choices shape your legend and the world around you. Feed to grow stronger, embrace powerful classes, and carve your path alone or in co-op through a dark realm filled with secrets.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142050/Deadhaus_Sonata/#app_reviews_hash"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s no release date yet for Deadhaus Sonata, but the game is being more fully unveiled tomorrow. What we do know is that it’ll be coming first to early access, allowing players to ‘become the undead’ and assume control of a powerful vampire with supernatural abilities.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The marketing spiel for Deadhaus Sonata is ambitious and promises a lot:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Deadhaus Sonata is a new dark fantasy world shaped by psychological depth, interconnected lore, and player-driven consequence. Every choice leaves a mark on your character and the world around you, with sentient gear, persistent events, and outcomes shaped by time, place, and action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the game can be wishlisted on Steam <strong>now</strong>, the title’s website stresses that it’ll be available on ‘all major platforms.’</p>

Look. This is almost as exciting as when we all learned New Horizons would give us the ability to sit down on the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes as a part of Animal Crossing: New Horizon's 3.0 update, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-big-30-update-just-dropped-a-day-early">which dropped a day early today</a>, giving access to a new Hotel area, loads of new decorative items, some quality of life features like bulk crafting, and Dream Islands you can build alongside friends. But as players have discovered since, it's also added a subtle new feature to aid in construction and placement: essentially, a controlled way to step in the cardinal directions in very precise ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This feature is now tutorialed as part of obtaining the Construction App, though it's possible it may be available prior to that, and it's very easy to activate. You can use it any time by pressing the L button. Pressing it once will snap your character into place with a tiny little hop. Holding it down and moving the stick in a direction will let you take exactly one step in that direction, effectively the size of one "square" of space. This is ideal for activities such as precise furniture placement, or lining yourself up perfectly to hit rocks or even catch bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, sure, it's not actually a huge deal - just a fun quality of life feature. It's not like a REAL jump (and you can already jump small gaps automatically anyway). But Animal Crossing's audience has historically gotten very excited about little touches like this, such as the wave of excitement when sitting on the ground was confirmed to be in the game, or the love for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/77-amazing-little-details-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons">any number of other tiny details</a> players have found over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, if they ever add jump attacks it's over for you people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other small details in the new update worth celebrating, such as the ability to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qcmzyq/you_can_have_new_custom_design_on_slumber_islands/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">save individual custom designs to Slumber Islands</a> (effectively giving you even more slots), and the fact that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qcuyk8/former_villagers_remember_us/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former Islanders visiting the Hotel will remember you</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got a comprehensive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/ACNH_3.0_Update_and_Switch_2_Edition:_All_Details_and_Everything_New">guide to the 3.0 update</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/Kappns_Family_Hotel_-_How_to_Unlock_and_Guide">how to unlock everything</a> and what's included, as a part of our Animal Crossing: New Horizons Wiki guide.

		<p>Amazon have found their Kratos and he is not new to the God of War universe.&nbsp; Ryan Hurst will be playing the PlayStation icon, having previously voiced Thor in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/">God of War Ragnarok.</a></p>
<p>The show has had two seasons ordered before the first scene has been filmed, with pre-production currently underway. The series will be skipping the Greek games and beginning in Norse mythology, but one would assume they are going to have explain why Kratos is covered in white ash and has giant chains wrapped around his forearms.</p>


<p>Ryan Hurst is best known for playing Opie Winston in Sons of Anarchy and will be seen on the big screen later this year in Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey.</p>
<p>Amazon’s TV adaption of Sony’s God of War games landed an Emmy award-winning director for the first two episodes. Frederick E.O. Toye has signed up and should be familiar with historical violence, having directed Shogun for Disney, and also The Boys for Amazon.</p>
<p>He joins Ronald D. Moore, creator of the highly acclaimed Battlestar Galactica remake, who will be the showrunner. The series was announced in 2022 with Rafe Judkins as the showrunner, but he left the project in 2024 due to creative differences.</p>

<p><em>“’God of War’&nbsp;is a compelling, character-driven franchise that we believe will captivate our global customers as much with its expansive and immersive worlds as its rich storytelling,”</em> Vernon Sanders, head of global television at Amazon Studios, said. <em>“We are honored to share in the adventure of exploring the&nbsp;God of War&nbsp;mythology in such a momentous way with Sony Pictures Television, PlayStation Productions, and Santa Monica Studio.”</em></p>

<p>Sony has a Horizon Zero Dawn movie in the works and a sequel to the Uncharted movie was announced years ago, but that seems to be dead in the water, perhaps due to Tom Holland’s busy schedule.&nbsp; Sony Pictures are also producing the Metal Gear Solid movie.</p>

            <p>
It's kind of baffling how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> came out almost two full decades ago, and there's hardly a whisper of a game that's managed to match its art direction. The thing is just too clean, too specific, there's a purpose to every detail. It feels like the future distilled into digital form, though no one really followed suit in the years since, opting for drab, lifeless realism instead. Except, as it turns out, that's almost what Mirror's Edge looked like too.
</p>
<p>
Over on <a href="https://www.designroom.site/mirrors-edge-an-oral-history/">Design Room</a>, as part of an oral history of the game, some of the game's original senior devs shared a lovely assortment of details. As it turns out, when Mirror's Edge was still in development, it was originally going to look more like other Unreal Engine games of the time (brown), with senior producer Owen O'Brien noting how not particularly unique it looked. "But we found that when you were moving very fast through the world, you got simulation sickness very quickly," O'Brien explained. "discovered that it was lessened if you made the world cleaner and less detailed."
</p>
<p>
Art director Johannes Söderqvist also took part in the interview, saying how it was just your generic, run-down New York style rooftops kind of look. "It wasn't bad; it looked good, actually," he said. "But there was no style to it, or a fairly generic style." It was O'Brien who wanted the game to stand out a bit more visually, noting that you couldn't tell the difference between games like Battlefield, Call of Duty, and Rainbow Six. "I said to the team, 'I want to look at a screenshot of Mirror's Edge in a magazine and know it's our game,'" O'Brien said.
</p>
<p>
So, Söderqvist worked with his art team to figure out how to get that striking look, drafting up a visual target, ultimately deciding to just strip out all of the colours from the textures, leaving most of the environments as pure white, the occasional block of colour to guide you.
</p><p>
I quite like lighting artist Oscar Carlén's take on what the world of Mirror's Edge is ultimately like too because of this decision: "Even though Faith is living in this very dystopian society where everything is controlled and monitored, she has such a hopeful spirit, a bright view of life. I think the lighting does a great job of making you feel that perspective."
</p>
<p>
If you haven't already, do give Design Room's full piece a read. Great stuff they're doing over there! And play Mirror's Edge too, still one of the best to do it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>How’s 2026 going for you? I’m hoping you’ve at least kept up your NYT Connections streak – I know I have! If you’re looking for a quick way to solve today’s NYT Connections puzzle, look no further than this snapshot guide. I’ve got your NYT Connections hints and answers right here, ready to digest.</p>



<p>Read on to wrap today’s NYT Connections challenge and move on with your day!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-15">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 15)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #949:</p>



<ul>
<li>CEREAL</li>



<li>STATIC</li>



<li>MELTED</li>



<li>SNOW</li>



<li>LEVITATE</li>



<li>SALT</li>



<li>PATRON</li>



<li>SHOVEL</li>



<li>HOSE</li>



<li>STATIONARY</li>



<li>SPADE</li>



<li>JACKAL</li>



<li>FROZEN</li>



<li>RAKE</li>



<li>DANDRUFF</li>



<li>STILL</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all things you’d grab from a shed when working in the yard.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These all describe something that isn’t changing position or activity.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each of these can appear as tiny, thin pieces that fall, sprinkle, or scatter.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word hides two common male first names back-to-back (sometimes overlapping slightly in sound or letters).</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 15:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-15-949">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 15 (#949)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– HOSE, RAKE, SHOVEL, SPADE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – FROZEN, STATIC, STATIONARY, STILL</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CEREAL, DANDRUFF, SALT, SNOW</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – JACKAL, LEVITATE, MELTED, PATRON</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Since the days of <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> and <em>Doom</em>, the humble first-person shooter has flourished in myriad and complex directions. The genre has expanded in narrative and gameplay terms to include everything from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/i-played-half-life-2-for-the-first-time-this-year-heres-how-it-went/">sprawling sci-fi</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/review-halo-infinites-campaign-finishes-the-fight-but-arrives-in-tatters/">epics</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/08/bioshock-objectivism-philosophy-analysis/">dense objectivist allegories</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-review-war-games-now-with-battle-royale/">multiplayer-focused military free-for-alls</a> and practically everything in between.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, you just want an excuse to shoot a bunch of weird little guys in weird little spaces.</p>

<p>For those times, there is <em>Oddcore</em>, a new Early Access, roguelike boomer shooter that is a stark contrast to the more sprawling self-serious shooters out there. The game’s combination of frenetic, quick-moving action, semi-randomized scenarios, and well-balanced risk/reward upgrade system makes for a pick-up-and-play shooter that I find myself struggling not to pick up and play for a few more quick-hit sessions even as I write this.</p>
<h2>Hold on for one more stage</h2>
<p><em>Oddcore</em> begins with a wacky, bare-bones narrative about being trapped in some incomplete theme park resort with an “infinite room generator” that is on the fritz. After the quick tutorial, though, that narrative just serves as an excuse to throw you into a series of off-putting liminal spaces that make you feel like you’re trapped in a corrupted PlayStation 1 disc. Each of these low-res polygonal rooms slowly fills with malformed black-and-white demons, most of which run at you with a fanaticism straight out of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/12/serious-sam-3-is-hardcore-difficult-and-lovely/"><em>Serious Sam</em>, </a>threatening to bite at your ankles or floating menacingly toward you while launching slow-moving pink projectiles at you.</p>

<p>This is not one of those shooters where you cower behind cover and pop up for a quick shot when it’s safe. More often than not, each “variant” arena is a more or less wide-open space where enemies can and will swarm in from every side. You’ll find yourself almost constantly backing away and strafing to avoid encroaching enemies while also keeping your head on a swivel to make sure there aren’t any new threats appearing behind you.</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention that all this is happening on a tight five-minute timer that’s ticking down as you play? To extend an <em>Oddcore</em> session past that limit, you have to tap a button on your gun to create a portal to a weird shop dimension, where you can spend the souls of dead enemies for more in-game time. You can also spend those souls on a series of slow-machine randomized sets of upgrades to your health, attack speed, and assistance gadgets, or save up those souls to use as a quick health boost in the middle of a firefight.</p>

You should have a letter from Luna informing you that Slumber Islands are now available. More on this later.</p><p dir="ltr">Assuming you’ve unlocked Kapp’n, the <strong>Seaside Hotel should be available already</strong>. That’s right, it’s that easy. You don’t need to give it a day before it gets built. Unfortunately, if you haven’t unlocked Kapp’n yet, you need to attend your first K.K. Slider concert and hit a 3-star island rating. Bummer.</p><p dir="ltr">Upon entering the hotel, Tom Nook will introduce you to Kapp’n’s family. Fun fact: If you head to the Resident Services building before visiting the hotel, you’ll notice that Tom Nook isn’t at his usual station.</p><p dir="ltr">After you’ve made it through the pleasantries, Leilani will give you your first job: <strong>Decorate a room</strong>. You can put as much or as little effort into this as you’d like. Once it’s done, <strong>a guest will show up immediately</strong>. Hugh was our very first guest, but yours may differ.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4634810-howtoprepareforanimalcrossingnewhorizons3.01-48screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4634810" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4634810-howtoprepareforanimalcrossingnewhorizons3.01-48screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4634810"></a><figcaption>The new hotel is unlocked right away, so long as you've unlocked Kapp'n already.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4634810-howtoprepareforanimalcrossingnewhorizons3.01-48screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">After you’ve welcomed your first guest, Tom Nook will explain <strong>Kapp’n’s new shipping service</strong>. Kapp’n will request specific craftable items, and by creating and shipping them, you’ll earn <strong>Hotel Tickets</strong>. Thankfully, you can now <strong>craft multiple of the same items at once</strong> to speed up the process.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, completing these requests will increase your hotel’s notoriety--at least this is what Kapp’n tells you. We don’t know yet if this is lip service or if there is an actual benefit to completing these requests outside of getting extra Hotel Tickets and new items from the souvenir shop.</p><p dir="ltr">After talking to Kapp’n and Nook, <strong>head back inside and speak with Leilani to decorate your second room</strong>. Upon completion, she’ll tell you to come back tomorrow for more work. Decorate both rooms if you want to maximize your time while you wait. If you want, you can use your tickets to purchase some souvenirs either directly from the shop or Gram’s catalogue. Keep in mind that ordering from her catalogue costs extra.</p><p dir="ltr">If you’d like, you can also <strong>customize the mannequins in the lobby</strong> so visitors and friends can quickly change into an island uniform.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Track_down_Resetti">Track down Resetti</h2><p dir="ltr">That’s about all you can do in the hotel today, so let’s wander your island for a bit. You may stumble upon your visitor roaming your island, but the animal we’re looking for is Resetti. Once you find him, he’ll tell you all about his <strong>new Reset services</strong> that can clear out your entire island or specific parts of it.</p><p dir="ltr">It costs 60,000 bells per use and it can be used as many times as you’d like, but the first day of use is free! You can redeem this free day whenever you like, so don’t feel pressured to take advantage of it today. Just speak to Isabelle when you require his services.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4634811-howtoprepareforanimalcrossingnewhorizons3.01-37screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4634811" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4634811-howtoprepareforanimalcrossingnewhorizons3.01-37screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4634811"></a><figcaption>If you find them stylish, you can check out the new Lego outfits and other items.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4634811-howtoprepareforanimalcrossingnewhorizons3.01-37screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">We decided to use his services ASAP because I have a bunch of flowers we wanted to get rid of, or rather<em> store</em>, because, thanks to this update, you can <strong>store your flowers</strong>.

You can’t specify for him to just pick up only flowers or furniture, for example. Even though he said he was picking up flowers, he also stored all of our furniture, so we had to re-place all of our furniture in those cleaned areas.

He can expand your storage again, something I recommend you do today, since it will take a day before it goes into effect. You can also celebrate the Hotel’s grand opening if you’d like. Be sure to also check the Nook Terminal to pick up the <strong>new Lego furniture</strong> if anything strikes your fancy.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, if you have a <strong>Zelda or Splatoon Amiibo</strong>, you can invite some of the new villagers to your Campsite.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Check_out_Slumber_Islands">Check out Slumber Islands</h2><p dir="ltr">Now let’s get back to Luna. Head home, or to a nearby bed, and <strong>take a nap</strong>. You’ll notice a new option: It’s slumber time. Choose this and Luna will prepare a slumber island for you. Here you can construct and decorate to your heart's content.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4635509-howtoprepareforanimalcrossingnewhorizons3.03-27screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635509" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4635509-howtoprepareforanimalcrossingnewhorizons3.03-27screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635509"></a><figcaption>Slumber Islands behave like a Creative mode where you can bring your friends to hang out.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4635509-howtoprepareforanimalcrossingnewhorizons3.03-27screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can change your look, build bridges, and decorate your island with furniture and items you’ve collected over the years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Bully Online,</em> a mod that added online multiplayer to Rockstar’s classic open-world game, is shutting down less than a month after launch. The creators haven’t explained why yet, but fans are already blaming Rockstar Games and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for the sudden demise of the project.</p> <p>Developed by Fat Pigeon, a collection of modders and fans, and led by <em>Bully</em> content creator Swegta, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bully-online-mod-play-free-gta-online-release-pc-rockstar-2000639618"><em>Bully Online</em> took years to develop</a> and launched on PC on December 15. The mod added new content like mini-games, multiplayer activities, custom vehicles, and competitive racing. Fans were excited to check it out, especially as the original <em>Bully</em> didn’t include online multiplayer and Rockstar seems unwilling to make a sequel or remaster anytime soon. But now, not long after it was released, the mod is shutting down.</p>

  <p>On January 14, a message was posted to the official <em>Bully Online</em> Discord server announcing that the mod will be shut down “forever”&nbsp; in 24 hours. According to the Discord announcement, <a href="https://x.com/TheNathanNS/status/2011478101419544964/photo/1">as seen in a message shared by TheNathanNS on Twitter,</a> the devs are stopping development of new content and scripts for the mod, removing the source code from the main site, and deleting any webpages connected to the mod, as well as wiping all account data connected to the project. The modders say players can hop on and enjoy <em>Bully Online</em> for the next 24 hours until the servers are completely wiped and deleted for good.</p>

 <h2>Why is <em>Bully Online</em> shutting down?</h2> <p>As for why <em>Bully Online</em> is being killed, nobody involved has provided a clear answer. On Discord, the announcement does make it clear that this wasn’t what the modders had planned, saying, “For now though, know this was not something we wanted.” The messages also promise that Swegta will be posting a video in the near future explaining more.</p>

 <p>Many fans are already blaming Rockstar and/or Take-Two Interactive, companies that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ambitious-gta-underground-mod-shutdowns-after-six-years-1847619249">have a long track record</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-is-removing-old-gta-mods-using-dmca-notices-1847315391">screwing with</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-sues-gta-reverse-engineering-project-1847613341">shutting down fan projects and mods</a>. But it should be noted that at the moment, we don’t know for sure what happened.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted both Swegta and Rockstar Games for more information, but didn’t hear back from either before publication.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/SWEGTA/status/2011478849431687225">Swegta himself also confirmed the news on Twitter</a>, posting on Wednesday that he will make a “proper statement on the situation” on January 21. On the creator’s website, a new message was added that states: “The Bully Online project is shutting down. Thank you all for playing.”</p>

And now, it's coming to the U.S. for a one-night-only theatrical release on February 27, 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2026/1/14/umamusume-pretty-derby-beginning-of-a-new-era-anime-film-north-american-release-date" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared by Crunchyroll</a>, the film will hit select, to-be-announced theaters in the U.S. for a one-night screening next month, and shared an English-language <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4dMQOzj-5g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a> and poster alongside the news.

It features the Umamusume, or women with some of the features (such as ears and tails) and abilities of horses who participate in races styled after real-world historical horse races. In the game this takes the form of a sports simulation game where players train Umamusume to compete in various raises and meet certain, character-specific goals.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the mobile game, a multi-season anime, a manga, and various other spinoffs, Umamusume has covered the stories of multiple characters based on real-world race horses from the '90s, '00s, and '10s. The film, Beginning of a New Era, released in Japan on May 24, 2024 and follows Jungle Pocket, based on the real-world horse of the same name, and her rivalries with Agnes Tachyon, Manhattan Cafe, and Dantsu Flame. In the film, Jungle Pocket trains with veteran trainer Tanabe in an effort to win the Triple Crown, a series of three races that can only be competed in once in a lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umamusume: Pretty Derby launched in the U.S. in July of last year and only increased its popularity from what it already enjoyed in Japan. So much so that fans are now paying attention to the real-life horses that inspired their fictional counterparts, cheering them on, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-fans-mourn-death-of-champion-racehorse-grass-wonder">even mourning the death of one last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Punching trees might never be the same. </h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After more than 10 years in development, Hytale early access is here! If you’re just getting started, we’re writing a variety of early-game guides on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hytale/How_to_Make_a_Furnace_and_Smelt">smelting</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hytale/How_to_Play_with_Friends_and_Set_up_Hytale_Servers">setting up servers for friends</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hytale/Hytale_Progression_Guide">plenty more</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I preferred to go in blind. Hytale is quite obviously heavily Minecraft coded, but developer Hypixel is also doing its own thing in ways big and small, too. Below are seven things in Hytale's early game that surprised me, coming at it specifically from a Minecraft’s player’s perspective. Anything I missed? Have some early-game observations of your own? Leave a comment! </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>1. Punching down a single tree knocks down the entire thing at once, giving you a pile of wood, sticks, and sap along with it. No floating tree trunks here!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale is very clearly heavily Minecraft-inspired, but one area in which it does feel quite different is in that time-honored opening crafting survival game moment of punching down your first few trees. In Hytale, like Terreria and plenty of other survival games, the whole tree collapses and explodes like a little piñata of wood and resources once you disconnect it from the ground. You'll need all that sap, trust me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>2. Early overworld mobs are tankier than expected</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-11-49-25-am-1768423172423.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">How was I supposed to know this cutie would take nine hits?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Within my first few minutes in Hytale I had come across squirrels, rabbits, sheep, and even a fox. And although none of them were hard to kill at all (sorry little guys, but I need your pelts for early-game crafting recipes), I was a little surprised at how much HP they seem to have, and how many hits from my first crude sword it took to take them down. I had to chase one rabbit halfway across the plains - they're quite speedy when making their getaway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>3. Ores glint faintly in underground caves</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-42-54-pm-1768423553440.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Sweet, sweet early game Copper.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is truly a tiny detail, but still one I thought was neat. When spelunking in Hytale, if you look carefully, an otherwise pitch-black cave wall or crevasse will glint off distant light sources like your torch if there are any valuable ores present. Helpful!
</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>4. Gear Progression Is a bit more complicated</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-41-18-pm-1768423553440.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Iron upgrades will have to wait.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In my first cave I explored I found plenty of copper ore for Tier 1 armor, but I also found a stack or so of iron ore, for Tier 2 gear. I was initially a little bit disappointed, thinking maybe I could just leapfrog past tier 1 entirely. But crafting weapons and armor in Hytale actually requires a few different raw materials, which I appreciated. Copper armor requires only copper and plant fiber. But Iron requires iron, light leather, and linen scraps. So it looks like I have more mob grinding in my near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>5. There are more decorative options</strong></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-44-00-pm-1768423553440.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale’s crafting system in early access is still very basic (and a little buggy), but coming from Minecraft, I still appreciated some small crafting details like being able to turn raw wood and stone into slanted, tiled roof blocks and half-block-thick walls when building out my starter hut. You can also place shelves on our walls and stick a few decoratives like candles and books on them. By the way - huge fan of how Hytale's crafting benches can see and make use of resources stored in nearby chests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>6. There are promising secrets and surprises</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-1-19-53-pm-1768423653838.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A first look at the still-heavily-under-construction Forgotten Temple.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale is what I would describe as an “aggressively” early access game. Most of the time when you come across something interesting in the world like what looks like a dungeon entrance, or a hand-built ruin, you’ll be stopped from entering and shown a literal under construction “work in progress” sign. There is one exception though, which illustrates some of the promise of what is hopefully to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on I spotted a nearby icon on my map labeled “Forgotten Temple Gateway.” Without spoiling the details, investigating said gateway led to a fight against a unique mob and a portal to a beautiful and entirely unique, hand-crafted location, filled with its own NPCs and points of interest. Hytale for now looks to be very thin on hand-crafted Adventure content, but this tiny taste was an encouraging place to start. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>7 Farming Is a Bit More Complex</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-44-21-pm-1768423553440.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Next order of business: start my chicken empire.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although I didn’t get a chance to dive into the feature in detail because I had to go back to (grumble grumble) <em>work, </em>I did get a chance to poke around Hytale’s farming system a bit. So far it looks like, similar to most of Hytale’s other systems, it’s a bit more complex than Minecraft’s. You can craft animal caretaking buildings including chicken coops and beehives, as well as a farming aids like a watering can. Tree saplings and new crop seeds don’t come from harvesting, but instead must be created by spending “Essence of Life,” which seems a bit like a currency you receive when harvesting mature crops.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, as a Minecraft veteran - I’ve been playing off and on since there were Secret Friday Updates! - Hytale’s opening few hours are familiar enough and yet still different enough to keep me interested and coming back for more.

            <title><![CDATA[Finally, Some Good AI Policies]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/bandcamp-games-workshop-ai-ban/</link>
            <guid>1406416</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>For the lion’s share of companies, there seem to be two schools of thought around generative AI: 1) We’re gonna add it to everything, <a href="https://aftermath.site/please-seek-help-immediately/"><u>customer sentiment be damned</u></a>, and then we’re gonna be rich, rich, rich, or 2) Of course we’re wary of AI’s implications, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-larian-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate/"><u>c'maahn I'm just a little guy, it's also my birthday, I'm a little birthday boy</u></a>. I’d like to personally commend Games Workshop and Bandcamp for bucking this trend.&nbsp;</p><p>The former, which makes <em>Warhammer</em>, said as part of its recent financial results that while a few senior managers at the company are well-versed in AI and have been given free rein to be “inquisitive” about potential usage, “none are that excited about it yet,” and it’s banned otherwise.</p><p>“We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorized use outside of GW including in any of our competitions,” said CEO Kevin Rountree (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech?ref=aftermath.site"><u>IGN</u></a>). “We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective; the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.”</p><p>He added that “we have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our <em>Warhammer </em>Studio – hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make <em>Warhammer </em>the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”</p><p>Bandcamp, one of the few services that still tries to help musicians make money, took things a step further, <a href="https://blog.bandcamp.com/2026/01/13/keeping-bandcamp-human/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announcing this week</u></a> that music generated “wholly or in substantial part by AI is not permitted.” AI impersonations of existing artists are also not allowed.</p><p>“We believe that the human connection found through music is a vital part of our society and culture, and that music is much more than a product to be consumed,” the company wrote. “It’s the result of a human cultural dialog stretching back before the written word. Similarly, musicians are more than mere producers of sound. They are vital members of our communities, our culture, and our social fabric. Bandcamp was built to directly connect artists and their fans, and to make it easy for fans to support artists equitably so that they can keep making music.”</p><p>Bandcamp’s stance is a crucial one as the popularity of AI-generated music, regrettably, explodes. Take, for example, neo-soul artist Sienna Rose, who has three songs in the Spotify top 50 <a href="https://www.avclub.com/the-hottest-neo-soul-artist-on-spotify-doesnt-exist?ref=aftermath.site"><u>despite not existing</u></a>. “She,” unfortunately, is just <a href="https://www.avclub.com/ai-music-slop-haven-timbaland-tata-spotify-breaking-rust?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the tip of the iceberg</u></a>. This does not mean AI has reached a standard of quality such that it’s an acceptable substitute for art made by people with hopes, dreams, and, well, souls; rather, decades of paint-by-numbers pop formulated by the same nine producers and the hyper-commercialization of music by services like Spotify – turning artists’ blood, sweat, and tears into disposable background noise – have primed people to accept watered-down, machine-made gruel. It’s not unlike the way SEO and algorithms turned numerous websites into barely sentient content mills <em>before </em>AI swooped in and finished the job. The powers that be have been trying to build this world for decades. AI was just the missing puzzle piece.</p><p>All we can do now is support the people and organizations that prioritize authentic human ingenuity while doing the slow, hard work of constructing something, anything, better than the modern internet – preferably somewhere else.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/please-seek-help-immediately/"><div><p>Please Seek Help Immediately</p><p>Motherfucker have you listened to yourself</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

Anyone order a point-and-click adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game for later this month featuring a cast of British actors that'll make you go "oh, right, them!" when you Google them? Well, someone must have, because Earth Must Die, the next game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lair-of-the-clockwork-god">Lair of the Clockwork God</a> developer Size Five Games, now has a release date. Come on, it's getting cold!
</p>
<p>
Or it's still cold, because it's not out yet? I'm losing myself in the metaphor here, point is, Size Five announced today alongside publisher No More Robots that Earth Must Die will be launching January 27th. That's less than two weeks away! I can count! In any case, not only did the game get a new release date and a star studded trailer, it also has a demo for you to have a crack at!

<p>
For those that need a more formal introduction first, Earth Must Die stars the very regularly named VValak Lizardtongue, Grand Shepherd of the Tyrythian Empire, who is very upset that "those idiotic, moronic Terranoids" took over his kingdom that he definitely didn't inherit from his father and for sure built up himself (sounds like we got a real nepo baby over here). As a result, he's decided he's going to kill pretty much everyone on earth. Lovely!
</p><p>
Right, those British actors - you'll find the likes of Joel Fry (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/game-thrones">Game of Thrones</a>, Our Flag Means Death), Little Alex Horne (Taskmaster), Martha Howe-Douglas (Horrible Histories), and for a name that'll be more widely familiar globally, Final Fantasy 16 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>'s Ben Starr.
</p>
<p>
If all of that sounds good to you, you can wishlist and check out the demo for Earth Must Die on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639780/Earth_Must_Die/">Steam</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[I Nearly Made It Through All Of 2025 Without Playing A Single Console Game]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/gran-turismo-7-review-impressions-ps5/</link>
            <guid>1406383</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Right before Christmas time,<a href="https://aftermath.site/game-of-the-year-2025-aftermath-luke-plunkett/"> <u>when I started putting my Game of the Year list together</u></a>, I had an odd realisation: not only was not a single game on the list something I played on console, but I didn't remember playing <em>any </em>console games through all of 2025.</p><p>I mean, I'd <em>dabbled</em>. You can't work in this job without picking up a controller at some point, and so if you were being a pedantic asshole you could say I "played" <em>Mario Kart World</em> and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> at a friend's place. But both were for a matter of minutes, literally to check them out; to say I'd <em>played </em>them would be like sitting through the first four minutes of <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em> then saying you'd seen the movie.</p><p>It was an odd thing to reckon with. Partly because it must surely have been the first year I hadn't properly played a console game since the 1980s, which would have been a hell of a run, but mostly because I quickly realised that instead of being some life-changing realisation, shaking the very foundations of my understanding of this medium and my place in it, it ended up as some harmless trivia. I just didn't really care. It was 2025, you can play <em>The Last of Us</em> on PC now, who gives a shit what machine you play a game on.</p><p>Not that it really mattered, because on December 25 I opened a present from my kids and it was a copy of <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> for the PlayStation 5.</p><p>The most perfect game to land in this situation, given the fact it's probably the most console-ass AAA title left on the planet that doesn't have the word Nintendo on the box. Sony has put a lot of PlayStation games on PC over the last few years, from <em>Horizon </em>to <em>God of War</em> to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, but not this. Never this. <em>Gran Turismo</em> IS PlayStation, it is born of the console; PC racing games are a different breed, and Polyphony must rightly reckon that this experience, a quintessential Japanese console game right down to the music and menus, just wouldn't work there. So if I wanted to play <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and I did, it was going to have to be on the PlayStation 5.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Those are Australian dollars, but whatever dollars you're using, it's a lot</span></figcaption></figure><p>Why now? This game came out in 2020! Well, I'm not ashamed to say that while I am an enemy of brands and the idea of loving brands, I have one glaring and fatal exception: the electric car manufacturer Polestar. I'm very into the company's focus on both design and sustainability. I own a Polestar 2 and it's incredible, but I want a Polestar 5 more than I have ever wanted a car in my life. Thing is, it's priced at roughly <em>AUD$250,000 </em>(see above), so it's a car I'll likely never get to even <em>drive</em>, let alone park in my garage. So the closest I'll probably ever get is driving one in a mostly-realistic driving video game, where it recently arrived as part of an update that doubled as a marketing exercise for Polestar (see below). A cheap and obvious marketing trick, but they got me.</p><p>I'm still not buying the car (<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/" rel="noreferrer">unless?!?!</a>), but PlayStation in particular got me, because I <em>love </em>this game. I've always been a fan of <em>Gran Turismo</em> for the simple reason that while it's got its fair share of car tweaks and spare part settings, the main purpose of the series is to serve as an interactive car brochure, a digital exploration of the fancier end of automotive culture. This isn't a driving game with radio DJs and a neon interface,<a href="https://aftermath.site/assetto-corsa-rally-impressions-review/"> <u>nor is it <em>Assetto Corsa</em></u></a>; this one goes out to everyone who obsesses over driving a car that costs more than an apartment, but who doesn't mind having to drive a Mazda 3 for a few laps first. Like me.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lBDF7TuSjQM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Polestar 5 meets Gran Turismo 7 | Polestar"></iframe></figure><p>To give you an idea of the game's tone, if you haven't already played it: Your main source of progression in <em>GT7 </em>is visiting a lovely little cafe in the woods and getting missions from its friendly owner, while a camera pans lovingly over whatever car you're driving at the time and a succession of automotive celebrities and designers share trivia with you about some random BMW from the 1970s. For anyone who is into the looks and history of cars, this is sicko stuff, it's perfect.</p><p>It's also great that despite all the advances in video game horsepower over the last three decades, this is still very much a <em>Gran Turismo</em> game, with the same pros and cons I could have listed after a few hours with <em>GT2</em>. It feels "real" but also weirdly sterile, and the sound effects are realistic but also empty, but the handling and races are all honed so perfectly that none of that really matters. The urge to win a few more bucks so you can buy an old Ferrari overpowers every other complaint I have about spending more time in menus than on the track, or the game still somehow not having a proper damage system. About the only things that <em>have </em>changed since 1997 are that the graphics have got better while the music has got worse.</p><figure></figure><p>Not that I bought too many Ferraris; I wanted this game for the Polestar 5, and after a little grind to unlock it I got my hands on it and never looked back. This thing <em>flies</em>, especially with upgrades, and while I'll never own one I can now at least say I've come as close as I ever will, from getting to hear its electric whirr through my soundbar to panning the in-game camera around its interior and leaving its cinematic driving videos to play on my TV like an aspirational screensaver.</p><p>For the sake of trivia, it would have been interesting to make it through all of 2025 without properly playing a console game. But for the sake of my own enjoyment, I'm very glad I broke that streak with just a few days to spare.</p>

Hurst is probably best known for his role as Opie Winston in the FX series <em>Sons of Anarchy</em>, and he most recently appeared in the Netflix series <em>The Abandons</em> last year. However, Hurst also provided the voice of Thor in 2022’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok/next-to-godliness">God of War Ragnarök</a>, a performance that earned him a BAFTA nomination. In those games, Kratos was portrayed by Christopher Judge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon Prime’s series is an adaptation of the Norse entries in the series, which includes Ragnarök and its 2018 predecessor, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/god-of-war/god-of-war-review-reaching-a-higher-summit">God of War</a>. The show centers on Kratos and his son, Atreus, and will follow the 2018 game’s story of the pair traveling on a quest to scatter the ashes of their wife and mother. The rest of the cast has not been revealed.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon has ordered two seasons of the show, which will be helmed by showrunner, writer, and executive producer Ronald D. Moore (<em>Outlander, Battlestar Galactica</em>). It will be co-produced by Sony Pictures Television, Amazon MGM Studios, PlayStation Productions, and Tall Boy Productions. God of War is currently set to begin filming in Vancouver in March.&nbsp;</p><p>God of War will be the latest video game adaptation to hit Amazon Prime, following series such as <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/07/29/heres-the-first-trailer-for-amazons-like-a-dragon-series"><em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em></a> and its biggest hit,<em> Fallout</em>.

            <title><![CDATA[PS Plus Extra Packs A Big Lineup This Month Just In Time For Resident Evil 9]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/jan-2026-ps-plus-resident-evil-village-2000659885</link>
            <guid>1406344</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony revealed the latest games coming to PS Plus Extra in January 2026 and the headliner will be arriving just in time for anyone who still needs to catch up on Capcom’s survival horror franchise ahead of <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>.<em> Resident Evil Village</em>, along with eight other games, will all be joining the PlayStation subscription library this month.</p> <p>Even if you’ve never played <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, you’ve probably encountered its fan-favorite vampire giantess <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-villages-lady-dimitrescu-was-worth-the-wa-1846848171">Lady Alcina Dimitrescu</a>. And while completing <em>Village</em> isn’t essential for anyone planning to play <em>Requiem</em> at launch on February 27, it’ll certainly be a nice option for passing the time until then. The other headliner this month is <a href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em></a>, the 2024 <em>Yakuza</em> game that’s a turn-based RPG and the first in the series to go outside of Japan.</p>

 <p>Here’s the full list of games for Extra and Premium tiers in January 2026:</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus Extra And Premium</h2> <ul> <li><em>Resident Evil Village</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Expeditions: A MudRunner Game</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>The Exit 8</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Art of Rally</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>A Little to the Left</em> | PS5, PS4</li> </ul> <h2><strong>PlayStation Classics (Premium Only)</strong></h2> <ul> <li> <p><em>Ridge Racer</em> | PS5, PS4</p> </li> </ul> <p>I’d like to draw quick attention to two of the smaller games above: <em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> and <em>Art of Rally</em>. Both are excellent. <em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> isn’t what some fans of the original game wanted, but it’s a neat crisis-management RPG mapped onto the roguelike structure of <em>Slay the Spire</em>. <em>Art of Rally</em> is a beautiful, minimalist, chill top down racing game. Give both a try if you haven’t already.</p>

 <p>Oh, and <em>A Little To The Left</em> is great as well, especially for couch buddies who might not normally play games. You organize stuff in unusual ways to unlock little easter eggs. It’s way cooler than it might sound.</p>
