            <p>
Endless Legend, the superb fantasy 4X game from developer Amplitude Studios, is currently free to download and keep on Steam - and there's still almost a week to claim it.
</p>
<p>
Amplitude - which has also developed the likes of Endless Space, Dungeons of the Endless, and Humankind - released Endless Legend back in 2014. It quickly drew praise for its fantasy flavoured Civ-style strategy - enlivened by some smart twists on the formula and its highly distinctive factions - mixed with a heavy dollop of lore.
</p>
<p>
If you're still a stranger to Endless Legend's action some ten years after its release, and the above description has set your strategy nubbin a-tingling, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289130/ENDLESS_Legend/">permanently add it to your Steam library</a> for the princely sum of zero money right now. And don't panic if you're currently indisposed: the offer runs until next Thursday, 23rd May.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Get Endless Legend for FREE!" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYc_j0Y3o-0?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
To coincide with Endless Legends' 100% price slash, its nine expansions are also heavily discounted, with the priciest currently costing £2.19 and the cheapest slinking in at a svelt 59p.
</p>
<p>
And if you'd like to check out more of Amplitude's work, it's probably also worth noting the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/AmplitudeStudios">studio's entire catalogue</a> is currently discounted on Steam, meaning substantial savings on everything from Endless Space and Humankind to the more recent Endless Dungeon.

            <p>If you’ve been wondering what Valve’s been working on as their next game after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/counter-strike-2-best-settings">Counter-Strike 2</a>, the answer may be at hand. Details and screenshots for Deadlock, a third-person hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> with MOBA elements, have seemingly leaked out of a recent closed playtest, revealing a blend of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> and Valve’s own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>.</p>

<p>Deadlock is apparently the latest evolution of a project previously known as Neon Prime, which you may faintly recall <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-register-mysterious-new-neon-prime-trademark-in-the-us">Valve registering a vague trademark for</a> a couple of years back. The game’s reappearance as Deadlock came via <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791110448114188557">noted Valve leaker Gabe Follower</a>, who described it as being a competitive hero shooter in the vein of Overwatch or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> - albeit in third-person - with the lane-based map design and even tower defence elements of MOBAs like Dota 2 or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>.</p>
<p>Those maps will host matches between two teams of six players, who will control unique hero characters able to pop off different abilities and items. The maps themselves are said to be “huge”, with the inclusion of floating rails - a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a> - to help players zip around.</p>
<p>The game’s world also seems to draw at least a little from the likes of BioShock, with a mixture of steampunk and fantasy in a European-inspired city home to strange creatures, robots and magicians alike. (Gabe Follower notes that the game was originally more sci-fi-themed closer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Portal</a> - which might explain the futuristic-sounding Neon Prime moniker - but shifted more to fantasy after “bad feedback” from testers.)</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Since testers started sharing Deadlock screenshots all over the place, here's ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon. <a href="https://t.co/KdZSRxObSz">pic.twitter.com/KdZSRxObSz</a></p>— Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Screenshots supposedly verified by the leaker reveal at least one character, a bow-wielding ranger called Grey Talon with the ability to use traps alongside long-range precision. The character design does indeed look very Overwatch-y or Dota-y to my eye, with the teases of the map showing graffitied city streets and alleys.</p>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8MqhEz6N_k">Tyler McVicker</a> added to the swirling rumours by claiming that the now-leaky closed playtest already has hundreds of people giving Deadlock a go, with a proper announcement and reveal of Valve’s next “major” game due sometime soon - perhaps sooner than even the developers expected, given the information already finding its way out into the public eye.</p>

  <p id="PbJcr0">There are many things that make <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a><em> </em>one of the most <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/5/20929735/best-movies-of-the-decade-2010s">enduring crowd-pleasers of the century</a>. Death-defying stunts, a fantastic and deep cast, extremely quotable dialogue, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/1/8700423/watch-how-mad-max-used-center-framing-to-keep-the-action-scenes">breathtaking imagery</a>. But one of the most important elements in the movie, and the Mad Max franchise in general, is the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/9/21/9364407/mad-max-game-disabiliy-fury-road">evocative character design</a>.</p>
<p id="cGlfBc">The War Boys and The Doof Warrior get their fair share of attention, and rightly so — their designs are vivid and very memorable, and before a recent rewatch they were the characters I remembered the best. But there’s one group I feel gets overlooked, that I gained a new appreciation for on that recent rewatch: The Rock Riders.</p>

<p id="wvBHh1">The Rock Riders are a group of motorcycle-riding bandits who live in a canyon smack dab in the middle of the path of Furiosa’s breakaway convoy in <em>Fury Road</em>. Furiosa made a deal with them to trade Guzzolene for safe passage, but the Rock Riders reneged on that deal when they saw just how upset Immortan Joe was at Furiosa’s betrayal. </p>

<p id="OdkgjH">That leads to a very cool sequence where Furiosa and her crew fight off the Rock Riders, as their motorcycles jump over The War Rig and repeatedly drop bombs on it. It’s like a circus act shows up in the middle of <em>Fury Road</em>, injecting some extra life and excitement in a movie already full of it.</p>
<div id="loGjug"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-K20x3mFhZs?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="D3x4Cs">The circus act isn’t far off — the origin for the Rock Riders <a href="https://www.cbr.com/exclusive-brendan-mccarthy-goes-full-throttle-for-mad-max-fury-road/">came from a beach trip by co-writer Brendan McCarthy</a>. While at a surfer pub, a video caught his eye of bikers doing eye-popping stunts. He pitched the idea of bikers leaping over Furiosa’s truck to George Miller (who, naturally, loved it), and they <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/mad-max-fury-road-the-story-behind-its-most-insane-stunts-41441/">hired professional motocross riders from around the world</a> to perform the sequence. </p>
<p id="na359n"><em>Fury Road </em>is made up of many great action sequences, yes, but they work in large part because of the character designs behind them, and the hard work to pull them off. The Rock Riders might not get quite as much attention as some of their bandit brethren, but they deserve recognition for this excellent sequence.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/24159010/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-deluxe-set-buy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="firstHeading">You might not know this if you grew up in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo">later eras of Nintendo</a>, but the company ran an esports competition called the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/15/8780155/nintendo-world-championships-e3-2015-kickoff">Nintendo World Championships</a> way back in 1990. The event toured 29 American cities and players from across the country gathered to compete using a custom Nintendo Entertainment System Game Pak. The cartridge used in the event went on to become a prized collectors’ item, but now, players will get a chance to buy a physical item directly inspired by it. </p>
<p id="7g4kUI">On Wednesday, Nintendo shared a trailer for the upcoming game, <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>. The game recreates the competitive spirit of the event and will allow players to speedrun more than 150 “<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-switch/">challenging moments</a>” from across 13 NES games like <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and <em>Metroid</em>. In addition to the virtual eShop download, the company announced <em>Nintendo World Championships </em>would be getting a physical edition as well. And while it’s not replacement for those rare early NES cartridges from the actual competition — the physical version of the game has plenty to ooh and aah over. </p>
<p id="oxqPej">You can buy the <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition – Deluxe Set</em> off of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-deluxe-set-121051/">Nintendo’s website</a>. It will go on sale July 18 and cost $59.99. (The virtual game-only version costs $29.99.) The Deluxe Set comes with a Gold replica NES cartridge and stand to commemorate the 1990 World Championships, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/games/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> game card, 13 art cards, and a set of five pins.

That’s in many ways by design, as the foundations of the game are so entrenched in the stylistic and mechanical elements of other titles. The game’s deep roleplaying mechanics allow for combat, magic, stealth, and more due to a reliance on skills that are pulled from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646"><em>Elder Scrolls</em></a></span>. The slightly unsettling fantasy setting is reminiscent of <em>Morrowind</em> specifically. The polygonal graphics are inspired by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-one-ps1-hanami-handheld-ff7-yveltalgriffin-1851410777&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-one-ps1-hanami-handheld-ff7-yveltalgriffin-1851410777">PlayStation 1</a></span> in the same way as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202">retro-horror trend</a></span> is. But its character models feel lifted from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-game-ever-thief-the-dark-project-is-the-only-way-5897240&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-game-ever-thief-the-dark-project-is-the-only-way-5897240"><em>Thief: The Dark Project</em></a></span>. <em>Dread Delusion</em> expertly weaves these inspirations together into a wholly unique cloth. It’s a game talked about in comparison, that manages to be more than its inspirations.</p><p>The star of <em>Dread Delusion</em> is its setting, the Oneiric Isles. A floating archipelago under a menacing red sky filled with warring armies and cosmic mysteries. As a prisoner of one such army, the player is essentially deputized into the fight and tasked with the mission of taking down a rebellious woman named Vela Callose. Infiltrating her fortress and assassinating her is your first goal, which you won’t be able to complete and will send you down a dozens-of-hours quest to finish the job. Once you have your (conditional) freedom from your jailers, <em>Dread Delusion</em> sets you loose in its weird world. </p><p><em>Dread Delusion</em> wants you to get lost. But don’t get so lost that you fall off the side of the map, these are floating islands remember? When the game warns you to watch your step at the start of your journey you, like me, might laugh and think that will never happen. Then you laugh right off the side of the island. It’s undeniably hilarious but also highlights that the world is in fact dangerous if you aren’t careful. Like <em>Morrowind</em>’s Vvardenfell or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span>’s Lands Between, the joy of the Oneiric Isles is encountering its unique charms naturally along your journey. A pub inside of a dead god’s head, a castle haunted by illusions, a traveling college of wizards, all of these and more await the curious player. What makes all these discoveries so much more compelling is that they all have stories to tell—they aren’t just set dressing. Everything here has depth.</p><figure id="" data-id="1351a30b700f4b4fcb6f18074fde91a2" data-recommend-id="image://1351a30b700f4b4fcb6f18074fde91a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A withered man stands in front of a gothic city under a red sky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A withered man stands in front of a gothic city under a red sky" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dread XP</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1351a30b700f4b4fcb6f18074fde91a2" data-recommend-id="image://1351a30b700f4b4fcb6f18074fde91a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A withered man stands in front of a gothic city under a red sky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That narrative depth and sense of discovery tendrils out from the game’s mechanical intricacy that offers so much player freedom. Like in <em>Elder Scrolls</em>, players are able to tailor their protagonist to different styles of play. You can focus on combat, magic, stealth, or even charm, and unlock different ways to complete problems. Instead of fighting your way through, maybe you could just befriend the guards and walk right into your desired area. It all depends on what skills you are able to unlock with Glimmers of Delusion, the resource that gives the game its name.<br></p><p>Combat does remain perhaps the most silly element of the game, a feeling I had during early access. <em>Here</em> the game lacks depth, and in most encounters, I find myself circling enemies and slashing until they die, a surprisingly effective tactic. It makes it simple but not very fun. Sneaking, lockpicking, and charming your way through encounters is always more compelling.</p><p>Tying leveling into a sense of cosmic horror is a great tonal decision that supports the game’s low-poly horror aesthetic. Visually and mechanically the game is unsettling in the most enthralling way, perhaps taking further inspiration from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928"><em>Pathologic</em></a></span>. But <em>Dread Delusion </em>shifts between so many different tones. It has cosmic horror and fantasy, but also comedy. The humor of the game feels especially well used in relation to its mechanics. Like in <em>Elder Scrolls</em> games, in which mechanical freedom often leads to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-met-a-very-immature-serial-killer-in-the-elder-scroll-1846839859&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-met-a-very-immature-serial-killer-in-the-elder-scroll-1846839859">hilarious unintended consequences</a></span>, <em>Dread Delusion</em>’s freedom will make absurd scenarios occur regularly. It’s nice that the game’s inhabitants have a sense of humor about it too.</p><p>In an already overflowing few weeks of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730">compelling</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">indie</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967">games</a></span> punching well above their weight, <em>Dread Delusion</em> is another fantastic game to put on your radar. Come for the deep skill system and the fascinating world, but stay for the unexpected adventures you’ll surely fall into. Just don’t fall off the sides.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Redfall is set to get one final update before work ends on it entirely. </p>



<p>In a message <a href="https://x.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Twitter</a> on Friday, the game’s official account thanked fans for the support since it was announced that developer Arkane Austin was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-shutting-down-four-studios-including-tango-game-works-and-arkane-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of four studios being closed</a> by Microsoft.</p>



<p>The message went on to reveal some of the features included in the final update, including the promised offline mode that will allow players to play even after Microsoft shuts down the game’s servers in the future.</p>



<p>“We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more,” the Twitter post reads. “We’ll provide additional details soon. Thank you all.”</p>



<p>When it was first announced that Arkane Austin was closing, the studio said there would be no more updates for the game. It seems clear that, based on the pushback from players, releasing one last update was the best thing to do for players to ensure that they can keep playing the game now and in the future.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>. Fortnite frequently changes. The next big change for Fortnite, Chapter 5 Season 3, is expected to kick off next week, and today Epic has let a major detail out into the open: A Fallout collaboration is on the way. Depicted in our first bit of art for the next season is the iconic Power Armor helmet from the Fallout franchise, as well as a pair of emojis in the tweet that act as a stand-in for the blonde-haired Vault Boy who is so intertwined with the Fallout universe.</p><p>The Fallout collab comes just a few weeks after the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-is-happening-amazon-confirms/1100-6522787/" data-ref-id="1100-6522787">Amazon Prime Video series became a huge hit</a>, and is just the latest in a years-long run of Epic's gargantuan video game platform staying in lockstep with pop-culture moments happening elsewhere.</p><p>It's not yet clear exactly what the crossover will entail, but an in-game skin seems like the bare minimum. Perhaps the new map and/or weapons will also be inspired by Bethesda's post-apocalyptic franchise.</p><p>The image also interestingly features what looks to be a massive dust storm and some sort of industrial tanks, lending credibility to the rumor that Chapter 5 Season 3 will feature some Mad Max-like dieselpunk inspirations, including an emphasis on vehicle combat--and likely a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga-review-a-whole-new-gear/1900-6418226/" data-ref-id="1900-6418226">Furiosa</a> crossover too.</p><p>For everything else we know about the next major Fortnite update, read our story on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-start-date/2900-5356/" data-ref-id="2900-5356">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 start date</a> and more.</p>

                <p>A Star Wars-themed Total War game is reportedly currently in development over at Creative Assembly.</p><p>According to to <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-works-at-creative-assembly/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DualShockers</a>, there are three Total War games being worked on right now. It's unclear which project Creative Assembly is furthest along with in development. However, the closest one is presumably the next mainline installment, as Total War is an annual series. The only exception is 2021, which was the first year without a new mainline Total War game since 2014.</p><p>The second one is a Total War: Star Wars game that seemingly started development in October 2023. Currently, any info about the alleged third Total War game is unknown. The most recent game in the series is Total War: Pharoah, which was released last year. Creative Assembly Sofia is <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-pharaoh/blogs/19-total-war-pharaoh-update-announce" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently preparing a large update</a> for the game that will add more campaign content and cultures.</p><p>Back in September, parent company Sega canceled Creative Assembly's latest game, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/segas-shooter-hyenas-canceled-other-games-canned-as-well-as-part-of-restructuring/1100-6518042/" data-ref-id="1100-6518042">multiplayer shooter called Hyenas</a>, and it laid off the developers who were working on it. In November, Sega president Haruki Satomi said that Creative Assembly would go back to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/total-war-dev-creative-assembly-is-returning-to-real-time-strategy-games/1100-6519563/" data-ref-id="1100-6519563">creating RTS games such as Total War as that was the studio's primary expertise</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/17/fallout-is-coming-to-fortnite<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's a great time to be a Fallout fan, thanks to its <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="77931a3c-3f80-4855-9ad5-3f76e5fbcb32" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/2024/04/10/the-fallout-tv-show-is-good-season-1-review">excellent Amazon Prime series</a> and the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="90f9957b-0269-4766-8f9c-ad4a933dbbf4" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/25/fallout-4-gets-a-next-gen-update-today-heres-what-to-expect">next-gen update for Fallout 4</a>. But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon</p>



<p>The teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f5b5da80-dc07-4895-9626-9cdca5c3d817" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/09/avatar-the-last-airbender-skins-now-available-in-fortnite">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef3902aa-9994-4d48-bfe5-4dd44b9364c8" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/15/fortnites-next-star-wars-crossover-will-span-lego-festival-and-battle-royale-modes">Star Wars crossovers</a>, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.</p>

<p>It will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.</p>

            <p>
A final update is on its way to Redfall after all.
</p>
<p>
Following the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft was closing a number of Bethesda studios</a> including Redfall developer Arkane Austin, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-studio-was-reportedly-working-on-offline-mode-for-may-release-before-closure">the team was working on DLC and updates</a> - including an offline mode - until very recently.

</p>
<p>
A new post on X, however, states the update is still on the way. "Thank you all for your supportive messages," it reads. "We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighbourhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more. We'll provide additional details soon. Thank you all."

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Thank you for all your supportive messages. </p><p>We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more. </p><p>We’ll provide additional details soon.

What's not specifically mentioned here, though, is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-hero-pass-dlc-still-missing-a-year-after-its-release">Hero Pass DLC</a>, which will add two new player characters to the vampire shooter but remains missing a year after the game's release.
</p>
<p>
This was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-hero-pass-cancelled-following-arkane-austin-closure">cancelled after the studio closure</a>, with players directed to a <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/?linkId=100000260400360#en/answer/65606">Bethesda support page</a> with details forthcoming of a credit programme to reimburse anyone who already purchased the DLC.

</p>
<p>
At present, that support page still stands. It suggests that while the offline mode and other requested features are still on the way, the Hero Pass is not.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Bethesda to confirm.
</p>
<p>
Even before this final update, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-last-stroll-through-redfall-at-the-pace-it-was-always-meant-to-be-played">Redfall remains worth checking out through one last stroll of its world</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-redfall-update-will-grant-arkanes-shooter-offline-immortality.874197/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-redfall-update-offline-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arkane Austin's ill-fated vampiric shooter&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>is just about still alive, it seems, as the devs have announced the game is to receive one final update before being laid to rest for good.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>'s official X (formerly Twitter) account, Arkane Austin says that one last update, titled Game Update 4, is in the works for&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>, so it looks like the studio will get to finish <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redfall-offline-mode-update-report">what it was working on before that shutdown</a> after all.</p>

<p>The first major feature the update will bring is the long-called-for Offline Mode, which will allow you to play&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>without being connected to a server. With online games being shut down left, right, and center, this is a pretty important move for preservation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-vampire-stairs.jpg?itok=M8bwdiZP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-vampire-stairs.jpg?itok=DNYIrNCA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>is getting one last update after all.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to being able to play offline, the last&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>update will also bring "revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems", and Arkane doesn't seem to have intended that pun.</p>

<p>The update will also bring the ability to pause the game if you're in single-player mode, so no more getting ganked by nasty vampires while you're making a cup of coffee in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Arkane says additional details for the update will be revealed "soon", and there's no release date for the update yet, so it might be a little while before it arrives.</p>

<p>Still, it's nice to know that although&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>was much maligned by critics and players alike, there will still be a way to revisit it in future, even if it is just to figure out what went wrong.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-sniper.jpg?itok=SiDR7yWO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-sniper.jpg?itok=86e2IwBT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to play&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>offline? You'll soon be able to do just that.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>, it's a shooter developed by&nbsp;<em>Prey&nbsp;</em>studio Arkane Austin.</p>

<p><em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>has a multiplayer focus (although it can technically be played single-player), with each character taking the role of one of the game's survivors, each of whom has special abilities that complement the rest of the group.</p>

<p>On release,&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/14768/redfall" rel="noopener" target="_blank">met with ambivalence</a> by critics and players, with many pointing to its lack of Arkane's signature immersive sim-style gameplay features, as well as the shallowness of its gameplay loops and story.</p>

<p>Last week, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">made the call to shut down Arkane Austin</a>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks and two other studios.&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>will, however, seemingly survive the death of its studio. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Around a week after Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">shuttered a number of beloved studios</a> with a track record of making excellent single-player, story-driven games, their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">newly-owned arm of Activision</a> has revealed a brand new studio. Working on a new series of story-driven, triple-A games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The unveiling of Elsewhere Entertainment comes days after the sudden and shocking closure of Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks and Mighty Dog Studios, who between them have been responsible for games including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey">Prey</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-evil-within-2">The Evil Within</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostwire-tokyo">Tokyo: Ghostwire</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and more.</p>
<p>With the exception of multiplayer misfire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a>, the likes of Arkane and Tango were arguably known for specialising in inventive and well-liked-to-loved single-player titles built around their narratives, making the emergence of a new studio doing exactly that somewhat frustrating timing.</p>

</div>
<p>It’s worth noting, of course, that Activision and Microsoft operate separately in many respects - including budgets - despite now being merged into one multi-billion-dollar megacorp, so the new Activision studio’s launch isn’t directly tied to Microsoft’s decision to close several other developers. (Elsewhere will apparently draw from Activision’s resources and use their tools for their projects.)</p>
<p>On top of that, the Polish team made up of devs with experience on Naughty Dog’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection">Uncharted</a>, CD Projekt Red’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division">The Division</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> was <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/activision-and-microsoft-are-opening-a-new-game-studio-in-poland-elsewhere-entertainment-with-a-totally-new-ip">apparently put together a little while back</a>, rather than being freshly formed now.</p>
<p>Given those particular credits, it might not come as a surprise to learn that Elsewhere will be working on an original “narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise", which lines up with those blockbuster single-player titles.</p>
<p>“The team’s underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games,” Activision added in their <a href="https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-announces-new-studio-elsewhere-entertainment-all-new-franchise-development">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>By “enduring legacy” and “resonates beyond games”, I can only assume they mean “makes a whole boatload of money and gets turned into a prestige TV show like The Last of Us and The Witcher”. Whatever it ends up being, expect it to be at least a while off while Elsewhere continues to staff up on their debut project.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/24158250/upgrade-netflix-movie-cyberpunk-scifi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="oyOft2">Compelling sci-fi dystopias are few and far between in movies these days, which is why it might be surprising that one of the best is hiding inside an underappreciated action movie from 2018. <em>Upgrade</em>, which arrived on Netflix this week, is full of bone-crunching, genuinely funny action, but it’s also secretly a fantastic thriller with an excellent sci-fi world hiding beneath the surface. </p>
<p id="m2tJ6n">The movie follows Grey (Logan Marshall-Green), a mechanic living in a not-too-distant future. Early in the film, Grey’s wife gets murdered in a seemingly random mugging that leaves him paralyzed, but he finds an opportunity for revenge thanks to an experimental cybernetic implant, called STEM, that allows him to walk again. But that implant seems to have a mind of its own, and talks to him almost constantly.</p>
<p id="XbbP80">This dynamic between STEM and Grey (voiced by Simon Maiden) gives <em>Upgrade </em>a surprisingly welcome dose of comedy that most action movies or thrillers don’t make time for. Because STEM can’t read Grey’s mind, Grey has to say everything he wants to tell STEM out loud, leading to hilarious fight scenes that leaves bad guys (who are also getting their asses kicked) completely baffled. It’s all the fun of Tom Hardy’s <em>Venom</em>, without the constraints of comic book characters holding anything back, and with the added comedy of a cold emotionless machine processing helping make the violent decisions quicker.</p>
<p id="O67W14">The fights themselves are also an excellent blend of silly and brutal that keeps them fun. Because Grey doesn’t really have a natural talent for fighting, he has to let STEM take over his body for brawls. As such, every fight is as robotic as you’d expect from a microchip learning to pilot a person. Arm and leg movements are staccato and instant, with barely any bending or smoothness to them at all. Punches are blocked without thought and delivered even more swiftly, and gunshots land with the perfect precision of an algorithm that’s worked it all out ahead of time.</p>

<p id="kH7o2l">What really sells all this is Logan Marshall-Green’s reaction to it. He plays the character like if Tom Hardy was in an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23737241/every-i-think-you-should-leave-sketch-ranked-best-to-worst-itysl"><em>I Think You Should Leave</em> sketch</a>, with a mix of terrified faces, unintelligible yells, and confused expressions, all while he’s putting random assassins in the dirt or throwing them through walls. For its part, the camera follows this strange style of movement too, frequently bending with Grey when he dodges a punch at an unnatural angle, giving us bizarre views and tipping us into the same kind of passenger-in-his-own-body feeling that Grey has when STEM takes over.</p>
<p id="7HuwUT">But in between all this action, director and writer Leigh Whannell (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/28/21154461/invisible-man-review-movie-elisabeth-moss-blumhouse-saw-leigh-whannell"><em>The Invisible Man</em></a>, <em>Insidious</em>), fills <em>Upgrade</em>’s world to the brim with fascinating details. Voice assistants and self-driving cars are just starting to eclipse the old mechanical ones on the road — putting Grey’s custom car repair business in jeopardy — while humans are getting augmentations to improve their everyday lives. The big city is swarming with police drones that monitor every street and alley for crime, but somehow never actually do anything to prevent it. While most of society is aware that human modification is common, the cops seem baffled to see it, making them feel decades behind the crimes they’re trying to solve. </p>
<p id="bW2vj5">It’s the kind of setting that feels quietly on the precipice of a full-on cyberpunk dystopia. The movie’s main characters all live in beautiful high-tech homes that look like they cost a fortune, while the side characters reside in abandoned apartment buildings, tiny run-down houses at the edge of town, or tent cities. Meanwhile, in the background of one scene we see a few people hooked into VR-headsets they rarely ever disconnect from, because for some, living in the virtual world is easier than living in the real one. The movie presents its nameless city setting as one slowly sliding into a massive class disparity that leaves only the ultra-wealthy and the incredibly poor, and it’s happening incrementally enough that no one in the movie even thinks to comment on it. </p>
<p id="hWoJI1">It’s rare that any movie manages to craft a cyberpunk world so subtly, but it’s even rarer when it’s all tucked neatly inside a black comedy about violent revenge, but that’s exactly what <em>Upgrade </em>pulls off. And while it wasn’t a particularly big hit in theaters back in 2018, hopefully the movie can get the appreciation it deserves now that it’s on Netflix. </p>

While we don’t have a lot of details at the moment, it seems that players will be able to visit at least one <em>Fallout</em>-inspired location on the battle royale’s map.

It’s possible that this will be a tiny thing, just a few skins and nothing more.

Here's what we think will pop up.</h2></div><div><section><p>There are a few different points in the year that feature some great sale events, offering excellent discounts on a variety of gaming-related items. Memorial Day weekend is one of those times and usually has quite a few deals for Xbox fans to enjoy. Whether you’re looking for deals on games or controllers or storage, there’s plenty to check out at numerous different retailers.</p><p>While we don’t know what exactly will be hitting those virtual sale shelves this year, we can take a good look at previous years to see what could be making a comeback. Below, you can also find information on when Memorial Day lands this year, how long sales will last, and when the next big sale event will be that you can mark your calendar for.</p><p><strong>Best Xbox Deals Today</strong></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/wKDXA?_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3-Month<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$36.99</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/NMXbE?_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Core Wireless Controller – Robot White<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$35.99</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/dPVeM?_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Series X Mini Fridge<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$39.94</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5OYlN" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Series X Diablo 4 Bundle<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$469.99</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/MY3X4" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Wireless Headset (Official)<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$89.99</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3v3em" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$30.00</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Y0r6o" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Seagate Storage Expansion Card For Xbox Series XS 1TB<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$139.99</span></li></ul></div><h2>When is Memorial Day?</h2><p>While Memorial Day lands on <strong>Monday, May 27</strong>, some of the sales start up a bit earlier. Sometimes even a week before, but that depends entirely on the retailer. Places like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart will put up a notice on their respective websites stating when their sale event begins and how long it will last for, so it's worth checking out your preferred site to see when the best time to buy is.</p><p>It's also worth noting that some of these retailers offer early access to sale events through their respective memberships. Though that hasn't been confirmed yet at one of their locations for this one, it's still worth keeping in mind. Places like Walmart, for example, offer this through their Walmart+ membership and you can even score a free 30-day trial to test it out! They're also offering some excellent bonus offers right now that you can take advantage of, like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-plus-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-deal"><u>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for two months for free</u></a>, a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-plus-youtube-premium-free-trial"><u>three-month trial of YouTube Premium for free</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-plus-apple-music-deal"><u>five months of Apple Music for free</u></a>, and more.</p><h2>What Xbox Deals to Expect This Year</h2><p>Based on previous years, there are quite a few different Xbox deals that could pop up again this year. Xbox video game deals will absolutely come back around, but last year saw various <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/here-are-saturdays-best-memorial-day-deals">expansion cards go on sale</a> and there's a very good chance that Xbox controllers will be discounted as well. We'll make sure to update this piece with the best Xbox deals as they appear, but if you simply can't wait for Memorial Day weekend and want to see what the best deals are right now, make sure to have a look at our roundup of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals">best Xbox deals</a>.</p><h2>How Long Do Memorial Day Sales Last?</h2><p>While some sales will just run through the three-day weekend, others can extend a few days after, which is nice if you're feeling on a tight schedule of picking up your favorite deals. Again, this entirely depends on the retailer, so it's worth checking out your preferred shop to see what their sale event plans are.</p><h2>When Will the Next Sale Event Happen After Memorial Day?</h2><p>Summer is a great time to shop around as there are a wide variety of sale events that go on over those months. You won't even have to wait too long for the next one, as June usually sees some big Summer gaming sales very early on. With <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Live</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-date-and-livestream-details-officially-announced">Summer Game Fest</a> kicking the festivities off this year in June, there will likely be a sale that happens around that time on each platform's store. IGN Live will run from <strong>June 7-9 in LA </strong>and SGF's big livestream event will kick off on <strong>June 7 at 2pm PT/5pm ET/10pm GMT</strong>, so make sure to keep your eyes peeled around this time to see what the Xbox Store has up its sleeve.</p><p>Not long after these events will be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-2024">Amazon Prime Day</a>, which is an excellent time for Prime members to scope out deals they may have missed over Memorial Day weekend. While we don't know the exact dates for it this year, if it follows the pattern of previous years, it'll likely land around the second week of July. </p><p>If you want to see even more deals outside of Xbox, check out our roundups of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-ps5-deals">best PlayStation deals</a>, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals"><u>best Nintendo Switch deals</u></a>, and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-video-game-steam-deals">best PC video game deals</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-game-reportedly-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter-called-deadlock<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Images and details for what is reportedly Valve’s next game have leaked online.</p><p>Valve reporter Tyler McVicker published a video to <a href="https://youtu.be/k8MqhEz6N_k?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> in which he claimed Deadlock is currently in closed alpha, with an announcement said to be imminent. Competitive gaming YouTubers are reportedly already playing under a non-disclosure agreement.</p><p>However, that hasn’t stopped what looks like a slew of screenshots showing off Deadlock. X/Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791115270905290793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@gabefollower</a> was first with the details, describing Deadlock as a third-person hero-based shooter, with 6v6 battles on big maps with four lanes. There are abilities and items alongside tower defense mechanics. The setting is described as fantasy with steampunk.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since testers started sharing Deadlock screenshots all over the place, here's ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon. <a href="https://t.co/KdZSRxObSz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KdZSRxObSz</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>These elements will be familiar to players of Valve’s multiplayer online battle area (MOBA) game Dota 2 as well as its own hero shooter, Team Fortress 2. Blizzard’s Overwatch, Riot's Valorant, and Hi-Rez’s Smite also look like they're in the mix.</p><p>Valve boss Gabe Newell is yet to announce Deadlock. IGN has asked Valve for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every IGN Valve Game Review</h3></div></output><p>Valve’s last developed game to release was competitive first-person shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/counter-strike-2">Counter-Strike 2</a>, which effectively replaced Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Before that, in 2020, Valve released <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> exclusively for virtual reality headsets. Valve has also released a Dota-themed digital card game called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/artifact">Artifact</a> and a Dota auto chess game called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dota-underlords">Dota Underlords</a>, although both have failed to find as big of an audience as the company’s previous titles.</p><p>All the while, the wait for Half-Life 3 continues. Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-left-4-dead-3-details-cancelled-valve">a making-of for Half-Life: Alyx revealed a swathe of games developed and shelved by Valve</a> between the release of Half-Life 2: Episode 2 and Valve's latest VR game. That list included details on a version of Half-Life 3 that was in development for around a year, and an open-world Left 4 Dead 3.</p><p><em>Photo by Olly Curtis/Future Publishing via Getty Images</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Arkane Austin's co-op vampire shooter, Redfall, will receive its fourth and final major update soon.</p><p>The official <a href="https://x.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Redfall Twitter account</a> posted that Redfall's Game Update 4 is bringing several quality-of-life features to the game. This include revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems, an offline mode, the ability to pause during single-player sessions, and more. The development team didn't say when the update will go live, but will provide more details at a later date.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">Microsoft shut down several of its studios</a>, including Arkane Austin. Xbox executive Matt Booty stated that Redfall's most-recent update was going to be its last one as development comes to a close. However, that doesn't seem to the case anymore. Booty also confirmed that Redfall's servers will remain online.</p><p>It seems like Game Update 4 only contains quality-of-life changes, as there's no mention of any additional story content. Those who purchased the premium editions of the game were entitled to two extra playable heroes. After Arkane Austin's closure, however, they were instead promised credits for the undelivered content.</p><p>Redfall is available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, as well as Xbox Game Pass.

<p data-characters="288" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Any <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> player will know by now, considering the <a href="https://x.com/search?q=ffxiv%20mountain%20dew&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deluge of memes</a> across the internet, that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-adds-the-mountain-zu-a-mountain-dew-themed-bird-mount/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>FFXIV </em>and Mountain Dew Gaming</a> are working together on a promotion that provides prizes both in and out of the virtual world. But for those excluded from events, it’s not much fun.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">The bummer here is that the Mountain Dew Gaming partnership isn’t for all players on the North American Data Centers — the <a href="https://www.mtndewgaming.com/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terms and conditions</a> state it’s for residents of the United States only — so that excludes a lot of players typically in that region. And for physical prizes, there’s no shipping outside of the continental US. </p> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">Of course, more region locked codes have frustrated players excluded again, particularly those in North American Data Centers but not US residents. The responses to<em> Final Fantasy XIV’s</em> official Twitter account demonstrate as much. <br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're excited to partner with <a href="https://twitter.com/MTNDEWGaming?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MTNDEWGaming</a> to offer fun rewards!</p><p>Please note that the Mountain Zu/Sparkling Citrus Refreshment item codes cannot be redeemed on Mog Station until Dawntrail early access. Attempting to redeem before then will display an "invalid code" error. <a href="https://t.co/GYGvNT6cWA">https://t.co/GYGvNT6cWA</a></p></div>— FINAL FANTASY XIV (@FF_XIV_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1791177357979697259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">The complaints are pretty evenly spread between <a href="https://x.com/ChaosValentine/status/1791183714346528957" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian players</a> upset and confused they aren’t included, and those in the <a href="https://x.com/umbrastaff/status/1791182937456771406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK and EU</a> lamenting that we don’t even seem to get thrown the scraps of these promotions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">There’s one <a href="https://x.com/TailzSnowMew/status/1791181116033921485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common theme</a> among the comments – why are these promotions region locked? This isn’t the first time that North America (or a select part of it) has benefited from a promotion while the rest of us could only look on longingly. Off the top of my head, I can name two that happened in 2021:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false"> <li><a href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1390023980195532801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Butterfinger promo</a>, which gave players the Chocorpokkur mount</li> <li>The controversial <a href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1726571133254963235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grubhub promotion</a>, which gave players the ‘Eat Pizza’ emote</li> </ul> <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">Admittedly, the Eat Pizza emote is now available to purchase on the<em> FFXIV</em> Online Store, but the Chocorpokkur mount is still only owned by those in the USA.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">Of course, there are other promotions, such as the Japan-exclusive KFC promotion, which provides players with the ‘Eat Chicken’ emote. But I’d like to mention here that the only promotion that happened in the EU was <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9303c603b00fb18f64bd7d0beaeba8eead0ebecd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this one</a> back in 2016, which didn’t make it to the UK. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">During the May 16 Live Letter stream, Yoshida noted EU Data Center players should shout out ideas and partnerships they’d like to see. It’s a nice gesture and all, but it’s been a while, and even if you play on one of the Data Centers typically of a certain region, there’s no guarantee you’re included. </p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Maybe I’m just salty. After all, I am a British player on North American servers, so I will soon have the Mountain Dew exclusive rewards in front of my face with no way of earning them, while my American friends discuss how much Mountain Dew they need to buy to get cool items.&nbsp;</p>

Well, if not, it might be time to do so, as not only is the community <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly fully on board</a> with Bungie’s next flagship, but there’s a lot of exciting stuff being shown off, like the improved weapon enhancement system.</p> <p data-characters="705" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">Indeed, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-05-16-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s latest <em>This Week in Destiny</em> blog post</a> has gone in-depth on <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s new and improved weapon enhancement feature, and everything suggests it’s going to be a hoot. The gist of it is that all the currently active weapons (i.e. the stuff that’s been issued out after <em>Beyond Light</em>) will have access to an up-to-date version of the masterworking and levelling systems, available via the three-stage enhancement upgrades that unlock as a given weapon is levelled-up. Some of the biggest boons of the new system include the ability to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-how-to-unlock-the-lost-memento/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apply a Memento to a non-craftable weapon</a>, for example, though the same functionality will not be available on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-can-you-get-your-old-sunset-guns-back-after-the-final-shape-comes-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously sunset gear</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-destiny-2-the-final-shape-adds-three-stages-of-weapon-enhancement" data-injectable="false">Destiny 2: The Final Shape adds three stages of weapon enhancement</h2> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true">Broadly, <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s new weapon enhancement system allows you to upgrade <em>most</em> of the game’s available weapons to gain access to enhanced traits, weapon levels, and a Memento socket. A rougher, work-in-progress version of this new system has been available for some time now via the Raid Adept weapons, but the same features (and then some) will be accessible to a wider array of gear with the new DLC.</p>
 <p data-characters="61" data-current-count="61" data-injectable="false">Here’s how the new weapon enhancement system will work:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Enhancement Tier 1:</strong> replaces a weapon’s Masterwork, unlocks an enhanced intrinsic, leveling, and a Memento socket; Raid Adept weapons can have their perks adjusted via the Martian Relic</li> <li><strong>Enhancement Tier 2 (at weapon level 11):</strong> upgrades the weapon’s left column trait to its enhanced version</li> <li><strong>Enhancement Tier 3 (at weapon level 17):</strong> upgrades the weapon’s right column trait to its enhanced version</li> </ul> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">Further, Bungie has promised that all of the currently available weapons from the following activities will be eligible to acquire enhanced traits in some way, shape, or form:</p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true"> <li>Vow of the Disciple (Adepts)</li> <li>King’s Fall (Adepts)</li> <li>Guardian Games</li> <li>Gambit PvPvE</li> <li>Crucible PvP (including Competitive, Iron Banner, and Trials of Osiris activities)</li> <li>Vanguard PvE (Operations, Nightfalls)</li> <li>Prophecy Dungeon</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">“Unfortunately,” says Bungie’s blog, “due to some technical constraints, there are a handful of weapons instances from before Season 17 that have origin traits and are active drops, but they will not be eligible for weapon enhancement. If a weapon is not actively dropping in these activities and playlists or it’s under the legacy focusing options, it will not be enhance-able when The Final Shape releases.”</p>
 <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">It shouldn’t be overly surprising that some of the active weapons will be precluded from the system, given how many different iterations of the weapon enhancement system <em>Destiny 2</em> has gone through over the years. We don’t yet have a concrete list of the weapons that won’t be eligible for enhancement just yet, but the good news is that Bungie will update them to support the new system “if [they] are reissued and become a part of a playlist’s active drops once again.”</p>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">It’s good news all around, then, and it seems that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-content-update-and-four-streams-completely-turned-the-destiny-2-community-around/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie has successfully turned <em>Destiny 2</em> around</a> following all the problems that cropped up during the year of <em>Lightfall</em>. It’s an impressive feat, to be sure, and it’ll become even more impressive if Bungie manages to deliver something truly meaningful and engaging with <em>The Final Shape</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-gameplay-reveal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed the first gameplay footage for&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, and it looks like exactly the kind of thing you'd want if you've been waiting for this revival since 2013.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I'm a Brit, and what I know about college football wouldn't fill the back of one of our very picturesque postage stamps. Still, we've got college football fans on our team, and our very own Andrew Otton assures me this is a strong showing.</p>

<p>Yesterday, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date">promised to show us</a>&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>in all its glory in a trailer, and they've made good on that promise. The footage doesn't technically show raw gameplay, but it does show what you can expect from the game's impressive-looking engine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-opener.jpg?itok=imfgpMmc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-opener.jpg?itok=JBSuQoZP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA is paying attention to the fine details in&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It looks like EA is not only paying attention to how games feel, but also how&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>pays tribute to its subject matter.</p>

<p>Plenty of pregame rituals and traditions have been incorporated into the game; in the trailer, we can see the USC Trojan stabbing the field, for instance, as well as the iconic Oregon Ducks motorcycle.</p>

<p>Any college football fan knows that the behavior of the crowds and the teams' mascots can be just as important as what happens on the field, so it's nice to see EA paying attention to this element of college football.</p>

<p>You can check out the new trailer for&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>right here. It should bring a happy tear to your eye if you're a college football fanatic.</p>




<p>In an <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/EA-SPORTS--Gives-First-Look-at-Gameplay-Modes--Fan-Favorite-Ways-to-Play-in-EA-SPORTS-College-Football-25/default.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accompanying press release</a>, EA reveals some of the features that will be making their way to&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football&nbsp;</em>in July.</p>

<p>They include a Wear &amp; Tear system that requires you to manage your players' fatigue and stamina on the field, as well as a system that incorporates the unnerving feeling of a homefield advantage into the gameplay itself.</p>

<p>All 134 FBS colleges will be represented in&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, and you can look forward to realistic "unique team run-outs, rivalry rituals, synchronized crowd-chants, loudness meters", and mascots, plus lots more.</p>

<p>It's nice to see the&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football&nbsp;</em>franchise returning. The last installment was all the way back in 2013, and a series of lawsuits and setbacks made another game in the series impossible for many years.</p>

<p>In 2021, however, the NCAA and EA revealed that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-returning-in-coming-years">college football games would return</a>, with EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-deal-covers-4-games">signing a four-game deal</a> to bring its signature franchise back to life.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, the first game in that four-game deal, launches on July 17th on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003151/">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ea-sports-college-football-25/9nsdm7mbgg8l" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. No PC version has been announced. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="bfiqT3"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> is a rare treat of a movie. It’s equal parts dense, complicated, funny, and sad, all while being an absolute joy to watch. Its story is equally concerned with the pain of loving a TV show that ended too soon, and the pain of letting your whole life slip by without ever truly knowing yourself. Finding ways to communicate all these complicated ideas while still making a watchable, entertaining film is a big task, but <em>TV Glow</em> writer-director Jane Schoenbrun has experience with that.</p>
<p id="RFxffj">Their fantastic first feature, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23027388/were-all-going-to-the-worlds-fair-review"><em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em></a>, centers on a young woman who finds friendship online as part of a community obsessed with something called “the World’s Fair Challenge,” a viral ritual that supposedly changes the body of anyone who performs it. <em>World’s Fair</em>, and Schoenbrun’s earlier documentary about Slenderman, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F275691576%2F4429fa2599&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24158543%2Fi-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23922584__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://vimeo.com/275691576/4429fa2599\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23922584__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://vimeo.com/275691576/4429fa2599&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>A Self-Induced Hallucination</em></a>, are both deeply rooted in online communities, creepypasta, and how we find ourselves and our identities in the media we consume. </p>
<p id="nKfyCq"><em>TV Glow</em> takes that concept even further, following Owen (Ian Foreman and, as he gets older, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24113743/american-society-of-magical-negroes-ending-explained-analysis">Justice Smith</a>) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine), two loners who bond over a shared love of a late-night TV show called <em>The Pink Opaque </em>— a mashup of ’90s TV hits that lives somewhere between <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23069583/buffy-spuffy-elysian-fields-fanfiction"><em>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23434855/twin-peaks-november-lets-go"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a>. Ahead of the release of <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em>, Polygon sat down with Schoenbrun to talk about their inspiration for the movie, their distrust of narrative convention, and the subtle ways all their films connect.</p>

<p id="GxNxRU"><strong>Polygon: Where did this script start for you?</strong></p>
<p id="NQXvay"><strong>Jane Schoenbrun: </strong>My process is very weird. I say my process — I don’t think it’s the way people normally work when they’re trying to make a narrative film. Something will kind of get lodged in my brain. And that something could be just like a title or an image or an idea. That’s definitely not a movie. But it feels stuck, and it feels connected to a lot of nerve endings that can be investigated. </p>
<p id="9GRLSz">And so for me on this film, there was this idea of being haunted by an unresolved cliffhanger from a child’s show, and the idea specifically of the characters on the TV show being in a certain kind of danger. That [feeling of] not having resolution, and that making it hard to exist in the “real world,” to the point where you’re almost taking on the pain of those characters. And from there, I really wanted to investigate why that particular mental metaphor or idea, and this sort of unreality and merging of fiction and reality that’s inherent in it, was so close to me. </p>
<p id="SJlLSy">I knew fairly early on that what I was talking about was a trans experience and dysphoria. And as I was beginning to work through dysphoria and beginning my actual transition, I understood this as a movie about recognizing something that’s wrong, and about the process that goes into that recognition.</p>

<p id="2km3NG"><strong>Do you think those feelings are similar for you, an unresolved TV show and the process of what it means to transition and to understand yourself better?</strong></p>
<p id="3kpc6T">The queer philosopher Eve Sedgwick does a lot of literary theory. I was reading the intro to one of her books, and she’ll talk about, like, a Henry James novel and pick apart the queer themes that are embedded in the work, or inherent to the work, even if only in a way that feels subtle, or only hinted, or glimpsed.</p>
<p id="K8p3KQ">She talked in this intro about, in childhood, finding these glimmers of a thing that at the time, she didn’t have the language to call queerness, but that she understood as some kind of signal that she wasn’t picking up elsewhere, that she wasn’t picking up in the immediate surroundings of the “real world” she existed within, and the straight world she existed within. And how she remembers almost making a promise to herself, whenever she would find these signals, these secret codes in the work that resonated with her, to look for that feeling in her adult life. </p>
<p id="tZFurk">When I read this, I had already been working on the movie, and it felt so eloquent, obviously [in] a different medium, you know? She’s not talking television, but it felt like exactly what the movie is trying to speak about, which is when you’re young, and you see a glimpse of something that cuts through in the way that feels, like Maddy says, more real than real life. What do you do with that? And to what degree do you reassess the life that you’re in, that does feel real, to make room for that kind of transmission?</p>

<p id="9oul03">I think the characters [in <em>TV Glow</em>] are very much haunted by that question. This question becomes more urgent as they get older, and they maybe do start to realize the true implications of the ways in which reality feels insufficient to them. And certainly for myself — like, yeah, obviously, I’m not trapped in a TV show, to the best of my knowledge. But I think I was unpacking some very personal things that I was working through.</p>
<p id="oCenUO"><strong>There have been a lot of conversations about the idea of representation in movies, but it’s very different to talk about people finding themselves in movies, TV, and art generally, and seeing things they may not realize are part of themselves until they see it on screen. I think </strong><em><strong>I Saw the TV Glow</strong></em><strong> is incredibly adept at showing that feeling. </strong></p>
<p id="av9G5d">I think on a very simple level, the concept of representation, the shallow identitarian representation, feels like mostly a tool of the oppressor. It’s like, <em>Who is the audience that is for?</em> I’m not sure that it’s for me, and trans people. We know we exist, you know? It’s for some kind of imagined idea of equality that will never actually exist, because we live in, like, a fundamentally evil, white-supremacist, capitalist hellscape.</p>
<p id="SQDsSc">But the idea of art creating possibility — or putting language to possibility — that previously felt either undefined or unimaginable feels to me like a form of representation, if you could even still call it that, that I could get behind. The idea of, like, a queer coming of age as something that’s inherently about creating unrealized or previously unrealized possibility, both on a personal and political level, and a piece of art that is speaking very honestly and personally about everything, that’s both liberatory and terrifying and difficult about that. I’m proud to have made that.</p>
<p id="HPPRHX"><strong>Why did you choose to center the story on Owen?  Was there ever a version that explored more of Maddy’s story?</strong></p>
<p id="widroH">I think if you’re thinking about, like, what’s-his-name’s Hero’s Journey shit, then Owen is the least interesting character, in that he doesn’t so much <em>grow</em> as he<em> decays.</em> Until perhaps at the very end of the movie he’s discovering or seeing something that explains the decay. And in this sense, he could be called, by, like, a hack studio executive, a passive narrator. </p>

<p id="nwNZCc">At the same time, I think that kind of “passivity” feels inherently tied to an experience that I — and I think many other trans folks — can relate to on a deeply visceral level. It indicates exactly how our ideas about what proper narrative or progress is is not only woefully limited in the experiences it’s showing, but also like maybe by definition, masculine and cis. [It’s] reflective of an idea of agency and individual agency that doesn’t resonate with other experiences, like my own. And so I am trying to rewrite or call into question or challenge or simply just like, exist within alternative ideas of narrative structure, to express something that feels emotionally truthful to my experience in the world. </p>
<p id="KzUUkc">I had a meeting with a really smart producer for this film. And he was like, <em>Listen, Owen is too passive. You need to rewrite this thing. Owen needs to be like, he got out of his home town and he’s coming back to visit, and all of these things are haunting him. This character is just a mess, and nobody wants to watch a mess.</em> </p>
<p id="WVC9yx">In fact, this producer told me, <em>Your audience is going to be convinced that Owen murdered Maddy, when Maddy disappears. Because you are playing against a century of Hollywood filmmaking about the reclusive, passive man who is secretly a psychopath, right?</em> Like the lineage of Norman Bates or <em>Peeping Tom</em>; the stuck-inside-himself, freak, passive, strange recluse, a character we should be viewing with suspicion. And I was so fascinated by this. I was like, <em>That’s a great point</em>. And really interesting from a trans perspective, because of course, Norman Bates was trans. And so I do think part of if it feels wrong to you, to be watching a character who is so stuck inside himself in the way Owen is. And for you to sit with that and question it as narratively incorrect, like, what presuppositions are you bringing to the table with that?</p>
<p id="mQ2zLO"><strong>Did you try to parallel and connect the suburbs as Owen experiences them and the world of </strong><em><strong>The</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>Pink Opaque</strong></em><strong>? </strong></p>
<p id="u1KL3Q">There was an idea early on in the film that it all existed in sort of one realm, that the suburbs Owen exists within are heightened in the way that the suburbs were heightened in ’90s television. The suburbs <em>The</em> <em>Pink Opaque</em> is set within are some kind of reflection of that, or they’re all sort of occupying maybe the same solar system, but different planets, because the whole movie is sort of playing with the idea of the memory of an imagined ’90s suburban utopia, and also the memory of how the television of that time helped to create that idea.</p>

<p id="5wVwA1">And then I think what happens in the movie is, both the real world and the TV show transform as the movie goes on into something else, but they kind of transform in tandem, right? Owen’s world becomes a darker and more haunted place, as the show transforms from this very nostalgic, cheesy, VHS analog thing to something that feels more like a snuff film.</p>
<p id="2nWVZF"><strong>One thing I really enjoyed about your last two films is the way the outside world interacts with the things we see from the characters. How did you approach building that off-screen world for your characters, and developing the things we don’t see?</strong></p>
<p id="S04Z4v">I think it comes from an understanding that your real estate, when you’re making a film, is actually quite limited. You have 90 minutes, maybe, and if tempo and pace and restraint are important to you, as paints on your paintbrush, which they are for me, you really don’t have much time to smoosh in a lot of exposition.</p>
<p id="61f4gC">And beyond that, I’m skeptical of the ability of a work of art to explain anything. I think that narratively, if you see that Owen has an angry dad, then the “Angry Dad” becomes a stand-in for an explanation for something. Or if you see that Casey [in <em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em>] is being bullied in school, then everything you’re seeing in the film becomes explained to a certain degree by this narrative choice. And it’s all constructed, right? Everything in there is a decision I’m making. For me, when we get too far from the margins into these expository zones, it almost becomes a way for me to interact with the viewer. </p>

<p id="WcdugB">I’m less interested in a psychological explanation of, <em>Oh, Owen’s life is like this because X</em>. I’m going for more: If I show you these three things, and then continue to explore what I’m exploring at the center of the film, what is your relationship to the exposition? Which is kind of heady, and, you know, maybe a little pretentious, but I do find that this kind of light touch makes films linger in ways that are more generative and evocative and long-lasting than if everything was able to be charted out and mapped out and explained. </p>
<p id="S2hRAW"><strong>What do you see as your own inspiration for that kind of storytelling and approach?</strong></p>
<p id="9Xqdi7">I am inherently suspicious of narrative, is probably where it comes from, and I think this is very apparent in my work. The work is so interested in narrative construction. <em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em> explicitly is a film about narrative construction and a film about a character narrating themselves. And I think <em>TV Glow</em> similarly is a film that’s interested in how power mediates the narratives that we are able to exist within.</p>
<p id="4sBR8h">I do think there is this impulse in [my] movies to do a thing that’s a little bit intentionally frustrating, perhaps, to people who are used to a straightforward, narrative, commercial language of cinema, which is to be interrogating narrative design and narrative tropes as a limiting, potentially even nefarious mechanism.</p>
<p id="Zlf3dl">I think the work is not trying to necessarily satisfy. And I think a lot of American entertainment, its primary goal is to satisfy in a very shallow and short-term way. To give you an experience that feels like spectacle, or feels relaxing and satisfying enough immediately that you can then go on with your life and see the next thing that’s going to satisfy you.</p>

<p id="8RqjcG">That’s just not what gets me out of bed, in my art, you know; I want to be making things that are speaking to the world we live in. And I do think our relationship to entertainment, which is our relationship to, like, narrative or resolution, or as [cultural critic] Lauren Berlant would talk about, ideas of the good life, or Cruel Optimism that can only let you down in reality. All of these things are [what] I’m trying to leverage the art and the experience of the movie to be like, to be generative in a way that’s a little bit deeper than just [giving] you finely tuned, perfected, narrative satisfaction.</p>
<p id="EjsFAa"><strong>Is that something that resonates with you in other people’s work as well? </strong></p>
<p id="QUNwOH">It’s almost mandatory for me, especially in the film and television and written-word work I consume. Something like <em>The Sopranos</em>, maybe kind of a random example. But I feel like the entire purpose of that show was exactly this. [It] was about utilizing the TV form. All of these different episodes, each of them kind of flirting with progress, but never quite getting there, and always doubling back on itself until it’s finally over. That’s a perfect metaphor for speaking about the way life can feel. And I think so much of the art I’m drawn to, it’s not that it’s disinterested in the pleasure of narrative, or like the power of catharsis or arc, but it is utilizing those weapons toward a goal that’s more than just enjoyment.</p>
<p id="N8ewaU"><strong>I think your first film, the Slenderman documentary </strong><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F275691576%2F4429fa2599&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24158543%2Fi-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23922584__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://vimeo.com/275691576/4429fa2599\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23922584__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://vimeo.com/275691576/4429fa2599&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em><strong>A Self-Induced Hallucination</strong></em></a><strong>, is really fascinating and great, and it also seems like sort of a skeleton key that echoes the themes of your next two movies. How often do you think about that movie and the stories you include in it? </strong></p>
<p id="WB4wAW">I think everything is an echo of everything else. And I think I did crack something with <em>Self-Induced Hallucination</em> that started a process I’m still very much a part of. I think my work has always been interested in this intersection point, this non-straightforward relationship between fiction and reality. And is it fiction that makes reality, or reality that makes fiction? Or is it something more complicated and interlinked? </p>
<p id="4tHBZn">I think about [that] all the time. Like that Tulpa kid, at the end of <em>Self-Induced Hallucination</em>. I think about this idea of something fictional that you understand on a certain level is fictional, being real enough to save your life. And I think about the ways those questions aren’t just a way to investigate the construction of identity, but are also a way to talk about this world we’ve built, and all of the ways in which it is both very real and very constructed. Like I was talking about earlier, the ways in which possibility could maybe be opened from the things that we consider “fiction.”</p>

He’s so good at capturing the inherent drama in these struggles that his videos routinely rack up millions of views, whether he’s recounting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/_EsFyogVvkw?si=ffePr1lq000D914j&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/_EsFyogVvkw?si=ffePr1lq000D914j" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the history of <em>Super Mario Bros. 3 </em>world records</a></span> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/_XkKufyIiAY?si=DnyFRoix4Ms7qzVc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/_XkKufyIiAY?si=DnyFRoix4Ms7qzVc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world records in <em>Wii Sports Resort</em></a></span><em> </em>golf. His latest video, however, may be his most jaw-dropping. It’s all about the history of world records (and other mind-blowing achievements) in NES <em>Tetris</em>, and it is absolutely not to be missed.<br></p><p>I don’t want to say much about the actual history the video covers, because so much of the pleasure of watching is in the way that Summoning Salt breaks it all down for his viewers, taking concepts that may seem a bit technical or alienating to non-gamers (or even just to people who aren’t familiar with the specific quirks of NES <em>Tetris</em>) and making it all clear, accessible, and absolutely thrilling. Like a great sportscaster who wants to make sure everyone watching can appreciate the action happening on the field, even if they don’t know a first down from a field goal, Summoning Salt is a wonderful tour guide through all the incredible achievements that his video recounts.<br></p><div data-video-id="196805" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Hate This FF7 Rebirth Character’s Whole Vibe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="93" data-playlist="196805,195905,196646" data-current="196805"><div><p>I Hate This FF7 Rebirth Character’s Whole Vibe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22362.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><h2 id="h119174"><a id=""></a>Pushing beyond the limits of <em>NES Tetris</em></h2><p>Still, let me say just a little bit to set the stage. In the early days of the saga, which Summoning Salt recounts with archival records of high scores in <em>Tetris</em> from sources like a 1992 issue of <em>Nintendo Power </em>and online chats from circa 2005, there was skepticism among players that a score of 999,999 was even possible. That’s because, when you reach level 29, the game begins moving so fast that it was clearly the programmers’ intended way of saying, “this is where the game ends”; playing (with normal methods anyway) just didn’t allow you to move the pieces fast enough to arrange them skillfully, so you were promptly met with a game over. Level 29 was dubbed the “killscreen” for that reason, even if it’s different from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_screen#:~:text=A%20kill%20screen%20is%20a,across%20the%20arcade%20machine's%20screen.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_screen#:~:text=A%20kill%20screen%20is%20a,across%20the%20arcade%20machine's%20screen." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">killscreens in other games</a></span> like arcade <em>Pac-Man </em>and <em>Donkey Kong </em>in which some sort of glitch or other oddity literally makes additional play impossible. And it wasn’t clear if it was even possible to rack up 999,999 points—the highest number the game’s score window could display—before reaching the killscreen and being forced to game over.<br></p><p>However, what follows over the video’s hour-and-50-minute runtime is so astounding and transformative that by the end, people’s perceptions of what’s possible in <em>Tetris </em>have been completely obliterated and remade, as new understandings of the game and approaches to playing it result in a total sea change. At one point, for instance, a shift in how players in the <em>Tetris </em>community hold and manipulate the NES controller completely destroys perceived barriers in just how far people can push the game. Suffice it to say that there’s no doubt any longer that people can reach scores way, way, <em>way </em>beyond 999,999 in NES <em>Tetris</em>. And just how we’ve gotten to this point is a story for the ages, packed not just with remarkable innovations and accomplishments, but new obstacles as well. For example, if you progress far enough in <em>Tetris</em>, the blocks will start having glitchy, unintended color palettes applied to them, some of which make the action very hard to see. It’s just one of those things you have to deal with when you push a game way past what the original programmers ever envisioned a player would achieve.<br></p><p>Don’t balk at that 110-minute runtime, either. It may sound like a lot of time to invest in a video about people making number go up in a video game, but there’s as much drama here as there is in an outstanding sports documentary. And one of the really exciting things about this story is that it’s not over yet. Shortly after Summoning Salt’s video was released, competitive <em>Tetris </em>player MylesTheGreat was streaming his own gameplay, but decided to call it a night. Just then, however, Summoning Salt himself piped up in chat. “One more!” he said. Reluctantly, Myles agreed, and—of course—had an absolutely amazing game, as you can see in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/xtrfxm8weXA?si=9kN1c-q8zqQ3EThu&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/xtrfxm8weXA?si=9kN1c-q8zqQ3EThu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this YouTube video of his</a></span>, appropriately titled “SummoningSalt Said ‘One More Game’ AND I BROKE TETRIS.” The story of <em>Tetris</em>’ past is absolutely bananas. Its future could be even wilder.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="210" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The iconic Kar98k sniper rifle is returning to <em>Call of Duty</em> in <em>Warzone</em> and <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, but when will you be able to get your hands on this behemoth? I’ve got the official date so you can get ready. </p> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">New weapons are added to <em>Call of Duty</em> every season, giving players new options to add to their loadouts. Usually, these new guns are pretty powerful, which makes unlocking and leveling them up necessary if you want to be a part of the meta. </p> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">While Season 3 Reloaded added <em>Advanced Warfare</em>‘s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-bal-27-warzone-loadout-attachments-perks-and-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BAL-27</a>, we’re going further back into history for Season 4, with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/looks-like-the-kar98k-is-set-to-return-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kar98k</a> sniper rifle making its <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>debut. </p>

 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false">The gun will then be added to the game and will be unlocked either through the Battle Pass or a set of challenges, which will be confirmed when Activision drops the Season 4 blog before the update. </p> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">Teasers for the Kar98k dropped on May 16, when content creators were sent packages advertising the new season, which included a toy car with the number 98 on it, the tagline “Bolt into action,” a scratch-off portion with the letter “K,” and a section on the back that indicates there are 98 of them in the world. Subtle, I know. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="false">The Kar98k was an extremely popular option in <em>Warzone Pacific</em> back in 2021, so it’ll be interesting to see how the new version stacks up. New guns generally dominate the meta to begin with, so I imagine we’ll be seeing people calling for nerfs on May 30. </p>

We’re here to keep you in the loop with the&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em>&nbsp;movie release date, potential returning cast, and teasers.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-when-does-five-nights-at-freddy-s-2-movie-come-out" data-injectable="false">When does Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 movie come out?</h2> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">The release date of the&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s&nbsp;2</em>&nbsp;film has been set for&nbsp;<strong>Dec. 5, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>Universal Pictures confirmed this exciting news, listing it on their <a href="https://www.universalpictures.com/upcoming-films" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming movie schedule</a>. The movie’s production company, Blumhouse, also <a href="https://x.com/jason_blum/status/1791200127149126116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backed this date</a>, but as with any movie filming, delays are always a possibility.</p> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">The plot for&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em>&nbsp;remains a tantalizing mystery, adding to the intrigue and excitement. Will it continue where its predecessor left off, or dive into Freddy Fazbear’s deranged origins? The games have been known to play with time, so a prequel-esque storyline could be in the cards.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true">However, there are still many unanswered questions from the first film, centering around Mike, the newly-appointed night security guard of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria. We may better understand what happened to him and his family in the much-awaited sequel.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-five-nights-at-freddy-s-2-film-teasers" data-injectable="false">Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 film teasers</h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">Blumhouse has only revealed one teaser so far, where we get a glimpse of Jim Henson’s Creature Shop. Although it hasn’t&nbsp;been confirmed, they seem to be working on another sinister animatronic, Mangle. This infamous character was first introduced in the&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/find-the-fnaf-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game</a>, showcasing a much more disfigured Foxy.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="239" data-injectable="false">Since Mangle is a part of the second entry in the&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s&nbsp;</em>series, it could be safe to say that the film will be tied to this game. Nevertheless, Blumhouse could still change things as they did with the first film.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-who-is-returning-for-five-nights-at-freddy-s-2-movie" data-injectable="false">Who is returning for Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 movie?</h2> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">While the official cast announcement&nbsp;is yet to come, there are strong indications that Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lillard may be reprising their roles.

 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">Lillard also commented on the&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2&nbsp;</em>release date announcement. In an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/matthewlillard/p/C7C7W7aP5Ro/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a>, he cryptically stated, “December 2025. I ALWAYS COME BACK.” This intriguing hint could indicate his return, but we won’t know for certain until Universal Pictures or Blumhouse unveils the cast details.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/report-call-of-duty-2024-will-come-to-xbox-game-pass-on-day-one/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has reportedly decided that, yes, Call of Duty 2024 will launch day and date into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>This is apparently something that Microsoft’s executives have been debating for some time – per <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango">The Verge</a> – but The Wall Street Journal is now reporting that they’ve made up their mind and will bring the next Call of Duty game straight into Game Pass when it launches later this year.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/30/xbox-games-showcase-and-a-redacted-direct-confirmed-for-june-9th/">The next Call of Duty is set to be revealed at Xbox Games Showcase on 9th June</a>, and is likely to be the game featured in the [Redacted] deep-dive stream that follows.</p>
<p>The hope is that this will be a major boost to Xbox Game Pass subscriber counts, across both Xbox and PC, and since COD will not be a platform exclusive for a long, long time, should preserve a lot of the overall profitability of the franchise with the majority of gamers still happy to buy the games outright on PlayStation in particular. A large portion of the money that Call of Duty makes also comes from the free-to-play Warzone game mode.</p>
<p>That reason means that some analysts, such as games industry analyst Daniel Ahmad, are all for it. He <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1791470465753518402">wrote</a>, “This is the right move for Microsoft because it’s a multi-platform title that is being sold for $70 outside of the subscription and because it’s a live service title with in game purchases. That model can also work for other Xbox first party games.”</p>

<p>However, this could still be a double-edged sword for Game Pass. It likely will boost subscriber counts, but how sticky will that be to keep people subscribed? Xbox and PC gamers might see this as an opportunity to pay for a trial or single month to get a quick fix of Call of Duty, before unsubscribing a month later, ultimately cutting a big chunk of the profit from all of those gamers, and potentially undermining the Xbox Game Pass project and business model in general. Worse would be if it fails to meaningfully move the needle, with the growth of subscriber counts having levelled off in the last couple years. One possible mitigation would be to have a higher priced tier specially for COD.</p>
<p>Of course, this should all be taken with a grain of salt. We can expect WSJ to have trustworthy sources, but we’re also a few weeks away from the 9th June showcase and Microsoft could very easily change their minds again between now and then.</p>
<p>The pressure is on the Xbox division and Microsoft’s gaming business to grow and be as profitable as possible, thanks to the almost $70 billion that Microsoft paid to acquire Activision Blizzard. Since that purchase was completed, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/">Microsoft made major redundancies</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/15/four-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-not-starfield-or-indy/">announced that they were bringing select Xbox exclusives to rival platforms</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">closed two beloved Bethesda studios</a>, and is reportedly planning for more games to arrive on PS5, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/15/report-more-xbox-games-coming-to-ps5-as-part-of-the-latitude-project/">nothing held back</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass-is-a-done-deal-according-to-the-wall-street-journal.874107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Is <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty</a> coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a>? When Microsoft first began pursuing it’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, many assumed using Call of Duty to bolster Game Pass was one of their goals, but things have changed since then. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-ps-plus-gaming-subscriptions-up-only-1-percent-year-on-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Pass growth has slowed</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-falls-fall-short-of-microsoft-growth-targets-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">badly missing growth targets</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-unlikely-more-than-10-to-15-percent-of-microsoft-gaming-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox boss Phil Spencer has admitted there’s a ceiling to its success</a>. While some Activision Blizzard games like Diablo IV have been added to Game Pass, recent reports suggested that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-still-evaluating-whether-to-put-cod-on-game-pass-and-a-game-pass-price-increase-hellblade-ii-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft was still “evaluating”</a> whether to do the same with the headliner that is Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Well, it seems the big decision may have been made. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-call-of-duty-game-pass-53e8930c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a new report from the Wall Street Journal</a>, Microsoft will indeed be bringing 2024’s entry in the Call of Duty franchise to Game Pass. This should be announced next month at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big Xbox Games Showcase</a>. Of course, Microsoft has not confirmed this, so take it with a grain of salt for now, but the Wall Street Journal isn’t in the business of spreading baseless rumors.</p>
<p>Needless to say, putting Call of Duty on Game Pass is a major risk for Microsoft. As we recently heard from former 343 Industries PR head Brad Hilderbrand, releasing titles on Game Pass on Day 1 <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-miss-sales-goal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causes them to “badly miss” sales targets</a>. Now, to some degree, the damage might be contained if Game Pass was only on Xbox, but this also has the potential to hurt PC sales. It should also be mentioned, that during the lengthy Acti-Blizz acquisition process, Phil Spencer hinted <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-ps-plus-playstation-7-spencer-no-forever-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’d be up for CoD on PlayStation Plus, too</a>. All that said, if Microsoft is still committed to Game Pass as an idea, maybe it’s time to throw that ultimate Hail Mary. It’s going to be hard to stuff this genie back in the bottle if it doesn’t work out though.</p>
<p>For those who haven’t been keeping up with the series, this year’s Call of Duty is being developed by Treyarch and is expected to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continuation of the Black Ops franchise set during the Gulf War</a>. In other words, this ought to be a pretty big entry in the series, and a heck of a way to potentially launch the “CoD on Game Pass” era.</p>
<p>The Xbox Games Showcase where the next Call of Duty will be revealed takes place on June 9. What do you think? Is bringing Call of Duty to Game Pass a good move or is Microsoft strangling the golden goose? If it happens, will you still pay for CoD or go the Game Pass route?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158944/college-football-25-trailer-gameplay-modes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Commki">With the release of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157717/college-football-25-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-ea-sports"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em></a> just two months away, we’ve now got our first glimpse of what the game looks like in action, courtesy of a proper trailer that publisher Electronic Arts released Friday morning.</p>
<p id="1DtOwo">Transitioning from Guns N’ Roses’ original recording of “Welcome to the Jungle” — a quintessential hype-up-the-fans song — into a marching band version is a very nice touch in this trailer. And it plays over footage of storied college football traditions from all over the country: unique team entrances (with, for the first time, real names on the backs of jerseys), mascots getting everyone into a frenzy, and crowds singing fight songs. It’s clear that developer EA Tiburon has gone to great lengths to bring the game-day atmosphere of college football to life in <em>College Football 25</em>.</p>
<p id="hrpALY">EA also revealed the first details about <em>College Football 25</em>’s modes and gameplay, confirming the return of the fan-favorite franchise and career modes — Dynasty and Road to Glory, respectively — as well as a new competitive offering called Road to the College Football Playoff. In that mode, players can choose a school and work toward winning a national championship by progressing through divisions and earning rank. In a way, its existence can be seen as a nod to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24074774/ea-sports-college-football-25-teaser-trailer">11-year gap between EA’s college football games</a>: The College Football Playoff wasn’t a thing when EA released <em>NCAA Football 14</em> back in 2013. And, yes, EA’s microtransaction-based fantasy team setup, Ultimate Team, figures to be a major part of the game, especially now that EA can use players’ real names.</p>

<p id="2A4qm4">College football doesn’t look the same on the field as the NFL, and EA Tiburon is touting some new gameplay features this year to differentiate the action not just in general, but on a team-by-team basis, with a gamified version of home-field advantage. If you’re taking Ohio State into the Big House for a showdown with the Wolverines, expect “distractions like screen shaking, missing pre-play icons, and moving play art,” according to EA. The developers are also introducing a wear-and-tear system that will force you to manage fatigue and make the right substitutions at the right times to prevent players from becoming tired (and making mistakes).</p>
<p id="mMrwGc">Off the field, EA is bringing back a bunch of veterans from ESPN’s college football broadcasts for audio commentary in <em>College Football 25</em>. Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit will call “marquee matchups,” said EA, while Rece Davis, Jesse Palmer, and David Pollack will handle all other games.</p>
<p id="wZPSh3"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> will be released July 19 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. While EA is also pairing it with <em>Madden NFL 25</em> (which is scheduled for an Aug. 16 debut) in a package called the MVP Bundle, there’s no word yet on whether there will be any cross-game functionality between the two.</p>
