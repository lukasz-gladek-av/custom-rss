<figure data-uuid="b374eebd56bd7"><a title="Prime 4 / Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b374eebd56bd7/prime-4-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Multiple rumours have been doing the rounds regarding a potential Switch 2 release for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the latest flagship entry in Ubisoft's stealth series, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">age ratings and even box art images</a> making their way online.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to prominent leaker Billbil-kun over on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/assassins-creed-shadows-debarquera-bientot-sur-switch-2-on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-60629">Dealabs</a>, we may now know the proposed launch date for Shadows. According to the article, the game is scheduled to release on <strong>5th December 2025</strong>, just in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>This also means that it's landing just one day after the highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which is scheduled to release on both the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>. We're not expecting a huge amount of crossover between the two games in terms of target audience, but we imagine Ubisoft must be losing out on at least a handful of sales as a result.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>This is how things go in the games industry, mind you, as we've seen time and time again. We'll just have to see how it all shake out.</p>
<p>As indicated by the 'leaked' box art design, it also seems likely that Shadows will be a Game-Key Card release on the Switch 2, meaning that no significant data will be stored on the cartridge and a full download will be required.</p>
<p>It's probably wise to take all of this with a grain of salt until we hear directly from Ubisoft. We've reached out for comment and will update you as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>To be fair to them, they haven't shied away from it or a commitment to doing a better job of communicating about the state of the game. In a new video, Helldivers 2 director Mikael Eriksson is firmly unducked and makes clear that updates adding new enemies, gear or twists will be a bit slower to arrive while the studio work on getting things running without hiccups.
</p><p>"The feedback that we've gotten has been very justified," he said. What I can say is that we're taking this very seriously and we are focusing way more now on addressing these issues to make sure that this sort of thing doesn't happen again. We have made the decision to push some of our content and feature updates a little bit into the future while we're addressing these things, to make sure that we can get to a much more stable state."</p>
<p>Eriksson added that some of the problems can be addressed "fairly quickly", whereas are a bit more complex, a sentiment the studio have regularly expressed when it comes to this build-up of buggy bits and bobs. "We are already making really big improvements. I'm confident that we will get there and we will be able to talk more in detail about this hopefully quite soon," the dev added.</p>
<p>It's good to see Arrowhead being a bit more proactive with their comms than they have been in the past. Here's hoping they can solve at least a good chunk of the lingering issues, even if it's impossible to make every addition risk-free when it comes to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-devs-arrowhead-pull-new-rupture-strain-bugs-offline-for-five-weeks-to-fix-their-er-bugs">kicking off unintended consequences</a>.</p>

              <p>Dragon Con, Atlanta’s massive annual pop culture convention, featured its usual array of enormously famous guests, booths and of course, cosplayers. As ever, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s intrepid photography heroes Mineralblu were there, snapping the best outfits, compiled here today for your viewing pleasure.</p> <p>The Florida event can certainly bring out the big guns. 2025’s shindig saw the likes of John Boyega, Charisma Carpenter, David Boreanaz, Brent Spiner, Simon Pegg, Timothy Omundson, Christopher Lloyd, Karen Fukuhara and William Shatner. It also appears to attract some of the most inventive cosplayers too, with some costumes the likes we’ve never seen before.</p> <p>Among the more familiar sources, such as <em>Elden Ring</em>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em> and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>, this year’s Dragon Con also featured cosplay inspired by <em>Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure</em>, the glorious idea of an unpainted Space Marine, and my absolute favorite, a collection of Thumb Thumbs from the mighty&nbsp;<em>Spy Kids. </em>And check back soon, as hopefully we’ll also have a video of the event to add to this post in the not-too-distant future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days has come and gone. This was the online retail giant’s two-day sales event where you’re able to save big on TVs, tablets, coffee makers, and pretty much anything else. The next massive, site-wide sale won’t be here until Black Friday, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find a good deal. You just have to look hard enough. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4758/">This Marshall Bluetooth speaker came down in price at the beginning of the month by a whopping $85 and has remained there through the Prime sale.</a> That 47% discount brought the price down from $180 to just $95.</p>
<p>Marshall has been an industry leader in sound engineering for more than 60 years. The company first put its name on the map when it introduced the world to the JTM45 guitar amplifier. That amp produced a much heavier reverberated sound than all other speakers on the market, which helped defined the sound of rock n’ roll. Music was changed forever. Fast forward to today, Marshall still commits itself to crafting great products featuring its signature sound. That’s what you’re getting with this portable Bluetooth speaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4758/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Iconic Look and Sound</h2>
<p>First thing you notice about the Marshall Emberton II is its look. This Bluetooth speaker has been models to look like all the iconic Marshall amps of the past, bringing a stylish accent to whatever desk, coffee table, or nightstand you place it on.</p>
<p>The Marshall Emberton II offers a rich stereophonic 360-degree sound that can fill a room and sound great no matter where you are sitting or standing in relation to it. It’s compact in size, but still durable, allowing you to take it with you anywhere without worry.</p>



<p>A portable speaker would be pretty useless without a good battery — so how is the Marshall Emberton II on that front? Well, this speaker will get you over 30 hours of playtime off of a single charge. That over a full day of listening to Ben Platt’s cover of&nbsp;<em>Diet Pepsi</em> on repeat. If you find you have forgotten to charge.</p>
<p>After pairing your phone in your Bluetooth settings, you can start listening with rich sound immediately. Though, if you download the dedicated app, you can customize your sound to your environment and persona preferences. Mess with the equalizer presets to find what’s perfect whether you’re listening in your living room or outside on the beach.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4758/">Right now, you can grab the Marshall Emberton II speaker for $85 off for a limited time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New leaks have revealed that Pokémon Scarlet/Violet’s cost went way over budget, matching the likes of Pokémon Legends: Arceus’ entire development. </p>



<p>A massive number of leaks have surfaced online about the Pokémon franchise since yesterday, revealing details about past, present, and future games. We have already been informed about the Gen 10 title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wind and Wave</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a roadmap</a> for future Pokémon games. Now, new details about Scarlet and Violet’s DLC have also surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-s-expansion-brought-in-6-15-million-downloads">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Expansion Brought In 6.15 Million Downloads</h2>



<p>As revealed by the reliable CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978000011733664139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the cost for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s DLC development surpassed their estimated budgets enormously, reaching “as much as the entire Legends: Arceus development”. After that, the development team decided that DLCs would be kept “at an appropriate scale commensurate with the revenue, and focus on achieving low costs”. In the first 10 months, the DLC sold 6.15 million downloads, which is 25% of the players that own the game. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Pokémon Scarlet/Violet DLC development ended up going way over budget, costing as much as the entire Legends: Arceus development.</p><p>"Going forward, we will keep the DLC at an appropriate scale commensurate with the revenue, and focus on achieving low costs". <a href="https://t.co/gIkuf3FwIV">pic.twitter.com/gIkuf3FwIV</a></p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978000011733664139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-dlcs-became-a-mandate-after-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-s-expansion-0">DLCs Became a Mandate After Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Expansion</h2>



<p>A previous post from Centro also talks about troubles during the development of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC, which led to a decision that many fans will be happy about. It seems that the DLC was not planned from the beginning, which led to a bug that affected development. After this issue, “Game Freak mandated that all future games will be programmed assuming DLC will be made.” Which means all future Pokémon games will be made with an expansion in mind. </p>

<p>If you can’t wait to get stuck into Pokémon Legends: Z-A Season 1’s Ranked mode, you need to hear about its official start date, what time it’s expected to go live, and potential rewards waiting for you if you can be the very best like no one ever was.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has a different feel to Arceus. From its location to its gameplay mechanics, there are differences across the board. But we’ve not had to wait for the game’s launch to find out everything about the RPG. We already know the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokedex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete Pokémon Legends: Z-A Pokédex</a> and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preload-guide-file-size-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">file size</a>.</p>



<p>The developer is also keen to keep you all up to date with Season 1 Ranked—and so are we!</p>







<figure><figcaption>A lot to look forward to. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can write down October 16 in your diary as the start date for Z-A Season 1’s Ranked mode.</strong></p>



<p>Funnily enough, it coincides with the game’s release day! Many new releases wait until some time after launch before going full board with any Season 1 content. If you’re looking forward to <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon</a> Legends: Z-A’s Ranked content, you won’t have to wait long to get stuck in.</p>







<p><strong>Pokémon has revealed that 6:00 UTC is the official start time for Season 1 Ranked.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick time breakdown of what this looks like for different regions if you’re having trouble converting UTC to your time zone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Season 1 Ranked Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00 PM—October 15</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1:00 AM—October 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2:00 AM—October 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">7:00 AM—October 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">5:00 PM—October 16</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>So far, we know you can earn a Greninjite for ranking up in Season 1.</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, there will be a lot more to earn, which we’ll learn about once Season 1 is live. The more battling you do, and the more you win, the better your loot at the end of it!</p>

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is being <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/pax-dei-arc-raiders-open-beta-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation/">added to a new batch of games</a> at launch this month and as updates to games already available, with players sporting GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs getting the most out of DLSS 4 and all of NVIDIA's graphics technology. NVIDIA has also <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/arc-raiders-geforce-game-ready-driver/">released new drivers</a> for ARC Raiders ahead of its server slam test before it launches later this month.</p>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-little-nightmares-iii-and-crimson-desert-all-launching-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-support/">Battlefield 6 and Little Nightmares III</a> were the two highlights launching with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, and this week, the attention turns to Pax Dei, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mmo-game-pax-dei-launches-october-16-available-game-pass/">new MMO arriving on PC </a>and as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-keeper-pax-dei-xbox-game-pass-october-2025/">Xbox Game Pass</a> this week on October 16, and Keeper, the latest game from Double Fine Productions, which is due to launch later this week on October 17 (and also directly into Xbox Game Pass) will launch with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support.</p>



<p>Fairlight84, the free-to-play PvP first-person shooter, where everyone has been turned into a new zombie-cyborg hybrid called 'Zomborgs,' also arrives this week on October 16, and with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Regarding the ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/">server slam test going on this weekend</a>, you'll also be able to jump into that with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation turned on. Of course, you'll want to ensure you have the latest drivers installed, but once you do, you'll be good to go for this test and for the game's coming launch on October 30, 2025.</p>



<p>Also happening this week, NBA2K26 gets support for DLSS Super Resolution, and if you are eligible for GeForce Rewards, then you'll be able to grab a free golden key for Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>A couple of notable titles are also launching later this month with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support, including Obsidian's second major RPG for the year, The Outer Worlds 2, and the long-awaited Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, which launch on October 29, 2025 and October 21, 2025, respectively.</p>

              <p><i>Call of Duty</i> has been such a staple of gaming that it’s hard to imagine a time when it wasn’t a household name. But way before its yearly release cycle kicked in and modern and futuristic settings became <i>CoD</i>’s bread and butter, even before the franchise made its debut and was largely about simulating World War II battles, there was <i>Medal of Honor</i>. And according to EA’s Vince Zampella (<i>Battlefield</i>, <i>Titanfall</i>, <i>Apex Legends</i>), Activision brought <i>CoD</i> into existence to put <i>Medal of Honor</i> in its crosshairs. Mission accomplished.</p> <p>“The only reason <i>Call of Duty </i>exists is because EA were dicks,” Zampella said in an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella"><i>GQ</i></a> (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-only-reason-call-of-duty-exists-is-because-ea-were-dicks-battlefield-boss-vince-zampella-says">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>). An FPS OG, Zampella was the lead designer of <i>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</i>, and would go on to co-found Infinity Ward.</p> <p>In what sounds like a dispatch from an alternate universe, Infinity Ward was originally hoping to create more <i>Medal of Honor </i>games. That didn’t happen. EA decided to be “dicks,” and chose to handle things on its own with <i>Medal of Honor</i> (that wouldn’t end up working out well). At the time, Infinity Ward, now without its franchise of choice in its grasp, pivoted to pitching Activision on a new historical shooter, <i>Call of Duty</i>.</p> <p>Zampella would later join EA, creating <i>Titanfall </i>and <i>Apex Legends</i> in his role at Respawn Entertainment. He’s now in charge of <i>Battlefield</i>, which is celebrating its sixth mainline release.</p>

You can find enormous sets like the <em>Star Wars</em>‘ Death Star which can take multiple days to build or small sets assigned to no IP that can snap together in minutes. Some of them are intended to be displayed on a shelf while for others, play comes first. This Formula 1 Speed Champions LEGO set covers both of those categories equally. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4754/">Right now, Amazon has it on sale for 20% off. The set normally goes for $27, but right now, it’s come down to just $22. You’ll save a cool $5 on your purchase.</a></p>

It features authentic details designed after the real-life 2024 vehicle raced by the F1 team, including rear wing, sponsor stickers and wider rear tires with “Pirelli” imprinted on them. It’s a great gift for car lovers or to make a brand new Formula 1 fan.</p>

<h2>LEGO Builder App</h2>
<p>You can use the LEGO builder app alongside putting together the F1 collectible LEGO race car. The app is designed to make the building process easier and more immersive than without it. You can zoom in and rotate the sets in a 3D space while tracking your work in front of you. If you need to walk away from the build to take a break or come back to in on a later date, you can digitally bookmark your progress and pick up exactly where you left off. It’s a real nifty way LEGO has kept up with the time. Check it out on the LEGO website for more info.</p>

<p>The current lead for the Battlefield franchise has stated that the only reason Call of Duty exists is because EA had a fallout with him. </p>



<p>The Battlefield franchise is back to its victory days with the release of BF6, finally giving the likes of Call of Duty some serious competition. Their last title, Battlefield 2042, didn’t perform well with fans, but the developers have pulled off a complete turnaround, with BF6 reaching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beats-call-of-dutys-all-time-concurrent-player-count-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost 750k concurrent players</a> on launch day. </p>



<h2 id="h-vince-zampella-reveals-call-of-duty-is-only-here-because-ea-were-d-s">Vince Zampella Reveals Call of Duty is Only Here Because ‘EA Were D***s’</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GQ</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/call-of-duty-creator-and-current-battlefield-6-head-vince-zampella-says-the-only-reason-that-cod-exists-is-because-ea-were-d-ks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Vince Zampella spoke about Call of Duty’s existence. The executive vice president at Electronic Arts stated, “The only reason that&nbsp;Call of Duty&nbsp;exists is because EA were dicks”. For those unaware about Zampella’s past, he left EA after a dispute, only to make Infinity Ward in 2002, which led to the creation of the Call of Duty franchise. He later returned to EA to oversee games such as Titanfall, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,&nbsp;and Apex Legends.</p>



<p>Vince Zampella is a true veteran of the shooter genre, delivering players with some of the biggest hits in this space. He started with Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, where we worked closely with Steven Spielberg. After the dispute, Activision tasked him with creating a franchise that would kill Medal of Honor, and that was Call of Duty. However, after that, he returned to EA and is now overseeing the latest big thing in the FPS space, Battlefield. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s campaign offers players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-campaign-tells-you-to-uninstall-when-youre-done/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an uninstall button</a> after completion. Additionally, Black Ops 7 beta matches were nearly 99% cheater-free. What are your thoughts on Call of Duty not existing if Zampella didn’t have a fallout with EA? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <p>Head of Battlefield Vince Zampella has given his opinion on the creation of the Call of Duty franchise, stating the series only exists "because EA were dicks".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella">In an interview with GQ</a>, Zampella spoke about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s potential to save the modern military shooter, but also his own history in game development. After all, before he touched Battlefield, Zampella was part of the original Call of Duty team.</p>
<p>"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks," stated Zampella. For those who don't know, Zampella was working on the Medal of Honor series  - specifically the fantastic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/medal-honor-allied-assault">Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</a> - at developer 2015 Inc. Zampella and his peers then formed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/infinity-ward">Infinity Ward</a>, and soon after EA quickly decided to move development of Medal of Honor in-house. It's here when Infinity Ward made a deal with Activision Blizzard to create a new game codenamed "MOH Killer", which later manifested as Call of Duty.</p>

<p>While Zampella's comment on the creation of Call of Duty is new, whisperings about the birth of CoD and EA's sudden decision to take Medal of Honor in-house have been circulating for years.</p>
<p><a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/publishing/the-medal-of-honor-killer-a-call-of-duty-story/">In a 2013 MCV article</a>, former Infinity Ward artist Justin Thomas (who worked on Medal of Honor: Allied Assault), stated: "After leaving 2015 we were working with a major publisher. For legal reasons I will say things didn't go as planned with it. We were left in a situation of unpaid milestones that were delivered and no finances to operate on.</p><p>"The company was potentially going to disband. In a last ditch effort our then president, Grant Collier sent out a signal to all the major publishers in the industry letting them know that the majority of the Medal of Honor: Allied Assault team was available. Within days of closing the doors on the studio, Activision responded immediately with an offer."</p>
<p>Fast forward decades later, and Zampella has found himself leading the charge with a new military shooter facing off against the Call of Duty series, in an interesting twist of fate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-ward-studio-heads-sacked">especially given Zampella was dramatically fired from Activision</a> back in 2010 due to claims of breach of contract and insubordination. Infinity Ward staff <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-told-infinity-ward-staff-to-take-the-money-and-get-over-it-after-west-and-zampella-firing">were then given a pay-rise, and told to "take the money and get over it"</a>.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 is proving to be a successful challenger to Call of Duty's throne right now, given the sheer popularity of the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-only-been-out-a-day-and-its-already-one-of-steams-biggest-games-ever">quickly becoming one of the most popular Steam launches of all time</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The year was 2013, Lumoise was the city, and roller skates were all the rage. When you weren’t taking time out to ride a Skiddo across town, battle in a café or try out this newfangled Mega Evolution, you were doing tricks on your roller skates. Those halcyon days are long behind us. Pokémon X&amp;Y are ancient, nobody roller skates anymore and Lumoise is not the city it once was. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, it is much, much larger.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition — Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZL4jOPorLQM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>An urban redevelopment mission is underway with one core goal in mind: to turn the city into a place Pokémon and people can truly share. And boy have they done a lot – both to the city and to the game.</p>


<p>After getting off the train in the capital of the France-like Kalos region, you quickly see what the city has become. Back in 2013, Lumoise was a little more than two ring roads, with 10 ‘spoke’ roads reaching from the central hub to the rim. The geography is much the same in 2025, but buildings aren’t so much obstacles as they are your new playground. Much like in Assassin’s Creed, (almost) every rooftop is in reach. As long as it’s outside, there’s (almost) nowhere you can’t go.</p>
<p>This is important because the entire game takes place within the confines of the city. That may seem hair-raising, considering the number of biomes and regions seen in typical Pokémon games, but it really isn’t an issue. A few dozen hours in, and you’re still exploring new rooftops, catching new Pokémon and heading to newly converted patches of turf that have been given over to wild Pokémon.</p>


<p>These Wild Zones, as they’re dubbed, are essentially self-contained biomes, zoned off using holotech that keeps ordinary citizens out and wild Pokémon within. You can go in and catch Pokémon using the cool new dynamic battle feature, or you can leave them be. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>This dynamic battle system is very cool, shifting this series from turn-based battles to real time, where you actively run around and dish out commands to your current Pokémon. Rather than using traditional PP (stamina), each move has a cooldown. Transitioning between Wild Zones and the rest of the city is seamless, and you use the same system of attacks no matter where you are — whether that’s using Rock Smash on a boulder or Water Gun on an enemy Pokémon.</p>

<p>The battle system is nothing new in the wider scheme of things. It’ll be pretty rote for anyone who has played World of Warcraft, for example, but it’s new for Pokémon which has historically stuck to its guns on 1v1 battle systems where you and your Pokémon stand rooted to the spot. It feels, in many ways, like the boss battles from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, but throwing moves instead of rocks.</p>
<p>But where things get <em>really</em> like Arceus is once night falls and the Battle Zones pop up. This is all part of the Z-A Royale — a letter-based ranking system to prove once and for all that you are, indeed, the very best, like no one ever was.</p>

<p>The Royale is a fun twist on traditional trainer battles, and as soon as you enter the zone, you’re fair game. Much like your Hisuian predecessors, this has you sneaking around like a ninja. The aim is to unleash an opening attack on a rival trainer and their Pokémon while literally crouching behind a bush, sign or bin. There’s none of this ‘When your eyes meet’ nonsense — this is brutal, all out backstabbery of the Pokémon kind. Not only is this fair game, but it’s actively encouraged by the app governing the tournament. You get missions to do this that give you bonus points. Get enough points and you can take on a Promotion Match to rank up.</p>
<p>Your opponents will tell you they’re taking part so that they can impose their own weird ideals and schemes on the city, like outlawing non-taxi based transport so they can monopolise urban mobility. But you’re an upstanding citizen (brutal backstabbery aside)! You’re in it to heal Lumoise, the city you only just arrived in!</p>
<p>Heal it from what, you might ask? Well, that newfangled Mega Evolution is no longer new. Everyone knows you hold a keystone, that your Pokémon holds a shiny marble that corresponds to their name and then you can unlock a form of temporary evolution that massively boosts their stats and gives them a cool new look.</p>

<p>What is new, and an emerging threat to this metropolis, is Rogue Mega Evolution. Certain Pokémon are evolving without the necessary stones, causing them a lot of pain and wreaking havoc. You have to end their pain by beating the tar out of them so they revert back to normal before they go on a rampage. It’s classic Pokémon logic.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s side missions! Pokémon fans are well known for being distracted by shiny things, and in this case, it’s missions given to you by the local detective agency – why would you do the main story stuff when you can cosplay as Detective Pikachu? There are dozens of these side missions scattered across the map at any given time, and they can be anything from a Pokémon-themed fetch quest to a battle request. They’re generally not difficult, but they offer some subtle guidance on type-based match-ups for newer players and unlocks new rooftops to explore.</p>

<p>But, wait, there’s even more! There’s parkour-based collectibles hidden around the city (Kalos gonna France), so you’ll be bounding around like some kind of Pokémon Ninja Warrior, there’s research quests to do and more. While you may not leave Lumoise, why would you want to when there’s so much to see, do, climb and catch?</p>
<p>Somewhat unsurprisingly, the Nintendo Switch 2 manages to take all of this in its stride, and the game plays admirably well in both handheld and docked modes. That’s to be expected, but as we were only able to test and review on the newer hardware, there does remain a question mark over the game on the original Switch hardware, given the long-standing performance struggles of Scarlet &amp; Violet in particular, which the Switch 2 patch was able to effortlessly brush aside.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159569/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>I honestly never thought I’d fall in love with <strong>Pokémon</strong> battles. That’s not why I play Pokémon – I don’t play competitively either – because I play a ton of RPGs where combat <em>is</em> the draw. I can get my fix elsewhere. But <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> may have done the impossible; in Kalos, I can’t wait to get into a fight.</p>
<p>Taking the basic framework for 2022’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a>, Z-A transplants the frictionless catching and larger environments to the streets of Lumiose City and switches things up by placing battles at the forefront, rather than the exploration. Arceus is one of my favourite Pokémon games ever, so I had concerns, but the shift here <em>mostly</em> works.</p>
<p>When a Pokémon spots me from a distance or I lock eyes with a trainer, no longer am I simply going for the same attacks, nor am I stressing about PP in a long Elite Four rush. Everything is real time with <strong>Xenoblade</strong>-style cooldowns and full movement to boot.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159573/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the best Pokémon battles have ever felt. Your Pokémon are no longer just static sprites and polygons with repetitive animations: they move in accordance with your own movements. And you have to use that to your advantage to both attack and avoid opponents.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I’m not <em>just</em> thinking about type match-ups (still important, of course) but attack distance, Pokémon speed, the battle space around me, and when to use each move. Totodile’s Bubble Beam can hit from a further distance than, say, Bite, but it has a longer charge-up time and it gives the opponent the chance to run away. Bite, however, might put Totodile in harm’s way. What if this Sandile has Absorb and gets it off as my little croc is running up to attack?</p>
<p>I’m even using attacks like Fire Spin and Toxic Spikes to set up traps and lure my opponent. These are all things that I know are used competitively, but I, even casually, feel like I have to utilise status effects and stat boosts and <em>everything else</em> in my Pokémon’s arsenal to win. And things can get particularly dicey when Alpha Pokémon get involved.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159571/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even Mega Evolution feels like it’s been massively improved, with snappy and dramatic transformations that in many story-focused battles are essentially mandatory. It’s beautiful to see the bones of the series’ combat be fully realised in this new system, and I’ll be sad to lose this system outside of Z-A.</p>
<p>Thankfully, as you can probably gather so far, there is a lot of that combat thanks to the Z-A Royale, which makes up one half of the game’s narrative progression. By day, Lumiose is a place for coffee and couture — and I must say, the fashion available is très chic — but by night, a battle zone opens up where trainers lurk and aim to duke it out and gain ranking points to reach the next promotional match. You can pick up Bonus Cards to help boost those rewards by fulfilling certain conditions, such as defeating foes with Plus Moves or putting them to sleep.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159576/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s another excuse to get into battle, which is absolutely a good thing. Especially as you progress through the game and higher-levelled trainers join the ranks. I never got bored sneaking into a new battle zone, picking up the nearest Bonus Card that fit my Pokémon team’s skillset, and then destroying a foe five levels above me with a crafty super-effective back attack. It’s extremely satisfying to pull off and frustrating when the trainer turns at the last minute to spot you, in a good way.</p>
<p>When you’re not spending time in the Z-A Royale, you’ll be helping Team MZ to quell the Rogue Mega Evolution threat popping up all over the city. These are basically the Frenzied Fights from Arceus, but much better. To me, they’re like MMORPG raid battles – watch the attack patterns, try to dodge, expose the ‘mons’ weaknesses, then Mega Evolve for some big damage numbers.</p>
<p>Because I was actually battling the Rogue Mega and not just running and throwing things, I felt engaged in these fights. They weren’t just an obstacle, but they helped me understand the importance of space and movement in combat. There were even times where I had to recall my Pokémon and hide behind an obstacle to avoid taking damage. It’s another layer of strategy that I wasn’t expecting from Pokémon that I really appreciate – even if those fights can get a little <em>too</em> chaotic and hard to track.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159568/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Something I hope Game Freak and The Pokémon Company can keep up on Switch 2 is smooth performance. I wish I wasn’t so shocked here, but they’ve managed it in Legends: Z-A. Running at a very consistent 60fps in both handheld and docked, with only a few slight dips in extremely busy, late-game battles and some fast menu cycling, it’s honestly a relief. Load times are also relatively snappy in both formats. I wasn't able to test out the Switch 1 version for review, so we'll have some thoughts on that post-launch, but on the newer console at least, it's a success. If only the visuals were as consistent.</p>
<p>I’ve showered a lot of praise on Legends: Z-A so far; the music is excellent, and I enjoy the abundance of fashion shops and customisation you have access to throughout the whole game. But as I said earlier, it <em>mostly</em> works. Unfortunately, there’s a big thing holding the whole game back from being truly brilliant: Lumiose City.</p>
<p>I will say, I’m pleasantly surprised at how dense this Kalos staple feels: it’s full of alleyways to get lost in and packed with life. There’s always a cafe or a boutique or even just a few market stalls tucked around the corner, places where people and Pokémon hang out. Scaffolding is stacked along the side of buildings, presenting some finicky platforming challenges and item rewards. Even on the rooftops, you’ll find Bird ‘mons fluttering around and trainers gathering and chatting.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159575/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But while I was wandering around the cobbles of Lumiose, I realised it all felt very compact. The city is essentially one big open zone, with a fair amount of verticality. But that means I’d run through and explored the entire place within about five hours. Sure, more Wild Zones unlock as you progress, bringing more Pokémon to catch. But it left very few surprises for the entire game.</p>
<p>I also wish it looked better, too. Lumiose has a few lovely sights here and there, but on the whole, Legends: Z-A appears lifeless. Arceus wasn’t a graphical showcase, but that watercolour-style aesthetic gave it a really unique feel. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/new_pokemon_snap">New Pokémon Snap</a> looks so much better and more vibrant than this. If clothes can swish around and hair flow through the wind, why can’t we have windows that aren’t just flat textures or shadows that don’t look like bleeding ink blotches on the floor? It's a little better docked, but not much.</p>
<p>I know this is controversial, too, but voices would help give this game character. I’m not even asking for full voice acting — though monologues and pre-rendered cutscenes feel utterly bizarre as just text on a screen — but I’d love a voice clip or two, along the lines of modern Zelda games. It’d also help give the story a little more <em>oomph</em>, which it needs when focusing on friendship, recovery, and forgiveness. Even with an explosive climax (which I urge you not to spoil yourself on), I felt... nothing.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159566/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those aforementioned Wild Zones might be my biggest disappointment with Z-A; admittedly, this is less about exploration and catching Pokémon than Legends: Arceus is, but it restricts that sense of discovery and magic that even the mainline ‘Gen’ games have. No longer am I walking out into a field and seeing Magikarp in the rivers and Bellsprout in the grass; instead, they’re constrained to tiny pockets of land, most of which are just little parks, boxed-off little streets, or construction sites.</p>
<p>What makes the Wild Zones stick out more is that there are actually plenty of Pokémon that <em>do</em> just wander around Lumiose: I spotted the Unova monkey trio just hanging around in trees at various times; Fletchlings and Pidgeys sit on roofs or lampposts and fly away when you approach; when it was raining, I found a Goomy sitting waiting for the nighttime drizzle to stop underneath a bridge. I still love catching these little creatures, so let’s give them the love they deserve. You can’t reasonably expect Pyroar to just prowl around the city streets, I get that, but sticking various 'pens' across the city doesn’t feel like the right solution.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159567/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The monster-catching aspect of the series does feel like it’s been relegated to the back seat a little; I’m glad Arceus’ catching system is back and still snappy, and you still have to put yourself in danger to “catch ‘em all”, but in revisiting Lumiose, in being restricted to this city and these zones, and in a Pokédex that lacks variety, it all starts to add up. The return of Mega Evolutions does help to alleviate that somewhat, but I really miss the sense of discovery I get from going to a new place or finding Pokémon in unexpected places.</p>
<p>Instead of feeling like a fresh new spin on the Legends formula, Legend: Z-A squeezes it into an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">X &amp; Y</a>-shaped sequel. In many ways, it’s more focused, but Z-A loses a lot of charm and the smaller environs don’t entice me to dig into every nook and cranny of the city. It’s so close to being a great Pokémon game thanks to that combat, which alone makes it worth picking up. But ultimately, it's just a good one.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A should be celebrated for its fabulous real-time combat and its largely smooth jump to the Switch 2, but in condensing things down to one single location, it loses part of the Pokémon magic that Arceus and many other entries managed to amplify.</p>
<p>I’ll forever find filling up my Pokédex fun, and for the Switch 2 generation, this is a good starting point for the franchise. But if the Legends series is to continue, it needs to recapture its personality and fuse that real-time system with a bit more freedom.</p></section>

              <p>If you’re after a solid everyday laptop that’s easy to carry around and does not cost you an arm and a leg, Lenovo Ideapads are an excellent choice to consider. Depending on the specs and model you’re after, you’d typically expect to spend over a thousand dollars on one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4756/">But right now, Amazon has slashed the price of the 15-inch Ideapad Slim 3 to $579, which is a huge 71% off its usual price.</a></p>
<p>You’re saving $1,420 on this powerhouse, but the deal is only around for a short time. Amazon has marked it as a limited-time offer, so it likely won’t stick around for long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4756/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brighter Visuals, Powerful Processor</h2>
<p>The Slim lineup essentially features sleek and light entry-level laptops that are designed for everyday use. This model gets you Intel’s 13th Gen Core i5-13420H processor that offers plenty of power for regular work, browsing, streaming, and even some light creativity. There’s a 16GB RAM to prevent frustrating slowdowns, plus 512GB SSD M.2 PCIe NVMe storage to save your entire multimedia library and programs without feeling cramped. Think thousands of photos, a wide range of documents, your favorite movies, and so much more. And since it’s SSD, you will also enjoy faster boot times to get on with the day without any delay.</p>
<p>The display is just a 15.3-inch screen with a 1920×1200 resolution for clear, detailed visuals. It’s bright enough to bring everything on the screen to life without that oversaturated feel.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sucker-punch-could-make-a-new-sly-cooper-or-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei.1324336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation has benefited from the mammoth exclusive launch of Ghost of Yotei—the follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima. Now, Sucker Punch is already looking ahead to a potential Sly Cooper or Infamous game as the next project.</p>



<p>Aside from 1999’s forgotten Rocket: Robot On Wheels, the American-based team known as Sucker Punch Studios got its career firmly on track with 2001’s Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus. This led to a further two Sly games (the fourth being handled by Sanzaru Games), before moving onto the inFamous franchise. 2009 to 2014 saw five separate inFamous experiences, and then it was time for Ghost of Tsushima. </p>



<p>Once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-best-games-like-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a>‘s Legends multiplayer update has been added, Sucker Punch is weighing up what to do next.</p>



<h2 id="h-going-back-to-sly-a-serious-possibility-for-sucker-punch-studios">“Going Back To Sly” A Serious Possibility For Sucker Punch Studios</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The next samurai story might have to wait. Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/ghost-of-yotei-sucker-punch-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, Sucker Punch studio head and co-founder Brian Fleming said: “Whatever we do next, whether it’s continuing Ghost or going back to Sly, the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time”.</p>



<p>Fleming indicates that despite the studio’s size, it can’t do more than one project at a time.</p>



<p>This follows an interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/07/17/ghost-of-yotei-directors-share-philosophy-on-balancing-freedom-with-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameInformer</a>, where Ghost of Yotei co-creative director Nate Fox said he “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-director-love-to-work-more-infamous/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Would love Sucker Punch to work on more InFamous</a>.” Again, whatever the company decides, it will likely be the only piece of media the studio develops for a few years.</p>



<p>Sucker Punch Productions has steadily become one of the most prolific and premium game studios in the world. You never hear bad words or controversy about it, and the company goes about its business creating one incredible game after another. With the main bulk of Ghost of Yotei’s development complete—aside from post-launch content—the future could be interesting.</p>



<p>What do you think? Will Sucker Punch listen to the old-school fans crying out for a new Sly or inFamous game? Is a new ‘Ghost’ game to make a trilogy a given? More importantly, what do you want to see from the incredible studio?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Open world is now almost a cliché statement."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The lead designer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim"><u>Skyrim</u></a> is "eternally shocked" at not just the RPG's success, but its enduring appeal, suggesting it's the game's open world and "quirkiness" that keeps players coming back 14 years after its debut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skyrim released way back in 2011. An open-world RPG, it puts players on the precipice of determining the future of Skyrim as the Empire waits for the prophesied Dragonborn to come, a hero born with the power of The Voice, and the only one who can stand among the dragons. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-review"><u>IGN's Skyrim review returned a 9.5/10.</u></a> We called it "a rare kind of intensely personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking on the <a href="https://linktr.ee/frvrpodcast" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>FRVR Podcast</u></a>, lead designer Bruce Nesmith offered his thoughts on why so many people continue to play and enjoy Skyrim so many years later. "I think Skyrim did the open world in a way that nobody had ever done before and very few people have really tried to do since," he said, adding: "By all rights, a year later, some other game should have eclipsed it. And then two years later, three years later, five, 10. It’s like ‘what the hell is going on here?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Todd [Howard, Bethesda boss] would even go to these meetings and show us information, which I can’t give you the details of, about how many people are playing it. It’s like, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me?’ Seriously, still, 10 years later."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploring the game's legacy and lasting community, he added: "I think Skyrim did the open world in a way that nobody had ever done before and very few people have really tried to do since. And one of those things that we accepted, which a lot of developers struggle to accept, is that this means you’re going to have quirkiness. You’re going to have weird stuff happen. And if you say that’s okay, you can get this diamond."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly then, Nesmith believes that if a developer tries to "smooth everything out" to prevent that aforementioned "weird stuff," "you’re going to lose some of that magic" that makes some games so special.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And we didn’t make that as a conscious decision," he added. "It just sort of happened. You know, we kind of prioritize functionally and 'well, okay, that bug’s acceptable. This behaviour is less than ideal, but we can live with it because look what we’re getting over here.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We didn’t put anything off limits. We didn’t try to manage the experience. We let it be <em>your</em> experience, it was a player-driven experience. And very, very few games have mastered that because open world is now almost a cliché statement... ‘Oh yeah, we have open world.’"</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda is of course working on its hotly anticipated Skyrim follow-up, The Elder Scrolls 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield boss Vince Zampella has said that Activision's best-selling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty</a> franchise only exists "because EA were dicks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an eye-opening but typically frank statement from Zampella, who is of course now an EA employee himself once again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over his career, Zampella has ping-ponged between rival publishers EA and Activision, working first on EA's Medal of Honor series, then founding Infinity Ward and helping create Call of Duty — specifically so it could be Activision's Medal of Honor "killer" — before returning back to EA after helping create Titanfall and Apex Legends at Respawn.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks," Zampella told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, reflecting on his career. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zampella initially worked on EA's Medal of Honor franchise from 1999 to 2002, and served as lead designer on the celebrated Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. After this, Zampella co-founded his own studio, Infinity Ward, with initial plans to continue working on Medal of Honor left up in the air when EA decided to take development of its franchise in-house. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For legal reasons I will say things didn't go as planned with it," former Infinity Ward artist Justin Thomas previously revealed of the situation in an <a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/publishing/the-medal-of-honor-killer-a-call-of-duty-story/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MCV</a> interview, back in 2013. "We were left in a situation of unpaid milestones that were delivered and no finances to operate on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was at this point that Activision answered a last-ditch call by Infinity Ward, intrigued by the potential of working with the team behind Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, and driven by the idea of creating a new franchise that could topple EA's own. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6: Single-Player Campaign Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest, as they say, is history. Call of Duty became a behemoth, though Activision and Zampella parted ways following the launch of 2009's Modern Warfare 2, prompting a bitter legal feud over unpaid bonuses and royalties that dragged on for years (until Zampella ultimately earned a sizable payout). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That situation then led to Zampella co-founding Titanfall and Apex Legends developer Respawn, which EA partnered with then ultimately acquired. Zampella was then repeatedly promoted to look after more of EA's gaming portfolio, ultimately becoming boss of the embattled Battlefield franchise, turning its fortunes around to deliver this month's successful release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GQ's interview also includes a snippet on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/10/call-of-duty-elite-enlists-hollywood-talent">now-distant plans for Alien director Ridley Scott to direct a Call of Duty movie</a>, something which ultimately never came to pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ridley Scott came in one time – who's a hero of mine – but he's not connected to games, so he'd ask these questions like, ‘How do you script what happens?’" Zampella recalled. "There was a bit of a talk around him doing a Call of Duty film, but we never really took it seriously. Video game movies at that point were never really that good."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched last week and earned EA its best-ever game launch on Steam, beating that of Apex Legends.

It’s up to you to upgrade and specialize any survivor you find in the wasteland any way you see fit.</li><li><strong>Explore, Loot, and Capture</strong> – While most of the buildings of the Dust Bowl are long abandoned and taken over by the undead, the loot and potential shelter is coveted by most survivors. During your exploration missions you’ll come across various farmsteads, factories and military installations full to the brim with monsters, loot, and most importantly, foundations that hold the potential to turn the long abandoned structures into sprawling and heavily fortified settlements.</li><li><strong>Your Own Safe <a title="Games > Haven [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/haven">Haven</a></strong> – With survivors from all over the wasteland pouring into your settlements for safety, it’s smart to keep them occupied.

                <p>Microsoft has released another ad for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-story-trailer/1100-6531213/" data-ref-id="1100-6531213">The Outer Worlds 2</a> featuring comedian and actor Ben Schwartz dropping in on a focus test group meeting for the upcoming RPG and making some odd suggestions.</p><p>"Before a sequel can be great, it must first be tested. Repeatedly, in front of a group of complete strangers," reads a line from the video's description.</p><p>Schwartz plays a character with the title "Head of Sequels." In the video, he offers up some strange ideas to help people understand and appreciate The Outer Worlds 2. One of his ideas is to bribe people to like the game. Another is firing t-shirts at them. This is all done under the idea that The Outer Worlds 2 has "big sequel energy." The video also features Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Good Place actor Marc Evan Jackson--take a look at it below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdby-WtK8bk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zdby-WtK8bk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Schwartz previously played his "Head of Sequels" character in an ad for The Outer Worlds 2 from Summer Game Fest earlier this year.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 launches on October 29 for $70, but people can pay $100 to buy the Premium edition five days earlier, beginning on October 24.</p><p>Microsoft was going to make The Outer Worlds 2 its first $80 game, but the company later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">reversed course and confirmed</a> that the game's standard edition would be $70. Anyone who preordered when The Outer Worlds 2 was $80 can get a refund.</p><p>When Microsoft initially announced $80 games, the company said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">the decision to charge more</a> was made "with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development." When the reversal back to $70 was announced, Microsoft said it was keen to keep The Outer Worlds 2--and its other holiday games--at a price that would be "in line with current market conditions."</p><p>Many theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> would also come to market at $80 this year, but it's not. While there are no price increases for buying games outright from Microsoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscription prices are going up significantly</a>, so playing The Outer Worlds 2, Black Ops 7, or any other new release from Microsoft via Game Pass is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playing-new-call-of-duty-games-on-game-pass-just-got-more-expensive/1100-6535141/" data-ref-id="1100-6535141">getting more expensive. </a></p>

The update is focused on bug fixes and controller-support improvements (especially on PC and Mac), while larger adjustments will likely come in the future. For instance, the patch notes do state that more controller fixes are on the way. Please do be aware that some of the adjustments could be considered spoilers.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1030300/announcements/detail/503964399479816738">On Steam</a>, the first change listed for Silksong version 1.0.28891 is the addition of DualSense Edge support, the premium PS5 wireless controller with mappable back buttons. Mac players are also receiving "improved support for various controllers," and Team Cherry has made it where Silksong will pause now when a controller is disconnected.</p>

			<p>Battlefield Studios, the collective name for the development teams working on Battlefield 6 (DICE, Ripple Effect Studios, Criterion Games, and Motive Studio), <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977809244906037359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that a few balancing tweaks were rolled out to the game without the need for players to download a patch.</p>



<p>You can find the changes below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased ticket count for some maps on the Rush game mode to the intended amount of 100 (up from 75).</li>



<li>Reduced the muzzle velocity of the M2010 ESR from 900 to 800 m/s</li>



<li>Reduced the muzzle velocity of the PSR from 750 to 720 m/s</li>



<li>Shotgun projectiles will now take drag into account.</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, this is just the beginning of the balancing effort. While the game launched in a solid state, leading to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/">concurrency records on Steam</a> and very positive reviews from critics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including ours</a>), the community has already requested other changes and the developers will have to continue monitoring the live service situation.</p>



<p>In other news, Reddit users have started <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o64hvu/cronus_zen_users_on_ps5_are_now_receiving/">reporting</a> that the developers' <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-dev-partnered-with-sony-microsoft-to-better-detect-cronus-zen-on-consoles/">partnership with Sony and Microsoft against the usage of Cronus Zen devices</a> for cheats is paying off. The first permabans have already been dealt, and indeed, the people behind the Cronus Zen have reportedly recommended avoiding using the device for now:</p>



<p><em>We're currently advising all Battlefield 6 players, especially those on PC using the Zen with any of our latest scripts, to pause usage for now. The team is actively testing to understand what's causing it and ensure everything remains safe and stable. Please avoid using the Zen in Battlefield 6 until we confirm it's fine to resume. We also ask that no one publicly shares or discusses any bans — this draws unnecessary attention to the community and makes testing more difficult. </em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy Might Not Be the Dissidia You Wanted]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy-might-not-be-the-dissidia-you-wanted.1324288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed&nbsp;<em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy</em>, a brand new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Dissidia&nbsp;</em>series of spinoff fighting games, but if you were hoping for a fully-fledged PC and console title, you're going to be disappointed.</p>

<p><em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>is intended for release on mobile devices sometime next year, and there's no mention in the debut trailer of a PC or console version for the game, so it sounds like it'll be the usual free-to-play procedure for this one.</p>

<p>In the new trailer's description, Square Enix describes&nbsp;<em>Duellum&nbsp;</em>as a "3v3 team boss battle arena" game in which you'll be taking part in "exhilarating, action-packed battles" to defeat bosses faster than an opposing team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy-3v3.jpg?itok=fU00VfcX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy-3v3.jpg?itok=l6OqV-Rl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>is a new mobile-oriented fighting game spinoff, and it's coming next year.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>will sport modern redesigns of classic&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>characters; Square Enix has already confirmed the likes of the Warrior of Light,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy IV</em>'s Kain Highwind, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VI</em>'s Terra Branford, among <a href="https://www.square-enix.com/ddff/en/character/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">many others</a>.</p>

<p>The redesigns are intended to slot into a story that takes place in modern Tokyo, wherein warriors known as "Ghosts" appear to do battle with strange monsters born from a crystal. That sounds like a pretty typical&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>plot if you ask me.</p>

<p>With that said, many of these characters' classic looks can also be seen, so perhaps you'll be able to choose from various different costumes. I'd be astounded if Square Enix didn't embed those costume changes in microtransactions or a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fortnites-battle-passes-how-did-they-take-over-gaming-industry" rel="nofollow">battle pass of some kind</a>.</p>

<p>The new game's <a href="https://www.square-enix.com/ddff/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a> promises "simple controls", so you should be able to jump into the action quickly. Gameplay revolves around accumulating Bravery by battling monsters, then unleashing that Bravery to deal big damage to bosses and secure the win.</p>




<p>This isn't the&nbsp;<em>Dissidia&nbsp;</em>franchise's first foray into mobile gaming; it's preceded by the RPG&nbsp;<em>Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dissidia-final-fantasy-opera-omnia-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">closed its servers for good last year</a>. Let's hope&nbsp;<em>Duellum&nbsp;</em>is a bit luckier.</p>

<p>If you want to get a chance to try out&nbsp;<em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy</em>, then you can sign up for the game's closed Android beta <a href="https://www.square-enix.com/ddff/en/cbt/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>&nbsp;(as long as you're in the US or Canada). It's due to take place between November 7th and 14th, and recruitment ends on October 28th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another huge&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>leak has revealed new information about what we can expect from the upcoming tenth generation of mainline games, as well as new projects in the works and more.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-suffers-major-leak-all-upcoming-titles-up-to-2030-leaked.1323781/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Atheerios</a> (as well as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1o5qz6r/gamefreaks_plans_up_to_2030_just_leaked/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">others</a> around the <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977869125147058256" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">web</a>), this leak, which appears to come from the same source as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-teraleak-online-co-op-battler" rel="nofollow">last year's so-called Teraleak</a>, reveals developer Game Freak's plans for the franchise through the next five years or so.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that this story will contain some spoilers for what's in the leak; we don't intend to reveal everything, but if you don't want to know anything about what's in store for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, you might want to avert your eyes. I won't be mad, I promise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-leak-2025-z-a.jpg?itok=W1poDr6i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-leak-2025-z-a.jpg?itok=jVA-wZ5L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A huge&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>leak has seemingly revealed what's coming next for the franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to Gen 10, the leak shows that the setting will be Southeast Asia-inspired, and that you'll not only be exploring a huge open world just like in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet" rel="nofollow"><em>Scarlet and Violet</em></a>, but delving beneath the waves to explore underwater as well.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the game will supposedly feature a system of procedurally-generated islands you'll be able to wander around as well, in addition to a new graphics engine. The leaks refer to this generation as&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Wind and Wave</em>, although that name is far from official, and it's apparently set for release next year on Switch 2.</p>

<p>According to the leaks, a game known as "Project Seed" is <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977803554770604239" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">also in development</a>, and it will apparently take the form of a multi-region&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>MMO in which you'll be able to travel seamlessly between the first four regions of the series (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh).</p>

<p>That's in addition to a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>series that will take place in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-sword-and-shield" rel="nofollow"><em>Sword and Shield</em></a>'s Galar region, so if you were hoping for that Unova&nbsp;<em>Legends&nbsp;</em>title, you're out of luck, it seems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-sword-and-shield-leak-2025.jpg?itok=qr4hYsP2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-sword-and-shield-leak-2025.jpg?itok=v6LiNxl- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Supposedly, a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>game set in the Galar region is being worked on at Game Freak.</figcaption></figure><p>It is worth noting that a lot of what's been reported in this leak could be inaccurate since it hasn't officially been announced. Not only that, but Nintendo and Game Freak could choose to kill the development of any of the projects that have been leaked, or alter their content significantly.</p>

<h2>This leak also reveals something about&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>budgets</h2>

<p>It's not just new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games the leak reveals, either. There's also <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1977787802646708402" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some information</a> about the kind of money Game Freak and Nintendo spend on&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, and if it's accurate, it could be very illuminating indeed.</p>

<p>According to the leaks,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">due to launch on Friday</a>, was made for a budget of around $13 million, while the upcoming tenth-generation games had $20 million allocated to them.</p>




<p>If those figures are to be believed, then we can assume&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>'s budgets weren't astronomically higher than the ones outlined above; if anything, the money spent on the last generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games may even have been lower.</p>

<p>That might go some way towards explaining why the games launched in such a messy state technically; $10-$20 million seems like a very low figure indeed for one of the highest-grossing media franchises in the world, even if we factor in extra money spent on the likes of marketing or publishing.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what comes of these leaks. If I know Nintendo, the company will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-subpoena-request-pokemon-teraleak-identity" rel="nofollow">vicious in pursuing the perpetrator</a>, and much of what's been revealed might be thrown out or altered significantly in response to the leak. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple products can come a little pricier then some of its peers. Though, most users find them worth it for their reliability, ease-of-use, or, in some cases, because you bought an iPhone 4s over a decade ago and now have just gotten too used to the Apple ecosystem to migrate out of it. No shame, I’m describing myself too. Apple stuff is simple, it does what we expect them to too, and it integrates easily with all our other Apple crap. That’s why its always nice to see when some of these iPhones, Macs, or AirPods get hit with a big discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4755/">Right now, Amazon has the Apple AirPods Max over-hear headphones on sale for 22% off</a>. Now, 22% may not sound like a lot at first, but that shakes out to a savings of $119. It brings the price down from $549 to just $430 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4755/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Apple AirPods Max are a stylish pair of over-the-ear headphones which are capable of high-fidelity audio thanks to the help of the H1 chip alongside Apple’s dynamic driver. These headphones are able to produce sound that can adjust itself in real-time to follow along with you. It does so by tracking your head position so it feels like you are in the pit at your favorite concert venue. And with support for Dolby Atmos, you’ll be hearing rich and detailed audio for certain songs, movies, or shows.</p>
<h2>Active Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Enjoy pro-level active noise cancelling when using the Apple AirPods Max so you can focus on only the sound you want to hear. Turn off the distracting noises coming from your environment, whether that’s a loud roar of a plane turbine or a chatty office of co-workers.</p>



<p>Battery life is reliable. The Apple AirPods Max will grant you with a solid 20 hours of listening time off of a single charge. That should be enough to get your through your flight or day at the office, no problem.</p>
<p>The limited time discount isn’t available with all color options unfortunately. If you were eyeing either the orange or starlight versions of Apple’s premium line of headphones, you’re in luck. Those are the two seeing the full $119 discount. The other color options are all still on sale, just not for as much. You can pick up the black or blue model of the Apple AirPods Max for $49 off at $500 even or the purple version for $20 off at $529.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket-year-one-anniversary-update-includes-huge-wonder-pick-buff.1324270/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s hard to believe it’s been a year since Pokémon TCG Pocket launched. The mobile-only card-collecting experience has been a great imitation of real-life buying, collecting, and trading, and Pocket is undergoing significant changes as part of its first anniversary.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-devs-plan-to-release-a-major-update-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> is a much cheaper alternative to collecting physical Pokémon cards. It has proven to be another money-making phenomenon, with regular updates adding new sets and features. While the community is still divided over Deluxe Pack ex, more updates are being prepared in the background.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-updating-trading-amp-wonder-picks">Pokémon TCG Pocket Updating Trading &amp; Wonder Picks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s first anniversary is set to bring three major changes and improvements: A new Share feature, an upgrade to Trading, and improved Wonder Picks.</p>



<p>Firstly, the new Share feature allows you to gift one of your friends a card between one and four-Diamond rarity once a day. A quick one-off gift that should allow you to fill any collection gaps much faster.</p>



<p>The second change is the range of tradeable cards you can choose from. Recent booster packs will now be eligible for trading, and you’re no longer restricted to the old-school rarity limits.</p>



<p>The game will allow you to trade the following rarities:</p>



<ul>
<li>One-Diamond</li>



<li>Two-Diamond</li>



<li>Three-Diamond</li>



<li>Four-Diamond</li>



<li>One-Star</li>



<li>Two-Star</li>



<li>One-Shiny</li>



<li>Two-Shiny</li>
</ul>



<p>Finally, the Wonder Pick mechanic is getting a decent overhaul. The only meaningful change since the game’s launch has been the Sneak Peek bonus that appears every now and again—and it doesn’t even activate that often.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Pocket</a> channel: “Cards from the latest expansion you have not obtained will appear more often,” and “The number of cards you currently own will be displayed on each card in Wonder Pick.”</p>



<p>The anniversary announcement doesn’t say when any of these features are dropping. We’ll have to wait and see on this.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s clear the team is listening to the fanbase. Do you think these changes address key areas of the game? Is there anything else that needs to be tweaked or added?
