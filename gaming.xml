<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 is a dream for many PlayStation owners. It’s been too long since Indy graced our screens in computer game form, and it feels like the right moment. Thankfully, we don’t need to go on a crusade to tell you the status of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s release schedule.</p>



<p>The iconic Indiana Jones jingle applies to almost any situation. Carry the shopping into your house in one go, play the jingle, beat a boss on a game, play the jingle, watch footage of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-you-play-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-full-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>—you get the idea. It’s fair to say Indiana Jones games haven’t gone down as well as the films, with releases such as The Emperor’s Tomb and Staff of Kings not living long in the memory.</p>



<p>It’s time for Indy to have a successful virtual outing—that isn’t a LEGO entry—and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 can be the one. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-coming-to-playstation-5">Is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Coming to PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Take that doubters! Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is definitely coming to PlayStation 5</strong>, despite initial doubts it would due to Microsoft’s ownership of Bethesda Softworks.</p>



<p>In September 2020, Microsoft famously purchased Bethesda in a shocking deal worth $7.5 billion. Microsoft effectively owned the rights to a ton of franchises in the blink of an eye: Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, DOOM, and Wolfenstein. Bethesda announced it was working on a new Indiana Jones game several months after the announcement—leaving PlayStation players in the dark over its release exclusivity.</p>



<p>An agreement was eventually released ensuring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is confirmed for PS5</a>. The slight caveat is the Xbox Series X|S and PC get first dibs for a few months, meaning, PS users need to channel some patience. So it’s not all Temple of Doom and gloom, and even the developer is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-developers-thrilled-game-is-coming-to-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thrilled the Great Circle is making its way to PS5</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-releasing-on-ps5">When is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Releasing on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>April 2025 is when Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is expected to release on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>The projected Great Circle launch window for PS5 comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge’s Tom Warren</a>, In a report, they said, “Sources familiar with Bethesda’s plans tell me the company has been targeting an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-an-april-2025-release-for-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2025 release for&nbsp;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;on PS5</a>, but this date could naturally shift depending on development schedules.”</p>



<p>Obviously, this wording means there could be some changes as we get closer to April 2025. Take the information with a grain of salt—although Tom is a very reliable reporter—in case Indiana Jones and the Great Circle doesn’t release in April 2025.</p>

<p>As a PS5 owner, I’m more than happy to see Indiana Jones and the Great Circle eventually come to the console. Do you think this is better for everyone involved? Let us know in the comments.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-return-of-steam-machines-valve-rolls-out-new-powered-by-steamos-branding/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Longtime Valve watchers likely remember <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/steam-machines/">Steam Machines</a>, the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">aborted</a>, pre-Steam Deck attempt at crafting a line of third-party gaming PC hardware based around <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/12/valve-first-version-of-steamos-to-be-released-to-the-masses-on-friday/">an early verison of its Linux-based SteamOS</a>. Now, there are strong signs that Valve is on the verge of launching a similar third-party hardware branding effort under the "Powered by SteamOS" label.</p>
<p>The newest sign of those plans come via <a href="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steam_brandGuidelines.pdf">newly updated branding guidelines</a> posted by Valve on Wednesday (as noticed by <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/compare/d54725a035de...41944930ea8a#diff-5daae83579359a756437d0a949cfce0a729a6857724a1740b2825f45fd0d9292">the trackers at SteamDB</a>). That update includes the first appearance of a new "Powered by SteamOS" logo intended "for hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve."</p>
<p>The document goes on to clarify that the new Powered by SteamOS logo "indicates that a hardware device will run the SteamOS and boot into SteamOS upon powering on the device." That's distinct from the licensed branding for merely "Steam Compatible" devices, which include "non-Valve input peripherals" that have been reviewed by Valve to work with Steam.</p>
<p>The new guidelines replace <a href="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/Steam_Guidelines_060222.pdf">an older set of branding guidelines</a>, last revised in late 2017, that included detailed instructions for how to use the old "Steam Machines" name and logo on third-party hardware. That branding has been functionally defunct for years, making Valve's apparent need to suddenly update it more than a little suspect.</p>

As a result, the game's hyper-realistic graphics are even more impressive.

They are both wondering if they just listen to music in bizarre ways, or if it’s everyone else who is wrong, actually. You be the judge. But also be nice.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4fd1451cf6dc477b050191ea9fee9a93" data-recommend-id="image://4fd1451cf6dc477b050191ea9fee9a93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1920" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Sabrina Carpenter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Sabrina Carpenter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Spotify</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fd1451cf6dc477b050191ea9fee9a93" data-recommend-id="image://4fd1451cf6dc477b050191ea9fee9a93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1920" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Sabrina Carpenter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/spotify-wrapped-minutes-listened-top-artists-1851059532&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/spotify-wrapped-minutes-listened-top-artists-1851059532">Spotify Wrapped</a></span>. At least, I do the moment I boot up the music-streaming app and see all the statistics and rankings encompassing a year of listening habits. It’s only when I start seeing other people’s Wrappeds that I feel like I might be slightly insane. I spend every 12 months wondering what I’m going to see in the mirror Spotify holds up at the end of the year, and my 2024 wasn’t particularly surprising in a vacuum. My most played song was Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” because I’m gay and have immaculate taste. Just how much have I listened to the tune since the <em>Short n’ Sweet </em>singer released it in April? 1582 times.</p><p>Friends, I realize that probably sounds excessive. Literally seconds after I posted about my Spotify Wrapped on social media, I was met with reactions from people gobsmacked by how many times I’d heard Carpenter singing about the Nintendo Switch (but not actually). Then, as I scrolled through other people’s Wrapped, I saw the majority of people’s most-played songs had only been played a couple dozen times over the course of 12 months. On top of that, my overall Spotify usage was in the six figures. I spent 129,053 minutes listening to music on Spotify, about three months of non-stop music in my ears. Once again, this dwarfed most people’s average play time, which landed around five figures or less.</p><p>These ridiculous statistics require some context. For one, I always have music playing if I’m not talking to someone, and even then, it’s probably playing in the background. That means while I’m writing for this here website, playing non-narrative games like <em>Overwatch 2</em>, or commuting through New York City, my Spotify is blasting something into my ears. Again, Spotify Wrapped reminds me not many people operate this way, and I simply don’t know how the rest of y’all are white-knuckling life without music. What am I supposed to do, listen to the sounds of NYC traffic jams?</p><p>But my total playtime is probably less surprising than the 1500 listens to “Espresso.” That can be explained by me listening to songs on repeat for hours on end. Sometimes I’ll listen to a song nonstop for a day or two, then move on to something else, then come back to that song for another stretch of relentless listening. The song of the moment is Coheed &amp; Cambria’s “Searching For Tomorrow,” which has had a few of these dedicated windows of repeat listening in the time since the prog rock band released it last month. Is there <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://medium.com/illumination/autism-music-on-repeat-1ac474e184f5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://medium.com/illumination/autism-music-on-repeat-1ac474e184f5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">possibly something undiagnosed</a></span> underneath there? Could be. But my music-listening habits have always been this way. When I was young, if I didn’t like a full album I’d spent money on, I’d probably have the songs I did like on a loop, and the rise of digital music and streaming services has only exacerbated this approach.</p><p>To be clear, this isn’t exclusively how I listen to music. But over the years, I’ve always sought out ways to listen to songs on repeat. When I used YouTube as a primary music source, I had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://listenonrepeat.com/?v=Y5WQ6gF-8vA#Wel_e_to_ListenOnRepeat_-_World_s_%231_YouTube_Looper&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://listenonrepeat.com/?v=Y5WQ6gF-8vA#Wel_e_to_ListenOnRepeat_-_World_s_%231_YouTube_Looper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">external websites open to play songs I was really vibing with on a loop</a></span>. I remember I stopped using Soundcloud as often when they made it impossible to find their repeat button for a brief window of time. Part of it is just my personality. I tend to hyperfixate. Growing up, I used to go see a movie that I enjoyed multiple times in theaters and replay games multiple times without getting tired of them. So it’s natural that tendency would bleed into how I listen to music as well. But part of it is this job. I start to attach certain feelings or games to specific songs or artists, and will listen to them on repeat so it keeps me in the right headspace. Music is so often an extension of my mood that a song landing in my most-listened-to playlist is as much a statement about how I felt that year as it is about the quality of the song.</p><p>“Espresso” was my go-to gym song for much of the year. Since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791">moving to NYC</a></span>, I finally made the jump to becoming a gym rat, and I tend to listen to a lot of pop girlies during my workouts because half the reason you go to the gym is to get more confident in how you look. So yeah, I listened to a sexy little pop song half the time because it got me in my groove. Couple that with the song being relatively short (just under three minutes) and it naturally ends up getting a couple dozen plays by the end of the workout. The same goes for Charli XCX and Billie Eilish’s “Guess” Remix. Nothing gets me more pumped for cable flys than a bumpin’ pop song. It’s the same effect metal or hip-hop has on the average straight dude.</p><p>But my top-played artists aren’t all pop girlies, though Sabrina, Charli, and Chappell Roan all ended up in my top five. Yes, yes, I know I’m gay, Spotify. Chill. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/coheed-and-cambria-deranged-joke-single-batman-arkham-1851463330&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/coheed-and-cambria-deranged-joke-single-batman-arkham-1851463330">Coheed &amp; Cambria’s “The Joke”</a></span> was my second-most-played song, though Spotify won’t give me a number on how many times it was played. It was the return of my favorite band, and the fact that they managed to end up in my top five artists this year on the back of three singles leading up to their new album next year is a testament to how many times those songs were spun. Jon Bellion, probably my favorite pop artist right now, hasn’t put out an album for six years, so his new, melancholy single about rediscovering his inner child, “Kid Again,” was on loop for several days as I wrung his soulful vocals out for every last drop.</p><p>Eventually, these songs do make their way out of the rotation, but I have been blessed with the uncanny ability to never truly tire of these songs. I remember friends in high school being frankly kind of shitty to me for being able to listen to songs on a loop in my headphones, as if that had any bearing on their lives. Looking back, it was probably less about them being subjected to a song non-stop than it was the idea that someone listened to music differently. I had earbuds in, what did it matter to them what they were playing?</p><p>Without context, my Spotify Wrapped usually looks insane every year. But looking back at the way I listen to music, I try not to read into it too much. I just know everyone who sees it in passing probably wonders how the hell someone can listen to a funky pop song about Not Coffee hundreds of times without wanting to tear their ears out. And to that I say: If you can’t still love a song after hearing it dozens, hundreds, or apparently thousands of times, that’s a skill issue. Sorry. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go put “Espresso” on for the 1583rd time.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="49bafe836badee97eb854631197a4950" data-recommend-id="image://49bafe836badee97eb854631197a4950" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1920" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Marble Sounds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Marble Sounds." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Spotify</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="49bafe836badee97eb854631197a4950" data-recommend-id="image://49bafe836badee97eb854631197a4950" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1920" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Marble Sounds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Looking at everyone else’s Spotify Wrapped makes me feel like I’m doing it wrong. (If I were being more honest, I’d say that it makes me feel like everyone else but me is doing it wrong, but I won’t admit to that.) As <em>Kotaku</em> writers shared their summaries of their most-listened-to songs from 2024 in our Slack, Kenneth reported that he’d listened to Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” some 1,582 times. My most played song—“Young Fathers” by Typhoon—had been streamed by me 17 times.</p><p>If you asked me to sing “Young Fathers” by Typhoon, I’d have genuinely replied, “Who?” I absolutely wouldn’t have known that was the name of the band, nor even the name of the track, but playing it back, I’m like, “Oh yeah, I really like how this sounds!” I’d added it to my Liked Songs playlist (currently 1,622 songs long) and I guess it came up 17 times over the year. I’ve no idea who Typhoon are, if they’re wonderful progressives championed by the youth, or some problematic bunch of old bastards only liked by actual Nazis. It’s just a song that made a nice noise, so I listened to it. (I’ve got it on right now, and it’s a great pop track, with a whole host of catchy riffs, but I’ve never paid attention to the lyrics.)</p><p>According to Spotify, I’ve listened to a total of 5,232 songs this year, by 1,992 different artists. And, apparently, this isn’t very normal? It kept telling me I was in the top 0.5 percent of various bands’ listenerships, which feels incredibly stalkerish, and confuses me even further given how infrequently I’d apparently streamed any single track. But it’s likely because of this width instead of depth that my top five artists included, in fifth place, Eels.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong—I love Eels. I loved them in 1996 with Beautiful Freak, a CD I recorded to cassette and then listened to on a loop on my Walkman during a summer spent mowing fields in a Scottish outdoor activity center. I loved Electro-Shock Blues (well, as much as that gut-punch of an album can be loved), and the incredible Daisies of the Galaxy in 2000, and Souljacker in 2002, and then…I drifted off. I hadn’t listened to them in 20 years! I spent a couple of days listening to a bunch of their more recent albums, stuck a few of the tracks on my Liked Songs list, and that was that. And apparently that made the band my fifth highest choice!</p><p>The rest of the top five isn’t as surprising to me, even if it reveals that I still just listen to what comic writer and former colleague Kieron Gillen always describes as “John Walker music.” (It’s a derogatory term.) In first place is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marblesounds.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marblesounds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marble Sounds</a></span>, and that makes perfect sense. The Belgian singer’s music is my “happy” place, something I put on when I need to feel the perpetual ennui of life reflected back to me in beautiful sounds. Second place is The Mountain Goats, and again, the only surprise is that it’s not first place. Alongside Nick Cave, John Darnielle is my favorite singer, and The Mountain Goats is the band I’ve seen live the most times. If I had to pick only one artist I was allowed to listen to, it’d be him or Cave, depending on the day. Third is Radical Face, and again, that’s a go-to artist for me (alongside another Ben Cooper vehicle, Electric President, with Alex Kane), since I discovered him in 2017 via the extraordinary video-EP, “SunnMoonnEclippse.”</p><p>But from then on, it’s a free-for-all. There are tracks I am convinced I listened to vastly more often than those listed in my top five songs, including whoever Typhoon are. Like French “electro-swing band” Caravan Palace’s incredible ditty “Miracle,” that despite being five years old I only heard for the first time this year via some TV show.</p><p>Also, I’m convinced I listened to A House’s 1994 track “Why Me” more than 17 times on the same day a couple of weeks ago. Although, at least the appearance of “A Wave Across A Bay” in second place for songs represents just how much I’ve listened to Frank Turner this year. If I’d had to guess, I’d have assumed it’d have been the deeply moving song about anxiety, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBwxy-JT7Pw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBwxy-JT7Pw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Haven’t Been Doing So Well,”</a></span> or his wonderful song “Miranda,” about restoring his broken relationship with his dad (the agreed term between them) after she came out as trans.</p><p>Also, where’s Busdriver? Where’s Aesop Rock? Where’s Nick Cave? Where’s Noname? And the rest of the artists I feel like I put on more often than others?</p><p>OK, I’m done just crowbarring in favorite songs to make you listen to them—I’ll get back to the point…</p><p>As tempting as it is to crown myself as Captain Iconoclastic, having found my own niche of middle-of-the-road middle-aged men to listen to, it leaves me feeling a bit alienated. My wife and son sing along to any song they hear in public, but they’re all new to me. When Kenneth shared his top five, I genuinely asked who Sabrina Carpenter is. It turns out I know the track “Espresso,” and have deliberately listened to it a few times as it’s a great piece of pop, but I had no idea who sang it—even though I remember her lackluster performance of it on SNL.</p><p>When I was younger, I’d have taken dumb pride in this. Ooh, look at me, I don’t even know the big pop hits, aren’t I so <em>very interesting</em>. But as I get dangerously close to 50, I realize that, no, I’m just missing out. Admittedly, this is in large part driven by my wife and son endlessly repeating the same bloody Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan songs, which might be perfectly fantastic, but I’ve involuntarily heard them so many times they’ve become like sandpaper on my brain.</p><p>And I guess it’s that last part that traps me in my weird situation: I don’t want to hear the same song a billion times. Kenneth listened to “Espresso” 1,500 times in a year. That sounds like a punishment to me, and as I already said, I think it’s a great track! But damn, 30 times and I’d not want to listen to it again for a good few years. I want something brand new more than I want an old familiar. As soon as something is broadly popular, I hear it even when I don’t want to, and I begin to resent it. It’s <em>imposed</em> on me. It’s fair to say that with 272 monthly listeners on Spotify, another regular favorite, Trouble Books, aren’t going to be played when I go into the department store. (Listen to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58RFslkOLjQ&amp;pp=ygUYdHJvdWJsZSBib29rcyBncmF2ZWwgcGl0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58RFslkOLjQ&amp;pp=ygUYdHJvdWJsZSBib29rcyBncmF2ZWwgcGl0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Gravel Pit”</a></span> right now, you bastards.)</p><p>So am I the weirdo? Or is it Kenneth? I like to assume that it’s probably both of us, given we felt so compelled to worry about it that we wrote this article.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-the-hero-building-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible is a comic famed for its unusually high levels of gore and character mortality. Back in 2021 it got an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/invincible">animated TV treatment</a>, expanding its fan base considerably and opening the door to other spin off products such as this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a>. In the show, the protagonists are teenagers, struggling to learn how to use their powers to defend the world after a massacre of older, more experienced superheros. So here, you get to create them from the ground up in Invincible: The Hero-Building Game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What’s in the Box</h2><div catalogid="cf173c02-dce9-4297-8045-212cb71eef3c" id="209856"><div id="209856" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Invincible: The Hero-Building Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it’s very much a board game, Invincible: The Hero-Building Game doesn’t have much of a board. Instead of anything fold-out, there are three separate boards that sit next to one another, representing three different areas of wherever the scenario you’re playing takes place. Each has spaces for heroes, villains, minions and civilians. They’re very basic, presumably so that they work as whatever location you’re supposed to be in, but they’re perfectly functional.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assuming you like the style of the original Invincible comic, the remainder of the components are much more engaging. There are standees for the four playable heroes, plus Omni-man, lots of civilian and minion tokens, and multiple decks of cards for things like events, villains and hero powers, all resplendent with licensed comic art from Invincible, although the typography on the cards is a little gauche.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from various cardboard and wooden markers, the other components are related directly to the playable heroes and scenarios, with a tracking board for each of these, again festooned in relevant comic art. With all those panels assembled together on the tabletop, your play area begins to look like a comic book in and of itself.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather than a point-by-point rulebook, Invincible: The Hero-Building Game walks you through the introductory scenario step by step, and then has an addendum for more advanced rules. This is a divisive approach, but it works well here, allowing you to get into the basics of the game with a minimum of fuss. Everyone picks a hero from the available roster of Invincible, Atom Eve, Rex Splode and Robot, seeds a bag with a variety of colored cubes, and dives in, working together to save the globe from an alien invasion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three board areas, each one of which has spaces for heroes, villains and a mass of innocent bystanders, who fluctuate between safe and dangerous zones. On your turn you’ll start by drawing three cubes from your bag and assigning them to your hero powers, allowing you to do things like move, attack, or rescue civilians. Colored cubes have to be assigned to matching color powers: yellow is fighting, for instance, while blue tends to be more about rescue and recovery. Black cubes are wild and can be assigned anywhere, but there’s a catch: you can keep drawing and assigning cubes as long as you like, but if you get more than four black cubes, you’re exhausted and out of the round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve seen this kind of push-your-luck bag-drawing before in games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg-buyers-guide">Quacks of Quedlinburg</a>, and it’s really fun. By allowing players to control their own risk, it offers a neat balance of excitement and strategy. But it’s particularly good here because most hero powers require more than one cube to activate, meaning you’ve got to be incredibly careful about your priorities. If you really, really want to attack this round, it’s tempting to throw black cubes into your yellow powers, but then yellow cubes drawn are less useful. And on the flip side, if you haven’t quite filled and activated a power when you close in on that five-cube limit, those you’ve assigned will be wasted unless you risk another draw.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s superpowered swings and roundabouts and the right choice is situational, depending on whether you’re on the verge of taking out an enemy, or suffering a catastrophic number of civilian deaths. Running it close to the line when there’s a critical outcome on the line is hugely exciting and, as a bonus, it alleviates the common pitfall of cooperative play where the most experienced player directs the others. It’s your turn, it’s your bag, and it’s up to you how risky you want to play it, then down to fate whether you’ll live up to your character’s heroics or blow it for the whole team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After all the players have finished drawing cubes and taking actions, it’s on to the training phase. You’ll each have a hand of five cards representing potential superpowers your teenage hero might learn to manifest. Orange cubes drawn during your turn can be assigned to confidence, which is essentially a currency you can use to buy these cards. This adds a whole new layer of strategy to proceedings as you look for combos between your starting powers, those in your hand and the cubes in your bag, a multi-way mash-up of bag-building and tableau building from an enormous deck of powers, for a colossal amount of variety and strategic flex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As fun as this is, it does leave some thematic question marks hanging over the game. While the heroes do grapple with learning their powers in the comic, the idea that it’s a revolving door of different abilities they can try on for size and discard feels like a stretch too far. Similarly, while each hero starts with a signature purple power keyed to their abilities – Rex Splode can damage all enemies in the vicinity with an explosion, for example – there’s nothing to stop you choosing a roster of entirely unrelated powers to go along with it. You could make Rex, who is selfish and reckless in the source material, a caring, sharing support character with lots of healing and buff powers if you so wish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible: The Hero Building Game earns back some thematic brownie points in the villain phase. Here, you draw an event card that has different instructions for villains and their minions, which will see them damaging heroes, killing civilians and using special powers, at least until such time as you do enough damage to them to get them off the board. You may also get a boost from some outside help, or include optional challenges like having to zap back and meet shifts at work to make things even tougher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each scenario has a selection of randomly drawn and scenario-specific enemies that enter play as the game progresses, as well as some thematic special rules. The whole package gives each scenario plenty of thematic heft as well as variety for replay value. In the second scenario, for instance, you’ll face the annoying Doc Seismic, who won’t enter play until the final round, giving you limited time to defeat him. And in the meantime, you’ll have to watch out for him accumulating damage to Mount Rushmore, which will lose you the game if it takes too much. Other ways you can lose include an excessive civilian death toll, or too many hero knock-outs from enemy damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To try and avoid this fate, you’ve always got the option to fly back to HQ and rest up, recovering some health and your defiance token, a handy option that lets you re-draw cubes if you don’t like what you pulled. However, doing so takes you away from the frontline, so this is very much robbing Peter to pay Paul, as while you’re away, your team-mates and civilians will be left to face the punishment. But this is typical of the game, which does a great job of keeping the tension high and making you feel like you’re stretched too thin, walking a strategic knife-edge between victory and defeat. And this matches the tone of the comic, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XGoe?object_uuid=b8a983c9-a9b2-4db4-b179-108341944395&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVpj4?object_uuid=b8a983c9-a9b2-4db4-b179-108341944395&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Dire Wolf</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 5, 2024 3:51 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Whatever your feelings on the source material, Invincible: The Hero-Building Game is a cut above its cooperative peers in the board gaming world. Despite a few thematic and presentational miss-steps, it generates a fitting emergent narrative for the comics that it’s based on. Perhaps more importantly, it’s a compelling challenge, with lots of cool combos to dig for in your quest to save the world again and again, thanks to plenty of variety and optional difficulty tweaks. It even manages to encourage genuine cooperation as you work through tactical plans and bring them to the table, leaving the final risk up to the individual. It's an impressive package, which deserves to build its own heroic niche in the wider world of comic book board games.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"Players can switch between Season Passes at any time to proceed along the Season Pass track of your choice and obtain items from past seasons. This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this isn't as disastrous a move as a full shutdown which other triple-A live service games have suffered recently, the removal of seasons certainly doesn't bode well for the future of Foamstars. Square Enix only released the game in February, meaning the dedicated live service support that was seasons will come to end less than one year after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Foamstars debuted to a middling reception and Square Enix seemingly hasn't been able to turn interest around. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/foamstars-review">It earned a 6/10 in IGN's review</a>, in which we said: "Foamstars' combat mechanics are unexpectedly engaging, but confounding time-gated modes and aggressive monetization make them harder to enjoy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Live service games such as Foamstars have had a rough year, with many falling to reach high levels of engagement. The model is so attractive to publishers as, instead of just making a single payment to buy a game, players are given a continuous stream of purchasing options such as battle passes, season passes, and other microtransactions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A live service boom of sorts has occurred in the video game industry as a result of incredibly successful games such as Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys, but many publishers have seemingly fallen short by looking to capitalize immediately instead of building up a dedicated audience first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Foamstars may be included in this list, though others such as Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League have also fallen flat. The most infamous live service game of the year, however, and perhaps ever, is in PlayStation hero shooter Concord.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It debuted to a tragic 697 peak concurrent players on Steam, a number that made the 12,786 players of the aforementioned Suicide Squad, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue">was dubbed a disappointment by Warner Bros.

Archers and Axe Throwers have received some significant changes to their upgrades, which are now faster to research, deal more damage, and cost less gold and (in most cases) lumber to learn. Paladins have received some slight buffs, as have Death Knights.</p><p dir="ltr">One huge change players seem happy with is a nerf to the Ogre Mage's Bloodlust ability, long regarded as overpowered for those playing as the Horde and an ability without a good Alliance alternative. The ability doubles the damage and piercing damage of a selected unit for a set duration, allowing Bloodlusted units to cut through even heavily armored foes with ease.</p><p dir="ltr">Post-patch 1.0.1, Bloodlust has had its duration decreased, its mana cost increased, and had its double-damage buff applied after armor reduction instead of before.

I wasn't able to find an exact date for when 2.02 released, but given the Battle.net version of Warcraft 2's October 1999 release, it likely came a few months later or sometime in 2000.

The game entered early access on Steam on July 15, 2015, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/333640?emclan=103582791436993571&amp;emgid=4542535021350562775" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Freehold Games stated that it had actually been 15 years</a> since development started.</p><p>The 1.0 version of Caves of Qud launches with the Dromad deluxe edition, as well as a tutorial and the last story quest with multiple endings. The Dromad deluxe edition includes some new features, including an enhanced soundtrack and the Pets of Harvest Dawn DLC pack that unlocks some in-game pets at the start of the game. For those who already own Caves of Qud, the soundtrack and the DLC pack can be purchased separately.</p><p>Unfortunately, save files prior to 1.0 will not be compatible with the full version of the game. However, players can continue playing their old saves on the 208.x legacy branch, which can be switched to from the Betas menu in Steam.</p><p>Caves of Qud will cost $30, but there's a 15% launch discount until December 12. Freehold Games is also holding a speedrunning contest for streamers today to celebrate the launch. Those who can beat the game as quickly as possible will be able to win Caves of Quid prize packs.</p><p>Freehold Games also said that it plans to keep supporting Caves of Qud with post-launch content after the release of 1.0, and will share those details in a future update.</p>

                <p>One of the year's most highly anticipated games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-collectors-edition-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6524003/" data-ref-id="1100-6524003">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, gets early access tonight at 4 PM PT / 7 PM ET for those who bought the Premium or Collector's Edition, but some players got their hands on an earlier release. Leaked gameplay first appeared on YouTube on Thursday, showing the game’s first three hours.</p><p>Even though the video, posted by YouTuber Lone Viking, was eventually taken down by ZeniMax, some of the game's plot points were revealed. Lone Viking said that he purchased the game from a local store, where he paid $80-$100 to get it three days early for the game's basic release on December 8. Official review embargos are expected to lift later today at 4 PM PT / 7 PM ET, the same time as the early access.</p><p>What we do know from the game is that Indy has split from his on-and-off-again companion, Marion Ravenwood, and finds himself on the trail of a great conspiracy that leads him through the Vatican, the Sukhothai temples in Thailand, the Egyptian pyramids, Shanghai, and the icy Himalayas.</p><p>Game Pass users can upgrade to the Premium Edition for $35 (or $100 for those buying the full game without Game Pass) to play early and score a few bonuses like a Temple of Doom outfit and a future story DLC, the Order of the Giants. PlayStation owners will have to wait a bit longer to punch Nazis and seek treasure as the game isn't headed to the console until Spring 2025.

My first “Bass Monkey” postmortem was more of a Beginner’s/technical guide, and this “Humble Bee” postmortem is more like a continuation of that journey, but mostly sharing psychological lessons about staying sane with this continuing Game Dev habit.

Right? I mean, Van Gogh’s art was considered worthless while he was alive. He wasn’t fully appreciated for his work until AFTER HE DIED. And the dude painted like 2,100 artworks over his lifetime. I’m not saying that nobody will appreciate your work until you’re dead. But c’mon. You’ve got to put your hypothetical </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uB5PUpGzeY">10,000 hours of deliberate practice in</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> before </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/309485-nobody-tells-this-to-people-who-are-beginners-i-wish">making some good stuff</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I feel like people (myself included) routinely expect to make their first game(s) and have it reach critical acclaim, making them rich and famous in the process. But that’s just not how it works. I feel like expecting that is a road to insanity. It’s simple (but hard). We make games that we like and share it with people that we like; rinse and repeat. And over time, we improve our skills! I don’t think there’s anything wrong with toiling away in quiet obscurity for a time. In fact, it might be beneficial: you can best hear your own voice in the silence, after all. For every Eric Borone that made Stardew Valley for his first commercial game (though, I believe even HE had to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-k6j9g5Hzk">re-draw his art assets several times over the span of 4.5 years</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), you have developers like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Cawthon#Works">Scott Cawthon who made like 70 games before hitting it big with Five Nights at Freddy’s</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

But throughout the last 2 years, I lost my way. I don’t know what it is (sunk cost fallacy?), but the longer you work on a skill (and the better you get at it), you really start to hope that you can make some money off your passion, turning it into a “side-hustle”. I started measuring my success based on my quantity of Steam “Wishlists” and how much money I might make from the eventual release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My first game, Bass Monkey, was totally free, but I’m still selling Humble Bee for a few bucks. I think I’ve got my head back on straight, but it’s important for me to remind myself that the joy is in the work, NOT THE RESULTS. I mean, recall a time when you had a dream (eg, making your first video game, graduating from school, etc.) that you FINALLY achieved after years of toil. Remember how amazing that achievement felt, FOR ALL OF 5 SECONDS? Humans are wired to WORK. We reach the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/history-of-happiness/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/#:~:text=Mihaly%20Csikszentmihalyi%20discovered%20that%20people,which%20involves%20their%20creative%20abilities.">flow state (ie, have fun),</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> while concentrating on a task at just the right balance between frustration and boredom. Happiness actually, counterintuitively, happens when WORKING TOWARDS a goal, rather than ACHIEVING the goal itself. It’s kinda messed up, but happiness isn’t something you can ATTAIN; it’s something you EXPRESS. So, enjoy the work and express the joy. Release games and the achievements will come with due time.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="It’s worth finishing what you start"><span>It’s worth finishing what you start</span></h2><p>Against all odds, you gotta finish</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finishing this game was really hard. I’m not gonna lie. I don’t know, but 2 years is a long time to work on a project alone (I don’t know how some solo developers go for longer in isolation…) Even though in my last post-mortem I proposed that you should TRIPLE your original timeline estimate. I didn’t heed my own advice. I got “scope-creep”. And indeed, a 9-month project once again ended up taking three times longer than expected (27 months!) It’s hard, and after many “dark nights of the soul” and working on Game Dev every single day (for 10 min to 2 hours per day), eventually the game gets done. Aim high, my friends, but check out these resources to identify your blind spots and get some motivation to work towards being a “finisher”:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, I want to finish off with one technical section, which is more “nitty gritty”:</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Technical lessons learned">Technical lessons learned</h2><p>In the end, it doesn’t really matter HOW you made it, just THAT you made it</p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Programming: I used the Gamemaker engine (and its C-based language, [GML]) developing “The Last Humble Bee”. I talked about this in my last postmortem, and I do think that it’s a solid language/engine to start making games quickly. But for this largish-scope 2.5D game (where I had to learn to program all of the jumping physics, collisions, and rendering pipeline to achieve the 3D-ish effect), making the thing just got super unwieldy. Further, since there’s no real official “asset store” to help save time, I can’t seem to find a way around re-inventing the wheel with each game. Next time I’ll be using Unity to make a full-blown 3D game (I’ve tried Godot, Unreal, and Unity over the last several months as a learning experience, which is maybe a post for another time), because I think the unity asset store is an unparalleled time-saver. But any of the options I listed above have much more “built-in” functionality right out of the box for games with more than 2 dimensions. I will probably still come back to Gamemaker for pure 2D games, but I’ll be trying something new with the next game.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Art: Most of the art in The Last Humble Bee came from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://itch.io/">io</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, purchasing and altering asset packs with a CC0 license from talented pixel artists. After hand-pixelling everything in Bass Monkey myself, buying assets was a humongous time-saver. I would recommend going this route if you’re not an artist first and foremost. It’s better to spend your time on other strengths and just buy and tweak art assets (if you can afford it).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Music: I made the music myself. Music is why I got into game development in the first place! I used some sampled bumble bee sounds. Played my bass and guitar over some drum loops. Good times. Love this part of development. Though, there’s a lot of time to be saved by licensing music if you’re not a musician. And a lot of talented musicians out there that would be happy to license their music to you.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Marketing: OK maybe this is a hot take, but I am now CONVINCED that 90% of game marketing is simply having a memetic game idea (ie, contagious, unique, remarkable) that people see a gif for 5 seconds and it just </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WezMZrk32M4">HAS THAT MAGIC</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

            <p>
One of my favourite anime shows is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlrPO6dBaxw">Sakura Quest</a>. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed "Queen" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.
</p>
<p>
I'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old "danchi" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

<p>
Hoshino needs to persuade 100 residents to attend the festival by gathering clues about their "quirks and desires". Some of these clues are found online, care of a gorgeous Y2K web browser that harbours a few minigames. Others must be uncovered using Hoshino's low-key Sherlockian capabilities. "A tossed-aside cigarette butt tells a story, and the fragrant scent of trees hides the sneaky presence of a mosquito," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3107530/Danchi_Days/">the Steam page comments</a>. Confound you, trees! When the day of the festival comes, we will chop you down for firewood. Providing we get permission from the council.
</p><p>
Danchi Days takes inspiration from auld Japanese console delights like Earthbound and Moon Remix RPG, but it's also semi-autobiographical - based on developers sandy powder and Melos Han-Tani's experience of living in a real-life danchi, with art from illustrator mogumu. It's being published by Analgesic Productions, whose other works include the amazing and perpetually overlooked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anodyne">Anodyne</a> games. I'm hoping the new game's apartment block doesn't harbour anything like Anodyne 2's desertNPC.

<p>
Keen? It's not out for a while - sometime in 2026. In the meantime, you can catch up on Sakura Quest. Don't miss the multiple episode arc about the fight to extend the local bus route.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/jake-paul-added-to-undisputed-boxing-roster/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Jake Paul is joining the Undisputed boxing roster. Developer Steel City Interactive announced on Thursday that Paul will be joining the game as part of The Problem Child DLC pack on December 12.</p>



<p>“Jake’s influence on modern boxing is undeniable. His meteoric rise has introduced a whole new generation to the sport, especially those who have followed him from a YouTube phenomenon to a legitimate boxing contender,” Founder and CEO of Steel City Interactive Ash Habib said via release.</p>







<p>“I’ve been breaking barriers and making history in real life, so it’s only fitting that I bring the same energy to Undisputed. This isn’t just about being in a video game; it’s about inspiring a new generation of fans to step into the ring—virtually and in real life,” Paul said.</p>



<p>To get Paul into Undisputed, the developers at Steel City Interactive did full motion capture at their UK-based studio. </p>



<p>“The Steel City team nailed every detail, from my moves to my swag, and I can’t wait for players to test their skills,” Paul said.</p>



<p>In addition to Paul, The Problem Child DLC pack will feature six more fighters, including: Zhilei Zhang, James ‘Buster’ Douglas, Otto Wallin, Erik Morales, Marco Antonio Barrera, &amp; Juan Manuel Marquez.</p>



<p>As of writing, no price for the DLC pack has been announced. As far as future additions go, Insider Gaming has heard of a few names the studio has had talks with that were either close to a deal or have signed a deal that hasn’t been announced yet. Paul was one of those names, and there are others that, while can’t be said yet, are pretty obvious fighters to be added in future DLC.</p>

He was hit by a truck and ultimately pulled under it as the driver kept going. "The Xbox in my backpack prevented me from hitting my head or worse, even dying. I wasn't gonna get shredded beneath the truck so I used my left leg to attempt to slow the truck," Brandon wrote.</p><p>"At this point my bike wedged my right leg so I couldn’t move it anywhere. Next thing I know my backpack was only hanging on by my left shoulder and was slammed into the curb along with me afterwards."</p><p>After this, Brandon said he felt the full weight of the front end of the truck begin to roll onto his ribs, going on to say he was dragged for about 12 feet. He was taken to the hospital and miraculously only had a single broken bone in his left foot, in addition to some road rash. Not only was Brandon mostly OK from the experience, but his Xbox didn't break either. He said it booted up normally and runs games despite the toll it took and the damage it sustained.</p><p>"If the Xbox wasn’t in my bag at the time a lot more could have happened…" he wrote.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/infinity-nikki">Infinity Nikki</a> - the cute and colourful dress up game with gacha elements - released earlier today, but was quickly hacked, with reports of players being met with a distressing and distasteful message.</p>
<p>Please note, there may be some upsetting content below. <strong>Please read on at your own discretion.</strong></p>

<p>As shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1h73ssp/infinity_nikki_site_got_hacked/">reddit</a> and social media platform X, the Infinity Nikki website briefly displayed an abusive message earlier this morning, which was being used to promote fellow gacha game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> (there is no evidence this message was posted by a member of the Genshin Impact community). </p><p>A QR was also displayed under the message, but for obvious reasons, Eurogamer has not tested to see where it leads. However, it appears the hacked page was for the official celebration event, which asks players to use a QR code to open a page on their phone.</p>

<p>A reddit moderator suggested the Infinity Nikki website was "compromised for roughly 30-40 minutes", but advises players proceed with caution until developer Infold makes an announcement regarding the site's status.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it appears that the Infinity Nikki servers are down for some. Our Zoe was looking to stream the game this afternoon, however she has been met with a maintenance notice.</p>
<p>"The server is not open yet," the message on Zoe's screen reads, stating maintenance will conclude in 2029 (which we hope is an error). Additionally, Infinity Nikki's announcement page isn't working for Zoe.</p>
<p>It is unclear if these server issues are related to this morning's hack. Eurogamer has reached out to the Infinity Nikki team for comment.</p>
<p>We recently awarded Infinity Nikki four out of five stars, with our Jessica saying it has the potential to give Genshin Impact a run for its money.</p>
<p>"It sure is nice see miHoYo have some proper competition for once, and I know I'll still be returning to Miraland whenever I'm in need of a mood boost, whether that be in the form of humming along to catchy tunes while Whimcycling my way towards hot air balloons, or laughing at the melodrama in future story updates," she wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-review">Eurogamer's Infinity Nikki review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

ChatGPT users will be able to access content from across Future’s portfolio, with attribution and links to the full original articles for transparency and further information.”</p><p>The post notes that this “partnership builds on Future’s existing deployment of OpenAI’s technology,” with chatbots currently on Tom’s Hardware and fashion site Who What Wear. I messed around with the Tom’s bot this morning, which does in fact cite the guides its information comes from. (For what it’s worth, asking the same question of ChatGPT itself did not return any sources.) This stands in some contrast to the experience<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/06/insider-union-chatgpt-hallucinating-links-business-insider-articles-openai-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Business Insider</a> had with its own OpenAI partnership, which failed to properly credit BI’s scoops.</p><p>You don’t need me to tell you that no good comes from feeding the work of writers into the ravenous maw of the plagiarism machine. This is yet another deal that serves OpenAI and the publishing companies it gets in bed with, while hurting the staffers and freelancers who actually <em>write</em> the words these companies need more and more of. While I can only hope <a href="https://aftermath.site/pc-gamer-games-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer’s headlines</a> confuse ChatGPT into some kind of meltdown, the more likely scenario is that we continue plodding along in this incredibly stupid and short-sighted way until the AI bubble bursts like so many tech bubbles before it. As AI’s capabilities <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/godot-isnt-making-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plateau</a>, even as OpenAI needs more and more <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-closes-66-billion-funding-haul-valuation-157-billion-with-investment-2024-10-02/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">money</a> and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/series/49/microsoft-three-mile-island-ai-nuclear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">power</a>, it leaves time for more outlets desperate for cash to make these deals, which will either fizzle out (the best-case scenario) or ultimately let companies replace actual writers and actual stories with <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-generated-content-internet-online-slop-spam.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slop</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, OpenAI is facing a lawsuit from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/11/29/canada-openai-lawsuit-cbc-postmedia-copyright/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian news publishers</a> in addition to the one it’s already facing from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>.

			<p>Mr. Robot has been cheating death for a decade now, ever since Don’t Die, Mr. Robot first launched on PS Vita, but now it’s time for his greatest challenge yet: not dying in three whole dimensions. Kind of. 3D Don’t Die Mr. Robot spruces up the 2014 indie classic with new visuals, but even with the change of perspective, it’s the same core gameplay that makes it as addictive as ever.</p>
<p><iframe title="3D Don't Die, Mr. Robot!  *Wishlist Trailer 2*" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8mDp4fUDbw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Mr Robot is stuck in the dimension of Neon Dunjun, tasked with collecting all sorts of fruit while avoiding enemies that pass across the stage in an attempt to destroy him. Mr Robot has no attacks of his own, but thankfully the fruit he’s collecting is actually explosive, blowing up and taking out any nearby enemies –&nbsp;he’s equally fortunate to personally be immune to these explosions, though just one touch from an enemy and it is lights out for him.</p>


<p>Different enemies have different movements that you need to work out. Some will fly in a straight line, while others come in a group and spread out across the level so you need to guide Mr Robot to stand in a gap between their paths, and yet more will home in on Mr. Robot, or pop in as a pair and fire a laser beam across the level. You need keep moving and adjusting your position, but will often find yourself getting cornered.</p>


<p>The main mode in 3D Don’t Die Mr Robot is Remix, giving you a sequence of levels to work through. Every level has a ranking system from bronze to platinum trophies, and once you unlock the platinum trophy the level ends. Getting that platinum at the start of Remix is easy enough, because the game is still introducing you to the different elements of it. The further you get, the tougher things become. There are levels where the platform is tiny and enemies are popping up with no way to close the gap on them with Mr Robot, so you must instead wait for fruits to appear and line up to create a chain of explosions to save him. Linking these chains together rewards you with lots of points, though points don’t always mean prizes. In some missions, you have to destroy a set number of enemies while in others you have to collect coins. As you meet each trophy tier in missions the number of enemies increases, as does their speed, testing your reactions as you go.</p>
<p>Outside of Remix mode, there is Arcade mode which is essentially a score mode where you try to survive as long as you possibly can to rack up those points. And with online leaderboards, you will want to keep chasing those scores. My personal favourite named mode is Lime Attack, which is a time attack mode which is green and the only fruit that appears is limes. Chill Out mode brings some coolness to 3D Don’t Die Mr Robot too, and rounds out the modes available. &nbsp;Collecting the coins in missions is not a pointless endeavour if you love accessorising. You can use the coins to unlock all sorts of accessories for Mr Robot, including hats, glasses, shoes and body colours.</p>

<p>What Infinite State Games has nailed with 3D Don’t Die Mr Robot is that feeling of chasing a high score, and doing better each time you go in. Every time I failed to hit Platinum in Remix mode, I would immediately replay that level over and over until I did get it… or the mission proved too tough for me, and I lowered my target to the Gold trophy.</p>
<p>One niggle I did find with the game was Mr Robot kind of getting stuck on corners in missions where the layout had some sharp corners or turns, which led to some runs ending quickly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-brings-new-jobs-to-star-wars-board-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new expansion is coming for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mandalorian-adventures-board-game-announced-by-asmodee-group" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Mandalorian: Adventures</em></a>. Unexpected Games' latest premium expansion, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> will add new game elements to the base game based on Season 2 of the popular streaming series.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to learn more about <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-mandalorian-adventures-review-is-this-way" rel="nofollow"><em>The Mandalorian: Adventures </em>you can check out our review </a>where we praised the thematic decks and new player experience</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> was designed by Unexpected Games' studio head Corey Konieczka, the same mind behind the original release. The expansion introduces four new characters, four locations, and a brand new mission book. The expansion is not a standalone experience and requires the base game.</p>

This season involves the titular Mandalorian Din Djarin attempting to reunite his companion Grogu with the nomadic Jedi Order, all while avoiding attacks and plots by the Imperial Moff Gideon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Season 2 of <em>The Mandalorian</em> included some of my favorite Star Wars™&nbsp;scenes in the last decade. It was a blast recreating these moments for the board game, and this expansion includes so much more. From Boba Fett and Ahsoka Tano to duels and dangerous cards, I can't wait for you to see all the new content.” said Konieczka.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to new characters and missions, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> introduces new enemy types, ongoing events, and a duel deck. These elements can be integrated into the base game, adding more replayability to the experience.</p>

In addition to this board game about helmeted bounty hunters there is the collectible card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-unlimited-shadows-of-galaxy-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em></a> and the skirmish miniatures game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/star-wars-shatterpoint-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> will be available in Summer 2025. It will be sold at an MSRP of $39.99.</p>

The expansion more than doubles the total number of patents that EA has opened up since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22638535/ea-accessibility-patent-pledge-apex-legends-ping-system">launching the pledge in 2021</a>, and includes generation and recognition tools for speech and audio.</p><p>“We believe that games should be accessible to everyone and our industry-leading teams are always looking for new ways to make this a reality,” Kerry Hopkins, SVP of Global Affairs at EA, said in a press release. “By making this technology available to others, we continue to work to enhance accessibility and inclusivity for players around the world by removing unintended barriers to access.”</p><p>Some examples of open tech patents include systems that can improve speech recognition, generate expressive speech audio from text data, and generate speech that mimics a player’s voice based on minimal sample speech data. One system uses machine learning to make a player’s voice sound older, while another “infers a player’s emotion while playing a video game” and automatically adjusts the game’s background music to best suit their emotional state.</p><p>EA says these patents could be used to improve gaming experiences for players with speech disorders or who struggle with verbally expressing themselves, helping them to communicate in a way that better represents their age, emotion, language, and speaking style. Alongside this announcement, EA is also releasing a <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/IRIS-Unreal-Plugin/">Unreal Engine 5 plugin that enables in-engine use of IRIS</a> — EA’s photosensitivity analysis tech — to help game developers identify frames that could impact photosensitive players.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals is just an Overwatch clone. That’s what former Blizzard President Mike Ybarra seemed to suggest in a post on social media on Wednesday (December 4).</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1864450732054675950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his post</a>, Ybarra called the game “Overwatch Marvel Rivals” while making comparisons to a recently announced game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looks similar to Horizon Zero Dawn</a>.</p>



<p>“Looks like Overwatch Marvel Rivals ships tomorrow,” Ybarra said. “Much like Light of Motiram (a clear copy of HZD) out of China. I mean even the character name – Widowmaker in OW vs. Black Widow in Marvel Rivals lol. NetEase/TenCent – all the same.”</p>







<p>Of course, one part of his comment that stood out was comparing Overwatch’s Widowmaker to Marvel’s Black Widow. It’s unclear to tell through text whether that was a legitimate criticism, but users on Twitter were quick to use the community note feature on the post.</p>



<p>Black Widow, for those that don’t know, first debuted in 1964. That puts the character 52 years older than Widowmaker. Again, however, it’s hard to tell if that comparison was serious or made in jest. That said, he has made other posts in relation to the game without addressing the comparison.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">It might not be arriving anytime soon, but Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has made clear that work is resuming on Haunted Chocolatier. The Stardew Valley creator has returned to the game after focusing on that title's 1.6 update.</p><p dir="ltr">Barone wrote <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2024/12/04/update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new blog post</a> on the Haunted Chocolatier website, acknowledging it's "been a while" since the last update. The main reason for that has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-wont-resume-work-on-haunted-chocolatier-until-stardew-version-1-6-is-settled/1100-6522145/" data-ref-id="1100-6522145">the developer's commitment to Stardew Valley 1.6</a>. Even since launching the considerable patch, bug fixes and console porting have been a priority. But now, Haunted Chocolatier should get the spotlight.</p><p dir="ltr">"My next task will be to tweak the existing bones [of Haunted Chocolatier] until I'm happy with them, add all the rest of the bones, and then flesh it all out with all the content that will need to be in the game," wrote Barone. "Yes, it's going to be a lot of work still, but it's okay, I'm addicted to the grind."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4410293-image-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4410293" data-ratio="0.41705842847549" data-width="1489" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4410293-image-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4410293"></a><figcaption>A work-in-progress screenshot of Haunted Chocolatier, showcasing the game's action-RPG elements. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4410293-image-2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Barone noted that Haunted Chocolatier will be created similarly to Stardew Valley. "I'm coding it (mostly from scratch) in C#, and I'm working solo in all areas," wrote the developer. "Why? It's what I'm comfortable with, it's what I enjoy, and it worked well for Stardew Valley." Barone adds that help technically might be needed down the road, but Haunted Chocolatier would basically be complete before that.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-gives-update-on-stardew-valley-1-6-console-port-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6526220/" data-ref-id="1100-6526220">Returning to Haunted Chocolatier after Stardew Valley 1.6 has always been the plan</a> for Barone, acknowledging the situation throughout this year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-announces-new-game-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6497292/" data-ref-id="1100-6497292">Haunted Chocolatier was originally unveiled</a> over three years ago. The RPG/simulation title will see players living in a haunted castle, with gameplay leaning heavier into action-RPG territory compared to Stardew Valley.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1666085285"

The broad aim is for this tech to assist players with speech disabilities or those who need help verbally expressing themselves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For developers, EA suggests they could use this technology to "make it possible for those players’ speech to be more effectively recognized and reflected in-game in a way that is representative of their age, emotion, language and speaking style."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another patent highlighted is an internal plugin for Unreal Engine 5 that enables in-engine use of EA's previously open-sourced photosensitivity analysis tech, IRIS. The plugin now allows developers to catch potential photosensitivity issues in-engine and real-time as they run their games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The sooner you start testing, the sooner you find potential issues," said IRIS engineer Blanca Macazaga Zuaz. According to her, not many free or easy-to-use tools for photosensitivity analysis were available prior to IRIS. The free access takes down two barriers with one stone, which she called an "incredible feeling."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Previously, the Madden and Dragon Age publisher made technologies like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/ea-will-let-devs-use-accessibility-tech-like-apex-legends-ping-system-for-free">Apex Legends' </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/ea-will-let-devs-use-accessibility-tech-like-apex-legends-ping-system-for-free">ping system</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and voice controls for NPCs free-use.

More to come soon!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can see EA's newly updated crop of free-use accessibility patents </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ea.com/commitments/positive-play/accessibility-patent-pledge">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
