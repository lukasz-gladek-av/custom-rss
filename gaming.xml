		<p>Less than two weeks after its launch, Firewalk Studios and Sony are taking Concord offline and issuing refunds to all players, to “explore options” for the game’s potential future. The game’s servers will be shut down on 6th September 2024.</p>
<p>Writing on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">PlayStation Blog</a>, Game Director Ryan Ellis gave the following statement:</p>


<p>“Concord fans — we’ve been listening closely to your feedback since the launch of Concord on PlayStation 5 and PC and want to thank everyone who has joined the journey aboard the Northstar. Your support and the passionate community that has grown around the game has meant the world to us.</p>
<p>“However, while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended. Therefore, at this time, we have decided to take the game offline beginning September 6, 2024, and explore options, including those that will better reach our players.”</p>
<p>In effect, this is a full cancellation of the game’s launch on 23rd August. All players who bought the game through the PlayStation Store or PlayStation Direct will have an automatic refund from Sony – these will take 30-60 days to appear on bank statements, apparently. Steam and Epic will also refund players who are on PC. If the game was purchased physically, you’ll have to talk to the retailers directly, but Sony has sanctioned the refund programme, so you shouldn’t have much trouble.</p>

<p>It’s widely thought felt that trying to do a premium hero shooter when the market is dominated by a small handful of free-to-play titans, like Overwatch, Valorant and the soon to be released Marvel themed shooter, was a misstep. So was launching in the middle of Gamescom with little to no splashy marketing support. It resulted in a concurrent player count that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/">maxed out at 697 players on Steam</a> and has barely scraped three figures on PC in the last few days. With reports and speculation that sales are at around 25,000, it’s a massive underperformance for Sony, and they had to do something to spur it on.</p>
<p>As for the game’s future? Well, going free-to-play is the obvious answer, it just depends how long it will take Firewalk to work microtransactions into the game to shift the business model, and then Sony needs to pick a launch window that gives them a fighting chance.</p>
<p>It’s a real shame, because we enjoyed this alternative to the genre mainstays. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord review</a>, Jim said, “Fun, quickfire game modes and solid multiplayer shooting help steer Concord through an asteroid field of scepticism and unhinged vitriol but the space odyssey doesn’t end here. Like any live service, Concord’s ongoing vitality and potential appeal to new fans will hinge on its post-launch support, content roadmap, and building on Firewalk’s exciting foundation.”</p>

			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is this month's game featured on IGN First, and the exclusive coverage <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGMMK2I30-o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> today with a 22-minute-long gameplay video featuring commentary from BioWare developers. Game Director John Epler talked about the Lighthouse, shown in the first few minutes.</p>
<p><em>The Lighthouse is your base of operations that you inherited willingly or unwillingly from Solas. It is located in the Fade. It's where Solas was able to start planning his rebellion against the Elven Gods millennia ago. Right now, you and your team have occupied it and started to build it, starting to shape itself around your personality. Each of these spaces kind of shapes itself around your companions as they live there, as they basically spend their arcs in those rooms. </em><em>One of the interesting and fun things we've done in Dragon Age: The Veilguard is that if you see the lights on in a room, that companion has something to say. You can see Harding up in that space there, Neve behind you as well as Belara.</em></p>
<p>As the player character moved to the mission, they had to go through the Crossroads. Epler once again discussed what they are exactly.</p>
<p><em>The Crossroads is the area that you spend a lot of time traveling through as you go from area to area. It's also a space that has at one point served as Solas's main base of operations and training ground for his rebellion against the Elven Gods, so as you go through it, you're going to find fragments of the past, things that Solas had done previously that are going to give you a bit of insight into Solas as a character but also into the Elven Gods and their motivations.</em></p>

GameSpot was able to get hands-on with Black Ops 6 during Activision's Call of Duty: Next event, which featured multiplayer and the next Warzone map. Black Ops 6 feels very polished with new action star movement that is a blast to use, but I do worry that it won't take long for high-skilled players to exploit the system and ruin the fun.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Movement for action-hero plays</h2><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 definitely feels like a Black Ops game with its fast-paced action, arcade style, and vibrant maps. The biggest difference this year is Treyarch's new movement system, which further adapts the fluidity and pace of the typical Black Ops multiplayer experience.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Official Multiplayer Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Omnimovement allows you to sprint, slide, and dive in any direction. Whereas previous entries limited you to just forward dives and sliding, you can now go prone and spin around 360 degrees, making for epic moves that allow you to live out your own John Wick-style action-hero fantasy.</p><p dir="ltr">Omnimovement's reveal worried me as a long-time, old-school player who doesn't bunny hop and rarely slide cancels. I already find myself being outfinessed by high-skill players who can give themselves an advantage in gunfights with these advanced techniques. The thought of my opponents using even more advanced slides and diving sounded worrisome for my future matches. I was also pretty skeptical at how the movement would feel.</p><p dir="ltr">However, omnimovement pleasantly surprised me. It's a well-polished mechanic, and I found myself enjoying the moments where the movement benefited me. This includes reactions like side diving to avoid a grenade or diving backwards behind cover to reload. There were also intense moments of Domination on Skyline, where my team and I cleared the enemies away from the B flag and I dove off a balcony to land behind cover and secure the point.</p><p dir="ltr">These are the type of over-the-top plays I'd only expect to pull off during scripted moments of a Call of Duty campaign. Yet here I am, leveraging these moves and having a great time doing it. It's not quite muscle memory for me yet, and I'm sometimes diving and sliding at the wrong times, but I'm learning how to better chain movements together and make my playstyle more fluid as I rack up additional game time in the beta.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360826-bo6_multiplayer_omnimovement_branded2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360826" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360826-bo6_multiplayer_omnimovement_branded2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360826"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360826-bo6_multiplayer_omnimovement_branded2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Further improving the action is the new Intelligent Movement system. These are optional game settings, which are turned off by default, but I highly recommend everyone try these out. They allow you to customize a lot of basic movements, such as turning on settings for tactical sprint assist and removing the sprint delay, reducing the number of button presses needed to perform certain actions. These not only made my movement feel faster and more fluid, but it meant less input on the thumbsticks, thus it also felt much easier on my hands.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, Black Ops 6's movement is all about timing and decision-making. I've been at an advantage when an enemy launched at me with an ill-timed dive, and I've been gunned down in the same manner when the roles were reversed. So far, omnimovement hasn't felt like it's created a significantly higher skill gap, and casual players should still be able to hold their own against their opponents, but only time will tell if this sentiment will remain true. Right now, it's something optional that allows you to get a bit flashy with your movements, and it doesn't feel like a required skill you <em>need</em> to master. You can easily still win gunfights and find success without ever partaking in the additional movement, at least based on what we've seen so far.</p><p dir="ltr">I remain concerned that it won't take long for high-skill players to master and possibly exploit this movement system to an even higher degree than we already see with Call of Duty's existing slide-canceling and bunny-hopping mechanics. It's easy for an above-average player to find exploits or slide around and break your cameras, and while it's still too early to be certain, Black Ops 6's more advanced movement has the ability to bring one of the highest skill gaps we've seen.</p><p dir="ltr">This year could also be tough for average/casual players who start playing post-launch. Jumping into a new Call of Duty with more complex movement long after players have mastered the movement could make for a more jarring experience than usual.</p><p dir="ltr">On a positive note, the beta includes the omnimovement training course that will also be in the game at launch. This allows you to practice your dives and barrel rolls with coaching narration provided by Black Ops fan-favorite operator, Frank Woods.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Brand-new maps and mostly familiar modes</h2><p dir="ltr">While Modern Warfare 3 released with a map pool consisting of entirely remastered maps, Black Ops 6 is set to launch with a fresh offering of 16 brand-new maps. The first week of the beta includes the same map pool as our hands-on experience at Call of Duty: Next, and it's a pretty good variety of settings with each beta map having a unique aesthetic.</p><p dir="ltr">Rewind is a map that takes place in and around a '90s-themed shopping center with a Blockbuster-style video store. Derelict is a colorful yet rundown train yard, Babylon takes place in ancient city ruins of Iraq, Skyline is a luxury penthouse, and Scud is a desert military outpost.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360828-bo6_multiplayer_action_branded2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360828" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360828-bo6_multiplayer_action_branded2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360828"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360828-bo6_multiplayer_action_branded2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Treyarch kept a focus on core 6v6 maps for multiplayer, so don't expect any large-scale Ground War-style maps for this year's launch. The maps are all small-to-medium-sized with a mostly standard three-lane design that Treyarch is known for designing. Not everyone is going to like that structure, but I appreciate that they're not cluttered or campy maps, and it's never going to take you long to get into the action.</p><p dir="ltr">The beta includes a mix of staple Call of Duty modes, with Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint all in rotation. However, Treyarch also gives us a taste of the new Kill Order game mode. Kill Order isn't massively innovative, but it does add a little spice for those who prefer a more casual Team Deathmatch-style mode. The mode marks one person on each team as an HVT (High-Value Target) player. Regular eliminations still count towards your team's score, but you get even more points by keeping your HVT alive and eliminating the enemy HVT. This mode doesn't get as sweaty as a match of Hardpoint, but it can be a whole lot of chaotic fun.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Gunplay feels satisfying</h2><p dir="ltr">The beta gives a solid offering of weapons to try out. The XM4 is a versatile assault rifle, and the Jackal PDW is a powerful choice for an aggressive submachine gun. The weapons feel mostly balanced for their class, with the one exception being the Jackal PDW--the submachine gun is a bit overpowered in this first week of the beta. Weapon tuning will likely take place during the beta and prior to launch though, so hopefully it's in a better place by the time the game releases.</p><p dir="ltr">The time-to-kill in Black Ops 6 feels consistent and a little faster than Cold War's slower 150-health, but even with the game's return to classic 100-health, it doesn't feel too fast. It's perhaps closer in line with the TTK currently found in MW3.</p><p dir="ltr">The audio and visual designs are highly polished as well. The guns all look and sound amazing to use. Some of the more recent Call of Duty games started with too much visual recoil, which was a combination of smoke and gun wobble that could distract and reduce visibility in gunfights, but thankfully Black Ops 6 doesn't seem to have any major visual recoil hindering your fights. The footstep audio might be a little low, but everything else in action sounds well-tuned.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that visibility is great this year. A problem with recent Call of Duty games, especially early in the betas, was poor visibility with washed-out color palettes and hard-to-see enemies and nametags. However, Black Ops 6 has great lighting and visuals. I never find myself shooting at teammates or squinting to try and tell who's an enemy.</p><h2 dir="ltr">A mostly standard loadout system</h2><p dir="ltr">The create-a-class system is what you'd expect from a Treyarch-developed Call of Duty, but one major difference works towards its goal of providing the best movement. All loadouts now have a dedicated melee slot, so you don't need to sacrifice a secondary weapon for a knife. You also get unlimited tac-sprint with the knife in hand, allowing you to swap to a blade and speed around the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Modern Warfare 3 labeled traditional perks as wearable gear pieces, such as a vest that worked just like the classic Overkill perk to carry an additional primary weapon. Over time, new gear pieces were added in seasonal updates that offered similar perks already featured in the game, and gear pieces became a more confusing way of getting the classic Call of Duty perks you needed for your playstyle. It's nice to see Black Ops 6 go back and streamline perks into the typical three categories. The perks are much of the classic offerings, such as Ghost, Double Time, and, Flak Jacket, but Treyarch does bring back the Wildcard feature from previous Black Ops games, which provides an additional way to customize your loadouts. In the beta, we only have two options: Overkill to carry a second primary weapon and Perk Greed to equip one additional perk. Both feel like good Wildcard options to have. I lean more towards Overkill for my loadouts, but it will likely depend on your playstyle which you choose.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360835-bo6-cod-next-02-mp-0382.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360835" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360835-bo6-cod-next-02-mp-0382.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360835"></a><figcaption>Beta killstreaks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360835-bo6-cod-next-02-mp-0382.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Gunsmith is a lot more straightforward than what we've seen in recent years. There's no worry of advanced weapon tuning, conversion kits, or even an overwhelming amount of attachments like we saw in Call of Duty: Vanguard. It's just a simple Gunsmith customization that allows for up to five attachments. Attachments also feel much more straightforward, with a variety of pros and very few cons.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of getting to choose between earning killstreaks or scorestreaks, Black Ops 6 just offers scorestreaks, which is great to help promote objective play. The beta includes familiar options, with streaks like the UAV, Counter UAV, chopper gunner, and even Treyarch's iconic RC-XD remote-controlled car.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Warzone focuses on small map Resurgence</h2><p dir="ltr">For Warzone, Treyarch was focused on creating a Resurgence map with a story that only its studio could tell. Area 99 is a small Warzone map inspired by Treyarch's most iconic multiplayer map, Nuketown, with a focus on the points-of-interest telling the origin story of how the Nuketown map was created. This includes a manufacturing facility for the Nuketown model houses, a nuclear reactor, a mannequin-assembly center, and an underground bunker.</p><p dir="ltr">At first glance, I thought the map looked too small and drab. I expected more pops of color like we see in Treyarch's multiplayer map design, but Area 99 is a lot of washed-out colors and boring concrete. However, the Nuketown story here is interesting and unique, and the map plays really well for its purpose as a Resurgence map, which is all about facilitating a more frantic and fast-past battle royale experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Area 99 is smaller than Rebirth Island, and it makes for plenty of quick engagements. We only played a handful of matches at Call of Duty: Next, given our short amount of playtime, but each one was met with instant action.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360836-bo6-cod-next-04-wz-0022.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360836" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360836-bo6-cod-next-04-wz-0022.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360836"></a><figcaption>Area 99 map layout</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360836-bo6-cod-next-04-wz-0022.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That said, don't expect too many new bells and whistles for this new year of Warzone. Movement is the focus for the developers, and the new features arriving with integration--such as Black Ops 6's omnimovement and the advantage of unlimited tac-sprint with the dedicated melee slot--are among the game's biggest updates. Improved movement and quality-of-life changes can always make the Warzone experience better, but I'm really hoping the developer has more plans up its sleeve for dynamic map changes and special events to help keep battle royale from getting too stale.</p><p dir="ltr">One welcome change, however, is the removal of Warzone's backpack system. There are still dedicated slots for holding important equipment, such as the gas mask, field upgrade, one killstreak, and tactical and lethal equipment, but ditching the backpack means no one can hoard a bunch of game-changing killstreaks and equipment for the final circle. Additionally, armor and ammo satchels are introduced to make sure you can still store enough plates and ammo for your fights now that the backpacks are gone.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Final thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr">Overall, Treyarch's move to the new engine feels like a success, and the extra development time can definitely be felt in the polish of the multiplayer beta. The only issues of note so far are some minor freezing and hiccups with the servers, and that the Jackal PDW needs to be nerfed. While I haven't had enough playtime with Area 99 to give in-depth impressions yet, it already feels like Warzone is getting a potentially solid new map design for the Resurgence modes.</p><p dir="ltr">My biggest concern for Black Ops 6 post-launch is the skill gap that could eventually be created by the movement and offering powerful gun attachments that don't feature any cons, but only time will tell how sweaty this omnimovement will become. For now, it looks as if Treyarch has redefined Call of Duty's fast-paced action with omnidirectional movement, making multiplayer a blast.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft and Apple In Disagreement About Cloud Gaming Again]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-apple-in-disagreement-about-cloud-gaming-again/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-and-apple-in-disagreement-about-cloud-gaming-again.971061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-apple-in-disagreement-about-cloud-gaming-again/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This argument between Microsoft and Apple is far from new, but it has resurfaced again. Earlier in the year, Apple opened its App Store to game streaming services, such as the commonly used Xbox Cloud Gaming and GeForce Now. This allowed a more seamless integration, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-considering-a-browser-based-app-for-xbox-game-pass-to-bypass-apple-app-store-rules/">users didn't have to use a web app</a> on iPhone and iPad. Despite this, NVIDIA and Microsoft have not made native apps for iOS, which Microsoft has now explicitly explained.</p>
<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer already spoke out about Apple earlier this year, saying that Apple's cloud changes haven't gone "far enough" for Xbox. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In an interview</a> with The Verge, Spencer mentioned "that there's not enough room for us to monetize Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS." Regarding the terms that Apple suggested, he responded with, "You might even say they go the opposite direction in some way, but they definitely don't go far enough to open up competition in the world's largest gaming platform." During that interview, Spencer said he would continue to work with Apple and Google to try and create a solution for this.</p>
<p>In submissions to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Microsoft has raised the point that despite the various changes that Apple made to the App Store guidelines in January, March, and April<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> (as seen in sections 4.7 and 4.9)</a>, it still isn't enough for it to operate a native Xbox Cloud Gaming app on iOS.</p>
<p>After reviewing Apple's guidelines, Microsoft has said that they "still represent an obstacle to Cloud Gaming native apps" as it cannot comply with them in a technical and economical sense if it incorporates games into the Xbox Cloud Gaming services on iOS. Specifically, Apple is asking to make multiplatform services such as Xbox Cloud Gaming and all content, subscriptions, and features available within the app as an in-app purchase.</p>
<p>By asking that, Microsoft opens a can of worms for the third-party game developers who have their games on the service. Microsoft would then have to ask them to recode their games so that they are compliant with the IAP requirement, which is a significant amount of effort for something that may not even be successful.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6c53fc52d5fb4c82ddd66/2024-08-07_Apple_Response_to_Working_Paper_6_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple argues</a> that it is supporting cloud gaming via web apps, citing two articles by the Verge that discuss Microsoft's improvements to Xbox Cloud Gaming performance on iPhone and iPad and the fact that more than 20 million people have used Xbox Cloud Gaming on their iOS platforms. Apple has also claimed that Microsoft has not engaged with them despite multiple efforts to work together to make cloud gaming successful on iOS.</p>
<p>When it comes to the issue of third-party developers having to recede their games, Apple has also argued that point, saying that developers "generally are not having difficulty with the IPA requirement," citing Antstream, a small app developer who was responsible for launching the first iPhone game streaming service with over 1,300 retro titles from different companies.</p>
<p>To try to settle this argument, the CMA has set a deadline for all parties involved to respond to the market investigation before a provisional decision report is released in November. A final report is due next year.</p>

When <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a></span> first released in 2016 it failed to live up to the lofty promises made by developer Hello Games prior to launch. Yet, over many years the studio has slowly updated and changed its underlying systems to not only meet those original expectations from fans and help rebuild trust, but eventually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-unexpected-success-of-no-man-s-sky-1833920840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-unexpected-success-of-no-man-s-sky-1833920840">surpass those expectations</a></span>. In 2024, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is perhaps the most definitive game for those seeking a unique space fantasy that lets you explore, catalog, and conquer the great unknown.</p></div><div><p>I respect, but don’t quite understand, the popularity of realistic driving sims like <em>American Truck Simulator</em>. Growing up in Los Angeles, driving around in my free time just to drive was a favorite pastime. There is something about the monotonous act of just cruising down roads with the radio on that feels meditative, but for me at least, doing that in a game just doesn’t hit the same. If you feel similarly then maybe change the setting to space<em>. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2380050/Star_Trucker/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2380050/Star_Trucker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Star Trucker</em></a></span> is exactly that, a realistic driving simulator with the exception of the extra-planetary routes you’ll be undertaking.</p></div><div><p>If you’d rather spend your time with a strategy game that will let you sink dozens of hours into building up your own space empire as you play cutthroat political games then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Stellaris</em></a></span><em> </em>is for you. From the same team behind strategy heavy hitters like the <em>Crusader Kings</em> and <em>Victoria </em>series, <em>Stellaris </em>takes Paradox Interactive’s deftly crafted 4X gameplay and transfers it to a grand galactic theater. If you’ve ever thought that, actually, the political part of the <em>Star Wars</em> prequels was fascinating, you can guide your own rise to power amongst the stars.</p></div><div><p>Space isn’t all that friendly, especially in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/252110/Lovers_in_a_Dangerous_Spacetime/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252110/Lovers_in_a_Dangerous_Spacetime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</em></a></span>. In this co-up adventure, you and up to three friends man your spaceship against the seemingly constant threats of deep space. Communication is key in this joint adventure that requires you to run around your ship and man the proper stations to stay alive. Like any good party game, <em>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</em> is easy to pick up, hard to master, and just hectic enough to cause the right amount of chaos amongst your group.</p></div><div><p>How hard can it really be to build a rocket? Turns out extremely, but thanks to <em>Kerbal Space Program</em> it can also be extremely funny. The space flight simulation title bases its building and launching of rockets and other spacecraft off of completely realistic physics. The humorous twist are the titular Kerbals, silly looking aliens who are your guinea pigs. The meat of<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/Kerbal_Space_Program/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/Kerbal_Space_Program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kerbal Space Program</em></a></span> is its incredibly intricate building systems that challenge you to make effective spaceships, but your many failures are made easier by the presence of the Kerbals at all times. Sometimes you might find yourself making the most failure prone craft you can just to see how it treats your willing victims.</p></div><div><p><em>Fallout </em>in space. That’s the pitch for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/578650/The_Outer_Worlds/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/578650/The_Outer_Worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a></span>—which is not to be confused with <em>Outer Wilds</em>, another great space exploration title currently not on sale. Developed by <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> creator Obsidian Entertainment, <em>The Outer Worlds</em> brings the studio’s signature player-centric open-world RPG design to a space setting rife with sharp satire and western homages. The ability to choose how you approach situations (be it with a gun or with your words) in many major story beats and more minor interactions creates a living breathing world that makes the player feel truly important in more ways than just being the protagonist of a predetermined story. Running around and uncovering every little detail of <em>The Outer Worlds </em>setting is worthwhile, as its frontier western twist on the space adventure is perfectly pulpy.</p></div><div><p>In the twelve years since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/FTL_Faster_Than_Light/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/FTL_Faster_Than_Light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>FTL</em></a></span><em> </em>released it feels like the roguelike genre has absolutely ballooned in popularity, yet <em>FTL </em>remains one of the absolute best to ever do it. You take control of a spaceship’s crew and make your way to your destination while being constantly attacked by enemies. While staying alive is paramount, <em>FTL </em>is much more management-based as you need to choose the proper crew and equipment as well as direct said crew to stations across these ships in order to avoid defeat. The fast-paced but highly strategic and customizable nature of each encounter makes returning to <em>FTL </em>over and over again a joy.</p></div><div><p>As far as original sci-fi settings go, <em>The Expanse</em> series (both the books and the TV show) are up there. From the mind of writers Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck—under the pen name James S. A. Corey—<em>The Expanse</em> is a gritty realistic version of space filled with high political tensions and space-based class disparity that leads to some incredible story arcs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1708010/The_Expanse_A_Telltale_Series/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1708010/The_Expanse_A_Telltale_Series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Telltale Series</em></a></span> based on the TV show continues that thrilling world in a slightly more interactive form and centers around one of the show’s best characters, Camina Drummer. You shouldn’t feel intimidated if you’ve never read or watched <em>The Expanse</em>, as the game is a great starting point.</p></div><div><p>Space is an unknowable void. It is uncaring, cold, and will kill you. You cannot defeat a force of nature like it. That is the conceit behind <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2341070/The_Banished_Vault/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2341070/The_Banished_Vault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Banished Vault</em></a></span>, a space-faring strategy/management game unlike any other on this list. You control a massive colony ship as it jumps from system to system as it constantly flees for an encroaching plague. Each system has planets and potential resources to find that can prolong your inhabitants’ lives from the inevitability of their deaths. There isn’t a real sense of victory in <em>The Banished Vault</em>, just a sense of ephemeral survival that can quickly be taken from you. This helplessness in the face of space makes for a thrilling gameplay loop that somehow hooks you in, compelling you to try to survive just a bit longer each time. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

No, you did not hallucinate Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy battling Sephiroth. That is, in fact, very real, and part of the first <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>game. You know what else is real? Mickey Mouse being the king of this universe, but also lowkey one of its most prolific warriors. These games are <em>Space Jam </em>for theater kids and Disney adults and they’re on a pretty decent sale right now.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1000794&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1000794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>On Steam</strong></a></span><strong>, the entire franchise is on sale as the <em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em> for $69, though it usually goes for $100. </strong>This collection features just about every <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>title, since they’re all mostly canonical and tie in to the confusing overarching story in some fashion. Most of the entries are the full, original games, where possible. Some of the other titles, though, couldn’t be ported without meaningful resources put towards altering the gameplay to fit systems other than where the game first launched. For instance, <em>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</em>, which was released on the DS and made use of the dual screens for gameplay. In the case of games like this, this collection instead has compilations of the cutscenes in high-definition. </p><p>As far as full games, bagging this collection will get you <em>Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, Re:Chain of Memories, II Final Mix, Birth By Sleep Final Mix, Dream Drop Distance HD, 0.2 Birth By Sleep - A fragmentary passage, III, and III ReMind</em>. You’ll also get the HD cutscenes of <em>358/2 Days </em>and <em>Re:coded</em>, as well as the movie <em>χ Back Cover</em>. Now, in case that made no sense, and I’m sure it didn’t, I will do my best to explain what I just said.<br></p><p>The three main games are in there, and the first two are specifically the <em>Final Mix </em>versions, which just means they are the re-releases that featured expanded content. Remember, DLC didn’t <em>really </em>exists in the early 2000s. The first game is not really all that fun (it’s too stiff in my opinion), but the second is like a completely different and much better game. Meanwhile, <em>ReMind </em>is just the third game’s lone piece of DLC, so if you’re interested in where the series will go outside of the story arc that concluded with <em>III</em>, it’s probably worth having.<br></p><p><em>Re:Chain of Memories and Re:coded </em>are (as the titles might give away) remakes of existing games which were ported to consoles. The former is a Gameboy Advance title that adopted a card-based battle system, and the latter was a mobile game that was eventually brought to the DS and then everything else. Meanwhile, <em>Birth By Sleep </em>is a PSP prequel that is probably one of the most celebrated titles in the series, and <em>0.2 Birth By Sleep - A fragmentary passage </em>is a playable prologue for <em>III </em>that picks back up with the fan-favorite character Aqua. I’m giving you all the broad strokes because anything else might literally cause an aneurysm.<br></p><p><em>Dream Drop Distance HD </em>is also a port of a 3DS game, but at the time the handheld was being touted as being able to house console-level experiences, hence why this game was able to make the jump to other systems completely intact. And yes, <em>Dream Drop Distance </em>can be shortened to <em>3D</em>, a point that the series’ creator Tetsuya Nomura and Square Enix were <em>very </em>proud to tout. Everything is canon, everything is convoluted, and I kind of respect it.<br></p><p>I cannot tell you a damn thing about <em>χ Back Cover</em>, as that simply goes beyond my limited understanding of the series. In my defense, I was very hammered the last time anyone tried to explain the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>games to me, and while that was fun, it probably doesn’t help. What I do know though is that <em>χ Back Cover</em> is a film tied to yet another mobile game that presumably does a good job of filling players in on what that side of the story was all about, without forcing anyone to play the game.</p><p>Despite my jests, <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>is a hugely important series to a generation of folks. It’s tremendously obtuse, but it is also <em>so </em>sincere. It taught a generation of kids the power of friendship. It let Woody from <em>Toy Story</em> roast the shit out of its central villain and weaponize the power of love. The main weapon of the game is a literal giant key. And for the price of a single game, you get about two decades worth of the most heartfelt nonsense wrapped in one of the action-RPG genres’ best combat systems. Need I say anything else?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-does-concord-shutting-down-mean-for-you.971052/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-concord-shutting-down-mean-for-you/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you haven’t heard the absolutely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mind-boggling announcement</a> from Sony, you should know that Concord is shutting down completely. They’re not just ceasing ongoing development or canceling future content, they’re going nuclear with the arena shooter. So, what does that mean for you? What does it mean for those who paid for the game?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-still-play-concord">Can You Still Play Concord?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, in canceling the game, they took down the servers altogether. You can’t join a game if you own a copy and still have it installed, and you currently cannot buy it. Sony took down the store page on Steam, and over on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, it’s listed as “Announced” with a release date of 8/23/2024. </p>



<p>In its announcement, Sony said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Concord fans — we’ve been listening closely to your feedback since the launch of Concord on PlayStation 5 and PC and want to thank everyone who has joined the journey aboard the Northstar. Your support and the passionate community that has grown around the game has meant the world to us.</p>



<p>However, while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended. Therefore, at this time, we have decided to take the game offline beginning September 6, 2024, and explore options, including those that will better reach our players.</p>



<p>While we determine the best path ahead, Concord sales will cease immediately and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased the game for PS5 or PC. If you purchased the game for PlayStation 5 from the PlayStation Store or PlayStation Direct, a refund will be issued back to your original payment method.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While it’s fantastic to hear that those who paid for a copy will receive a full refund, it still sucks for those players who were genuinely excited about the game. While it certainly didn’t sell well, Concord was entertaining, though it didn’t break the mold. The studio was chasing a trend from years prior and was too slow to capitalize.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-concord-return">Will Concord Return?</h2>



<p>It’s certainly possible that Sony will decide to bring Concord back online with a total revamp and a better roadmap. If they do, I suspect it’ll launch as a free-to-play game instead of a paid title. Based on the wording in the announcement, Sony wishes to “explore options” to determine how best to move forward with the project. After all, it spent years in development.</p>



<hr>



<p>According to analysts, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-sales-25000-analysts-estimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord only sold approximately 25,000 copies</a>, which makes it a failure on all accounts. We’re all curious to see how Sony will proceed with this one.</p>

Those who purchased on Steam and the Epic Games Store will be refunded in the coming days.</p><p>Physical refunds are a tad trickier but players can check with individual retailers to obtain a refund. Sony will presumably organise a system with them itself that allows all refunds to be processed fully. "Once refunded, players will no longer have access to the game," Sony made clear.</p><h2>Concord pulled less than two weeks after launch</h2><p>Concord arrived August 23, 2024, meaning it has been removed from sale just 11 days after launch and taken offline for all players a mere two weeks after. Even those who bought Concord will no longer be able to play after September 6.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p>Its launch was nothing short of disastrous, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">analysts telling IGN it has likely sold as few as 25,000 units</a>.

                <p>The Tony Hawk Pro Skater social media accounts have gotten a refresh for the franchise's 25th anniversary and fans are now ablaze with speculation.</p><p>No official news of any kind has been released, but Tony Hawk Pro Skater accounts on X/Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook all got a facelift with a 25th anniversary logo (Thanks <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-pro-skater-fans-are-excited-after-this-social-media-refresh" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>). All the images have a 2024 copyright water mark, which suggest Activision has renewed the franchise's copyright. The update has fans wondering if a Pro Skater 3 and 4 remaster is on the horizon.</p><p>The most recent game in the franchise was Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, which released back in September 2020. It remade the original two games adding a robust create-a-park feature, online multiplayer, and several new skaters.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-shutting-down-sony-offering-full-refunds.970992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that live-service hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down effective Friday, and that all players who have purchased the game will be entitled to refunds.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Sony says that it's been "listening closely" to&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>feedback. The studio says that while many of&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s qualities "resonated" with its player base, "other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn't land the way we'd intended".</p>
<p>For that reason, Sony says it's taking&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>offline on September 6th, which is this Friday. The company says that it will "explore options, including those that will better reach our players".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/concord-shutting-down-combat.jpg?itok=eZnIGRb0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/concord-shutting-down-combat.jpg?itok=3u7WxvAI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Concord&nbsp;</em>will be no more beginning this Friday.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to taking the game's servers offline, Sony says it'll be offering "a full refund for all gamers who have purchased the game for PS5 or PC". That's everyone who bought it, since&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>isn't available on any other platforms.</p>
<p>If you bought it either from the PlayStation Store or from PlayStation Direct, you'll be issued a refund "back to your original payment method".</p>
<p>Things are a little different if you purchased <em>Concord&nbsp;</em>from other platforms. Steam players will be issued a refund "over the coming days", as will the Epic Games Store. Physical retailers, meanwhile, will have their own refund processes to which you should refer if you bought the game from them.</p>
<p>Once you've received your refund, you won't have access to&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>anymore, which suggests that Sony isn't just going to be taking this one offline for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Sony taking&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>offline is a stunning blow to a game that was supposed to be one of the cornerstones of the studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-comments">live-service approach</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, Sony revealed that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-revised-its-live-service-ganes-plans-with-only-6-games-coming-by-fy-2025">release just six</a> of its previously-planned twelve live-service games before the end of the 2025 fiscal year, and since&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>is presumably one of those six games, its failure should probably cause Sony execs to do some serious soul-searching.</p>
<p>It's remarkable that Sony is choosing to take&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>offline less than two weeks after its launch, but given that the game attracted <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just shy of 700 concurrent players</a> at its peak (on Steam, that is), it's a decision that makes some sense. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <p>
Floundering 5v5 shooter Concord is set to go offline indefinitely this Friday - just two weeks after its PS5 and PC release - as Sony and Firewalk Studios admit "our initial launch didn't land".
</p>
<p>
Concord - one of several games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-as-it-continues-work-on-triple-a-multiplayer-exclusive">snapped up by Sony</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">live-service push</a> under former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-pvp-shooter-concord-is-firewalk-studios-first-game">initially announced last May</a>. Since then, the response has been tepid, culimating in less-than-stellar player numbers at launch, and subsequent estimates it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">only sold around 25,000 copies across PS5 and PC</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now, Sony is taking the remarkable step of pulling the game offline this Friday, 6th September. In a post announcing the news <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>, game director Ryan Ellis wrote, "While many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognise that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn't land the way we'd intended."

<p>
As such, Concord will be taken offline indefinitely so Firewalk can "determine the best path ahead" and "explore options, including those that will better reach our players."
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Concord will be pulled from sale immediately, and everyone who purchased the game on PlayStation 5 and PC will receive a full refund. Those who bought Concord on the PlayStation Store or PlayStation Direct will be refunded via their original payment method, and Sony says these refunds may take between 30 and 60 days to be appear on purchasers' bank statements.
</p>
<p>
Steam and Epic customers will be refunded in the "coming days" and will receive confirmation their refund has been processed. And as for players who bought a physical copy of Concord, they're advised to refer to the refund process of their retailer. All players, notes Sony, will lose access to the game once refunded.
</p>
<p>
"We'll keep you updated," Firewalk's statement concludes, "and thank you again to all the Freegunners who have joined us in the Concord galaxy."
</p>
<p>
Writing about the "kind and earnest" Concord's muted launch last month, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spare-a-thought-for-poor-concord-a-kind-and-earnest-shooter-sent-out-to-die">said</a>, "Out of the trenches of development and into no man's land it goes, clutching its weapon and its special ability, hoping for the best and bracing for what is, probably, the inevitable, while the forever war for our attention rumbles on."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-has-no-drm-or-microtransactions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Denuvo DRM is one of the most well-known and well-hated pieces of software in the gaming industry. It's used to protect games from piracy, which is frequent in a world full of digital content. Denuvo has been on the market for ten years now, and is increasingly more controversial, as it stops people from tampering with the product and making it available for piracy, as well as to stop unlicensed emulation. <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-qa-with-tim-willits-we-have-a-game-that-will-exceed-expectations/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is one of the most highly anticipated games and has decided not to go ahead with Denuvo DRM or any alternatives to DRM. This information was found in a <a href="https://support.saber.games/hc/en-us/articles/26354574015249-Warhammer-40-000-Space-Marine-2-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;A posted</a> on the Saber Games website that discusses some important topics, such as the presence of microtransactions.</p>
<p>The FAQ covers a lot of important details about the upcoming release of Space Marine 2, a game that has already received a lot of attention due to a leak of a developer's build. However, many have moved past that and are now eagerly awaiting the game's release date, due on September 9, 2024.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Aside from the lack of DRM, Space Marine 2 will not feature any microtransactions, except paid cosmetic DLC. However, that is completely optional, and there won't be any pay-to-win features in Space Marine 2. "All gameplay content and features will be free to all players. Any paid DLCs will be cosmetic only," as confirmed in the FAQ on the Saber website. While they aren't using DRM, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, they will rely on EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) for anti-cheat coverage.</p>
<p>For those who are more interested in the graphical side of things, there are no plans for ray-tracing at current, but DLSS2/FSR2 will be available to those able to use it on day one, with DLSS3/FSR3 coming later in the year. Additionally, the developers aim to optimize the game for the Steam Deck later in the year. Unfortunately, the game is set not to support ultrawide and super-ultrawide monitors on launch day. This problem with a previous Warhammer 40,000 game was resolved after some time with a dedicated patch.</p>
<p>While Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 will be available on GeForce Now on day one, it won't come to Xbox Game Pass for the foreseeable future. Regarding GeForce Now, the game will have fully-functioning cross-platform saves and offline progression, but those who want to play the Operations Mode will need a stable internet connection to access it.</p>
<p>Friendly fire will not appear in any game mode, but there will be dedicated PvP servers for those who want to partake. The dedicated servers will be for NA, LATAM, and SIE regions. As expected, there is no LAN support for PvE/PvP.</p>
<p>For those curious about Space Marine 2, the game doesn't require you to play the first to enjoy this one, despite some returning characters from the first game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After only ten days on the market, <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-first-trailer-gameplay-release-date/">Concord</a> sales are ceasing immediately as Sony and Firewalk Studios explore better options to better reach their players.</p>
<p>In a new post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, Game Director Ryan Ellis provided an update on the state of the game, revealing that some aspects of the game and the initial launch did not land the way the studio intended. As such, it has been decided to cease sales of the game immediately and take servers down later this week, on September 6th. A full refund is being offered for anyone who purchased the game on any platform. You can find information on how refunds are being offered below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Steam</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Store</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Steam Store will refund players who bought the game over the coming days.&nbsp;Steam will send confirmation of the refund once it has been processed.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Epic Games Store</strong>&nbsp;– Epic Games Store will refund players who bought the game over the coming days and will contact each customer directly to confirm that the refund has been processed.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Other retailer refunds</strong>&nbsp;– For customers who have purchased a physical copy at a retailer location outside of PlayStation directly, please refer to the refund process of the retailer you purchased it from to obtain your refund.&nbsp; &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>While the decision to halt Concord sales immediately, and take the game offline, may sound a little extreme, with the game having only been out for a few days, it was clear right from release how the game wasn't doing well at all, with extremely low concurrent players numbers on Steam from day one, despite showing some promise. Unfortunately for Sony and Firewalk Studios, gaming has moved past the trends that Concord tried to catch, and it will be very interesting to see how the game will be changed if it ever returns to the market.</p>

Now, after Capcom had what it called “technical discussions” with Microsoft, Xbox will be able to get in on the fun as well, though a bit later than everyone else.</p><div><p>Recently, there’s been a noticeable delay for big third-party releases on Xbox. It took last year’s Game of the Year, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3,</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993155/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-release-game-of-the-year">several months after its console launch to hit Xbox</a> because of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/24/23844418/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-release-series-x-s-cross-save-split-screen">technical constraints of developing for the Series S</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226834/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-impression-game-science"><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224290/black-myth-wukong-passes-counter-strike-all-time-peak-on-steam">launched to big fanfare</a> on PlayStation and PC, and while an Xbox release is planned, there’s been no word of when. </p></div><p>Similarly, the developers of <em>Enotria: The Last Song </em>— an action RPG based on Italian folklore — <a href="https://enotriathelastsong.com/news/enotria-the-last-song-official-announcement">announced an “indefinite delay” of the Xbox version of its game</a>. In <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1830677183695667270">a statement on social media</a>, the developers at Jyamma Games said that they want to bring the game to Xbox as fast as possible but that “this task is nearly impossible with Microsoft taking months to reply to us when we have the game ready for submission.” The developers then implored fans to reach out to Xbox on their behalf, ostensibly to get the ball moving.</p><p>The two Capcom collections include 15 games, featuring arcade classics like <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</em>, <em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em>, <em>Capcom vs. SNK, Power Stone</em>, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is taking <em>Concord, </em>its latest PlayStation game, offline on September 6th, following poor sales of the game. The first-person hero shooter&nbsp;launched exclusively on PS5 and PC on August 23rd, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing?utm_source=twitter">estimates have put sales</a> at under 25,000. <em>Concord </em>also only managed to hit an all-time peak of 697 players on Steam, lower than the launch peak of <em>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum — </em>widely regarded as the worst game of 2023.</p><p>“We have decided to take the game offline beginning September 6, 2024, and explore options, including those that will better reach our players,” says <em>Concord game</em> director Ryan Ellis in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">PlayStation blog post</a>. “While we determine the best path ahead, <em>Concord </em>sales will cease immediately and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased the game for PS5 or PC.”</p><p>If you purchased the game for PS5 from the PlayStation Store, a refund will be issued to your original payment method. If you purchased<em> Concord</em> on Steam, you’ll get a refund in the coming days, and the same will occur on the Epic Games Store. </p><p><em>Concord </em>launched as a $40 game after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-live-service-hero-shooter-concord-has-been-in-development-for-around-8-years">eight years of development</a> and went up against many free-to-play alternatives like <em>Overwatch </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211812/valorant-console-launch-xbox-series-s-x-ps5-download">even <em>Valorant</em></a><em> </em>in the competitive hero shooter genre. It has ultimately failed to compete as a paid game, especially without a unique selling point. </p><p>Firewalk Studios’ mention of options “that will better reach our players” and the refunds make it seem like <em>Concord</em>, if it does return, will move to a free-to-play model. “We’ll keep you updated and thank you again to all the Freegunners who have joined us in the <em>Concord </em>galaxy,” says Ellis.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
