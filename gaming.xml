            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fortnite-cursed-sails-event-now-live/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-awaited Cursed Sails event for <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-guidelines-frequent-crashes-ifortnite-intel-14th-gen-13th-gen-cpus/">Fortnite</a> is now live. Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean is the next collaboration in-game, with players now able to live out their swashbuckling dreams by exploring Shipwreck Shallows and hunting for buried treasure.</p>
<p>With this <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/disneys-pirates-of-the-caribbean-docks-into-fortnite-br?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shiny new event</a> comes quests for players to complete, titled Cursed Sails quests. With this event comes a battle pass, where completing Cursed Sails quests will net you rewards from the Cursed Sails Pass. Completing the Cursed Sails quests will give you access to the Cursed Gold currency, the point system where you can unlock rewards from the battle pass.&nbsp; The battle pass features 11 unlockable cosmetics on the free track, meaning you don't have to miss out on looking the part of a pirate.</p>
<p>As with any battle pass, a free track allows players to unlock certain rewards, but they typically aren't as high rarity or high value as the paid track on the battle pass. By completing quests and unlocking the free tracks of the pass, you can expect to get items such as Jack's Cutlass, Bane Pickaxe, and Jack's Prize Back Bling.</p>
<p>For those who have purchased the battle pass for this event, you will instantly unlock Jack Sparrow's entire outfit. The premium track can net you rewards such as the Jar of Dirt Emote, Jack's Compass Back Bling, and many more Pirates of the Carribean-themed cosmetics. Additionally, you'll be able to get your hands on LEGO Jack Sparrow, where you can take him into LEGO Islands and LEGO Fortnite if you want a blockier experience.</p>
<p>While this event may feel similar to Wrecked, you will get to explore many new vessels that hide plenty of secrets along the way.</p>
<p>Participating in the event means you'll get to explore exclusive features that appear. For example, you may find a Ship in a Bottle when looting the vessels. By breaking it open, you can summon a Ghost Ship, which can crash into your opponents to deal devastating damage.</p>
<p>You can also have a blast with the event by jumping into a Pirate Cannon, launching you skyward and sending you a fair distance across the map. You can also move the Pirate Cannon around to choose where to aim and fire, giving you and your teammates the advantage of exploring uncharted territory.</p>
<p>Additionally, released in conjunction with this event, you can purchase cosmetic packs of Elizabeth Swann, Captain Barbossa, and Davy Jones, all of which come with their LEGO counterparts.</p>

<p>If you're curious but don't necessarily want to buy the game right away, EA Play subscribers have access to a 10-hour trial right now; Game Pass Ultimate members have this benefit as well since the membership includes EA Play.</p><p>College Football 25 is already doing well, as the game reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-hits-2-million-players-before-official-launch/1100-6525147/" data-ref-id="1100-6525147">2.2 million unique players during the early-access window</a>, while another 600,000 people have tried the EA Play trial.</p><p>EA's last college football game before this was 2013's NCAA Football 14. EA and the NCAA broke off their partnership due to a variety of reasons, including legal problems and lawsuits. Instead, EA brokered separate licensing deals to feature all 134 FBS schools in College Football 25. And in a major change, EA is paying athletes to be in the game as part of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals.</p><p>College Football 25 is available on console for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but not last-gen consoles, PC, or Nintendo Switch.</p><p>If you're just getting started with College Football 25, you may want to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-day-preorder-buying-guide/1100-6525115/" data-ref-id="1100-6525115">College Football 25 launch guide</a>.</p><p>You can see a sampling of review scores for College Football 25 below.

You can see sweat on individual players, the lighting is exceptional, and everything pops visually in a way that Madden just doesn’t. There’s also just a lot more stuff to enjoy, from the unique intros for each team as they take the field to mascots dancing around when their school pulls off a big play." -- <em>Will Borger </em>[<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Forbes -- 8.5/10</h2><p>"When I heard EA was bringing college football back, I was fully prepared to play a game of Madden with college uniforms. In all honesty, I would have played it and been mildly satisfied. EA delivered a much deeper experience that easily carves its own identity in every way possible. Once EA learns its way around the restrictions of the NIL situation, the series will go to an even higher level." -- <em>Brian Mazique </em>[<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2024/07/19/ea-college-football-25-review-the-good-the-bad-and-the-bottom-line/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2><strong>Polygon - No score</strong></h2><p>It’s a testament to what is possible with sports games when teams have longer than a few months to crank out AAA titles. And if this is the foundation for future college football games, then the series is in a very, very good place." -- <em>Matt Brown </em>[<a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/24201283/ea-sports-college-football-25-review-ncaa-ps5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2><strong>GamesRadar -- 4.5/5</strong></h2><p>"From nowhere, it's suddenly the sports game that all others have to beat." -- <em>Ben Wilson </em>[<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/college-football-25-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2><strong>Hardcore Gamer -- 4.5/5</strong></h2><p>"EA put all of its chips into College Football 25, and it truly paid off. People are buying consoles just to play this game. It's a cultural phenomenon and the experience that's provided isn't replicated anywhere else. All the new additions to help make the game stand out including Wear and Tear, Turbo Mode, different coverage shells and added hot routes for pre-play, and basically everything added isn't just a gimmick, it's a substantial change. While some bugs and logic need to be addressed, College Football 25 is undoubtedly the most fun football game to come out in years. Everything College Football is here." -- <em>Cory Wells </em>[<a href="https://hardcoregamer.com/college-football-25-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/tsukihimes-turned-me-into-visual-novel-fan<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While the rest of the world was playing <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, </em>I was playing <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legendary-visual-novel-tsukihime-piece-of-blue-glass-moon-gets-first-english-trailer">Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-</a>. </em></p>
<p>Obviously, these games are on completely opposite sides of the spectrum. One is this highly involved, hard-as-nails action game. The other is a visual novel, more similar to reading a book than it is playing a video game. Yet, I haven't been this hooked on a game in years. <em>Tsukihime,</em> you convinced me: Visual novels are freakin' awesome.</p>
<p><em>Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon- </em>is a rather obscure title for those unfamiliar with visual novels, but it came to my attention after diving headfirst into the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fatesamurai-remnant-review-musou-holy-grail"><em>Fate</em></a> franchise. <em>Tsukihime</em> shares the same universe, so I already had a bit of familiarity with the subject matter, though if you want to go in blind, this is a perfectly fine experience on its own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-narative.jpg?itok=5n2pq32J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-narative.jpg?itok=w7nf8wwh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nasu's known for a certain writing style, and if "edgy" is what you'd call it, hey, count me in.</figcaption></figure><h2>Visual Novels Like <em>Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon- </em>Might Just Put You in a Trance</h2>
<p>This particular version of <em>Tsukihime</em> is a remake that originally released in Japan in 2021, but the West finally received an official English release in June 2024. I admit, I was very apprehensive. My previous foray into visual novels wasn't as enjoyable as I would have wanted, but like any piece of media, sometimes it takes a few tries before you find something that clicks.</p>
<p>And click, <em>Tsukihime </em>did. This visual novel is a treat to the eyes and ears, immersing the player in a narrative filled with magic, vampires, and plenty of emotional twists and turns. And that's the thing: I normally wouldn't attribute "immersive" to a very passive experience like a visual novel, but<em> Tsukihime</em> achieves just that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-narrative-2.jpg?itok=qHrlhiJT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-narrative-2.jpg?itok=q4usgo74 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shiki isn't your normal high schooler.</figcaption></figure><p>Exceptional voice acting with polished character art and backgrounds accompany words on the screen, and this combination creates a clear and cohesive image in my head as I read. Though there's little motion to these images, in my mind I can see this living and breathing world <em>Tsukihime</em> so clearly conveys.</p>
<p>Sound effects and music coalesce with the narrative as you read, putting me in a dream-like trance. These aspects of <em>Tsukihime</em> might sound like any other visual novel, but as someone who has little to no experience with the medium, the psychological aspects of reading took me by surprise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-vlov-2.jpg?itok=jiNxaKES 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-vlov-2.jpg?itok=zNENrI72 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Action-packed moments are still a thing, despite being a visual novel.</figcaption></figure><h2>Find Yourself a Story with a Hook</h2>
<p>Of course, <em>Tsukihime</em>'s story is what keeps me coming back. You play through the eyes of Shiki Tohno, an anemic high schooler with a very powerful supernatural ability: the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception. Shiki can see red lines marked on every object and living thing in the world -- these are lines of death which, when severed, mark a permanent end for whatever it was on.</p>
<p>The player learns more about Mystic Eyes of Death Perception and the effect it has on Shiki and those around him. When Shiki gained these eyes after a horrific accident during his childhood, he was warned it may attract other "strange" things. After being outcast from his insanely rich family's mansion, he is summoned to the mansion a decade later to take up the role as eldest son once more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-dialogue.jpg?itok=_Yg_8v_A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-dialogue.jpg?itok=7pbBOJlN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tsukihime</em> takes time to brief the player on the world, and worldbuilding is exactly my cup of tea.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Tsukihime</em> takes a bit to ramp up, but the visual novel takes many unexpected turns. Vampires and some of the most bombastic fights in fiction are thrown in the player's face as the combination of voice acting, detailed visuals, and well-written dialogue constantly barrage the player in its latter half.</p>
<p>To dive into more detail on the characters and scenes in <em>Tsukihime</em>, well, we'd be here all day. And look, this is not a short experience -- with three different endings, it'll probably take up to 40 hours to finish everything.</p>
<p>So I'll keep it brief and say, I did not expect to get so emotionally involved in a game, much less a visual novel. In fact, few pieces of media hit me as hard as <em>Tsukihime</em> did. A key character, Arcueid, well, her story was so potent to me, I had to emotionally detach myself from the visual novel so it didn't make me a mess. And that is when I realized, if visual novels can do this to me, what else might there be in store?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-flowchart.jpg?itok=7gL0LYRW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-flowchart.jpg?itok=SBv2h1se 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is the flowchart feature, allowing you to jump to previous scenes.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Tsukihime </em>Came Equipped With Handy Tools for Beginners</h2>
<p>Visual novels are already a bit light on gameplay features, but <em>Tsukihime</em> makes things a breeze if this is your first foray into a the genre. There's the bare minimum you'd expect (a reading log, quick save and quick loads), but also other inclusions that made this much more accessible. It was a misconception of mine to go in expecting visual novels to be clunky, but everything flows very well.</p>
<p>There's a flowchart that allows players to jump around the story with ease, collecting new scenes or, if you have a change of heart or even <em>die</em> in the story, allows for a way to fix your mistakes. Though, if you do die, it'll give you tips on how to change your fate, which is also very appreciated as a newcomer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-accessibility.jpg?itok=ahAlWMLr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-accessibility.jpg?itok=h49xs7la 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's some handy features to make your reading experience smoother.</figcaption></figure><p>Other than that, there are three endings which means three routes, but a decent amount of overlap in the beginning. There's a feature that can automatically skip dialogue you've seen, and you can also adjust the speed in which new dialogue is shown. You can finely tune the timing on these, so developer Type-Moon clearly tried to make this as welcoming an experience as possible.</p>
<p>It was my fault for discounting visual novels as "not for me." If you find yourself in the same shoes, you might just be surprised. Pick up a visual novel with a subject matter that appeals to you -- it doesn't have to be <em>Tsukihime </em>-- and devote yourself to it like it's a great novel. You might just be surprised by how powerful visual novels can be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/19/the-ftc-pushes-back-against-xbox-game-pass-price-increases<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, Xbox <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/10/price-increases-and-new-tiers-are-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">announced</a> it was introducing new Game Pass tiers and raising its subscription prices for existing members on September 12. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took issue with these changes in a filing yesterday to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Microsoft revealed a new tier called <strong>Xbox Game Pass Standard</strong>, a $15 monthly subscription for new members that excludes day-one releases, EA Play, PC Game Pass, and cloud gaming. <strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</strong>, which includes those perks, will have its monthly price raised from $17 to $20. <strong>Xbox&nbsp;Game Pass Core</strong>, which only offers online play and a smaller library, is raising its yearly sub from $60 to $75 (the $10 monthly fee remains unchanged). <strong>PC Game Pass</strong> is increasing from $10 per month to $12.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the $10.99 <strong>Game Pass for Console</strong> is no longer be available to new subscribers as of July 10. If existing subscribers fail to renew their membership, they will be permanently locked out of this tier and must subscribe to another, more expensive membership.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>In the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453.121.0_1.pdf">filing</a>, the FTC blasts Microsoft’s discontinuation of Game Pass for Console, stating that users must pay a substantial price increase (81%) to switch to Game Pass Ultimate. Those unwilling to do so must settle for Game Pass Standard, which the FTC describes as a “degraded product” since it excludes day-one releases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“[Game Pass Standard] costs 36% more than Console Game Pass, and withholds day-one releases. Product degradation—removing the most valuable games from Microsoft’s new service—combined with price increases for existing users, is exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged."</p>

<p>The FTC was the primary opposition against Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and sees this move as proof of its concerns over the purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs[…]—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger.”</p>

<p>The FTC goes on to call the price increases "inconsistent" with the case Microsoft made during the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/07/11/microsoft-and-xbox-win-case-against-ftc-to-acquire-activision-blizzard">Xbox FTC trial last year</a>. It states, "Microsoft promised that 'the acquisition would benefit consumers by making [CoD] available on Microsoft’s Game Pass on the day it is released on console (with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition).' Microsoft’s post-merger actions thus vindicate the congressional design of preliminarily halting mergers to fully evaluate their likely competitive effects, and judicial skepticism of promises inconsistent with a firm’s economic incentives."</p>

<p>That last portion references&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-set-for-october" target="_blank">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s (the first new entry to release post-acquisition) October 25 launch on Game Pass Ultimate, roughly a month after the subscription tier's price increase.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-gets-rated-by-esrb-for-pc-ps5-xbox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The US Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39965/hunt-showdown-1896/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> Hunt: Showdown 1986 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Here's the description of the game (which received a Mature 17+ rating):</p>
<p><em>This is a first-person monster hunting game set in a fantastical version of the Victorian era. Players use bladed bats, clubs, brass knuckles, and pistols to kill zombie-like creatures and human rivals. Combat is highlighted by impact sounds, gunfire, and blood-splatter effects. Some weapons allow players to cave in zombies' heads or to cut off their limbs. One type of zombie explodes into blood and viscera when killed; another type is depicted wearing human skin as a cape.</em></p>
<p>Notably, this is a separate listing from Hunt: Showdown. Before you dream of a sequel, though, Crytek General Manager David Fifield <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crytek-will-never-replace-hunt-showdown-with-hunt-2-the-way-overwatch-2-did-overwatch-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Rock, Paper, Shotgun in late 2023 that such a thing was not at all in the plans:</p>
<p><em>I would say we would even be less aggressive than Overwatch or, you know, Destiny 2. No, we have no plans for Hunt 2. We just plan to keep going forward. </em><em>You could say that chapter two of Fortnite was Fortnite 2 - they made a new island, they radically overhauled a whole, giant part of all its systems, but they just called it chapter two of a game called Fortnite. So that seems to be more the trend that we'll follow, when updating Hunt: Showdown.</em></p>
<p><em>If we talked about other products in the Hunt franchise, they wouldn't be replacements to Hunt: Showdown, they'd be brand extensions. Here's another game you could make in the Hunt universe, but that game wouldn't be meant to replace Hunt: Showdown, the thing people play.</em></p>
<p>So, maybe Hunt: Showdown 1896 is going to be a brand extension, as suggested a while ago by Fifield. Or, more likely, this is simply the rebrand of the game itself. The developers have hinted at such a thing, and we already know that next month, they will <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-ps5-xbox-series-x-update-release-date-support-xbox-one-ps4-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add</a> proper PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X support while dropping old-generation consoles, which are indeed absent in the ESRB listing.</p>
<p>Either way, big changes are on the way for the game.</p>

<p>The EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) marketing director at Xbox says that the company “isn’t blessed” with a large budget in the region, leading to PlayStation outspending them on marketing in the region.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/xboxs-marketing-boss-fight-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marketing Week</a>, Michael Flatt said that Xbox needs to “work really hard” against the competition. That work includes being “quite scrappy”.</p>



<p>“They’re [PlayStation] blessed with marketing funds that we’re just not able to enjoy,” Flatt said. “But that’s totally fine. We adopt what I would call a more fiscally responsible approach to media investments.”</p>

<p>He continued: “We’re not blessed with huge media budgets, so we have to be quite scrappy really, and quite tenacious to fight for funds that would probably go somewhere else.”</p>



<p>This interview comes after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-stop-pushing-xbox-consoles-in-europe-other-regions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims of Microsoft looking to stop</a> pushing console sales in the EMEA region. Instead, Xbox will reportedly put more of a focus on Game Pass, Cloud Gaming, PC, and Xbox controllers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/building-a-new-star-wars-moon-for-outlaws-ign-first<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At the very heart of Star Wars Outlaws is the fantasy that all sci-fi fans dream of: the ability to adventure across the stars. Five different moons and planets await you, from Rise of Skywalker’s chilly Kijimi to the classic deserts of Tatooine. But while fans will recognise many of Outlaws’ locations, there’s one that they definitely won’t: Toshara. </p><p>A brand new moon crafted especially for Star Wars Outlaws by the development team at Massive Entertainment, Toshara is inspired by the East African savannah. But while it has uniquely beautiful landscapes, it is – aptly for a game called ‘Star Wars Outlaws’ – a criminal hive. </p><p>“It's run by a corrupt imperial governor,” says Navid Khavari, Outlaws’ narrative director. “And while the Empire is in charge, this is also a hub of scum and villainy, and you have all the sorts of major syndicates trying to vie for a stake of Toshara.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/starwarsoutlaws-newmoon-landscape-1720445484854.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Toshara is inspired by savannah regions such as Tanzania. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>To ensure Toshara is as immersive and authentic as possible, Massive approached the moon from all angles. “We had to work out the demographics of the planet,” Khavari explains. “We had to work out what the major hubs are. We had to work out fauna, flora, all of these sections that needed to come together and also be weaved by narratives.”  </p><p>But before all that, Massive had to pitch Toshara to the custodians of Star Wars: Lucasfilm. Because Toshara isn’t just a location for a video game; anything in Star Wars Outlaws is canon, and so whatever Massive made would need to be fully approved by the people behind the films, shows, and Star Wars universe at large. </p><p>“It's like they're giving us a box of toys, we take the toys out, play with them, but then we also create our new toys and put them back for somebody else to play,” says Benedikt Podlesnigg, art and world director on Star Wars Outlaws. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While the Empire is in charge, this is also a hub of scum and villainy.</p></div><p>A major player in such a process is Steve Blank, director of franchise content and strategy at Lucasfilm. “Massive came to us with the idea of a savannah planet,” he recalls. “Once we sort of knew the high level intention behind the story and where we wanted to go, we let them ruminate on what does that mean? What would you like to see? What do you feel like you haven't seen before?”</p><p>The result of those conversations was a collection of unusual and familiar ideas. Massive wanted Toshara to be a world where the Star Wars mythology’s pirate-inspired elements could live – think Jabba’s barge and Luke being forced to walk the plank over a sarlacc pit. This had to be a place of high risk, high reward treasure hunting. And so was born the so-called gem of the underworld; a moon ruled by a corrupt division of the Empire and largely controlled by the galaxy’s crime syndicates. But it wasn’t enough to develop lore. The team had to start with the look and feel of the very ground itself. </p><p>“We approached Toshara in terms of the general Star Wars design tenets, where it has to be familiar but with a twist,” explains Julian Gerighty, creative director of Outlaws. The familiar is the landscapes of Tanzania, which Podlesnigg says would be the shooting location for Tosharan scenes if Outlaws were a movie. Layered on top of this is the twist: “huge mountain outcrops that have been carved so that a city can take place within those rock walls,” describes Gerighty. And then, within that rock, is Toshara’s most distinct characteristic: amberine. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/starwarsoutlaws-newmoon-city-1720445391303.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The crime-ridden city of Mirogana is built inside the amberine outcrops of a mountain. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Amberine is an orange, crystal-like material that runs through the crust of Toshara and juts out through its surface. Inspired by an old Austrian fortune-telling tradition in which molten lead is poured into cold water to create shapes that reveal what’s to come, the Amberine forms into a variety of striking forms. It is Blank’s favourite part of Massive’s new world. </p><p>“You find [amberine structures] sort of wherever you're going,” he says. “They're inside caves, they form plateaus [...] and they also react beautifully to the sun over Toshara, so you get these gorgeous reflections in the lighting.” </p><p>Unusually for Star Wars, amberine isn’t a precious resource like spice or Beskar Steel, and so Toshara’s population has left it untouched and intact. That’s not to say the crystal is useless, though. The moon’s climate is incredibly windy, and those winds erode away rocks, cliff faces, even mountains – a process that gradually reveals the incredibly resilient amberine within. It made sense, then, that Toshara’s main metropolis, the city of Mirogana, would be built within an amberine structure to protect it from the winds. </p><p>Basking within the orange glow cast by sunlight filtering through that amberine shield is the Pyke Syndicate, the most dominant of Mirogana’s criminal organisations. But don’t let them put you off visiting; the city’s busy streets are full of opportunities for both a galactic scoundrel scouting for gigs, and a player looking to diversify their experience.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The first thing that you should do as a scoundrel is go to the cantina.</p></div><p>“Every single location we had to choose had to be a den of scum and villainy, right? And in Mirogana you can do a lot of things,” says Gerighty. “There's the first thing that you should do as a scoundrel, as an outlaw, is go to the cantina. And in the cantina you'll find lots of shady characters that'll offer you jobs. Or you can just relax, eavesdrop, pick up some intel, play a couple of games of sabacc, bet on the Fathier races, play some arcade games…” </p><p>Beyond the cantina you’ll find a city split into several regions, each with their own flavour. The gambling district is constructed using different architecture and signage to the central market, while the Imperial checkpoint is built out of the Empire’s instantly recognisable flat panels and grid vents. No matter where you find an Imperial base on Toshara, it’ll stick out like a sore thumb. </p><p>“They come in, they don't care about their environment, they just stamp down their base wherever they need,” says Podlesnigg. He paints a picture of a time when the Tosharan landscape featured a colossal amberine archway, but when the Empire arrived they simply demolished the arch to make way for the base. In the game, you’ll be able to see that very base flanked by two amberine pillars – all that remains of that historic arch. “It creates a really interesting visual that's seen from far away that you can really use as a landmark.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/starwarsoutlaws-imperialcompoundconceptart-1720425543767.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A Tosharan Imperial Base, flanked by the remains of an amberine arch. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Beyond the city’s borders, the aforementioned winds have eroded away the moon’s rock surface to reveal even more unusual amberine formations. A resourceful outlaw with a speeder bike could use such formations to hit even greater speeds during hot pursuits. </p><p>“It's very orange glowing, so it stands out very naturally in the environment,” says Podlesnigg. “So we could make ramps where you can jump off [while riding the speeder bike]. We made the wind tunnels where you can see [how they have been] carved out by the winds. I think one of the references was surfing underneath waves.” </p><p>In the process of planning out Toshara’s geography, Massive went as far as establishing that the moon’s wind currents all run north to south. This dictated the map’s population density, road networks, audio design, and – importantly – the formation of the speed-boosting wind tunnels. And so while the amberine ramps and tunnels may be a gameplay-first element, it’s all created hand-in-hand with world-building. </p><p>“For every location, no matter how small, we want to think about what happened here, what is happening now, and what is the location in general? What [do] people do here?” explains Podlesnigg. “So we have a very clear idea of the history of the place and what the place is.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For every location, no matter how small, we want to think about what happened here, what is happening now?</p></div><p>A skilled outlaw can harness the moon’s winds for their benefit, but not everyone is prepared to tackle such a climate. Echoing the derelict Star Destroyer on Jakku in The Force Awakens, Toshara is littered with crashed starships. They’re the remnants of those who tried to fight the winds and lost. It’s a smart bit of environmental storytelling, but the tale doesn’t end there. Those shipwrecks have become part of Toshara’s history and economy; with nothing but rock and amberine available to the moon’s population, the crashed ships were harvested for metal which was then used to construct many of the buildings you’ll see and explore.  </p><p>With so much of Toshara’s environment being made up of harsh rock, crashed spaceships, and strange amberine structures, the finishing touch had to be something much more alive and endearing. While the crime syndicates may be the planet’s apex predators, there are plenty of other creatures in the wilds to discover and befriend. Podlesnigg describes a magpie-like flying creature that’s “attracted by everything that sparkles, and they steal everything.” It’s an amusing trait, but one that folds directly into gameplay: “When you see them circling somewhere, maybe you can go there and find something of value.”</p><p>A cuter friend can be found in Toshara's weasel-like creatures, small pettable animals that will follow you around in groups. We can only hope that we’ll be able to round up a dozen and cause chaos in a cantina… </p><p>Toshara has yet more secrets to be discovered, but we won’t know this new moon’s best treasures until we explore it ourselves when Star Wars Outlaws arrives on August 30.

This gives you a new option to focus one of these weapons outside of Nightfalls, although you will need to have unlocked its pattern already before you can do so, and you'll need several Nightfall Ciphers to do so.

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

                <p>Prime Video's The Boys TV series wrapped up its fourth season this week, and the season went out with a bang. Now, the show's creator and showrunner has provided a peek behind the curtain of how the most climatic part of the finale was created, and it's getting people talking about the possibility of a video game based on The Boys. <strong>Major s</strong><strong>poilers follow below.</strong></p><p>Eric Kripke revealed that the team works with Cncpt Studio to create detailed CG pre-visualizations for major scenes prior to filming, and this was the case for the season finale. Creating a pre-vis sequence like this can help the team decide on camera positions, lens, and coverage, Kripke said, all without having actors rehearse in person. Peter Jackson famously used pre-vis animatics to plan out some of its biggest and most complicated scenes as well. Many Hollywood productions do this.</p><p>For the season finale of The Boys, Kripke enlisted Cncpt's help for the pivotal sequence where Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) launches tentacles out of his chest and uses them to rip the would-be president Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) in half. Cncpt's pre-vis of this sequence is pretty impressive in its own right, featuring all the main characters and their movements from the scene in pretty solid detail.</p><p>"Our team is amazing," Kripke said of the work. Take a look at the video for yourself below.</p><p>The impressive-looking character models have people calling on Prime Video to make a video game based on The Boys. It remains to be seen if that would ever happen, and the rights might be a little complicated given that The Boys is produced by Sony Pictures Television for Prime Video. Both Sony and Amazon have their own dedicated gaming divisions, too.</p><p>Characters from The Boys have already come to video games, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-brings-back-the-boys-dlc-soon-along-with-these-unexpected-bundles/1100-6523618/" data-ref-id="1100-6523618">Homelander, Starlight, and Black Noir were added to Call of Duty as playable characters</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-teaser-shows-first-look-at-homelander-in-action/1100-6523183/" data-ref-id="1100-6523183">Homelander alone came to Mortal Kombat. </a></p><p>The Boys will return for one final season to come, but it won't be here anytime soon. In the meantime, fans can look forward to Gen V Season 2 at some point sooner.

			<p>Honkai: Star Rail is one of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/honkai-star-rail-five-tips-on-getting-started/"> more popular games</a> created by miHoYo. Released in 2023, it has received consistent updates that add new content and banners for players to try and roll for. The latest update for Honkai: Star Rail, <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article_pre/15787?utm_campaign=link&amp;utm_id=6&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=sns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 2.4</a>, is set to be released on July 31. The full title for this update is "Finest Duel Under The Pristine Blue."</p>
<p>This update shows the crew of the Astral Express heading back into familiar territory as they return to Xianzhou Luofu. On this journey, they will meet old and new friends as they attend the Wardance ceremony. Along with the event of the Wardance ceremony, two new characters will be joining the roster.&nbsp; The Ambrosial Arbor crisis has now been resolved, and people can celebrate with the Wardance ceremony. This ceremony commemorates the Reighbow Arbiter and the Cloud Knight's defeat of the Abominations of Abundance.</p>
<p>At the festival, players will get to reunite with fan favorites such as Yanqing and be introduced to significant figures in the story, such as General Feixiao of Xianzhou Yaoqing and General Huaiyan of Xianzhou Yaoqing, known as Merlin's Claw and Flaming Heart, respectively.</p>
<p>This update sees the introduction of Yunli and Jiaoqiu. Alongside the introduction of these two characters in Honkai: Star Rail 2.4, a brand new map will appear with tons of buried secrets for players to explore—the map that is being introduced in the Honkai: Star Rail update 2.4 is titled "The Shackling Prison," where players will get to learn more about the atrocities that go on beneath the surface in the prison that holds the most formidable criminals. To be able to access this area, you'll have to go beneath the waters of Scalegorge Waterscape. This area is full of mystery and intrigue, and has many secrets for players to uncover.</p>
<p>Yunli is one of the brand-new characters to be added to Honkai: Star Rail and she is the treasured granddaughter of Flaming Heart General Huaiyan. Yunli has a lot of exciting new abilities that players will get to experiment with, such as her Parry state and her unique Counter ability.</p>
<p>In addition to Yunli being added to the game, Jiaoqiu will also make their arrival representing the Xiaozhou Yaoqing delegates. Jiaoqiu experiments with alchemy and fire, and has their unique debuff that they can inflict on enemies called "Ashen Roast." This huge update to Honkai: Star Rail will be released on July 31, with a Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works] collaboration also teased by miHoYo. However, this collaboration is not due to arrive until Q3 2025.</p>
<p>In other news, the developer has recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/zenless-zone-zero-the-perfect-gacha-game-for-those-who-dont-like-gachas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, which is yet another <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-reaches-50-million-global-downloads-hoyoverses-latest-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global hit</a> from the studio.</p>

From worst to best, the levels are: Hated, Disliked, Neutral, Liked, and Respectable. </p><p>The level is determined by a 100-point scale, with each level having a specific range. For example, Neutral is between 40 and 60. Whenever Geralt enters a new region the reputation will start at Neutral, so you don’t have to worry about being public enemy number one from the start. Doing Witcher contracts as well as winning horse/boat races or fist fights will boost your reputation. Some main quests will also have an impact on reputation depending on your choices, and if you steal or swing your weapon in front of guards, you’ll lose reputation points. The system looks to punish (or reward) you by focusing consequences on the place that matters, your wallet. Better reputation levels will give you a discount at shops while letting you sell items for a higher price. The opposite is true if Geralt isn’t popular with the locals. </p><hr><p>The mod claims it restores this system after CDPR cut it from the game at some point in development. <em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to CD Projekt Red for confirmation or comment.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Our former editor Katharine "Thorsbane" Castle has long since quit these turgid shores for the sunny uplands of Eurogamer, where the consoles multiply like rabbits, but her legacy endures. For instance, it's thanks to her that I know and am excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roots-of-yggdrasil">Roots of Yggdrasil</a>, a roguelike deck-and-city-builder which casts you as a posse of vikings in a flying longship, touching down on floating islands to found a quick settlement and harvest some magic before the apocalypse - here known as the Ginnungagap, a swirling purple void - catches up with them.</p>
<p>Katharine called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roots-of-yggdrasils-gorgeous-roguelike-citybuilding-is-a-real-grower">"a real grower"</a> before the early access release in January, likening it to both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-banished-vault">The Banished Vault</a> - a chalk and cheese comparison if ever I heard one. Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.</p><!--more-->
<p>"We had planned another patch before releasing 1.0, but as we worked on it, we realized bundling all the changes together made way more sense," developers ManaVoid Entertainment comment in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2071430/view/4190113770900051871?l=english">a Steam post</a>. "That means the next patch is going to be BIG." Here's what you can expect: new events, including new characters to bandy words with from biome to biome, and new Runic Stones, which can be used to add keywords to your cards. For example, if you stick "Retain" on a card, it'll stay in your hand at the end of your turn.</p><p>There will be new building cards, too, such as raiding camp and cart maker, and a fourth playable scion to unlock, with their own story and quest. Existing characters will get endings for their story quests. Quality of life improvements include cleaned-up scion blurbs when preparing for each run, and a clearer presentation of whether your scion or housing will level up if you succeed at a trial.</p>
<p>They've also rebalanced the Holt environment that forms the persistent and evolving staging area for this particular roguelike. "Overall, we felt the progression was a bit too slow and also too restrictive," the devs explain. "Expect less requirements on Holt buildings in the future and more ways to obtain amenity tags. We also don't plan to wipe anything, so if a building you placed gets rebalanced, you'll be able to simply remove it and replace it elsewhere if you prefer!"</p>
<p>All this comes with the caution that the game's price will increase "slightly" when it leaves early access. But there will be a launch discount, too, so you hopefully won't suffer if you hold off till September. Anybody here played this recently? How has the early access build come along since Katharine's day?</p>

            <p>
Following a bit of a tease at least year's BlizzCon, Blizzard has given Overwatch 2's 41st hero the full reveal treatment. And that's not all! Juno, as the shooter's new Martian space ranger is known, is available to play today for a limited-time.
</p>
<p>
When Blizzard first teased Juno last year, she was known only by the codename Space Ranger. It was, however, confirmed, she'd be Overwatch's first Martian character, as well as a "highly mobile support hero". Eight months later and we now have a much clearer idea of who Juno is, as well as what she can do, thanks to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GspacNMHSbM">brand-new gameplay trailer</a> showcasing her abilities.
</p>
<p>
Sporting a kind of retrofuturistic look, complete with jet-infused roller-boots and a slinky ray gun, Juno leans heavily on speedy traversal. Her passive Martian Overboots ability can be triggered while airborne, enabling her to hover for a limited time, and it can be paired with her Glide Boost, allowing her glide horizontally with increased movement speed.
</p>

<p>
As for that ray gun, it's officially known as a Mediblaster, and its primary mode of fire is capable of healing allies and damaging enemies. Juno's secondary fire, meanwhile, takes the form of Pulsar Torpedoes - homing misses that can lock on to enemies and allies alike, harming or healing them respectively over time.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the gateway-like Hyper Ring, granting teammates a temporary speed boost as they pass on through, and her ultimate is the Orbital Ray. This massive beam from outer space travels forward, healing allies and increasing their damage as it goes.
</p>
<p>
Juno officially joins Overwatch 2 in Season 12, which begins on 20th August - but players can put her through her paces from today, 19th July, until 21st July on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC. She'll be available in all game modes except Competitive for the duration of her trial, as well as the No Limits mode in the Overwatch arcade.

As a result, yesterday representatives of publisher NetEase and its subsidiary, Starry Studio, posted on the massively popular 500,000-person <em>Once Human</em> Discord, begging fans to go to the game’s Steam review section to boost the rating to “positive” or higher.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20240718/40780_1167927.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20240718/40780_1167927.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But the game’s July 18 patch</a></span>, which was full of bug fixes, caused some unexpected problems. It has been essentially eating some players’ items when they tried to deposit them, and ruining some bases people had spent decent chunks of time building. This all came after extended server maintenance to complete the update in the first place. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6tjjc/after_patch_update_i_lost_my_home/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6tjjc/after_patch_update_i_lost_my_home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Players have since shared</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6ex5f/base_disappeared/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6ex5f/base_disappeared/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">images of busted homes</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6jtfz/my_friends_base_after_the_patch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6jtfz/my_friends_base_after_the_patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the <em>Once Human </em>subreddit</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/app/2139460/discussions/0/4515505180235671253/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2139460/discussions/0/4515505180235671253/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and Steam Page</a></span>,  asking one another for help getting them restored.  “Been walking around tonight thinking why do people build half bases without walls,” joked one player. “Now I know why.”</p><p>“We apologize for the inconvenience,” representatives for the game posted on the Discord today under the title,<strong> </strong>“Fixes for ‘Deposit Function Causing Item Loss’ and ‘Territory Module Loss’ Issues.” The developers added, “Both problems have been identified and are currently being resolved as quickly as possible.” <em>Once Human</em>’s developers said players who lost items will get them replaced through the in-game mail and all players impacted negatively by the patch will get “extra compensation.” </p><p>Amid this latest mess, the original post asking players for positive reviews was deleted (I only saw it initially because of the auto-ping notification from the Discord server). It’s unclear if there will be a new call-to-action  once the mini-crisis has fully-passed, or if NetEase has thought better of asking players to juice the Steam rating—a not altogether unreasonable ask given how many players do like the game, and the fact that it’s still being held down by unsubstantiated criticisms of<em> Once Human</em>’s data collection policies. </p><p>“Bad reviews like that can do so much harm to the game and might be the reason that it may die which I hope from the bottom of my heart that this will not happen,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e1b6r2/i_wish_the_reviews_would_get_positive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e1b6r2/i_wish_the_reviews_would_get_positive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one fan on the subreddit last week. And the tide does seem to be turning. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/?gad_source=1#app_reviews_hash&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/?gad_source=1#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Despite plenty of complaints</a></span> about the latest patch issues, most of the negative Steam reviews have begun tapering off. We’ll see how that holds up after <em>Once Human</em> reaches its first map and character reset at the end of August. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It didn’t work.</p><p>I purchased a copy of it when it launched in 2022, and sunk around 10 hours into it to mixed results. I definitely clicked with it here and there, but when it got tougher…I wasn’t here for it. Or, rather, other things in life grabbed my attention instead. Sure, I could see the appeal of mastering a tough challenge, but I already have my fair share of challenges in other hobbies and, well, <em>life </em>itself. So it drifted. I’d try it every now and then, including a few months ago, and just couldn’t get into it in a sustainable way.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559"><em>Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn: </em>The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>And then I played, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559">reviewed, <em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</em></a></span>. Like many soulslikes, it’s got its work cut out for it trying to make it in a genre with fans that have very discriminating, and often developer-specific, tastes. <em>Flintlock</em> is a much easier take on the <em>Souls</em> format though, and that really helped me cut to the chase a bit more, find the joy of more intentional combat and the dopamine drip that results from steadily moving through a world, one tough battle at a time. It was a nice set of training wheels for me and provided some joy on its own merits as well. And around halfway through that game, I felt a confident and excited urge to jump into one of FromSoftware’s masterpieces with the intention of finishing it. </p><p>That game turned out to be <em>Elden Ring</em>. I considered others, but the open, wandering spaces of <em>Elden Ring</em> feel a bit more inviting. I spun up a new character and have since sunk six hours into this fresh, new attempt. Having just gotten through a fight that literally took me around an hour and a half to complete, accompanied by a dear friend who’s willing to help me unpack the game’s cryptic systems and provide me with some encouragement, I think I’ve cracked it. I’ve got some good momentum. I understand this genre and this game better now. </p><p>Also, this playthrough of <em>Elden Ring</em> is coming at a time where I’m facing some steep personal challenges, unexpected failures, pains, and regrets. Yet, there’s opportunity and an uncertain future full of trials and struggles where I can easily see myself coming out intact and stronger. In getting sent to “You Died” screens constantly, with the courage to get up and do it again, I’m wondering if <em>Elden Ring</em>’s gonna have more to offer than just a fun, if not challenging, way to pass the time. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="209678f4949d13482011eb680facaf59" data-recommend-id="image://209678f4949d13482011eb680facaf59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A space explorer stares out at islands floating in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A space explorer stares out at islands floating in the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hello Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="209678f4949d13482011eb680facaf59" data-recommend-id="image://209678f4949d13482011eb680facaf59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A space explorer stares out at islands floating in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, Windows (Steam Deck OK)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Touch some alien grass and maybe some water too</p><p>I won’t claim to be an OG, but I’ve been on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/no-man-s-sky&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/no-man-s-sky"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a></span>’s side since the very beginning.

I’ve cheered it on through numerous of its updates, and even flirted with the possibility of coming back numerous times. The “Atlas Rises” update in particular, which added a whole new story to <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, was very enticing, but I stayed away for a bit longer. It wasn’t till the “Next” update that I booted the game back up, since it finally introduced proper multiplayer and overhauled the game to be <em>much </em>closer to the vision of it I’d always had.

Sure, I’ve been running through <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> for the past month-and-a-half at this point, slowly catching up to the recently released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-steam-reviews-1851570344&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-steam-reviews-1851570344"><em>Dawntrail</em></a></span>, but it’s time for something different. <em>FF11 </em>first released in 2002, and has been steadily getting updates ever since. At the start of this year, egged on by a great deal in the Steam winter sale, I purchased <em>FF11 </em>and dove in. My first foray into the dated MMO was spent struggling through the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-xi-log-in-process-sucks-man&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-xi-log-in-process-sucks-man" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frustrating set-up</a></span>, but I did eventually figure it out and start exploring the world with a friend. I declared that 2024 would be the year of <em>FF11</em>, at least for me. </p><p><br>In the months since I created my character, the constant itch to play <em>FF11 </em>has remained. That has only been enhanced by my time with <em>FF14</em>, which is a sleeker and more approachable MMO, but one that lacks the particular old-school charm of its online predecessor. <em>Final Fantasy 11</em>’s world of Vana’diel has a unique friction to it, something rooted in a more adversarial relationship with the player. Die too much and you can lose levels; enemies often drop loot in password protected chests you need to solve or watch disappear; and NPC party members must be recruited one-by-one through special missions. It makes every step of progress feel hard-earned in a way that I find extremely satisfying. The experience has been made easier in the two decades since the game’s original release (like the addition of the NPC party members), and there are plenty of helpful beginner’s guides out there. It would be perfect timing for any <em>FF14 </em>players, since<em> Dawntrail</em>’s Alliance Raids will be an homage to Vana’diel. — Willa Rowe  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5dd9100c576b70ef1df4625c3679b7c7" data-recommend-id="image://5dd9100c576b70ef1df4625c3679b7c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="928" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a speed run mode shows different game level selections from Nintendo's history." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a speed run mode shows different game level selections from Nintendo's history." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5dd9100c576b70ef1df4625c3679b7c7" data-recommend-id="image://5dd9100c576b70ef1df4625c3679b7c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="928" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a speed run mode shows different game level selections from Nintendo's history." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Switch<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Prove I’m the best around, and nothing’s gonna ever keep me down</p><p>In my NES-playing youth, it was common for me to make up my own challenges to tackle after I’d mastered a game the “normal” way. Can I beat <em>Mega Man 2 </em>mostly just using the Buster? Can I beat <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>without relying on mushrooms or other power-ups? Things like that. And I know I’m not the only one. In talking to others over the years, I’ve learned it was quite common for kids to devise challenges that gave us new goals to shoot for and lent new replay value to NES games we’d otherwise mastered. Now, Nintendo has put out its own collection of time-based challenges for its own first-party NES games (sorry, <em>Mega Man 2</em>), and I’ll be spending a fair chunk of this weekend seeing if I’ve still got the stuff. </p><p>Weirdly, despite being called <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition </em>(emphasis on “World Championships”), apparently there aren’t leaderboards for its many challenges, so you can’t actually compete directly with your friends or the wider world. (There is one weekly challenge everyone can participate in which <em>is </em>ranked, but, for now at least, that’s it.) This is an absolutely puzzling decision to me, albeit one that seems par for the course for Nintendo, which historically seems to struggle with implementing online features in a smart, player-friendly way. All week, as I’ve been anticipating this game, I’ve been thinking back on how the Xbox 360 era of Xbox Live was a golden age for leaderboard competition and online activity. It was a time when I gleefully invested hours in playing <em>Pac-Man CE </em>or <em>Geometry Wars </em>in an effort to surpass my friends on the high score charts, and I’d hoped this game might rekindle some of that competitive enthusiasm in me, but for NES games. It seems that’s not to be. </p><p>Still, I’m keeping an open mind. I love many of the games featured here—<em>Metroid</em>, <em>Zelda II</em>, <em>Donkey Kong</em>—and even those I don’t love (like <em>Ice Climber</em>) I think could be the stuff of entertaining one-off challenges, so I’m eager to jump in and see just what sorts of tests of skill Nintendo has devised. Perhaps my friends and I will just have to resort to sharing our best times in a group chat or something, which won’t be nearly as cool or seamless as doing so via an in-game leaderboard, but I’ll take what I can get. And I’m already thinking about how that <em>NES Edition </em>in the name implies that this may be the first of many. Nintendo, please, for the sake of all that is good and holy in this world, add proper leaderboards by the time you get around to making the <em>SNES </em>edition. Please! — Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0ccf586bb0d136eb6999b7bc34b8122a" data-recommend-id="image://0ccf586bb0d136eb6999b7bc34b8122a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Monsters pour forth from a portal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Monsters pour forth from a portal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0ccf586bb0d136eb6999b7bc34b8122a" data-recommend-id="image://0ccf586bb0d136eb6999b7bc34b8122a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Monsters pour forth from a portal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows (Steam Deck OK)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Get the Platinum trophy </p><p>If this were the PS2-era,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-tower-defense-hands-on-1851532868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-tower-defense-hands-on-1851532868"><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em></a></span><em> </em>would be one of those games that would have come out, been mostly ignored, and then disappeared only to live on in the memories of people who raved about it to anyone who would listen. Hell, it might never have gotten localized at all. But it’s 2024, and everyone will get a chance to give <em>Path of the Goddess</em> a try, and they should. Capcom’s mashup of tower defense and old-school arcade action games is dressed up in Japanese folklore with a vibrant art style and incredible soundtrack. It’s fun, meaty, and doesn’t try to do more than it can. It’s a refreshing departure from games that put big-budget presentation over compelling gameplay and pile on needless systems to pad out play time. </p><p>You play as a warrior named Soh, tasked with escorting a maiden down a mountain so she can purge the evil spirits that have infested it. You train villagers to take on specific roles, and then order them around the battlefield to fight off hordes of demons until the sun comes up. Between missions, you rebuild the villages you encounter to unlock new abilities, classes, and equipment. It’s a solid formula that sings thanks to crisp combat and attention to every little detail from the development team. You can feel the love, care, and creativity in even the smallest elements, especially the UI which is masterfully incorporated into the overall presentation. There are flaws and tedious parts to be sure, but for a $50 game (it’s also on Game Pass), <em>Path of the Goddess</em> nails everything it <em>needs</em> to do and more. — Ethan Gach </p><hr><p>And that wraps our picks for the weekend.

<p>EA Sports College Football 25 is officially available for everyone, but the success of the game has been going on for days. EA Sports has announced that 2.2 million unique players played College Football 25 during the three-day early access period. </p>



<p>On top of that 2.2 million players, another 600,000 players played via the EA Play 10-hour trial that was available.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-response-to-college-football-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming previously reported</a>, the original internal expectations for the game were to hit the mid-$100 million for revenue in order to be a “success”. That number, based on the player count who purchased the $99.99 Deluxe Edition, has already been surpassed. Just simple math puts the game at around $220 million in Deluxe Edition sales already.</p>



<p>“There was a feeling that we had something special based on the trailer views and interactions online, but the way it’s transitioned to actual sales and players has me lost for words,” one source said earlier this week.</p>



<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1813973638275850649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mat Piscatella of Circana</a> said that the game was third in US daily active users on Xbox behind just Call of Duty and Fortnite. On PlayStation 5, it was fourth behind Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Grand Theft Auto 5. </p>



<p>College Football 25 is available now for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>
