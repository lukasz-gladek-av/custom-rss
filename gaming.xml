            <p>Valve's Lionel Hutzes have been summoned to slide down the fireman's pole and deal with yet more legal wranglings involving the behemoth behind Steam. New York state attorney general Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against the company for allegedly violating gambling laws via the use of loot boxes in games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people," attorney general James writes in a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through">press release</a> announcing the suit's filing. "Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve’s illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers."</p>
<p>Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> are named directly in the release as games which, in the office of the attorney general's estimation following an investigation, "enable gambling by enticing users to pay for the chance to win a rare virtual item of significant monetary value".</p>
<p>"In Valve’s most popular game, the process resembles a slot machine, with an animated spinning wheel that eventually rests on a selected item," the release continues. "The randomly selected virtual items have no in-game functionality but can be sold online for money, with one item reportedly being sold for more than $1 million."</p><p>Counter-Strike gun and knife skins selling for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-casually-gut-counter-strikes-billion-dollar-skins-market-with-a-small-update">bananas real money sums</a> via third-party marketplaces is specifically mentioned further on, with the attorney general's office asserting the Valve "facilitates and even assists these third-party marketplaces in their operations". In addition to emphasising that she sees Valve's loot boxes of being "especially harmful to children", James also dips into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/academic-studies-of-violence-cause-violence">very</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-arent-we-discussing-videogame-violence">very</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/president-trump-showed-a-weird-frag-montage-in-his-video-game-violence-meeting">very</a> long-running talking point that is whether games with violent gunning in them are a factor in causing real life violent gunning.</p>
<p>"It is important to note that Valve’s promotion of games that glorify violence and guns helps fuel the dangerous epidemic of gun violence, particularly among young gamers who can become numbed to grave violence before their brains are fully developed," the attorney general alleges.</p>
<p>Overall, James' lawsuit seeks to "permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and pay fines for violating New York’s laws".</p>
<p>I've reached out to Valve for comment.</p>
<p>The lawyers of the company behind Steam certainly haven't been allowed to sit around and twiddle their thumbs in recent years. Just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-will-face-that-656m-uk-lawsuit-accusing-them-of-overcharging-steam-customers-as-tribunal-rules-it-can-go-ahead">last month</a>, a tribunal ruled that a £656 million UK lawsuit accusing them of using Steam's dominance over the PC market to act "anti-competitively", resulting in customers being overcharged, will go ahead to the next stages of the legal process.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's where to pick it up.</h2></p><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">February 27 is a special day in the Pokémon calendar, commemorating the release of the very first Pokémon games in Japan. Known to fans around the world as ‘Pokémon Day’, 2026 will be a special 30th anniversary celebration as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To celebrate, The Pokémon Company has recently dropped a 30th Anniversary Pokémon Day TCG Collection, featuring a specially stamped foil Pikachu promo card, a metallic coin featuring the 30th anniversary logo, and three booster packs from Phantasmal Flames and Mega Evolution.</p><div id="234519"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234519" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Pokémon Day 2026 Collection</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Proving a popular set, Pokémon TCG's 30th Anniversary TCG Collection is stocked at all major retailers. However, navigating the market requires a bit of strategy; prices are still fluctuating from the original launch price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the week following its release, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a07ekA?object_uuid=e35de0ab-d25e-4849-bb7b-c223bed34345&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGplayer</u></a> reported a low sale price of $18.79, but it's currently sitting at around $26-$27 market price. That’s a decent drop from the $50 pricing we were seeing earlier in the year, even if it is still slightly more than the expected $17.99 MSRP. Still, that's a significant 58.87% drop in resale value in just a month, making this all the more affordable for fans to pick up right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for the lowest "in-stock" price right now, direct from a major retailer, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Day-2026-Collection/dp/B0G2FVLXVL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=36VQRZIV3UEAJ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fpJDom5qEWmKC0FcSlN6VIskxWDbsXrw_vz63nbDXOnPWWrJIH7xP97VRCaDCHQoaTT0Ax7GTdN5nAlTKd8v0h9qirbSbiiEWD7eKZwOhLB-lNHalc47TcMFdCpXSBpPCg-DQ0-aLHK6CIw_iviZoheXuUpnyGVWClbf0bjytHgyS6KktRc0tr9vVcWTSni_lAL_vwiFH5wcas89RIfpjBp9RReM80I2BPu6NENeqB5DzDIyrVlAZKqGB5VFaoUy2icu9opjnW-xVdPVcgpB8oJ8vCyIA96S2gcHIWaaKbg.dCTp1x9Nb8Laf8Ks31TMSiKjSHnlOi-hH0k2yZJu17s&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=pokemon+pokemon+day+collection&amp;qid=1768584789&amp;sprefix=pokemon+pokemon+day+collection%2Caps%2C210&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=tcg-ign-20&amp;ascsubtag=06U9e7yJctIoHdAg4l1vnCG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Amazon</u></a> leads the pack at $38.99. That being said, we’ve seen them dip <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-day-2026-tcg-collection-is-back-in-stock-with-a-major-new-discount-at-amazon"><u>as low as $26.99</u></a> here before, so it’s up to you if you want to hold for that or opt for TCGplayer instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q45Eq4?object_uuid=e35de0ab-d25e-4849-bb7b-c223bed34345&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Best Buy</u></a> is holding firm at $49.99, albeit the listing is via a third party seller, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/aR72pE?object_uuid=e35de0ab-d25e-4849-bb7b-c223bed34345&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Target</u></a> has already been cleaned out of their $17.99 stock - you can’t be surprised at this point!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re hunting for a sub-$20 pull, it’s best to keep an eye on local inventory or set up an alert for online restocks from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg"><u>reputable resellers</u></a>. Just remember - these figures are based on US retailers, so international collectors should factor in global shipping costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to resell yourself, I’d recommend you keep looking. Given the lack of exclusive anniversary packs inside, it’s not likely the Pokémon TCG's 30th Anniversary TCG Collection will turn over a huge profit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, while the stamped foil promo card of Pikachu isn’t a unique illustration, its status as the first official 30th-anniversary product might be worth something to completionists in a few years. I’d recommend picking up two at or near MSRP if you’ve got the space - one to hold onto as an investment, one to rip.</p></div><div id="235758"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235758" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: First Partner Illustration Collection - Series 1</h3></p></div></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, the next best 30th anniversary set to keep an eye out for is the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-first-partner-illustration-collection-explainer">First Partner Illustration Collection series</a>, with the first release incoming on March 20. That will feature a Promo Booster Pack, where you can pull three of nine illustration rare-style promo cards. Each of these cards feature stunning illustrations of beloved first partner Pokémon,  such as the Kanto region's Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the 30th anniversary celebrations, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-full-release-schedule-2026"><u>one more Pokémon TCG set</u></a> to be released in the first quarter of the year - Perfect Order.

<p>We had a lot of love for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> on its release. "With smart additions that move the series forward, this is the most accessible, deepest and simply very best Monster Hunter to date," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-rise-review-the-switchs-best-game-since-breath-of-the-wild">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Rise review from 2021</a>.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slime-rancher-2">Slime Rancher 2</a>, well, back in 2022 Christian Donlan called it both "glorious" and "ghastly" after he took it for a short spin.</p>
<p>"Slime Rancher 2 is absolutely gorgeous, a kind of duvet-soft archipelago filled with thick waving grass, sun-warmed rocks, and dreamy coastal vistas. It is such a pleasure to explore, I would be out there wandering even if I wasn't lured through it with the promise of slimes to capture," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-2-is-glorious-and-ghastly-and-thats-whats-fascinating-about-it">Eurogamer's Slime Rancher 2 feature</a>.</p>
<p>PGA Tour 2K25, Monster Hunter Rise, Slime Rancher 2 and The Elder Scrolls Online Collection: Gold Road will be available for all PlayStation Plus members from 3rd March. They will be on the service until Monday, 6th April.</p>

			<p>It seems like <strong>Wolfenstein 3</strong> is finally happening. It's been over eight years since the release of <strong>Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</strong>, and fans were almost losing hope that the third chapter of <strong>William "B.J." Blazkowicz</strong>'s story would actually happen.</p>



<p>Developer MachineGames <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-iii-hint-play-with-format/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had started teasing it very early</a>, just <a href="https://wccftech.com/pete-hines-confirms-wolfenstein-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a few months after the launch of the second entry</a>, but then they went quiet about it for a long time. With <strong>Arkane Lyon</strong>'s help, the Swedish studio would instead release two spin-offs, <strong>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</strong> and the VR-only <strong>Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot</strong>, in 2019. Both of them failed critically and commercially, though, and MachineGames turned to  <strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong>, based on a pitch by Bethesda's <strong>Todd Howard</strong>. I'm glad they did; <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was an amazing game</a></strong>, and it was rightfully recognized as such. That said, <strong>it's high time to finish Blazkowicz's journey</strong>. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/machine-games-reportedly-has-wolfenstein-3-r6-siege-like-multiplayer-game-on-the-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors about Wolfenstein 3 being in development were reignited</a></strong> thanks to reports from Kotaku and Windows Central. MachineGames studio director <strong>Jerk Gustafsson</strong> also chimed in a few weeks ago and, while remaining vague about the development timeline, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/it-can-be-now-it-can-be-later-but-were-not-done-with-it-machinegames-will-make-wolfenstein-3-eventually/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed that the developer wasn't done with the series</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Now, though, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-wolfenstein-3-first-story-details-unveiled-as-casting-begins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MP1st is reporting</a> that a casting call is already out, with Performance Director <strong>Tom Keegan</strong> and Casting Director <strong>Emily Schweber</strong> attached to the process. The game's codename is apparently '<strong>Valkyrie</strong>', and the casting call is for the role of <strong>Sofiya</strong>, a Ukrainian orphan aged between 8 and 11. Sofiya is said to form a bond with the main character throughout the game and accompany him on his travels alongside her adopted dog, Ralph.</p>



<p>MP1st also adds a brief overview of the character from the casting call:</p>



<p><em>While initially suspicious and traumatized by war, she blooms under the care of the resistance (possibly referring to the Kreisau Circle) as a strong-willed survivor.<br></em><br>Performance capture reportedly begins in April, and additional shooting dates are planned throughout 2026 and into 2027.</p>



<p>Still, <strong>it will likely take some time before MachineGames can show us anything of Wolfenstein 3</strong>. They were, after all, busy with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle until recently with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-a-bit-of-a-disappointment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Order of Giants DLC</a>. Perhaps 2028-2029 could be a realistic release window. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the studio <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is also working with Amazon MGM Studios on a TV adaptation</a></strong> that will air on Prime Video.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The casting for Wolfenstein 3 has begun.</p>
<p>There has long been chatter that MachineGames, the team also behind the sublime Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, wasn't done with the Wolfenstein series. Towards the end of 2025, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-doesnt-sound-like-weve-heard-the-last-from-machinegames-wolfenstein-series">studio head Jerk Gustafsson said the team would like to work on a New Colossus sequel</a>. "We have a story to tell," he said during a documentary by Noclip, which was released in September.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Then, just this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-developer-machinegames-still-plans-to-finish-its-wolfenstein-trilogy">Gustafsson told Eurogamer's sister site GamesIndustry that the "intention has always been to go back to Wolfenstein"</a>, and MachineGames "wanted to finish the trilogy". And, it seems like we are one very key step closer to that becoming a reality.</p>
<p>According to a casting call seen by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-wolfenstein-3-first-story-details-unveiled-as-casting-begins">MP1st</a>, performance capture for Wolfenstein 3 - codenamed Valkyrie - is scheduled to kick off later this year, in April. This process will allegedly run into 2027.</p>
<p>As for story details, the call is for a character named Sofiya, who is described as an orphan between the ages of 8-11 from Ukraine. She has a dog called Ralph, and the two of them form a bond with Blazkowicz. William "B.J." Blazkowicz - or, to give him his proper name Terror-Billy, the scourge of the Nazi empire - is the Wolfenstein franchise's lead.</p>
<p>"While initially suspicious and traumatised by war, she blooms under the care of the resistance (possibly referring to the Kreisau Circle) as a strong-willed survivor.," Sofiya's casting description reads.</p>
<p>Further details - such as whether Sofiya actually full on joins B.J's crew or if we can expect to see some kind of The Last of Us Joel and Ellie style surrogate father daughter relationship form - remain to be seen. What do you hope MachineGames is cooking up?</p>

<p>As for the more immediate future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">MachineGames is set to release Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on Switch 2 later this year</a>. Like I have said, this game is brilliant, and I loved being able to whip crack my way across the globe with Indy. "Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">original five star Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wolfenstein-is-the-next-game-series-to-get-an-adaptation-for-tv">Wolfenstein TV series in the works</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Bethesda's Todd Howard is staying tight-lipped on how things are progressing</a>.</p>

<p>New update incoming</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="fdaa5c68f79f6"><a title="Fallout 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fdaa5c68f79f6/fallout-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> is now officially available on the Switch 2, and it seems Bethesda won't be wasting any time when it comes to updates.</p>
<p>In a confirmation via social media, it has revealed it will bolster the post-apocalyptic experience with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-what-is-dlss-nvidias-deep-learning-super-sampling-explained">support for DLSS</a> and by also providing "additional stability improvements". This update will join the 60fps and 40fps modes, which are already in the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bethesda:</strong> Thank you to everyone who has already jumped in to explore the Commonwealth on Nintendo Switch 2!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>In addition to our current 60fps and 40fps modes we'll be adding the following in an upcoming update:<br>
- Support for DLSS<br>
- Additional stability improvements</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully this improves the overall experience and irons out any bugs present in the launch build. There's no mention about when exactly this next update will be released, but it's nice to see Bethesda at least providing players with a heads up, especially after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a>'s bumpy start on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This release of Fallout 4 on Nintendo's new hybrid hardware follows last week's update for The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, which added visual and performance modes. If you want to see both of these games in action, be sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/X9yfk_TCAUE">our YouTube channel</a>. We've also got a Fallout 4 review on the way.</p>

<p>But why?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="5c582cec1f55a"><a title="Gran Turismo 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c582cec1f55a/gran-turismo-7.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PlayStation</em></figcaption></figure><p>PlayStation's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gran_turismo_7">Gran Turismo 7</a> has apparently been linked to the Switch 2 in a wild new rumour, but it doesn't necessarily mean what you might be thinking.</p>
<p>This information comes from video game journalist Jeff Grubb, who recently responded to a fan on his show, asking a question about "the real driving simulator" and the possibility of it racing on to another platform.</p>
<p>While there was a fair amount of speculation on Grubb's end about <em>other</em> Sony franchises during this segment, in terms of Gran Turismo, he claims he's actually heard about a Switch 2 version, but doesn't expect anything to come of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jeff Grubb:</strong> "I heard recently that Gran Turismo was running on the Switch 2. I don't think it's going to come to the Switch 2, but I heard it was running on it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, why would Sony bother to get a game like this up and running on the Switch 2, but not even consider a release?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1reac3w/jeff_grubb_playstation_had_gran_turismo_7_running/">One popular theory</a> seems to be it's testing the waters <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/sony-allegedly-encouraging-devs-to-use-ps5s-new-low-power-mode-prompting-fresh-ps6-handheld-speculation?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">as rumours circulate</a> about the company potentially releasing a new PlayStation handheld. In other words, this could be research and development, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Gaming enthusiasts online have also pointed out how companies over the years <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2020/05/gears_of_war_ps3_footage_appears_online_epic_games_comments">got titles up and running on certain platforms</a>, but never went any further. If this is more than a rumour, it wouldn't necessarily be the first time we've heard about something like this.</p>
<p>As our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/for-some-reason-sony-apparently-got-gran-turismo-7-running-on-switch-2">friends at Push Square</a> further note, Switch 2's primary controllers <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-with-analogue-trigger-compatibility-that-work-with-the-gamecube-nso-controller">don't have analogue triggers</a> and the system doesn't offer "robust" steering wheel support, all of which is considered essential to experience Gran Turismo "at its best".</p>
<p>Of course, if there are any significant developments, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>

<p>Last May, an Xbox Wire post announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/ecco_the_dolphin">Ecco The Dolphin</a> would be making a comeback with a remaster of not only the first game, but also the sequel <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/ecco_the_tides_of_time">Tides of Time</a>.</p>
<p>Platforms weren't mentioned at the time, but a new two-page spread for the remaster in Famitsu this week lists the Switch - seemingly confirming the remaster is on its way to Nintendo's hybrid platform.</p>
<p>Additional details have also been shared by the series creator Ed Annunziata in this feature. As highlighted by Nintendo Everything, the plan is to include 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit versions in a single package, and allow players to swap between visual styles in "real-time".</p>
<p>The final name of this project is still being decided, but the favourite at the moment appears to be "Ecco Complete". Of course, this is all subject to localisation changes.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, these remasters will also be joined by a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/ecco-the-dolphin-is-making-a-comeback-with-remasters-and-new-game">"new, third game"</a> at some stage. More updates related to Ecco are expected to take place this April, according to an <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">official Ecco the Dolphin countdown website</a>.</p>
<p>As we've previously mentioned, the original Ecco the Dolphin game, which launched in 1992 on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis, is playable via the Switch Online + Expansion Pack.</p>

<p>It will apparently run for "about 23 minutes", and fans can expect to see some "pre-release footage" as well as the reveal of the new 1.7 marriage candidates at the end. Barone actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/stardew-valley-creator-teases-two-more-marriage-candidates-for-update-1-7">teased this upcoming reveal</a> earlier this month.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>ConcernedApe:</strong> "I made a video for tomorrow's 10-year Stardew Valley Anniversary, it will "premiere" tomorrow at 11am PST...I go over some old builds of the game w/ commentary, briefly go over the many updates, give a special message to the players, and reveal the 2 new marriage candidates in 1.7."</p>

This version hasn't been released in every region just yet, but Barone mentioned last week that the Switch 2 Edition (and free upgrade for existing players) would be coming to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/stardew-valleys-new-update-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-live">European and Japanese eShop in "a few weeks"</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">What are the odds?</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The attorney general of New York Letitia James is suing Valve, alleging the platform illegally promotes gambling to children.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release issued by the attorney general's office today</a>, which states that following an investigation, the office of the attorney general "found that Valve’s video games, including Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, and Dota 2, enable gambling by enticing users to pay for the chance to win a rare virtual item of significant monetary value."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In Valve’s most popular game [Counter-Strike 2], the process resembles a slot machine, with an animated spinning wheel that eventually rests on a selected item. The randomly selected virtual items have no in-game functionality but can be sold online for money, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/counter-strike-skin-sells-for-over-1-million">one item reportedly being sold for more than $1 million</a>. The lawsuit alleges that Valve has made billions of dollars luring its users, many of whom are teenagers or younger, to engage in gambling in the hopes of winning expensive virtual items that they can cash in on. With this lawsuit, Attorney General James seeks to permanently stop Valve from continuing to promote illegal gambling in its games and to pay disgorgement and fines."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The lawsuit itself describes both the mechanics of how loot boxes work in all three games, as well as the ways in which users can "cash in" virtual items, either by selling them on the Steam Community Market, or by connecting their accounts to third-party marketplaces, the latter of which the attorney general's office says it found Valve "facilitates and even assists." The attorney general's office argues that Valve's loot box model is "quintessential gambling, prohibited under New York's Constitution and Penal Law." Gambling is illegal in New York with only some exceptions, which the attorney general says are all irrelevant here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question of whether loot boxes can or should be regulated as gambling has been ongoing for more than a decade, with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/loot-box-state-of-play-2024-another-trip-around-the-world-of-regulation" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different countries issuing various regulations around them over the years</a>. China, South Korea, and some other countries require companies to disclose odds on receiving certain items in very specific ways. In Australia, the presence of loot boxes automatically nets a game an M rating (not recommended for children under 15, albeit not legally restricted), and anything with simulated gambling gets an R18+ rating, meaning it cannot be sold to minors. Belgium has attempted to ban them entirely, though it is apparently struggling to enforce this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The New York lawsuit aims to permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, make full restitution to consumers and give up all profit its made from this practice, and pay fines for violation of New York laws. If successful, this case could have significant ripple effects on the rest of the industry, as companies are forced to confirm to an increasing array of different loot box laws in different regions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people,” said Attorney General James in a statement. “Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>The physical distributor Limited Run Games is teaming up with Marvel and Konami to revive multiple retro games in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_maximum_collection"><strong>Marvel</strong></a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_maximum_collection">Maximum Collection</a></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>This superhero-sized collection, "coming soon" to Switch and other platforms, will feature six "classic titles" spanning across the Arcade, 8-bit and 16-bit consoles.</p>
<p>The collection covers multiple genres and promises to take fans on a "comprehensive tour" of Marvel's gaming legacy. It won't just feature one version of a particular title, either - it offers "every major console and arcade iteration" available.</p>
<p>Here are the titles included in this new collection, with rollback netcode also confirmed for X-Men: The Arcade Game.</p>
<p><strong>X-Men: The Arcade Game (Arcade)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The definitive mutant beat-’em-up returns! Experience the legendary cabinet action with full online multiplayer support for up to six players. Choose your favorite X-Man and take on Magneto’s army with the ultimate team-up experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Captain America and The Avengers (Arcade, Sega® Genesis/Mega Drive, NES)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take control of Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Vision as you experience the cinematic arcade original or the unique platforming spin of the NES.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spider-Man/Venom: Maximum Carnage (Super Nintendo™, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the iconic comic crossover, gamers take to the streets of NYC battling hordes of nefarious bad guys, all to the sound of a rockin’ 16-bit soundtrack! Switch between the rich color palette of the Super Nintendo version, or dive in and enjoy the Genesis/Mega Drive version’s gritty vibe. Whatever you choose, carnage is guaranteed!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety (Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The superlative symbiote sequel! Go solo or team up in two-player co-op to take on the Life Foundation and Carnage’s offspring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade’s Revenge (Super Nintendo™, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Boy™, Game Gear™)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Navigate Arcade’s deadly "Murderworld." This collection includes the handheld versions of the game, offering a fascinating look at Marvel's history of on-the-go gaming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Silver Surfer (NES)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test your Super Hero skills against one of the most infamously challenging shooters to ever grace a console! Featuring one of the greatest soundtracks in 8-bit history, this is a shooter that’s tough to master and tougher to put down!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Limited Run notes how this collection will feature "all new music from the legendary game composer Chris Huelsbeck".</p>
<p>As usual with collections like this, you can also look forward to a host of features designed to scratch that retro "itch". This includes a digital archive (featuring box art, instruction manuals and more), a music player (including scores for every version of every game in the collection), rewind &amp; save states, cheat menus, and display options - allowing you to relive the CRT days.</p>


<p>When we find out more about this collection, we'll let you know. Would you be interested in this? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/marvel-maximum-collection-revives-six-classic-superhero-titles-on-switch]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wolfenstein/" id="2953">Wolfenstein 3 </a>could finally be in the works.</p>



<p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-wolfenstein-3-first-story-details-unveiled-as-casting-begins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to a report from MP1st,</a> a casting call has been uncovered tied to the project. This appears to be our first look at the plot details. The project is codenamed “Valkyrie,” and it is attached to two people who previously worked on several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/machinegames/" id="87686">MachineGames </a>titles: performance director Tom Keegan and casting director Emily Schweber. Keegan directed performances for the cast of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-2/" id="97055">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-apparent-wolfenstein-3-plot-details-and-production-schedule">Apparent Wolfenstein 3 Plot Details and Production Schedule</h2>



<p>Reportedly, the story centers around a character named Sofiya. She’s described as a Ukrainian orphan aged 8 to 11 who forms a bond with William Blazkowicz, the franchise’s main protagonist. The young character is also said to be traumatized by War, making her suspicious, but she’s ultimately labeled a strong survivor. </p>



<p>The casting call also notes that performance capture is scheduled to begin in April, with shooting dates planned for later in 2026 and extending into the next year.</p>



<p>MachineGames had previously stated that they always intended to continue the franchise. Jerk Gustafsson, studio director, said earlier this month that while he wouldn’t comment on a timeline for the third game’s release, they were never finished with the franchise. Read his full comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/machinegames-still-plans-to-finish-the-wolfenstein-trilogy/">here</a>.</p>







<p>There’s still no exact confirmation from the studio, but we may be inching closer to finishing the Wolfenstein Trilogy. Insider Gaming will continue to report on the franchise’s future as more information becomes available.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Valve for “illegally promoting gambling” through the loot box systems it has built for video games like <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, and <em>Dota 2</em>, <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through">according to a press release</a>. The attorney general seeks to “permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and pay fines for violating New York’s laws.”</p><p>“This loot box model that Valve has developed — charging an individual for a chance to win something of value based on luck alone — is quintessential gambling, prohibited under New York’s Constitution and Penal Law,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/27417060-new-york-v-valve/">the lawsuit says</a>. Valve has made “tens of millions of dollars” selling loot box keys to “thousands” of New York residents and has “made millions of dollars more in commissions from New Yorkers who sold virtual items obtained from loot boxes.” The company’s loot boxes are also “particularly pernicious” because they’re popular with children and adolescents, according to the complaint.</p><p>Users can purchase keys to open loot boxes in some Valve games and receive randomly selected virtual items as rewards. If they want, users can then sell those rewards on the Steam Community Market and on third-party marketplaces; the rarer items can be worth “thousands of dollars,” the lawsuit says. These systems, however, require that users pay Valve $2.49 plus tax to open the loot boxes, and users often get items that are “worth less than what the user spent on the key.” The lawsuit also notes that Valve’s experience for opening a loot box in <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> resembles that of a slot machine.</p><p>Valve didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/884978/valve-lawsuit-loot-boxes-new-york-attorney-general-lawsuit]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight/" id="164327">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> is slated for release later this year, and it’s already promising to honor the multiple eras of everyone’s favorite billionaire playboy-turned-vigilante.</p>



<p>That same attention to honoring the bat’s legacy will also be evident in the gameplay of the upcoming title. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tt-games/" id="462">TT Games</a> isn’t afraid to say they’re influenced by Rocksteady’s iconic Batman: Arkham series, but they still want to make sure the story focuses on core characters that let the gameplay shine, while also offering the kind of quirky experience only LEGO can provide.</p>







<h2 id="h-lego-batman-promises-collectibles-honoring-the-bat-s-decades-long-legacy">LEGO Batman Promises Collectibles Honoring the Bat’s Decades-Long Legacy</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-are-not-leaving-anything-behind-how-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-is-balancing-old-and-new-ign-fan-fest-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking to IGN at IGN Fan Fest 2026,</a> Jonathan Smith, Head of Development at TT Games, elaborated on the team’s approach to the game’s story, which centers on core characters and promises multiple collectibles, allowing everyone to enjoy a Bat Cave full of memorabilia.</p>



<p>“We then want to give you lots and lots of options to see the full range of what those characters can be by giving you more than a hundred different suits to collect,” he said. “So you still get that moment in the Bat Cave where you’ve got all the different suits from all the different characters arrayed in front of you, colorful and glorious. You’re still compelled to want to complete that collection.”</p>







<h2 id="h-lego-batman-will-be-a-game-for-all-bat-fans">LEGO Batman Will Be A Game for All Bat Fans</h2>



<p>Furthermore, Smith explains why he’s not worried about a game like this alienating traditional fans looking for something more akin to the Arkham series, believing that the LEGO games offer broad appeal across multiple generations of players.</p>



<p>“On the contrary, what we find with all our LEGO games is that the more we can draw upon different aspects of a character, the wider we can make our gameplay, the more appealing it is to us as players, and to younger players and older players,” he answers. “There’s something about Lego that just translates well for everybody. So the more we can put into that, we don’t find that it misses the mark for anyone at all. It just brings more to the party.”</p>
