            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/archeologists-have-potentially-pieced-together-rules-to-ancient-shahr-i-sokhta-board<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A team of archeologists may have uncovered a piece of tabletop history. Decades ago, an ancient Shahr-i Sokhta board game was uncovered, but its rules were not included. After some speculation and research, the team may have figured out those rules.</p>



<p>In a report by <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/after-losing-the-rules-for-4000-years-we-may-know-how-to-play-this-ancient-board-game-77152" rel="nofollow">IFLScience</a>, the Shahr-i Sokhta board game was uncovered in 1977 by a group of Italian and Iranian archeologists. As the name suggests, they were excavating a cemetery Shahr-i Sokhta in the south-eastern region of Iran when they uncovered the board game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shahr-i-sokta-board-game-photograph.jpg?itok=2gHPj3EI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shahr-i-sokta-board-game-photograph.jpg?itok=kWjklV-M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Thanks to radiocarbon dating, they were able to determine the game was created around 2600-2400 BCE. The problem is only the game was present; no rules or instructions.</p>

<p>For comparison there is the <em>Royal Game of Ur</em>. This game appeared roughly around the same time in Mesopotamia, and had its rules written down on a cuneiform tablet, allowing the British Museum to translate and interpret the game's rules. They surmised it was a strategic racing game played with dice.</p>

<p>The team puzzling out the Shahr-i Sokhta board game didn't have that convenience. Instead, they took what they knew about ancient board games alongside historical evidence.</p>

This is due to the game&nbsp; having more varied game pieces and blockers. As the team wrote in their report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The blocker pieces cannot attack the opponent’s blockers, as the core of the gameplay is racing,&nbsp; and the rules must focus on the racing aspect.&nbsp; Moreover, the blocker pieces should be able to move more strategically,"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Shahr-i Sokhta board game, now referred to as <em>The Game of 20</em>, is available to play online for free on Persian Wonders' website. It is described as an older version of Backgammon. The goal is for you to remove all ten of your game pieces from the board before your opponent does.</p>

<p>Naturally, even with a ton of research and playtesting, there is the chance this board game wasn't played as intended. But that is part of the ongoing challenges of archeology and historical research.</p>

IGN has reached out to Sony and Bungie for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 81-page lawsuit lays out seven counts against Bungie and SIE, including Family and Medical Leave Act [FMLA] retaliation, defamation, and breach of contract. Barrett is seeking at least $100 million in defamation damages in addition to more than $90 million for money owed under retention agreements, alleged Washington Rebate Act [WRA] violations, and other compensation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reports emerged earlier this year that Barrett, a Bungie employee who also worked on both Halo and Destiny, was fired from his position as Marathon's director after an internal misconduct investigation. A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNDg2NDU0OCwiZXhwIjoxNzI1NDY5MzQ4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSVhUWktEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.lJDK2mJTGM2v8mjO2siujiOigS68jyckaTagfGlXp_A" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg report</a> cited sources claiming that Barrett "called lower-level female employees attractive, asked them to play truth-or-dare and made references to his wealth and power within the studio, suggesting that he could help advance their careers."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barrett released a statement at the time saying, "I feel that I have always conducted myself with integrity and been respectful and supportive of my colleagues, many of whom I consider my <br>closest friends. I never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/05/24/marathon-blogroll-02-1684962151922.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Chris Barrett was Marathon's director before being fired in 2024. Image source: Bungie.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Barrett's lawsuit alleges that he was scapegoated for Bungie's overall struggles in the wake of the PlayStation acquisition and that the investigation was used as cause to fire him after requesting FMLA leave. Barrett's lawsuit also says that many of the allegations laid out in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch">2021 IGN investigation into Bungie's workplace culture were "not shocking to him"</a> and lays out several allegations of his own, including claims that at least one employee "frequently exposed himself in the office" and that Bungie "maintained an email channel that shared lewd and semi-pornographic content to the entire studio."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barrett alleges that he sought to take mental health leave in late 2023, but was instead removed from his role on Marathon. In describing the investigation into his conduct, Barrett claims that he was confronted about what he described as "unspecified texts" but "but failed to show Barrett any of the communications, identify any of the recipients or senders, or even disclose when the communications took place — thereby rendering Sony's supposed 'investigation' into these texts pointless, and failing to meet any professional standards for conducting an investigation." Barrett was subsequently fired for gross misconduct in March 2024, with Joe Ziegler taking over the role as Marathon director.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barrett's lawsuit adds to Bungie's recent struggles. Earlier this year, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-says-it-remains-committed-to-destiny-after-layoffs-will-reveal-plans-for-multi-year-journey-soon">studio laid off 220 staff</a>, and in a report published in December 2023, Bungie devs described the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover">atmosphere at the studio as "soul-crushing."</a> Marathon, meanwhile, does not yet have a release date, though it's expected to see a playtest sometime in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-horses-red-dead-redemption-2-horse-testicles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Video game history is riddled with foundational Horse Moments, whether we’re talking classics like<em> Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> and <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> or (slightly) more off-the-beaten-path fare like <em>Barbie Horse Adventures</em>. But in the recent gaming canon, one game effectively represents an equine epoch: <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Its horses are so detailed that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/meet-the-hundreds-of-horse-girls-running-red-dead-onlines-kindest-posse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thousands of players</a> treat it as a massively multiplayer trail ride simulator. Even before the game came out, the internet became enamored with its horse testicles, which <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-hours-with-the-amazingly-detailed-red-dead-redempti-1829187487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developers said</a> expanded and shrank depending on the in-game temperature. Turns out, however, there’s a problem with that last bit. On the latest episode of You Are Error, we discuss Rockstar’s fumbling of that figurative and literal ball and so much more.</p><p>The topic of this episode of You Are Error, Aftermath’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-rami-ismail-arabic-palestine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new podcast about gaming’s greatest misconceptions</a>, is horses. It’s a pretty far cry from the globally consequential subject matter of episode one, and that’s by design. With these first two episodes, I’m hoping to demonstrate You Are Error’s full potential breadth. It can be serious, it can be silly, it can be something in between.</p><p>I decided on horses in particular, though, because while there’s plenty of lighthearted enjoyment to be derived from man’s best friend that isn’t a dog, there’s a deceptive amount of depth and cultural relevance to the topic as a whole. Horses are everywhere – in society and media. We can all at least sort of draw one. How and why do games mess up those, of all things? And what are game makers choosing to focus on instead?&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s guest who, yes, unfortunately, I asked about horse testicles, is <a href="https://x.com/MaliceDaFirenze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alice Ruppert</a>, video game horse consultant and creator of <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mane Quest</a>, a website about video game horses. We discussed the history of horses in games and how, even in this era of photorealism, some companies still fail to stick the landing when it comes to basics like legs. Legs! That’s the main thing about horses.&nbsp;</p><p>But alongside major releases, there’s also an entire, oft-overlooked genre of games focused on caring for, nurturing, and riding horses. If you grew up in the era of <em>Barbie Horse Adventures</em> (and all the jokes surrounding it), you might be starting to see the faint outline of a gendered component to this conversation, and well, at this point I’ll just let the conversation speak for itself. Buckle – or perhaps I should say saddle – up for an interview that I enjoyed tremendously, and I hope you will too.</p><p>You can listen below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7w7V296dt8HCoDryWiofI4?si=f79446b5647c44bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/you-are-error/id1782231480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, please consider leaving a review so that this foal of a podcast can eventually become a championship-winning race horse.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> In the run up to <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>’s release, they started talking about the amount of detail they packed into their horses, and the example that they used is that, if you had a horse in different temperatures, depending on if it was hot or cold, the size of their testicles would change. They’d be smaller or larger depending on if it was hot or cold outside.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> It is not the first time I’ve been asked about <em>Red Dead</em> horse balls.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I’m not surprised by that! Because I feel like, as we’ve already talked about, in a lot of games, horses are almost invisible beyond their utility to the player. And this was a moment where people actually talked about them beyond that. Admittedly it was still only kind of about the horses; it was really more about “Our game is so realistic. It’s the most realistic game ever. Here’s a salient example.” But nonetheless, how did you feel about that being such a big part of the discussion around that game?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Definitely mixed feelings in the sense of, as you say, the horse testicle thing is more of a stand in – both for people who like<em> Red Dead</em> as a way of [saying] “It’s so realistic that even the horse balls shrink and grow,” but also for the game’s detractors who are like “That game has so much padding and detail I don’t care about; you should have done this or that instead of spending time on your horse testicles.”</p><p>My actual opinion on <em>Red Dead </em>horse balls is that there’s too many of them, because there’s no reason for that many horses to be stallions. So, quick horse anatomy lesson: A stallion is an uncastrated male horse, and a gelding is a castrated male horse. Gelding horses is a practice that goes back thousands of years. It wasn’t always popular in all cultures, but it was definitely popular and practiced in the American West. The reason for that was just that geldings are much easier to handle than stallions because they’re not distracted by female horses, to put it simply.&nbsp;</p><p>So there would not have been cowboys riding stallions everywhere. You would use mares or geldings. Is it a bad thing that all the horses in <em>Red Dead </em>have balls? No, but I find it weird! As an actual rider, you don’t see as many horse balls as you see in <em>Red Dead</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>And also, this is complete speculation, but I feel like by the time they revealed that fact, people were talking about it so much that they did something to the ratio of male and female horses you find so that enough people would see their goddamn horse balls. It can be genuinely hard to find a mare in <em>Red Dead 2</em>, which I also think is stupid. Also, prominent, static testicles in every screenshot I take of my horse in that game are just not something I need. And in motion, they look really fucking weird – I can’t believe I’m talking about horse ball physics again – no, these are not static. In your super hyper realistic game, it just looks wrong. It looks like they’re made of wood.</p><p>Does that mean I think <em>Red Dead</em> should have added horse ball physics to their game as well? Not really. I just think it’s a really fucking weird choice, a weird combo of priorities. It definitely did its job as a marketing gimmick. We’re still talking about it six years later. So I can’t fault anyone for doing that, but at the same time, I don’t take it seriously as a realism metric.&nbsp;</p><p>But it’s hard to deny that the <em>Red Dead 2 </em>horses are some of the best that exist. The people at Rockstar definitely put a lot of work into it that otherwise isn’t [usually done] with different breeds and behaviors – different models and characteristics. At the same time, I have some nitpicks with the models of <em>Red Dead</em> that put them into uncanny valley territory for me. How their ears move and how their mouths move is wrong to me, and so they look a bit off. But that might just be me.&nbsp;</p><p>I know a lot of horse-loving gamers who absolutely adore <em>Red Dead</em>. There’s people who play <em>Red Dead</em> specifically for the horses – people that meet on dedicated servers and in special communities and mod<em> Red Dead</em> so they can come together and do show jumping competitions, essentially. And I think that’s beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> That’s really cool. How big is that community?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>The biggest community that I’m aware of is about 10,000 people, which is <a href="https://www.rifttrails.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rift Trails</a>. As far as I know, it got started in the horses-in-video-games Facebook group I launched a few years back – during covid, actually, when people started meeting up digitally and going on trail rides together during a time where, of course, many people were not allowed to visit their horses. That’s when I saw it starting, I believe. It’s possible something happened earlier.<em> Red Dead Online </em>has been out since 2018, but I think it got a big boost during the peak covid months of spring 2020.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>That’s one of those things, too, where I feel like it’s a beneficial side effect of that game’s horses being so good: Beyond what Rockstar intended for them, people found these other uses – these other ways to interact with what they had made.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> Absolutely. In many ways it’s something that I love – that I think is super beautiful and nice. Community and play emerging from places where it wasn’t intended. And at the same time, I was like, I think there’s a market for games that target horse-loving people explicitly and make these sorts of experiences to begin with on all platforms, and not just modded on PC if you jump through 20 hoops to find them.&nbsp;</p><p>If that many people are willing to jump through so many hoops to get the horse gameplay they want, imagine how many people would play it if it was simply something they could buy and find organically rather than explicitly having to go look for it and be tech savvy enough to create that experience themselves.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Are there any games along those lines currently in development or that have come out?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>There are games that took inspiration from that or tried to provide something similar. … [One example is in] <em>Star Stable Online</em>, which is the biggest horse game there is, essentially. It’s an MMORPG aimed at 8- to 18-year old girls that nobody has heard of, but they have, like, 600,000 monthly active players, and it’s huge.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Wow. Damn, good for them.</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Yeah, there’s so many people that work in games and talk about games a lot that are not aware of the kinds of numbers these games pull. That’s why I mention them at every opportunity, because at some point I’m hoping to get some investors and publishers to listen.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Well yeah, because based on what you’re saying, there’s clearly a bigger appetite for this than what is being provided for. There are more people who want these things.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Yeah, I would absolutely say that.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Which is interesting, because I went into this episode thinking it would be about what games get wrong about horses physically, but maybe the biggest misconception is this idea that there’s not an audience for games about horses.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Alice:</strong> I totally agree, and that’s why part of my work is essentially trying to gather that evidence. That’s why I like to shine a light on these modding communities and why I like to shine a light on bad horse games that still get players – because they’re the only ones offering this particular experience. Because what I want out of this is better horse games. In that way, it’s a very selfish endeavor. Even though we’ve seen improvements in the past few years, there’s still so much untapped potential.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking"><h3>Objects To Hit Fascists With In Indiana Jones, Ranked</h3></a><p>I've been playing Indiana Jones and The Great Circle and have constructed a ranking internally.</p></div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-trailer-ad"><h3>Is It A Trailer Or An Ad</h3></a><p>Rebekah Valentine assigned me this blog</p></div></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players will dig, find treasure, sell those treasures, use the money to upgrade their digging tools, and keep digging deeper.

It was experimenting with voxel-based terraforming, only to eventually ditch the idea.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wb-games-montreal-lays-off-99-staff-members-majority-were-subcontractors/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, a French outlet <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2126300/wb-games-montreal-keywords-licenciements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named Radio-Canada</a> mentioned that 99 developers have been laid off at WB Games Montreal. It's been said that 99 employees were impacted by this new round of layoffs. However, the vast majority of the employees affected by this round of layoffs were subcontractors hired through Keywords. Keywords is a game service provider that helps connect studios with professionals. They have previously worked with companies such as BioWare and NetEase for their projects. The workers at WB Montreal were in the QA department and helped Rocksteady with the development of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>This news comes after Rocksteady announced that the live-service shooter will no longer be supported as of January 14, 2025. The developers that were impacted by the layoffs mentioned to Radio-Canada that those let go will be made to leave WB Montreal in approximately eight weeks, which is roughly around the start of February.</p>
<p>A source mentioned to Radio-Canada that they were offered the opportunity to be kept on a contact list for any projects that were going to be going forward at WB Games Montreal. However, the source said that the projects may not need any people to work on them until 2026. Although this source has said this, it's not 100% certain that it's true, as they had reportedly been assured that WB Games Montreal had "enough projects to work on."</p>
<p>It's not a surprise to anyone who knows about Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League that it performed poorly. As a result of the game performing so badly, Warner Bros. Games revenue saw a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/">hefty 41% decrease in Q2 2024</a>, which is most likely why Rocksteady decided to pull the plug on the game entirely in January. WB Games did expect a drop in revenue, as they didn't release anything this year that was as successful as Hogwarts Legacy, but they were hoping that Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League would at least provide some padding.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's a bit uncertain as to what WB Games Montreal is working on, with their most recent game being Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Prior to that, they developed games such as Gotham Knights and Batman: Arkham Origins. While it hasn't been confirmed, WB Games Montreal is allegedly developing a DC Comics game utilizing Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Looking further than Montreal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sells-30-million-units-hogwarts-legacy-2-huge-priority/">Hogwarts Legacy 2 is the biggest priority for WB Games</a>, given the wide success of Hogwarts Legacy. So much so that the game sold more copies than the WB Games Senior Brand Manager expected.</p>

            <p>
Thursday is upon us once more, meaning another Epic Games Store freebie is here to claim and (ever-mounting backlog allowing) play. And this time, it's the turn of fantasy survival adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</a> - which is reportedly the first of 16 free games being given away by Epic over the festive period.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Epic's current freebie, though, developer Free Range Games' The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria launched to a decent reception back in 2023, transplanting familiar survival mechanics - exploration, combat, resource gathering, and crafting - to Middle-earth with atmospheric, if largely unspectacular results.
</p>
<p>
"This is a game with a lot of soul and a lot of problems, even if I've still found myself willingly sinking dozens of hours into exploring the mines"," Eurogamer contributor Emma Kent wrote in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-review">three star review</a>. "What is unique about Return to Moria is the way it pairs a relatively focused story with survival mechanics... The manner in which the game has been infused with Tolkien's lore and world-building is impressive, and that it somehow evokes the feeling of a Tolkien journey is remarkable in itself. For fans of Middle-earth this is worth experiencing, particularly if someone else joins you for the adventure."

<p>
The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-f01344">free to claim</a> right now until Thursday, 19th December. As to what's next, that - somewhat unusually - is yet to be revealed. However, according to extremely reliable leaker billbil-kun, Epic is poised to embark on another series of daily free game giveaways, just as it's done over the festive period for the last few years.
</p><p>
In a post <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/epic-games-store-voici-le-nombre-et-le-calendrier-complet-des-jeux-gratuits-a-venir-lors-de-levenement-de-fin-dannee-59770">on Deallabs</a>, billbil-kun wrote that one new game will be free to claim on the Epic Store every day from 19th December to 2nd January 2025. Each will be claimable for 24 hours, aside from the last, which will be free between 2nd and 9th January.

The “Emaciated Infected” is actually played by Angus Neill, who director Danny Boyle had previously met and remembered for his extremely gaunt physique, rather than the star of last year’s summer blockbuster <em>Oppenheimer</em>. </p><p>“Danny told me he’d always had me in mind for the role,” Neill, who specializes in Old Masters paintings, told<em> The Guardian</em>. “So we met up, hit it off, and I agreed to take part. He continued, “On set he has an extraordinary ability to hypnotize you, and working with him on the film was a very, very intense experience.”</p><p>Murphy’s character, meanwhile, survived the original <em>28 Days Later</em> but was completely MIA from the sequel <em>28 Weeks Later</em>, which was made by a different director and writing team entirely. With Boyle and script writer Alex Garland teaming back up for the third movie, Murphy is believed to be involved in the project but hasn’t yet been confirmed in the current cast, which includes Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Ralph Fiennes.</p><p>It’s possible Murphy’s role in the film is a secret to be revealed later, or maybe his character, a random bystander in the first movie, just wouldn’t make any sense showing up in the latest rage virus-fueled apocalypse. For now, fans will have to find something else in the movie’s unsettling trailer to debate. <em>28 Years Later</em> releases on June 20, 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Steel City Interactive has released Update 1.2 for Undisputed boxing on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. To coincide with the release of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jake-paul-added-to-undisputed-boxing-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s first DLC pack</a> of fighters, this update makes several changes across the game including adding a couple of highly-requested features.</p>



<p>Two of the biggest additions are the ability to change weight class in career mode as well two new venues and added weight classes for online quick fights and ranked modes.</p>



<p>You can check out the <a href="https://playundisputed.com/news/undisputed-patch-december-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full patch notes</a> below via Steel City Interactive.</p>



<h2 id="h-undisputed-update-1-2-details">Undisputed Update 1.2 Details</h2>



<h3>New Venues</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added Cambrian Hall. Located in the heart of England’s Capital and draped in rich boxing history, fighting at this venue is every prospect’s dream.</li>



<li>Added Atlantis, an underwater aquarium-like venue, located on the ocean bed. Can you keep your composure in the ring when you’re deep under water?</li>
</ul>



<h3>New Cosmetics</h3>



<ul>
<li>All players will receive an additional free outfit for Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk – recreate their historic first fight in all its glory with their fight-accurate outfits.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Career Mode</h3>



<ul>
<li>Introduced the ability for players to move up and down a weight class from their starting weight class. We know this is one a lot of you have been asking for and we’re excited to see you step up to the challenge of becoming Undisputed in not one, not two, but three weight classes with the same fighter!</li>



<li>Introduced the esteemed boxing correspondent Gareth A Davies to the Career Mode media feed, the first in a series of real-life media figures and brands.</li>



<li>Made a range of quality-of-life improvements to the career mode’s UI.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3>General Changes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Introduced Cruiserweight, Bantamweight, and Light Heavyweight queues to online quick fight and online ranked.</li>



<li>Added new knockdown and knockout animations.</li>



<li>Added an animation that plays when a fighter’s block health has been depleted, giving players better visual feedback during gameplay.</li>



<li>Slightly reduced stamina cost on missed punches and power punches to make combination and pressure fighting a more viable option.</li>



<li>Made a range of quality-of-life improvements to game audio and commentary.</li>



<li>Made performance optimisations to custom characters.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that meant players that quit out of online games on PlayStation weren’t being punished, and the win was not being correctly awarded to the remaining player. This now works as expected.</li>



<li>Many other bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.</li>
</ul>

The patch notes include an increase to XP earn rates across various modes, and more maps are added to the popular 10v10 playlist for multiplayer.</p><p dir="ltr">Leveling up and Prestiging is quite the grind in Black Ops 6, but, thankfully, one of the biggest highlights of the update is the buff to XP earn rates. Both player XP and weapon XP rates are increased for Domination, Headquarters, Kill Order, and Search and Destroy playlists. Team Deathmatch, Kill Confirmed, and Control also received a buff but only to the earn rates for weapon XP. Additionally, player XP rates are increased for Prop Hunt.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="931364360" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"
