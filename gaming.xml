            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-remasters-leaked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>remasters appear to have been leaked by merchandise spotted by eagle-eyed attendees at this year's San Diego Comic-Con.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-branding-seen-at-sdcc.937002/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ResetEra thread created by user Mama Robotnik</a>, cards bearing the legend "<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered</em>" were spotted at Comic-Con. The cards also bear the logo of developer Crystal Dynamics, along with a QR code.</p>
<p>Scanning the code takes you to a page on which you can sign up for the newsletter of Dark Horse Comics, whose logo is also featured on the cards. Per a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-reaver-remasters-seemingly-confirmed-by-a-statue-at-comic-con/1100-6525310/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GameSpot report</a>, the cards were next to a statue depicting&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver</em>'s main characters Raziel and Kain, and Dark Horse will be handling that statue's launch in August.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-defiance-raziel.jpg?itok=RrjIgwa7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-defiance-raziel.jpg?itok=N5Yk-HNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The last proper&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain&nbsp;</em>game was 2003's&nbsp;<em>Defiance</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Per GameSpot, Dark Horse wouldn't say anything about the remasters, and the cards depicting the games' names had been taken away by the time the publication's staff arrived at the relevant booth.</p>
<p>Crystal Dynamics is one of the studios that survived the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">great Embracer purge</a> of the last year or so, and the&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain&nbsp;</em>is still firmly under the studio's stewardship.</p>
<p>Remastered versions of&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>and its direct sequel would be a good way to test the waters for a potential new project, but honestly, I'd just be happy to see Raziel and Kain return again.</p>
<p>Who'll be handling the remaster is another matter entirely; Crystal Dynamics' logo being on the Comic-Con cards would seem to imply they'll be working on the games, but it could equally be a different studio entirely, as was the case for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered">this year's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>remasters</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-remasters-soul-reaver.jpg?itok=9dA-ocMU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-remasters-soul-reaver.jpg?itok=v03DEyLz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We've already had three remasters of beloved PlayStation-era platforming-heavy action-adventure games this year.</figcaption></figure><p>It's anyone's guess right now, but Aspyr would seem like a fairly obvious choice, although that studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-aspyr-response">work with the&nbsp;<em>Battlefront&nbsp;</em>remasters</a> might give Crystal Dynamics and Embracer pause for thought.</p>
<p>In any case, it looks like the revival of the&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain&nbsp;</em>franchise might be imminent after twenty years of dormancy. We don't talk about&nbsp;<em>Nosgoth</em>. Stay tuned for more!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/26/fall-in-love-with-sexy-household-objects-in-date-everything<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In Date Everything, those looking for romance don’t need to look any further than their refrigerator, smoke alarm, or dining room table. That’s because this wacky sandbox dating sim by developer Sassy Chap is all about forming relationships with everyday household objects that, it turns out, are actually pretty hot.</p>

<p>The game bestows players with special “Dateviator” glasses that allow them to speak with objects and see them in their true, absurdly attractive forms. Dozens of objects await your affection – even elements like air and water can be courted – and branching dialogue can lead to three relationship resolutions for each character (Love, Friend, Hate). Whatever you decide will be reflected in the ever-changing 3D overworld that is your house.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dlxxzmOXRf0" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Date Everything boasts over 100 voiced characters played by performers that include Felicia Day (<em>Critical Role</em>, <em>Supernatural</em>), Johnny Yong Bosch (<em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</em>, <em>Bleach</em>), and Grey DeLisle (<em>Scooby-Doo, Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>). Given the huge amount of speaking roles, Date Everything boasts 1.2 million words and 70,000 voiced lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Date Everything looks delightfully silly, but it unfortunately doesn’t have a release window. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.</p>

            <p>This is your friendly reminder that Microsoft is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-will-close-next-july">close its Xbox 360 digital store on 29th July</a> – that's next Monday – so you have just a few days left to make the most of those last discounts on some of the best Xbox 360 games of the generation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-gets-swathe-of-discounts-ahead-of-closure">Microsoft announced a raft of discounts on Xbox 360 digital games</a> back in May. Whilst some games will live on via other platforms and services – including Microsoft's comprehensive backwards compatibility system – there are a handful of games that will disappear from sale forever. So, if you've ever fancied one, now's the time to pick it up.</p>

			<p>New <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-resurfaces-with-new-footage-and-geforce-rtx-logo/">Lost Soul Aside</a> gameplay footage was shared today, providing a new look at the game by Ultizero Games that has been in development for quite a long time.</p>
<p>The new footage, which was shared today during a presentation held during Chinajoy 2024, showcases a tutorial fight as well as a fight against a new boss and a new weapon. Sadly, the game doesn't seem to be in great shape, as gameplay looks clunky and not particularly inspired. Hopefully, things will be improved before the game launches on a yet to be confirmed release date. You can check out the footage below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/07/lost-soul-aside-chinajoy-2024-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>.</p>

<p>Lost Soul Aside began development as a solo project by Yang Bing, who later created the development studio Ultizero Games to complete the development of the game. Inspired by Final Fantasy Versus XIII, which eventually became Final Fantasy XV, the game will be a character action game in the vein of Devil May Cry, where players will have to deal with powerful enemies using a variety of combat techniques.</p>
<p>Despite having been in development for a long time, Lost Soul Aside still lacks a release window. We will let you know when the game releases as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>As reported <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/07/dynasty-warriors-origins-details-story-battles-with-largest-number-of-soldiers-in-series-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Gematsu</a>, Koei Tecmo showed off 13 minutes of new footage for Dynasty Warriors: Origins, revealing cinematic story beats, combat, and key mechanics.</p>



<p>The new gameplay demo is already on YouTube across multiple channels, featuring story-driven gameplay. The cutscenes showcase familiar characters from previous games like Zhang Jiao and Guan Yu. </p>



<p>The combat revealed some of the special abilities that players will have, and more realism compared to past titles in the series. Notably, there are also shots of blocking mechanics and camera angles. </p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/koeitecmoeurope/status/1816722641673179583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Koei Tecmo summarized the story, emphasizing that it takes place “a year before the Yellow Turban Rebellion.” It also centers on a single protagonist with amnesia.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>In DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS, the story begins a year before the Yellow Turban Rebellion during the dawn of an era of great upheaval, when the protagonist, a martial artist with amnesia, visits a village suffering from famine.</p><p>Here, you will meet Zhang Jiao and Guan Yu.</p><p>Visit… <a href="https://t.co/glevaJQztB">pic.twitter.com/glevaJQztB</a></p></div>— KOEI TECMO EUROPE (@koeitecmoeurope) <a href="https://twitter.com/koeitecmoeurope/status/1816722641673179583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Developer Omega Force first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-revealed-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> at PlayStation’s latest State of Play event in May 2024. However, that only included a purely cinematic trailer, and did not reveal gameplay footage of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</p>



<p>The new ChinaJoy 2024 demo also reveals coordinated enemy AI, and a map where players can select a battlefield. It further reveals how players can briefly assume control of popular characters nearby. Fans also widely praised the music, which plays a large role in the series’ beloved attitude.</p>



<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins still doesn’t have a concrete release date at this time, though it will launch in 2025. It will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Paradox Interactive isn’t doing to great right now. The company <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/interim-report-january-june-2024-correction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released its second quarter financial</a> results on Thursday, and with it came the revelation that Paradox Interactive’s profits have fallen from $27.1 million to just $2.6 million year over year.</p>



<p>That drop of 90% can be attributed to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paradox-cancels-life-by-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of the life simulator</a> Life By You. A write down of $19.3 million is included in the profits, leading to the collapse.</p>



<p>As far as year-over-year revenue, that fell 22% to $53.3 million from $68.3 million.</p>



<p>In his comments on the financial reports, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester says that he, and the company, have mixed feelings about where things stand right now.</p>



<p>“On the one hand, our core business has performed very well, but on the other hand, we made the difficult decision to cancel the release of Life by You, as the game would not be able to meet our expectations,” he said. </p>



<p>“Looking at the quarter’s results, we’ve released several strong expansions with good quality to our core games, which has a positive impact on the top line and provides a good cash flow from operating activities. The bottom line is sadly weighed down by the write-down of Life by You. It is painful but gives us a strong motivation to further improve our operations.”</p>



<p>In addition to the cancellation of Life By You, Paradox has been trying to get back into the good graces of players after the launch of Cities: Skylines 2. The game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-rent-was-too-high-so-they-removed-landlords/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagued by various problems</a> since release, and the game’s console release has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-console-release-window-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been delayed time and time again</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hotel-barcelona-preview-a-game-by-2-japanese-legends-that-has-you-fight-alongside-yourself<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Overcome challenges with unique gameplay systems.</h2></div><section><p>Created as a collaborative effort between Japanese gaming legends SWERY and SUDA51, Hotel Barcelona has a unique premise in which your present and past self fight alongside each other. It is an action game in which previous defeats can lead to victory.</p><p>The backstory has a simple, The Purge-adjacent premise: While once a luxury hotel, today Hotel Barcelona is a place where serial killers gather from all over the United States. It is a nightmarish place where the nastiest criminals come and do whatever they want.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I got to play a stage set at a camping site where I had to deal with a devilish homicidal maniac named Jacob. His face was covered by not only a hockey mask, but also a football face guard, reminiscent of Friday the 13th killer Jason Voorhees. </p><p>Hotel Barcelona’s base is an orthodox 2D action game. You place as Justine and can use both melee and long-range attacks to defeat enemies, until you reach a giant boss at the end of the stage. Collecting resources along the way allows you to permanently upgrade your character. Like a roguelite, Hotel Barcelona has a high difficulty and expects you to retry stages over and over. Those stages unfold over multiple branching paths, with healing items and stat buffs that can be obtained along the way. Hordes of normal enemies will stand in your way, and there are some additional foes hiding behind tufts of grass for surprise attacks as well. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When you die, you have a chance to make upgrades before embarking on your next run, with the ghost of your previous run fighting alongside you.</p></div><p>Luckily, Hotel Barcelona, due out later this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC,  introduces the Phantom mechanic to help you on your way. When you die, you have a chance to make upgrades before embarking on your next run, with the ghost of your previous run fighting alongside you. While you can’t control this phantom, it will attack enemies based on your previous life when you were controlling them, and it also draws aggro from your enemies. Since the phantom only repeats a previous run, its attacks can often miss as well, but since there are so many enemies on screen, it is often helpful. You can stack up a maximum of three phantoms based on your previous three lives alongside your current run.</p><p>You can use tactics such as staying behind the phantom to use it as a shield, or by luring enemies into your phantom’s attacks. I tried to be the decoy myself too, but this proved difficult as there is no skill that has the enemies focus on Justine’s attacks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The special attack gauge decreases as time progresses, demanding the player to stay aggressive the whole time in order to fill the gauge.</p></div><p>Hotel Barcelona puts an emphasis on offensive tactics rather than defensive, with a gauge for special attacks that can be filled by gathering enemy blood. Once the gauge is full, a devastating attack against all enemies on screen can be utilized. This attack is not only effective against normal foes, but deals a lot of damage against a boss as well. The special attack gauge decreases as time progresses, demanding the player to stay aggressive the whole time in order to fill the gauge.</p><p>Jacob is a fierce boss with frequent wide range attacks. There’s not much you can do if you fight him by yourself, but your phantoms can lure or attack him, giving you a fighting chance. While I still wasn’t able to defeat him during my playtime, effective use of upgrades, special attacks and the Phantom mechanic should make it possible in the long run.</p><p><em>Written by Ryuichi Kataoka</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Valve has unveiled changes to how demos work on Steam, as the company is aiming to make them easier to discover. These updates will see demos redesigned to be more like standalone games on the platform, giving them their own store page separate from the main game's hub. The benefit to this is that the demo page can contain separate screenshots, trailers, and details on these slices of the full game to help set them apart and give potential players more accurate information. You'll also be able to add demos to your collection without needing to download it straight away, and when it's uninstalled, it'll also be removed from your library.</p><p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/6233628070477025191" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Valve</a>, these changes are driven by developer and player feedback, and players can expect to receive alerts for demos of wishlisted games. Pages for demos will include buttons to install the content, leave user reviews, and be redirected to the game's main page. Valve also plans to list demos more frequently on Steam's most-visited pages and include them alongside free-to-play games to "better balance them" with paid products.</p><p>The company also clarified that the Steam icon for game demos is not based on a dinner plate, but is instead a reference to ancient CD-ROM technology from a bygone era of gaming. "That classic icon, my friend, is from the days when demos were commonly distributed through the post office, contained in a bound package of game journalism printed on dead trees and imprinted on circular media known as Compact Discs," Valve explained.</p><p>Overall, these plans are designed to increase the visibility of demos, which will come in handy during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-25-steam-next-fest-game-demos-you-need-to-download-right-now/2900-5474/" data-ref-id="2900-5474">Steam Next Fest</a>. This is a week-long celebration where fans can try out demos from hundreds of games and give early feedback to developers, and the next instance of it will kick off on October 14. Next week will also see the launch of Tower Defense Fest on July 29, for PC gamers looking to try out previews of games in that genre.</p>

		<p><em>Image credit: SAG-AFTRA</em></p>
<p>The US Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has called a strike by voice actors on work with key video game publishers and developers, pushing back against proposed contracts that would enable the use of AI generated voices and performances in video games. However, work can continue on games deep into production… for now.</p>


<p>The ten companies facing the strike are Activision, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Take 2 Productions, VoiceWorks Productions, and WB Games.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said, “We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.”</p>
<p>Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland added in a separate statement, “The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games. That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the AI use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year – that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to AI, and the public supports us in that.”</p>

<p>As a rebuttal, a spokesperson for the video game producers group said, “We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”</p>
<p>It could take a while for the effects of this to be truly felt. Per Kotaku’s <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1816797825444753673">Ethan Gach</a>, games that have been in development for more than a year, and live service games can continue with union actors, though new and early projects cannot. Given that games can now very easily take 5 years to complete, there’s plenty room for this strike to escalate, especially as motion capture is a time consuming endeavour.</p>
<p>Given the timing, SAG-AFTRA has said that actors can take part in San Diego Comic Con panels which run through this weekend. Ordinarily all promotional work would also be halted, from awards shows to conventions and even social media posts.</p>
<p>The strike comes <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/09/sag-aftra-approve-strike-video-game-industry-1235555756/">ten months after members voted to authorise a strike</a>, and in the wake of the 2023 strike by SAG-AFTRA actors for TV and film, in which the use of generative AI and digital recreation were key points. Where the TV and film strike was also concerned with residual payments and the like, it’s the threat that generative AI poses to almost the entire video game voice actor industry that is really in the limelight here.</p>
<p>Generative AI has come on leaps and bounds in the last few years, and while still a million miles away from what we would traditionally think of as being AI – that’d be a self-aware computer, as opposed to what would more accurately be called ‘Machine Learning’ – it is already capable of synthesising a person’s voice from relatively few audio samples. There’s still things like needing to be able to convey emotion and the nuances of a performance and reading, but developers have already been using generative AI for things like the announcer in extraction shooter <a href="https://gamerant.com/the-finals-beta-criticized-ai-voices-voice-acting/">The Finals in open beta</a>, where a somewhat robotic performance is fairly in keeping with the tone of the game, and other titles have also used AI as placeholder until the latter stages of development.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-overhauls-steam-demos</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-overhauls-steam-demos-with-separate-store-pages-and-more.937614/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-overhauls-steam-demos<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced a new Steam update which will overhaul the way demos work on the storefront, so you should start seeing some changes to demos soon.</p>
<p>The update isn't a client-side one, so you won't have anything new to download. Rather, it's bringing a new suite of tools that devs and publishers can use to make demos "an even more powerful and flexible marketing tool", according to Valve.</p>
<p>First up, demos can now be added to your library without downloading them; a new "add to library" button has been added to demo pages beside the "download" button, so you can set them up for downloading later if you prefer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-demo-overhaul-new-page.jpg?itok=d2bYZrna 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-demo-overhaul-new-page.jpg?itok=f0X3bvQw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can now add Steam demos to your library to play them later.</figcaption></figure><p>It's now possible for publishers to create a separate store page for their demos if they wish. At the moment, any demo listings on Steam simply redirect to the main game's page, but in future, you might start seeing distinct pages for game demos.</p>
<p>As a result of this, it's also possible for user reviews to start appearing on separate demo pages, which should be a good way to give players a better idea of whether a demo is worth installing or not. Hey, it's all valuable storage space!</p>
<p>Valve says that demos will also start appearing more often on Steam store lists like New &amp; Trending, New on Steam, and "relevant tag and category pages".</p>
<p>In essence, this means that when developers and publishers launch a demo on Steam, it'll be treated more like a full free game (in terms of listings and visibility, at least) than a straightforward demo.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-demo-overhaul-new-trending.jpg?itok=pZCDwax9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-demo-overhaul-new-trending.jpg?itok=xf6Gv9MG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may well start seeing demos on Steam's New &amp; Trending page soon.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're a developer and you're wondering what else you might need to know as a result of this demo overhaul, make sure to check out Valve's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4155211502162971563" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full announcement</a> for some extra details, plus an amusingly-titled "infrequently asked questions" section.</p>
<p>This demo overhaul follows on from a newly-introduced Steam feature in the form of new game recording tools, which were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-game-recording-beta">introduced in beta back in June</a>. Given that Steam players once again <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-player-count-record-sale">broke the platform's concurrent user total</a> during this year's summer sale, it seems these features are still in high demand.</p>

This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss the downsides and upsides of the video game battle pass.
</p>
<p>In a week where PlayStation live-service hopeful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-next-live-service-sci-fi-shooter-concord-wont-have-a-battle-pass">Concord trumpeted the fact it won't sell you a battle pass as a marketing beat</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-studio-u-turns-on-controversial-real-money-battle-pass-changes">Apex Legends dialled back (some of) its battle pass changes</a> following fan fury, we consider the options available to video game makers hoping to ensure their latest releases keep being played - and paid for - well after release.</p>
<p>Would more people play Concord if it was a free-to-play title with a battle pass? Or is it better served by being a £40 launch? Not everyone can promise they'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-will-never-charge-money-for-dlc-or-updates">never sell post-launch content, as Stardew Valley's creator did</a> this week. But there's clearly a balance to be struck to ensure players don't feel fleeced, particularly when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-will-have-a-battle-pass-limited-to-cosmetics-report">full-priced launches like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> are getting in on the act too. Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy to discuss.</p>

			<p>Remnant II, a 2023 game, has been announced to receive its third and final DLC. This announcement accompanies the game's first anniversary, which has been over a year. The DLC will be titled The Dark Horizon and released in September 2024.&nbsp; This DLC will take players back to the depths of N'Erud, where a peculiar phenomenon has taken over the surrounding area, and it's up to you to uncover it.</p>
<p>Originally, Gunfire Games, the developer behind Remnant II, wanted all three DLCs released by the game's first anniversary. However, they have since decided to delay the third DLC. They do this to make the DLC as polished as possible and "deliver you the best possible experience you deserve."</p>
<p>The Dark Horizon, the third DLC, is set to be the most expansive of the three that Remnant II will receive. Players can expect to see more of "the Remnant greatness you've come to expect." In addition to the DLC in progress, they are creating a brand-new game mode that will be free to everyone who owns Remnant II.</p>
<p>While the upcoming game mode has minimal details, Gunfire Games has revealed that a new progression system will be specifically tailored to it. The developers say they will reveal more information about this game mode and The Dark Horizon DLC "soon."</p>
<p>Gunfire Games&nbsp;<span>has&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1282100/view/4364635226638976270" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed their sadness</a> in having to delay the DLC, going on to say, "While we're not happy about delaying this DLC release -- one you've been itching to jump into already—</span>we feel very lucky to see your ongoing support and loyalty to the Remnant franchise." While they go on to express their joy at the positivity pouring out from the Remnant community, Steam's reviews suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>Both currently released DLCs have mixed reviews, while Remnant II has a primarily positive rating. Regarding The Forgotten Kingdom, players felt that the DLC was more of the same as the base game and couldn't distinguish the difference between the two. In addition, because it lacked a proper end-game, players struggled to see where this DLC slotted in.</p>
<p>Compared to The Forgotten Kingdom, The Awakened King receives slightly better reviews. While players found boss fights enjoyable, they said the area needed to be tuned better. The reasons for tuning were split; some said the bosses were too strong, while others said they were too weak. In addition, players felt it recycled content and assets from the base game rather than giving the DLC its flair.</p>
<p>While Gunfire Games does not specify a specific date for releasing more information on the new DLC, they promise that it will be soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/top-esports-games-india/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Esports is experiencing rapid growth in India, garnering increasing interest from the younger generation as a viable career path. Mobile gaming prevails as the dominant sector within the Indian esports landscape, with most gamers favouring this platform over PC or console gaming.</p>



<p>As a result, games such as BGMI, COD Mobile, and Free Fire hold greater prominence than Dota 2 or LoL. Furthermore, the best Indian esports teams actively engage in mobile gaming competitions, recognizing this platform as pivotal for engaging the audience. Let us now explore some of the top esports games in India.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bgmi">BGMI</h2>



<p>The battle royale game developed by Krafton is arguably one of India’s most popular esports titles. The game has a turbulent history, as it first replaced Tencent’s battle royale title when PUBG, along with a host of other Chinese applications, was banned from the country in 2022. Later, BGMI was banned from India in 2022 and returned to Android and iOS stores in May 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="OFFICIAL LAUNCH of BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE INDIA | Download Now" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZO2-ytt8W84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Since its triumphant return, BGMI has regained its former glory and surpassed it, hosting some of India’s most intense and watched esports competitions in recent months. The game’s revival has been nothing short of a spectacle, with top tournaments like the BGMI Masters Series, BGIS, Skyesports Champions Series, and more drawing in massive audiences.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-nbsp">Valorant&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Despite the overwhelming dominance of mobile gaming in India, Valorant has managed to carve a niche among the best esports games in India. The game’s unique 5v5 FPS tactical shooter format, coupled with Riot’s strategic promotional efforts, has piqued the interest of Indian gamers. The introduction of an Indian hero, Harbor, has further bolstered the game’s popularity, promising an exciting future for Valorant in the Indian esports scene.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="VALORANT CONSOLE ANNOUNCE // Gameplay Trailer - VALORANT" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GAkFklRvhjU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Valorant is one of the few non-mobile games that has made its mark in the country, and Riot will soon make an effort to make their other premier esports game, League of Legends, one of the top esports games in India. Some Valorant competitions where the best Indian esports teams play include the Valorant Challengers Series, Skyesports League, and more.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-unite">Pokemon UNITE</h2>



<p>Back to my point of the top esports in India residing in mobile games, Pokemon UNITE is the next game on the list. Pokemon UNITE burst into the Indian esports scene in 2021, and many players jumped onto the free-to-play MOBA Pokemon game. Since then, it has become a favourite at esports competitions in the country. The famous esports tournaments for this game include Pokemon UNITE Pro League, Pokemon UNITE Championship Series and more.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="🎊 The Pokémon UNITE 3rd Anniversary is here! 🎊" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xLc1kEIIlJM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-counter-strike-2">Counter-Strike 2</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike has always been a fan favourite in the Indian esports scene, with CS: GO being one of the most popular esports games in the country. Counter-Strike is close to most Indian gamers’ hearts as it is one of the first multiplayer games that most gamers come across, thanks to the country’s cybercafe culture.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Counter-Strike 2 - Official Launch Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c80dVYcL69E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>However, Counter-Strike 2 is still relatively new, and there have been hardly any esports competitions in India until now. At the same time, Valve’s first-person shooter has much global history in the esports scene, and the game will pick up in India in the coming years. Popular esports CS2 competitions include Skyesports Championship, Skyesports Masters, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-cod-mobile">COD Mobile</h2>



<p>Lastly, we have COD Mobile, Tencent’s popular mobile port for Activision’s flagship first-person shooter. COD Mobile took India by storm when it was released, setting staggering first-week download records. Naturally, the game became a staple in Indian esports tournaments, boasting intense action and top-notch first-person gameplay for mobile gaming titles.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty®: Mobile - Official Launch Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n4b8FRUDNZo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>COD Mobile fans have several tournaments to watch in India, including the Call of Duty Mobile India Cup, Call of Duty Mobile India Challenge, Snapdragon Pro Series and more.&nbsp;This diversity makes it one of the top Indian esports.</p>



<h2 id="h-honourable-mention">Honourable Mention</h2>



<p>When compiling a list of the top esports games in India, one cannot overlook Garena’s Free Fire, a beloved title in the esports community. Despite its ban, announcing an India-specific version of Free Fire on the horizon has reignited hope and anticipation among fans.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Free Fire Official Trailer | Free Fire Official" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oq2Rz2I11l0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

Fortnite has been removed from iOS since 2020, but it looks like it may be coming back eventually.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-_tfogwUsU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new trailer</a> released today, Mediatonic announced a new Star Wars collaboration is coming to Fall Guys on July 30, 2024.</p>



<p>The crossover will feature Darth Maul, Padme Amidala, Yoda, and R2-D2. Like previous collaborations, today’s cinematic trailer for the new characters makes it clear that the upcoming content requires in-game purchases. </p>



<p>While Mediatonic did not confirm the exact pricing, fans can likely speculate based on past crossovers.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Yoda, R2-D2, Padme Amidala and Darth Maul land in Fall Guys!" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z-_tfogwUsU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Previously, Fall Guys focused on the original trilogy for May the 4th this year with characters like Captain Han Solo and Boba Fett. </p>



<p>There were also additions specifically based on The Empire Strikes Back, such as a Carbon Freezing Chamber. Today’s cinematic trailer didn’t hint at similar content for the prequel era, though it did hint at some possible emotes.</p>



<p>The new crossover does suggest even more Star Wars collaborations could arrive in the future, such as sequel trilogy or series-based content.</p>



<p>Most recently, Fall Guys finally released its delayed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fall-guys-collaboration-arrives-in-uefn-following-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaboration in Fortnite</a> for the major v30.30 update, welcoming many new fans to the game.</p>



<p>Fortnite players can now build Fall Guys islands with UEFN and Fortnite Creative. Fans can publish those islands beginning August 6, 2024.</p>



<p>Just today, publisher Epic Games also unveiled its new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-reveals-new-plans-for-mobile-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans for mobile gaming</a>, ahead of its return to the iOS store in the EU.</p>

		<div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Dark Souls: The Board Game – The Sunless City is a new take on the tabletop adaptation, aiming to make the rules easier to grasp, while also featuring the most iconic location from the original video game: Anor Londo. As a long-time fan of dying a lot in video games, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> is an important series to me, and having also played the standard version of The Board Game, I’m happy to report that it’s definitely a little more player-friendly, while not removing any of the lethality.</p>
<p>Let’s go over what you get in the box though, because that’s pretty important for a board game. You get fifteen enemy minis with three of those being bosses. Calling the bosses “miniature” feels a little off to be honest, given that you can fight against a Titanite Demon, and then the classic duo of Ornstein and Smough, and they’re all massive. You also get three player classes – Herald, Warrior, and Pyromancer – and then a bunch of new cards covering your equipment and spells.</p>



<p>What’s really cool, is that even though the rules do take a new approach, it’s all backwards compatible. That means that you can bring in pieces from other sets you have, and that’ll unlock new classes, more boss fights, and enemies in general. We’re a big fan of this approach, because it means that the money anybody has spent on the first generation of the game isn’t wasted.</p>
<p>You can play this solo and still have a lot of fun, but can also bring up to two of your friends in to help tackle the might of Anor Londo. You’ll have to overcoming different encounters, which are decided by drawing Encounter Cards to decide on what you’ll be fighting in any given room, along with the loot that you’ll be getting as well. The Titanite Demon then stands as a mini-boss of sorts, with the big duo serving as the climactic final fight.</p>


<p>It can feel odd that, without a dedicated player for the bad guys, you have to both control them and try to overcome them, though it’s all handled by a deck of cards that serves as their attack pattern. You’ll need to learn the order of the cards, which you shuffle each time you play the game to keep it fresh, and then think ahead about what attacks are coming, and where you’ll need to be. You can also, if you want, carry your progress on into other expansions to keep games going longer, even serving as a way to allow for a month-long campaign. You don’t have to though, and that’s one of the things that makes this special.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Dark Souls The Board Game The Sunless City is a great new take on the already solid board game, and the classic setting, incredibly boss design, and beautiful minis only help to maintain a really high level of polish. Throw in compatibility to the original, and you've got a board game that'll keep fans incredibly happy and also serves as a good on-ramp for newer players as well. This is definitely not one you'll want to miss if you like combat-heavy board games.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 and developer Sassy Chap Games have announced&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, a dating sim where the studios claim you can, in fact, date everything.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the game "whisks players off into a world where everyday objects transform into romantic possibilities". If you've ever found yourself idly wishing you could romance your laundry basket, your vacuum cleaner, or even the very air you breathe, this is the game for you.</p>
<p>With the help of special "Dateviator" (surely that should be Avidater?) glasses, you'll chat up everyday objects around your home to see if any of them spark joy, so to speak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-dating-sim-hoove.jpg?itok=srkdDOGS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-dating-sim-hoove.jpg?itok=HxGzgqXS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The possibilities for jokes here are endless.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is being made by Sassy Chap Games, a new studio formed by "a group of well-recognized voice actors" like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XV</em>'s Ray Chase and <i>Persona 5</i>'s Max Mittelman, among others.</p>
<p>As such, the game will feature 100 "fully voiced datable characters", as well as branching dialogue with multiple endings for each character.</p>
<p>Sassy Chap says that each romance path will have three potential outcomes, Love, Friend, or Hate, and each one will lead to a different resolution, which creates what the studio calls "an endless panoply of playthroughs".</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>right here. It'll give you a good idea of what you're in for, as well as which of your suddenly-not-inanimate waifus and husbandos you'd like to romance.</p>

<p>All of the characters mentioned above will have their own themes, and more than 11,000 hand-drawn images will bring them and their environments to life.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to fully interact with a 3D overworld that will change based on the choices you make throughout your run, so it won't just be the kind of static visual novel you might be used to from the dating sim world.</p>
<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it lands, it'll arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hooked-on-you-dead-by-daylight-dating-sim"><em>Hooked on You</em></a>, then you owe it to yourself to keep an eye on this one.</p>

The player is in, or should be in, control of any situation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">remaster, several things I noticed that gave me pause during the trailer was a greater focus on i-frame dodging, James's ability to stun an enemy before going in for a finishing blow like Leon, and in the extended trailer watching a nurse auto counter James after attacking too much.</span></p><p>Good horror has to strike balance between giving the player power and making them helpless (source IGN)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's easy to think that improving the combat, or creating new combat mechanics, is going to make the game better, but it also clashes with one of the most essential tenets of good horror design -- you&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>DON'T</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;want to be fighting.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Overcorrecting Horror">Overcorrecting Horror</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two over corrections happened with horror design in the 2010's. Following the success of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in the prior decade, designers started to really push the idea of combat as a focus for horror such as in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Space</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and the later Evils. Even&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>F.E.A.R.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;which is still highly regarded went for this idea of a military shooter meets Japanese horror.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other was a complete denouncement of the prior trend by smaller and indie studios. One of the most famous for that time was Frictional Games, who after the release of the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Penumbra</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;series went on to hit it big with&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amnesia-designer-removing-combat-opens-up-new-horizons/1100-6328973/">In interviews after the fact</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the co-founder often said they wanted to move away from combat/fighting in horror games as it was hurting the experience. Soon after, every single indie developer went a similar route with the likes of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FNAF</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;and more horror games than I can count today.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some may put combat in as kind of a boss fight or end-game option, but for most of the gameplay, the player is not fighting or engaging with the enemies in any way. Looking back on both styles, the developers are wrong for different reasons. With the action side, the more the player is allowed to engage with enemies from a position of power, the less horror there is. You know a game is not meant to be scary, such as in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Space</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where most of the encounters are arena fights that put the combat front and center. With&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Callisto Protocol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I said in my review that it was a good action game, but a terrible horror game for how combat devolved into a&nbsp;dodging mini-game.</span></p><p>Resident Evil 4 wants to have it both ways in terms of survival and action, but still leans more on being powerful than powerless (source author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the other side of the equation, having no combat or direct interaction with the enemies presents a different problem. It creates this black-or-white state&nbsp;that the player is either 100% safe or 100% dead. When the player knows that there is nothing else they can reasonably do, the sense of horror is replaced with a sense of frustration getting stuck at a spot repeatedly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From a gameplay standpoint, it makes these horror games become exceptionally repetitive because there is only one "right way" to get through these encounters. If you watch high-level play of something like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FNAF</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you're not engaging with the game anymore, you are performing a fixed set of actions designed to counter the AI behavior of the enemy, not the enemy itself. In the past, I've equated horror like this to a haunted house, and in my opinion, that's not good horror design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the footage I saw from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Remaster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the developers are obviously leaning towards the former, but this betrays several aspects of survival horror design that I don't see a lot of developers doing justice to.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Scrapping By">Scrapping By</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Survival horror, as the name implies, is about "survival". This is not supposed to be about the Doom Slayer ripping and tearing through monsters, just as it isn't about someone being chased by cannibalistic monsters and deciding not to pick up any of the knives, swords, clubs, or chainsaws they find around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is a very narrow place for where combat should fall in a survival horror game. It is meant to be a tool, but not "the tool" the player can use. If combat is too powerful, then it becomes the best option in any encounter if the player can just fight their way passed everything. If it's too weak or nonexistent, then the player doesn't have a way of interacting with the creatures. A good example of this philosophy would be the survival items from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 1 Remaster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, they allow the player to fight enemies a bit more safely than before, but they are still limited in their use.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What you want to see in a good horror setting is that fighting is allowed, but you do not want to be doing it. There needs to be a credible risk to fighting enemies to the player's health, resources, or both. The horror in these games is a form of the same horror seen in every soulslike where the player is in uncharted territory with a ton of souls -- that risk that in any fight or situation, they could lose everything. Combat needs to be messy and chaotic, not something that you can hone your skills at like in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sekiro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;where there is a legitimate challenge to get through the game, and games like it, hitless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That also means designing enemies whose only behavior isn't either "run at the player" or "run very fast at the player." Nemesis and Mr. X from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;remakes are close to what I'm looking for, but they still feel more like a phase in the level design, rather than an active enemy. Once you know their behavior, they stop being a threat. Looking at the footage from the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2 Remake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;trailer, the nurse was performing the same three-hit combo twice, which leads me to believe that combat is going to be mechanical in that respect.</span></p><p>The problem with Nemesis and Mr.X is that they still fall into set patterns for engagement (source Capcom)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a surprising twist, the closest a game has gotten to what I'm looking for in survival horror would be&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Amnesia: The Bunker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The beast that stalks the player is something that can be engaged with in multiple organic ways -- you can set traps, use noise as bait, or just shoot the damn thing until it retreats. Being able to fight the creature or use the environment to your advantage gives the player a lot of options, and takes me to what I want to see as an evolution of horror.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Immsurvival">Immsurvival</h2><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w1sgpGoaOBk?si=yLegKBThoJqyauhV" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What I'm looking for as an evolution of horror design is not about making the game hard to control or have janky movement, but giving the player a variety of weapons and means of survival, and making them completely terrified to use any of them against whatever "thing" is coming after them. Returning to the idea of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and push-forward combat, I had a crazy idea -- can you make a survival horror game where the player has infinite healing items and ammo by default, but still make it frightening to play?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I want the enemy designs to have as much freedom to use the environment as they see fit that the player does -- the trapper becoming the trappie to then turn it around on the player. I'm tired of games that only have fixed breakable sections where an enemy can show up -- I want the player to feel like 360 degrees around them is unsafe at all times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Good horror design is about making the player fight themselves as much as they are fighting enemies and making the player too powerful or too weak ends up with a horror game with either too much or too little bite to it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For more about horror design, you can&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.routledge.com/Game-Design-Deep-Dive-Horror/Bycer/p/book/9780367721749">check out my Deep Dive</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;on it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>If you would like to support what I do and let me do more daily streaming, be sure to check out my&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://patreon.com/gwbycer">patreon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.

The changes are based on feedback from developers and players, altering how demos behave and appear on the Steam marketplace.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For starters, demos can now be added to Steam libraries without the need for an immediate install. A new 'add to library' button can be used to chuck demos into libraries from the mobile app or other places "where you may not be ready to install them immediately."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It will also be possible to install demos after purchasing the full game, making it easier for developers to test demos and help players manage their library.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Steam store pages for demos">Steam store pages for demos</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another notable tweak will enable developers to create a separate store page for demos without impacting visibility. "By default, your free demo appears as a button on your base game's store page. But if you want to have a separate store page for your demo, you can now enable that in the 'edit store' section for your demo," reads a post from Valve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Enabling a separate store page for your demo will give you space to better describe the contents of the demo, add screenshots, upload a trailer, and specify supported features. If you choose to enable a store page for your demo, you will also be enabling players of your demo to post user reviews that appear on your demo."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve says Steam will treat demos "mostly the same way" irrespective of whether they exist as a standalone page or not. That said, a standalone demo that garners negative reviews might be hamstrung in the same way as a full release. "Of course the flipside can be true too; if players are loving your demo, the positive review signal to other players may boost interest," adds Valve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sticking with visibility, Valve says demos will now behave more like free games and can appear in all the same sections and lists. "For example, demos can now appear on the Steam homepage in charts such as the 'New &amp; Trending,' on the 'New on Steam' page, and on relevant tag and category pages,' notes Valve. "This means that launching a new free demo for your game will behave similarly as launching a free stand-alone game on Steam."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers will also be able to notify wishlisters when they launch a playable demo, potentially helping them bolster their marketing campaign.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can find out more about the latest changes on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4155211502162971563">Steamworks blog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-lowers-budget-for-bioshock-movie-adaptation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>As reported <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/bioshock-movie-scaled-down-netflix-more-personal-1236085711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Variety</a>, producer Roy Lee revealed today that Netflix lowered the budget for its BioShock movie adaptation, though it is still under way.</p>



<p>The update came up during a panel at San Diego Comic Con, which is currently running through July 28, 2024. Lee explained that “the new regime has lowered the budgets,” following the Netflix leadership shakeup.</p>



<p>They elaborated that as a result, the BioShock movie will feature “a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Lee also broke down Netflix’s general new compensation strategy, with bonuses based on viewership numbers. The producer added that “it motivates the producers to actually do a movie that gets a bigger audience.”</p>



<p>Netflix first announced the BioShock adaptation a couple of years ago, but Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence remains attached. Although Lee described the film adaptation as a “much smaller version” today, that could potentially benefit the story in some ways.</p>



<p>The original BioShock launched in 2007 to critical acclaim, and the series continues to thrive. </p>



<p>Reportedly, 2K Cloud Chamber recently ramped up development on the next BioShock video game. Just two weeks ago, the studio began <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioshock-4-developer-hiring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hiring for 30 open positions</a> involving both cinematic and narrative experience.</p>



<p>At this time, the BioShock movie does not have a release window, though today’s update provides a better idea of the development timeline.</p>
