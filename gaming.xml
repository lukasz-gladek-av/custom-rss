			<p>After the thoroughly enjoyable main game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall’s</a> first DLC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/24/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-review/">Wicked Isle</a>, was a bit of a letdown. Its story, despite some added monk mysteries, was far too similar to the main game’s story to keep my attention, not to mention the slightly awkward way in which it was presented. Then some of the missions required backtracking to areas from the base game for the fetchiest of all fetch quests, which really didn’t help things. The Red Strain is the second expansion for the game, taking players to another new area with its own storyline and sprinkling in some new weapons and perks as well. It’s certainly a bit of an improvement of its predecessor, but the title of the DLC might give a hint as to why it’s still a bit disappointing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall The Red Strain Launch Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/quZYMM2cDBw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Forgoing any story spoilers, The Red Strain refers to a mysterious and, yes, <em>red</em> plague that is corrupting the environment and people in the new area, Scafell Crag. It turns the foliage red and dangerous, with exploding red things in it, and there are red ferals now. You know, instead of them being blue. Herein lies the disappointment: this new red strain doesn’t really behave very differently to the blue version in the main game.</p>



<p>The only real difference is that this strain has also been corrupting humans, driving them to be aggressive and attacking you on sight, which is like pretty much everyone else you bump into in the wilderness in Atomfall. It’s a shame there isn’t much new here really, especially since even the enemies are barely changed – they’re just red now.</p>

<p>My initial foray into Scafell Crag was absolutely miserable. First I backtracked to the very beginning area of the game to access the lift that would take me there, not too bad but a bit inconvenient, but once I took that lift and ventured into the new area I was beset by enemies. Even my stockpile of ammo that I have had since lowering the difficulty in the previous DLC started to dwindle. Suffice to say that the initial area is incredibly hostile and the second area is quarantined behind a big, impassable wall.</p>

<p>So after I have seemingly wiped out half the population of Cumbria, I set about finding a way through this wall. After a minor quest issue that has recently been patched that led to a major misunderstanding caused me to waste half an hour sprinting all the way to Skethermoore for no reason, I opened this gate and started having fun again. This is why the Red Strain is a shame, the actual titular aspect – the Red Strain itself – is almost a reskin mechanically speaking, but the stuff in the background to explain it is quite interesting. There’s talking brains in jars here – another classic Fallout staple and a decent mystery with some suitably eccentric science-types. Sure some of the details are predictable – I’m sure you already know the source of the red strain based entirely on its name and how I’ve described it – but so were some of the details of the main game. That moreish feeling I had when playing through the main story returned for a good while during this DLC.</p>
<p>Along with these brain jars comes some new robots and enemies, including some flying, manhack-style things that are cool, if annoying because they behave like the rats and other swarms in the main game. There’s some new perks that can be very useful, and whilst there are some new legendary weapons, my favourite new gun is an actual silenced pistol, which has revolutionised stealth in the game, unsurprisingly. Melee combat is still poor, though that recent patch improves AI reactions whilst fighting at least, specifically ensuring they flinch when you kick them, which you’d think would be a given.</p>

<p>This free update that’s arrived alongside the ‘complete edition’ release has also added a fast travel system to the game that, while I mostly played this DLC before that update was released, should be a major blessing to get past some of the more tedious backtracking. The inventory is still a pain, however, especially since you often need to carry quest items around that take up precious space.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Whilst the eponymous Red Strain itself is predictable, the other stuff surrounding it is pretty interesting. The same could be said of Oberon and the main game, though, and the interesting stuff is enough to pull you through here just like it was there. This expansion feels about same quality as the main game did, whilst Wicked Isle felt lacking, so this is a return to form in a way. It might not be enough to trigger a new playthrough, but it's a good addition if you decide to do one anyway.	</p></div>

		<p>11 Bit Studios has revealed a new DLC for Frostpunk 2 and it is called Fractured Utopias. The studio has also confirmed when players will be able to dive into the new content, giving Fractured Utopias a release date of December 8th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 2: Fractured Utopias | Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJrPjBeeu74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Frostpunk 2’s Fractured Utopias, players will get eight new faction utopias, with each faction vying for what they view as their perfect society and they will clash over their different visions. There will be 12 unique unlocks per faction including laws, HUBs, and abilities, as well as eight housing district variants. The content will also be fleshed out with 100 new narrative events to navigate, a new map, and two new premium tales called Doomsayers and Plague.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/frostpunk-2-console-review/">Frostpunk 2 Console Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Frostpunk 2 console review, Dom said, <em>“Frostpunk 2 remains one of the most compelling city builders and survival games in recent memory, and it’s survived the transition to console in remarkably strong form. That said, if you have the option of playing on PC, that remains the best place to play.”</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Iconic Lovecraftian Board Game Eldritch Horror Is Coming to PC]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Iconic Lovecraftian tabletop horror game&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror&nbsp;</em>is getting itself a PC adaptation next year, and it promises to deliver a faithful digital version of the "acclaimed globe-spanning mystery and adventure".</p>

<p>As revealed during an&nbsp;<em>Arkham Horror</em>-focused livestream,&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror&nbsp;</em>will be launching via Steam in the first quarter of 2026. Development is being handled by Cornerstone Software, and this appears to be the studio's first project.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror: Digital Edition&nbsp;</em>aims to bring the scares and strategic decision-making of the original tabletop game to PC audiences, so you can expect pretty much the same gameplay and atmosphere you'll experience if you play the board game version.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eldritch-horror-pc-adaptation-board.jpg?itok=MmJIhvfN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eldritch-horror-pc-adaptation-board.jpg?itok=-gK7O32H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Legendary tabletop strategy game&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Cornerstone's&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror&nbsp;</em>adaptation will feature eight playable characters, all of whom are "fully voiced", as well as four distinct Ancient Ones to take on. You can also look forward to "countless monsters" and "hundreds of encounters", all based on the original&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror</em>'s "rich" lore.</p>

<p>This being a PC adaptation, though, you won't need to rely on YouTube ambience compilations for your soundscape;&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror: Digital Edition&nbsp;</em>will come complete with a "haunting original soundtrack", as well as new artwork that captures the game's "noir-inspired, 1920s supernatural aesthetic".</p>

<p>Of course, the game will attempt to faithfully translate Fantasy Flight's strategic party-based co-op gameplay into a digital arena as well, complete with "resource management, storytelling, and roguelite elements".</p>

<p>That being said, Cornerstone has made a couple of housekeeping changes; much of&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror</em>'s number-crunching and "bookkeeping" will be handled for you in the Steam version, allowing you to get straight to the spooky action, as it were.</p>

It'll set you back $24.99 or your regional equivalent.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.4, as well as some of the things you can expect from the patch when it lands, including a new dungeon, a new Trial, and more.</p>

<p>In the latest Letter from the Producer livestream, producer Naoki Yoshida revealed that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>&nbsp;Patch 7.4, which follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-73-august" rel="nofollow">August's Patch 7.3</a>, will be arriving across all platforms on December 16th. That should give you just enough time to think of some excuses to avoid your relatives so you can play it.</p>

<p>When Patch 7.4 launches, it'll kick off the next major arc in the long-running MMO's sprawling story, with the narrative fallout from 2024's&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>expansion having reached a climax in the previous patch.</p>

Not only that, but a new Trial, the rather intriguingly-named Hell on Rails, will be made available as well.</p>

<p>Four new raids are coming as part of the ongoing Arcadion raid series, tying up this sequence of eight-player battles, and you can expect a brand new Frontlines map that's sure to keep the bloodthirsty PvP marauders happy.</p>

<p>All of this is coming alongside a new Cosmic Exploration destination, a new Variant dungeon, and much more, so make sure to re-up your subscription if you're interested in finding out what happens to the Warriors of Light next.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s latest patch comes just a few months after the reveal that the popular MMO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-ps4-yoshi-p-comments" rel="nofollow">may not maintain its PS4 version forever</a>, as rising technical requirements might preclude the development team from releasing further updates for the platform at some point in the future.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Don McGowan is an attorney who knows what he's talking about when it comes to understanding what Microsoft might do following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-microsoft-be-able-to-stop-the-white-house-using-ai-generated-halo-imagery-to-depict-trump-as-master-chief-and-to-promote-and-recruit-for-ice-depressingly-i-doubt-it">the Trump administration's provocative use of the Halo IP</a> on social media this week. He was a senior attorney at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> for three years. He was also chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company for a decade - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-confirms-that-no-its-imagery-was-not-granted-for-use-in-disturbing-us-department-of-homeland-security-video">another brand recently abused by the Trump administration</a>. McGowan, currently a partner at KUSK Law and principal at Extreme Grownup Services, has given me an insight into what Microsoft's current thinking might be.</p>
<p>Quickly if you don't know: we're talking about The White House tweeting an AI-generated an image of Trump as Halo protagonist Master Chief, and the Department of Homeland Security tweeting an AI-generated Halo image promoting ICE, which showed Halo spartan soldiers on a Warthog jeep on a Halo ring world alongside a call to destroy the Flood - a thinly veiled and deplorable reference to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Understandably, such use of the Halo IP has caused fierce backlash, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-administrations-use-of-halo-ought-to-offend-every-halo-fan-regardless-of-political-orientation-says-key-series-designer">including strongly worded reprimands from the original creators of the Halo series and games</a>.</p>
<p>But the question has remained, all through this week, what Microsoft intends to do about it, because it hasn't said or done anything noticeable yet. "If I were Microsoft looking at this situation I would game-out the benefits and drawbacks of making this an issue," McGowan told me.</p><p>"One of Microsoft's biggest customers is the US government. Think of how many Windows licenses, Azure instances, Office 365 licenses, etc. the government has. Why would Microsoft take a step that puts those at risk? Microsoft has a dedicated federal government sales team, which means if that customer goes away, so might those jobs.</p>
<p>"It's always worth remembering how companies see themselves to understand what they're trying to do," he explained. "Microsoft is a business software company (Nintendo is a consumer electronics company and Sony is a bank). As in: The list of brands Microsoft wants most to protect probably doesn't have Halo on it, and the customers with whom it wants to protect its reputation are institutional customers. The tail doesn't wag the dog. This might lead to a reduced customer base for Xbox but that's less of an existential problem than fighting with a government."</p>
<p>Were this situation left to McGowan to deal with - and bear in mind it's been 17 years since he worked at Microsoft - he told me the first thing he'd do is have someone make a call to the government and have a friendly word.</p>
<p>"I would have Fred Humphries, the head of [Government Affairs at Microsoft], make a call to someone friendly in the Administration and say hey, could you do us a solid and use someone else's IP for a while? That might be challenging because the obvious substitute IP is Call of Duty and that's theirs also, but still."</p>
<p>There are already clues this might have happened in <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1983604918239031569">the Department of Homeland Security's pivot to  using imagery from The Lord of the Rings films</a> instead of Halo.</p>
<p>"What I wouldn't do is anything public," McGowan added. "I might let <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> say something like 'we wish they wouldn't have done that' in an unrelated interview. But that's as far as I'd go."</p>

<p>There's also a related question of precedent here. We saw a few months ago the usually litigation-quick Pokémon Company seemingly do nothing about the egregious use of Pokémon in an ICE promotional video. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-flood-are-evil-space-zombie-parasites-and-are-not-an-allegory-to-any-group-of-people-original-halo-devs-hit-out-at-homeland-security-ice-recruitment-ad">McGowan told IGN</a> recently he wouldn't have touched this either, were he still working there, "and I'm the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I've ever met", he said.</p><p>Does Microsoft's apparent inaction here, in addition to The Pokémon Company's apparent inaction, open the door for other parties to use these IPs as they see fit, too? Does it create an argument of some legal weight whereby someone can argue 'hey they did it worse'?</p>
<p>"I'm a big believer that people and companies have the right to be capricious," McGowan told me. "Letting someone do a thing doesn't obligate you to let everyone do that thing, and so if you see a thing you don't have to stop it.</p>
<p>"Copyright isn't trademark where there's a legal obligation to stop people from infringing," he explained. "You can let someone infringe your copyrights without issue, except that a future judge might not give huge damages for future infringement on account of judges are people. But letting [Customs and Border Patrol, which is part of the Department for Homeland Security] do this has no legal impact in the future."</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> community is on the hunt for Easter eggs, with one persistent player managing to clip inside a hidden room attached to the in-game shooting range.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/hidden_room_in_the_shooting_range/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Posted on the Battlefield reddit</a>, user Mobile_Cyberdemon_as showed off the process required to get past the door marked 'keep door closed'. Facing the door, look to the left and you'll see a small rubbish bin on the floor. By going prone on top of this bin at just the right angle, you can clip through the wall and access the hidden room.</p>
<p>What's inside the room isn't particularly exciting, with only some furniture and a helmet or two littered around, but nonetheless it raises the question of why it's there in the first place? It could just be a layover from a previous design of the shooting range, certainly. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/comment/nm7oq32/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Though some players believe it could indicate a future expansion to the shooting range</a>, perhaps for vehicles.</p>

<p>Others have pointed out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/comment/nm7ri9z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">that the stripy background you can see on the walls of this hidden room looks the same as the background when you customise a weapon</a>, meaning <em>this</em> could be where the customisation actually takes place in-game. It's entirely possible, it's common for separate screens like weapon customisation to take place in the environment out of sight via usual means as to avoid lengthy loading screens.</p><p>This marks the first big discovery in Battlefield 6's inevitable hunt for Easter eggs, a practice that has flourished for years given every game in the series' hidden treasures sprinkled throughout the games. For example, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-mirrors-edge-easter-egg-in-battlefield-2042s-new-map">in Battlefield 2042 there was a Mirror's Edge Easter egg</a> tucked away on the map Flashpoint. Players were able to find a pair of red running shoes by a crane, a clear nod to a gaming classic.</p>
<p>So while this hidden shooting range room isn't the treasure trove players were hoping for, it is regardless a step in the right direction. Who knows, maybe with some more snooping, this room could reveal additional secrets… Or maybe it's a cool red herring. Only time will tell!</p>

<p>Shovel Knight arrives in both NecroDancer games soon</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It is a truth, universally acknowledged, that at some point in an indie game's lifecycle, it will be graced by a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/shovel_knight">Shovel Knight</a> crossover. That even applies if your indie game is a decade old, it seems.</p>
<p>Brace Yourself Games has announced that 2015's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crypt_of_the_necrodancer">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a> (which arrived on Switch a few years later) is getting a Shovel Knight DLC all of its own. The new package throws the indie icon into the roguelike rhythm game as a new playable character with his own moveset, weapons, and shortcut potentials.</p>
<p>The above trailer gives a taste of the DLC in action, but it's safe to say that seeing a pixel art Shovel Knight hopping around on his little spade still brings us unrivalled amounts of joy.</p>
<p>What you'll also notice from the above trailer is that Crypt of the NecroDancer isn't alone in this shovel-y expansion. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer</a> is also getting in on the DLC fun, with a new Shovel Knight pack adding the following tracks to the rhythm game:</p>
<ul>
<li>"La Danse Macabre (Lich Yard)"<br></li>
<li>"Strike the Earth! (Plains of Passage)"<br></li>
<li>"In the Halls of the Usurper (Pridemoor Keep)"<br></li>
<li>"High Above the Land (The Flying Machine)"<br></li>
<li>"An Underlying Problem (The Lost City)"</li>
</ul>
<p>Rift is even getting Jake Kaufman's main Shovel Knight theme as an added bonus <em>for free</em>, so everyone will be able to try that one out.</p>
<p>The bad news is that we don't have a specific Switch release date for either of these yet. Both DLC bundles arrived on Steam yesterday, but the most Brace Yourself Games have confirmed so far is that the Switch version will be coming "at a later date". We'll be keeping an eye out for more information in the coming weeks, because we're really digging this DLC so far.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the time of this writing, Heart Machine, the studio behind games like Hyper Light Drifter, Solar Ash, and more recently, Hyper Light Breaker, is less than two weeks from releasing its next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/heart-machine-next-game-possessors-release-date-november-pc-ps5/">Possessor(s)</a>. It's also reportedly just had its second wave of layoffs in less than a month.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-possessor-s-dev-heart-machine-lays-off-more-staff-two-weeks-before-the-game-s-launch">Game Developer</a>, after the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/heart-machine-layoffs-hyper-light-breaker-development-ending/">confirmed a wave of layoffs at the beginning of October</a>, along with halting further development on Hyper Light Breaker, more former developers from Heart Machine have taken to social media to confirm that they've been laid off in a second wave this month.</p>



<p>At least four now former Heart Machine developers took to Bluesky to confirm they have been laid off, with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yiyiwzhang.bsky.social/post/3m4dxhba5ds2x">one even posting a video</a> where they paint a particularly dark picture of the shape the studio is in, saying, "<em>Heart Machine has just laid off a bunch more people, effective immediately. By the time Possessor(s) comes out on November 11th, I don't know if anyone who worked on the game will even be at the company anymore</em>.<em> That's game dev.</em>" The post captions the video "<em>Layoffs at Launch: that's game dev</em>."</p>







<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mllepilgrim.bsky.social/post/3m4c2kazjfk2n">Another post reads</a>, "<em>My heart is heavy and I might have more to say on that later, but I've got news today that my time at Heart Machine will come to an end after Possessor(s) ships. I'm honestly too busy...literally shipping the game to start actively looking for work, but I'll be looking for my next gig in December</em>."</p>



<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/virum.bsky.social/post/3m4dmk3tgqs2w">One of the developers impacted by the layoffs</a> had been with Heart Machine for nearly six years before being cut this month. Beyond those who've posted, it is unclear how many developers have been impacted in this round. The studio has yet to make a formal statement akin to the one it made earlier this month, although with the launch of Possessor(s) so close, the studio may just be waiting until after the game has launched to comment further on its status.</p>



<p>Game Developer also pointed out that this isn't just the studio's second layoff in less than a month, but also <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs">its third layoff in less than a year</a>.</p>



<p>To call these layoffs 'unfortunate' barely covers it. Heart Machine is a rarity in the modern industry as an indie studio that has stuck around for over a decade, with Hyper Light Drifter being one of the more beloved indie games in the last fifteen years. Now, it seems to be barely getting Possessor(s) out the door; its follow-up to the indie game that put the studio on everyone's radar will never really leave early access, and it doesn't feel unrealistic to say the studio might not make it to the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Hopefully, of course, that's not the case and the studio can find a path to survival once Possessor(s) has launched.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-offloading-samsungs-ssds-before-black-friday-990-evo-plus-now-going-for-peanuts-2000640283</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-offloading-samsung%E2%80%99s-ssds-before-black-friday-990-evo-plus-now-going-for-peanuts.1340293/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there anything worse than low storage and slow load times when you’re working on something important? Probably not. If your system is starting to drag and you often find yourself deleting old files to make room for new ones, it’s time for a storage upgrade. And thanks to a solid discount on one of Samsung’s best SSDs, doing that just got a lot more affordable.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/">Amazon has the Samsung 990 EVO Plus 1TB SSD listed for just $75, which is 29% off its regular price</a>. You’re saving a solid $30, which actually makes it cheaper than the base model right now. It offers plenty of space along with fast boot and transfer times so nothing is going to slow you down during your most productive, demanding days.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Plenty of Space for All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>Starting off with the storage capacity – 1TB is more than enough to house a ton of work files, plenty of assignments, all your favorite media content (high-resolution photos, videos, movies), and even a few games. This capacity should be sufficient for most work professionals, students, and creatives out there.</p>
<p>As for speed, you’re looking at some of the best in the category. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus uses PCIe Gen 4×4 and is also compatible with PCIe Gen 5×2. You’ll get read speeds of up to 7,250MB/s and write speeds up to 6,300MB/s, which translates into faster boot times and much quicker file transfers. No more staring at painfully slow progress bars that kill your momentum.</p>



<p>The M.2 2280 form factor means it works well with both desktops and laptops. Samsung’s Magician Software lets you monitor the drive’s health, install new updates, and enable extra encryption so that it stays optimized and secure over time. Best of all, despite all this power, this SSD keeps things calm and cool as it works. There’s a nickel-coated controller that helps with thermal control and keeps overheating in check during heavy tasks. It’s also more power-efficient, so you won’t have to worry about it draining the battery of your device.</p>
<p>Bottom line is, the Samsung 990 EVO Plus 1TB gives you massive storage, plus incredible performance, now at a lower-than-usual price. If you’ve been thinking about an upgrade, now’s a good time to make the move. And if 1TB isn’t quite enough for you, the 2TB and 4TB versions are also on sale, currently priced at $140 and $250, respectively.</p>

Sandfall Interactive’s RPG has been such a runaway success that people are asking Square Enix if it might signal to the storied developer that </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-turn-based-combat-clair-obscur-ff16-1851786128"><span>should go back to its turn-based roots</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XVII</span></i><span>. From the looks of it, both studios have a great deal of respect for each other, with Sandfall employees visiting Square’s offices for an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-clair-obscure-expeidition-33-turn-based-1851786927"><span>“exchange of ideas” in July</span></a><span>.

For now, we have new Nomura art of some of the breakout characters of the year.

              <p>There’s no shortage of laptops on the market, but finding one that can handle everyday work and entertainment without unnecessary extras or a high price tag can be tough. HP makes some of our favorite options out there, and Amazon is making it easy to treat yourself to one right now.</p>
<p>We just spotted the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4946/">17.3-inch HP flagship laptop going for $699, thanks to a massive 73% off its original retail price of $2,599</a>. That’s over $1,800 in savings, and one of the steepest drops we’ve seen on a full-size laptop packed with massive RAM (32GB) and storage (1TB). This is a limited-time offer, and while it hasn’t been marked as a lightning deal, there’s no guarantee it’ll last through the week-end.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4946/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Massive Screen for Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>If you’re a student or a professional looking for a reliable machine for work, streaming, or light gaming, you’ll want something with a bigger display and more power. This machine delivers exactly that.</p>
<p>Display-wise, you’re getting a 17.3-inch HD+ anti-glare screen that not just offers a larger real estate to work on, but also pushes stunning, sharp visuals to make the content pop. The 250-nit brightness keeps everything visible in both bright and dim settings, so you can comfortably use it indoors or outdoors without straining your eyes.</p>



<p>For power, there’s an Intel Core i3-N305 processor with 8 cores and 8 threads. It can hit speeds up to 3.8GHz, which is pretty decent for most everyday tasks. There’s 32GB of RAM that prevents lag during multitasking, as well as a 1TB PCIe SSD for faster boot times. The SSD also gives you plenty of space to store your important data, whether that’s work files or school assignments.</p>
<p>Those who are often on the go will appreciate the impressive all-day battery life. Recharging is fast too, and you can expect to go from 0 to 50% in just 45 minutes. It also includes Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 for faster connections, and a physical webcam shutter for privacy.</p>
<p>Best of all, you’re getting an accessory bundle thrown in with your purchase for free, which includes pre-installed Windows 11 Pro. You can get started right away without dealing with setup hassles or extra subscriptions. Just be sure to place your order before the retailer decides to shoot the price back up for good.</p>

                <p>A streamer who found himself in the legal crosshairs of Nintendo has been ordered to pay $17,500 in damages to the company.

The lawsuit accused Keighin of streaming leaked Nintendo games since 2022, and Nintendo claimed that his actions had cost the company "millions of dollars" in lost video game sales. Keighin reportedly did not have a prepared defense for the case, leading to a default judgment against him.</p><p>Nintendo had also requested a broad permanent injunction against Keighin and any third parties working with him to prevent them from using emulators--as well as the destruction of "all infringing" hardware and software--but the Colorado court did not agree to this request, rejecting it as "unclear" and "unreasonable" demands.</p><p>Known for being notoriously litigious when it comes to protecting its IP, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701/" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo also sued James Williams</a> recently, who moderated a Reddit page that promoted Switch piracy.

            <p>Epic Games has announced that Sidekicks are coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, little pets that you can bring with you into the battle royale as well as other in-game experiences within the Fortnite platform.</p>
<p>These sidekicks are essentially another form of cosmetic that players can earn and, of course, buy. They are customisable, and can even be given cute little accessories. The first sidekick to come to the game is Peels, a small yellow banana dog who'll be present in the next battle pass starting the 1st November.</p>
<p>If you're not feeling Peels, there's another bunch coming in November as part of the in-game shop. This includes Bonesy, Spike, and Lil-Raptor. Epic Games has also teased that some type of cat sidekick is set to come to Fortnite in the near future too, so there should be plenty of options. And that’s before we get to the inevitable IP tie-in stuff that’ll be sure to rear its head in the future.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a new tutorial video for the sidekicks coming to Fortnite.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0m9H13pGM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Sidekicks do not provide any in-game advantage, though they can be interacted with thanks to new sidekick emotes coming to Fornite. They also can "react to the world around you", though how exactly that works remains a mystery as of writing.</p><p>One quirk of the sidekick features is that a sidekick can only be customised one time after they're acquired, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-battle-royale-c-202300000001636/gameplay-c-202300000001721/how-do-i-customize-the-appearance-of-my-sidekick-a202300000021343">as declared on the Epic Games help website</a>. You can, however, buy the same sidekick multiple times, and can own several copies of the same sidekick as long as their customisation options are different. So, for example, you can own one red Lil Raptor, and one green Lil Raptor. You cannot own two green Lil Raptors.</p>
<p>Who doesn't love pets in video games? Even if they are just cosmetics when you really think about it, a little fella running alongside you, doing tricks or dancing on command? It's a surefire way to please people, and on Epic's part, a nice way of tempting folks to spend a little extra this month on Fortnite.</p>

<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160026/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Digital Eclipse doesn’t do things by halves. It’s already proven this with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration">Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_forever">Tetris Forever</a>, and yet I’m still blown away by what the studio has accomplished with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>.</p>
<p>For years, fans have been begging for a compilation of the original Mortal Kombat trilogy, and while many might have been satisfied with the original arcade variants on modern platforms (much like 2011’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_Arcade_Kollection">Arcade Kollection</a>), Digital Eclipse went several steps further. Here, we’ve got a total of 23 playable titles covering the first 11 years of Mortal Kombat, with just a few notable exclusions.</p>
<p>It’s an impressive achievement, and with an extensive accompanying documentary detailing Mortal Kombat’s inception and evolution, it’s easily the ultimate celebration of Midway Games’ gruesome fighting series. Glaring issues, however, become apparent once you go online – but more on that later.</p>
<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160031/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The original trilogy is represented across several platforms, including arcade, SNES, Mega Drive, 32X, PS1, Game Boy, and Game Gear. In a remarkable feat of preservation, the Wave Net version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/ultimate_mortal_kombat_3">Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</a> is also playable, having previously been limited to test sites and thus considered 'lost media'. Adding in Noob Saibot as a playable character and rebalancing the gameplay further, the Wave Net version did much more than simply introducing online play, and its inclusion here is frankly a miracle.</p>
<p>In addition to the original trilogy, we’ve also got the arcade release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mortal_kombat_4">Mortal Kombat 4</a>, the PS1 monstrosities <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mortal_kombat_mythologies_sub-zero">Mythologies: Sub-Zero</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/mortal_kombat_special_forces">Special Forces</a>, and the GBA releases of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mortal_kombat_advance">Mortal Kombat Advance</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mortal_kombat_deadly_alliance">Deadly Alliance</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mortal_kombat_tournament_edition">Tournament Edition</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of exclusions, certain platforms for specific titles are missing, including the Mega Drive's UMK3, the N64's Mortal Kombat 4, and others. Perhaps most notably, an updated release of MK4 for Dreamcast, dubbed <strong>Mortal Kombat Gold</strong>, is also absent. Its reception was mixed at best, but it still deserves representation.</p>
<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160035/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s difficult to lament missing releases here when the existing lineup is so darn impressive. Much like Tetris Forever and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/worms_armageddon_anniversary_edition">Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</a>, however, I could see Digital Eclipse adding more variations and titles as DLC later down the line. If your favourite game isn’t here, I’d advise you not to lose all hope just yet unless the studio says otherwise. ("We have nothing to announce right now, but we're open to the idea!", the team says <a href="https://www.digitaleclipse.com/media/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-launch-faq">on its FAQ page</a>.)</p>
<p>Each game offers up a variety of display options, including different screen sizes, filters, and backgrounds. While I’d normally disable the backgrounds completely on retro compilations, I’d urge you to leave them on here. The arcade variants in particular are really cool, with the glass display 'reflecting' the in-game action on the left and right sides of the screen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the console versions come with a CRT background and filters offering up flat-screen and curved-screen displays. The handhelds have all the filters you’d expect, with original, Pocket, and Light Game Boy variants.</p>
<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160033/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Most titles have training modes, with a separate mode dedicated to Fatalities (plus Babalities, Friendships, etc). These aren’t present on every entry, but the know-how from the arcade versions is directly transferable to the console versions, so you don’t need it on <em>everything</em>. Even in normal arcade mode, you can toggle on-screen prompts for special moves, so it’s a good way to get acquainted with the basic gameplay, even if it doesn’t include combo launcher tutorials.</p>
<p>Ultimately, yes, these are ‘old’ games that may require a bit of adjustment for newcomers – heck, the latest release here is from 2003, decade<strong>s</strong> ago. To anyone who grew up with Mortal Kombat in the '90s, playing most of these will be like slipping into a warm, comfortable bath (albeit one filled with blood). They feel just like they did back in the day, with the iconic stage music, character select music, and punctuating screams of <em>“Fatality!”</em> and <em>“Get over here!”</em> enough to make you giggle with glee.</p>
<p>But for those who have never touched anything older than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mortal_kombat_11">Mortal Kombat 11</a>, they might take a bit of getting used to. <a href="https://x.com/frostman007/status/1984113281607651706">The devs are investigating an issue</a> in which lowering the difficulty actually makes little to no difference to the often punishing AI, but even taking this into account, these are tough games either way, and the archaic movement exacerbates this if you’re coming into it blind. If you're <em>really</em> struggling, of course, then local multiplayer is an option, and this is just as fun as ever with a couple of friends and a few beverages.</p>
<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160032/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Like Digital Eclipse’s recent offerings, Legacy Kollection includes a full timeline chronicling the inception and development of Mortal Kombat, inserting playable versions of each game at relevant intervals. So if you struggle to just pick up and play a couple of rounds, or you're getting squished to death by <em>yet</em> <em>another</em> trap in Mythologies: Sub-Zero, viewing the context in which these games were made should help you better appreciate their quirks and thus encourage you to keep playing.</p>
<p>The interactive documentary is absurdly in-depth. It’s filled to the brim with documents, photos, interviews, and archival footage, with appearances from the likes of Andrea Rene, Mike Drucker, Eugene Jarvis, and many more. It covers how prior games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/smash_tv">Smash TV</a> influenced the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/mortal_kombat">Mortal Kombat</a>, while investigating the legal issues that eventually led to the creation of the ESRB rating system.</p>
<p>We even get to see series co-creator Ed Boon spontaneously pitch Scorpion’s rope dart move during an early performance capture session, and it’s a rare glimpse into how seemingly off-the-cuff decisions result in series-defining iconography.</p>
<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160034/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>If this is all you’re after from Legacy Kollection — if you're interested primarily in the history and the contextual material and seeing Boon and Tobias in the same room discussing the genesis and trajectory of the series — then it’s an absolute must-buy at launch, and stands as one of Digital Eclipse’s best retro compilations yet.</p>
<p>If, however, you’re keen to play these games online, then I’d recommend holding off for a little while. It’s a mess.</p>
<p>For starters, the only option available for online play at launch is ‘Quick Play’, which matches you with a random opponent once you’ve selected your chosen title. So there are no options for public or private lobbies yet, and this instantly makes Legacy Kollection unviable for tournaments, which, in the fighting game community, is kind of a death knell.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they <em>are</em> coming, and should be available within just a handful of weeks after launch, but this is nevertheless a disappointment for those keen to get stuck in at launch. What likely isn't coming, however, is crossplay, which is a bit of a sting in 2025. Digital Eclipse has cited the complexity around introducing such a feature and ensuring same-system matchmaking is working well.</p>
<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160030/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Quick Play isn’t even close to ideal. I wanted to wait until after the game launched properly to deliver my verdict on how this mode fares, and unfortunately I've spent most of my time waiting for the game to actually find a match. Once it does, there are glaring issues with input delay and audio on most titles. The audio in particular is dreadful, with <a href="https://x.com/LongJohnCenaFGC/status/1983894757957828847">garbled and stuttering music and sound effects</a>. The severity of this ranges from mildly irritating to downright unplayable. And yes, my connection was absolutely strong and stable throughout.</p>
<p>I’m fairly confident that, over time, these issues will be ironed out. With the eventual introduction of lobbies, online play for Legacy Kollection might well ultimately stand proud next to the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive-</a> on Switch 2, but for now, it’s simply not up to scratch.</p>
<p>If you’re getting this at launch, I’d recommend really taking your time with the documentary timeline; soak it in, because it’s an absolute delight. Hopefully, when you’re done, it might be ready for online play.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With a total of 23 playable games alongside a comprehensive interactive documentary providing detail behind the series' development, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection is yet another triumph for Digital Eclipse from the historical compilation perspective. It's full of nostalgia for fans who ripped spines out of their opponents back in the '90s, and the perfect way for complete newcomers to see what all the fuss is about.</p>
<p>If, however, you're keen to play these games online, then you're best off waiting. Essential features are absent at launch, and even if you do manage to find a game through Quick Play, chances are it'll be plagued with input delay and audio issues.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Later today, children will descend upon neighborhoods the world over in search of reasons for their parents to quietly ask them to brush their teeth a minute longer. The children will politely ignore the request.</em></p><p><em>It is also, god bless, happening on a Friday. </em></p><p><em>Or maybe not? </em></p><p><em>Well, the Friday part is happening. But whether or not you're in an area where you need to prepare—or care—about endless parades of trick-or-treaters is entirely to chance. The demographics of the neighborhood, the weather outside. Or...whether you want to answer the door at all.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob: </strong>So I’ve been thinking about what is the spookiest way you can decorate a house while still making kids approach in the hope of candy.&nbsp;</p><p>This is more of a theoretical discussion for me: I’m at the end of a long drive and I don’t anticipate many trick-or-treaters and we’ll have to make <em>very </em>clear that The Zacny Compound is open for business if anyone is going to bother walking up the drive. Pumpkins, spotlighting on a comically large bowl of candy, maybe a big sign that says, “FREE CANDY FOR KIDS”. Though maybe that loops back around to being off-putting.</p><p>But there’s this sweet-spot where a house looks mostly uninviting but also like it might still be open for candy business. It’s the house you have to steel yourself to approach if you’re a kid walking up the driveway or footpath, where at age 9 or 10 you suspect you might get murdered but you also stand an even chance of nabbing some candy bars.</p><p>Fake cobwebs and headstones all over the lawn? OK, that’s cute, we’re in the spirit of things. Ditto that huge skeleton. Those are fun seasonal decorations that serve to advertise a house is joining in the celebration.</p><p>But nothing sticks in my head like this one house a few blocks over from my place. It stood at the end of a street on a very small ridge so you’d look up about ten feet from the street. It was a brick ranch with a breezeway-style porch between the garage and the main house. The porch was recessed underneath the eaves, and evergreens further obscured the front steps onto the porch.</p><p>The street was U-shaped. Not a cul-de-sac but two different streets terminating at the same place. So this house basically had its back to the neighborhood and only faced like one other home. And I remember one Halloween I’m walking along the street, almost home, and I look up at this place and see it has its porch-light on. But it was this single, dim, watery fluorescent bulb that mostly illuminated the front steps but plunged the porch even further into shadow. Every other light in the house is off and I’m about to just pass by when my eyes adjust a little bit and I see this outline of a person sitting on the porch.</p><p>I felt this jolt of fear but then I think, okay, there’s no decorations. No lights. They’re not taking part in trick-or-treating, and I’m kind of relieved because I don’t want to go up to that house. Except right as I’m about to walk past, I see the figure move. Its head turns toward me like an owl. A perfect, smooth, unnatural swivel. They are looking at me, I realize.</p><p>Well, now I can’t just walk past it. I am not a chicken. I’ve just turned 10 or so, I’m practically a teenager. This person will know I’m scared if I don’t go up there. I turn back toward their driveway and start up toward them, the only sound the scuff of my shoes on concrete.</p><p>“Trick or treat?” and it comes out as a quiet question. No response. I take a few more steps to the foot of their steps. “Trick or treat!” Louder now, producing a cloud of vapor between me and the figure. They don’t look quite right, but also… is that a silver bowl next to them? I catch a dim glint.</p><p>I climb the steps and brush past the evergreens and now stand at the edge of porch. “Trickertreat.” I can’t see with this fucking porchlight in the corner of my vision. I take a step forward.</p><p>Turns out it’s just a stuffed scarecrow slumped in a lawn chair next to a bowl full of candy on the ground. But Patrick, I’m telling you, it was the scariest thing I had ever seen. Not the scarecrow, really. Just the entire approach. The ambiguity. The fact it felt like I was walking into a trap, approaching a space that was fundamentally hostile.</p><p>I breathe a little sigh of relief and bend over to grab candy. Fun size wrappers, invisible in the dim light, come to hand. I put them in my sack and then out of the corner of my eye I see a bit of movement.</p><p>A small puff of steam jets from the scarecrow’s head. I freeze. A century passes. There’s another puff of steam. My eyes are adjusting now. Its chest is moving. I am backing away. I feel my feet reach the top of the steps. “Thank you!” I blurt and now I’m <em>booking </em>it down the driveway, down to the street, and I’m racing for home. I am dressed like the theatrical version of Sherlock Holmes with the cloak and the deerstalker hat and I keep expecting to feel something grab the edge of that coat and haul me back to my death. I stop about a block and a half away. I look behind me. Nothing. I have never been so afraid. I have never felt more alive and I know I need to calm down or my parents are never going to let me go trick-or-treating without supervision again and even though I’m half-convinced I almost died just now, I want to do this again.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@sabinamusicrich?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Sabina Music Rich</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>There is a whole genre of TikTok videos where you watch kids bravely stepping on a “press here” button at a Spirit Halloween, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@king3brandon/video/7565284291920383287?q=spirit+halloween&amp;t=1761591340285&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>waiting for some tall monstrosity to leap into the air and scare them</u></a>.</p><p>There is such a difference between the Halloween lawn decorations of years past and today. I think we’re all familiar with motion sensors, but those were a damn <em>novelty</em> back then. And most of them were indoors. Now, if you approach a house with a dozen Halloween-related lawn items, you damn well <em>expect</em> to be attacked by a jump scare en route to the candy. There’s a house down a street that spooked my five-year-old a few years back that she straight up refuses to visit again. Her sister just grabs the candy.</p><p>One of my all-time favorite memories is this one neighbor who otherwise was never seen outside. I didn’t know that lady’s story then, I don’t know it now. What I do know is that she fuckin’ loved Halloween, and would so decorate the inside of her house that she’d welcome people to walk through it. It wasn’t a haunted house, there were no jump scares. It was just tons and tons of cool lights and decorations for you to awe at while you were contemplating which piece of sugar to jam into your face in the next minute.</p><p>One day, she was too old and stopped doing it. It was such a bummer. I hope she knew how much kids appreciated what she put together, even though we were too young to convey that appreciation back then.</p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/there-is-a-need-for-yellow-paint-in-games-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-says/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yellow paint to indicate the way to players is among the controversial features of modern video games, but no matter how heated the debate gets, some developers, like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, feel there's definitely a need for it.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/oh-no-the-yellow-paint-debate-is-back-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-says-there-is-definitely-a-need-for-that-kind-of-thing-and-the-only-real-question-is-about-how-its-done/">GamesRadar+</a>, Hamaguchi-san acknowledged the debate among players while also saying that there's definitely a need for yellow paint in games in many ways. The difference, however, is in how it is implemented.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"The need to guide players around from a gameplay perspective and show them what can be done, what they need to do, there are definitely times where that is needed," </em>Hamaguchi-san explained. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So I think obviously there is more of a debate about how it's done, what level and what works. And there'll still be people who say, 'no, that doesn't fit at all. We don't like that.' That's fine, but I think there is definitely a need there, and it's something that is definitely worth looking at."</em></p>



<p>As there are all sorts of players, the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director's stance on the yellow paint discussion is entirely understandable, as it aims to make complex games with sprawling worlds more accessible to all. </p>



<p>Still, having the option to turn these indicators in some way would be welcome. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/92">While PC users can sometimes resort to mods</a>, offering similar toggles on consoles would likely satisfy the concerns of the community. <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">As the third and final entry in the Remake trilogy is expected to be even larger</a>, it will be interesting to see how Hamaguchi and his team manage the balance between guidance and player freedom.</p>

            <p>Brethren! Cease your prattling and pick up your GameCube controllers. It is time to start playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eternal-darkness">Eternal Darkness</a>: Sanity's Requiem at an unhealthy velocity, while funding lawyers to uphold the legal rights of LGBTQ+ people in the USA.</p>
<p>Today marks the beginning of Games Done Queer, a new weekend-long streaming event from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/speedrunning">speedrunning</a> organisation Games Done Quick. It's raising money for the <a href="https://lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal and Education Fund</a>, which aims "to achieve full recognition of the civil rights of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and everyone living with HIV, through impact litigation, education and public policy work."</p>
<p>The event runs from today October 31st to Monday November 3rd, and sees canny streamers undertaking creatively accelerated playthroughs of games from all across the ages - Diddy Kong Racing, Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rift-of-the-necrodancer">Rift Of The Necrodancer</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a>, Kiosk, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>, to name a few. The full schedule is <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/61">here</a>.</p>
<p>I confess, I don't watch a lot of speedruns, but I'm fascinated by the ways in which players <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queering">queer</a> the machinery and build on each other's strategies - particularly when it comes to horror games, which may punish you more severely for being hasty. I've never played Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, but going by scattered internet chatter, it's a tough candidate for a speedrun. If you're familiar with the game, <a href="https://speeddemosarchive.com/EternalDarkness.html">this speedrunner breakdown from way back in 2011</a> may interest, as may <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/913957-eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem/80052151">this GameFAQ post</a> in which somebody tries to crack the game's occluded stamina system.</p><p>There's also Steve Messner's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-tool-assisted-speedrunning-works">old feature on "tool-assisted" speedrunning from 2016</a>, in which Super Mario 64 is prised apart like a broken pocketwatch and reassembled into some kind of warp drive. Anyway, best of luck to all the Games Done Queer speedrunners this weekend.</p>

              <p>LEGO’s great, ain’t it? It’s a toy that appeals not just to children but folks of all ages. You don’t need to be a kid to enjoy a good LEGO set, just a kid at heart. It helps that there is a LEGO set for practically every fandom in the world. One of the most popular of which has got to be the many, many Marvel collaborations the brand has made. This set here that happens to be on sale depicts perhaps the most iconic set pieces from Sam Raimi’s original <em>Spider-Man&nbsp;</em>trilogy. I’m of course talking about the train scene from&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>.</p>
<p>Normally, the LEGO Marvel <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/">Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock subway train scene set goes for $55, but right now it’s on sale for 20% off</a>: That shaves off a nice $11 from the price, bringing it to just $44.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>If you were in middle school or high school in the mid 2000s, chances are you loved these films. Critical consensus (highest Rotten Tomatoes score) indicates the best of Tobey Maguire’s best of the bunch is&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em> and I’d personally credit that to it having more heart than the other.</p>
<p>The most memorable scene from the Marvel sequel (spoilers, I guess) has got to be when a maskless Spider-Man saves the subway train, slowing it down on the tracks by webbing the nearby buildings, then for the passengers to warmly agree to keep his identify secret. That’s New York, baby.</p>



<h2>Runaway LEGO Action</h2>
<p>The 393-piece LEGO set includes builds into the front train care and includes four minifigures. It comes with Doc Ock, J. Jonah Jameson, Aunt May, and Spider-Man, who comes with swappable masked and unmasked heads.</p>
<p>Use Spider-Man’s attachable web to recreate the iconic scene. Doc Ock comes with his four adjustable mechanical arms. Two of them are equipped with laser beams while the other two can attach themselves to the train, holding on. And J. Jonah and May are just there too I guess.</p>
<p>The set measures in at over 3 inches high, 9 inches long, and 2 inches wide. The roof of the train can lift off to give access to the interior.</p>
<p>Use the LEGO Builder app to help make the build even easier. View each step with a 3D digital version so you can get a better look at some of those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet. You can zoom in and rotate the model around even bookmark your progress so you can walkaway and come back later to complete your build.</p>

<p>Bloober Team’s epic Silent Hill 2 remake smashed it out of the park on PS5 and PC. The title was a console exclusive for the PS5, but a new ESRB rating has revealed that the Silent Hill 2 remake is coming to Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p>



<p>It seems the Silent Hill 2 remake was potentially on a timed exclusivity agreement. This is the feeling as the horror remake has been rated by the ESRB for the “Xbox Series.” There’s still no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-switch-2-xbox-rumor-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch port</a> in the open, but the game’s console presence is about to become wider and more terrifying.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Happy Halloween! Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Poor James Sunderland, he has to relive his own personal trauma all over again on Xbox. On the plus side, it’s a nice Halloween treat for Xbox players who’ve upgraded to modern-gen hardware.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ESRB</a> website was updated on October 31 (of all dates) to show Silent Hill 2 being certified. The key difference this time is that it’s for “Xbox Series” platforms, and the news comes nearly a year after the PS5 and PC launches.</p>



<p>From what we can tell, nothing’s changed on the rating summary front. It’s still the same Mature 17+ rating, and features the same depraved content, the same gruesome and gory gameplay, and the same “Enemies with body parts sewn together.”</p>



<p>It doesn’t clarify when Silent Hill 2’s remake is coming to Xbox. We’ll have to wait for an official announcement in the future—maybe closer to The Game Awards?</p>



<p>For now, if you’re on Xbox and you haven’t played the second game’s exquisite remake, we advise you to get the sick bags on standby and have a nice supply of light bulbs at the ready, as playing this in the dark will mentally put you in Silent Hill while you’re trying to sleep!</p>



<p>Have you played the Silent Hill 2 remake? What do Xbox players have to look forward to? Let them know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, which is getting many new members by the day.</p>

            <p>Amid Nintendo's ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a>, the company's initial efforts to patent a variety of Pokémon-style monster capture and throwing mechanics in Japan have been rejected.</p>
<p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">launched its controversial lawsuit against Palworld maker Pocketpair</a> last year following the game's<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-reaches-25m-players-in-first-month"> wildly successful launch</a>, accusing the studio of infringing  "multiple" patents. At the time, it said it was seeking an injunction and compensation for damages. In response, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">vowed to fight the legal action</a>, saying it wanted to ensure small studios could not be "hindered or discouraged from pursuing creative ideas".</p>
<p>Throughout all this, it remained unclear exactly what patents Nintendo was accusing Palworld of infringing, although evidence unearthed by legal observers suggested the lawsuit primarily<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent"> hinged on Pokémon's ball-throwing and creature catching mechanics</a>. Notably, one of the patents Nintendo appeared to be pinning its legal hopes on wasn't filed until <em>after</em> PalWorld's release - albeit appended to a pre-existing "parent" patent filed in December 2021. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exceedingly-plausible-nintendo-crafted-patent-claims-to-specifically-target-palworld-says-ip-expert">one IP expert observed</a> at the time, it was "exceedingly plausible" Nintendo had crafted the patent application to specifically target Palworld.</p>
<p>Speculation Pokémon's Pokéball mechanics lay at the heart of Nintendo's lawsuit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">appeared to be confirmed last December</a> when Pocketpair released an update to remove Palworld's Pokéball-style summoning mechanic. It later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">removed a gliding mechanic</a>, saying it had to make "yet another compromise" due to the lawsuit. Since then, Palworld lawyers have argued, among other things, that the continued existence of games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> - which all feature similar mechanics to those Nintendo wishes to patent - invalidates the company's efforts, and Pocketpair has continued to assert the "invalidity of the patents in question". And it now appears Japan's patent office agrees - in part and for now at least - with that stance.</p><p>As <a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/">reported by GamesFray</a>, the Japan Patent Office has now rejected an application (specifically application no. 2024-031879) filed by Nintendo in March last year which attempts to patent certain capture and item-throwing mechanics. According to the machine translated rejection notice, the patent will not be granted in its current form as the "claimed invention(s) could have easily been made by persons who have common knowledge in the technical field to which the claimed invention(s) pertains", given evidence the "invention(s)" already existed "in Japan or other foreign countries prior to the filing of the patent application".</p>
<p>The rejection notice then highlights documentation provided by an unnamed third-party pointing to instances of similar mechanics existing prior to the filing in games such as Monster Hunter 4, Ark: Survival Evolved, Pocketpair's own Craftopia, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>. However, as GamesFray notes, the rejection isn't final, and Nintendo may still choose to amend its application in order to sway the patent examiner. It also stresses a final rejection of the application would have no "direct impact" on the Palworld lawsuit given patent office decisions are non-binding. That doesn't necessarily leave Nintendo in the clear, however; GamesFray says Japanese judges "tend to have respect for the determinations made by patent examiners".</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo finds itself in an entirely different position in the US, where it was recently granted a patent covering gameplay mechanics relating to the summoning of a sub-character to let it fight another. Eurogamer spoke to legal experts at the time to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">find out how enforceable that patent actually is</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last year's Silent Hill 2 remake is finally coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, as this new version of the game has been rated by the ESRB ahead of its official announcement.</p>



<p>As the yet-to-be officially announced new version of the survival horror game developed by Bloober Team, which returned the series to the spotlight after years of absence, will be identical to the PC and PlayStation 5 releases, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/">the Mature 17+ rating and its summary</a> don't reveal anything that wasn't already known about the game. Still, it's great to know that more players will soon be able to play one of the best survival horror games released in recent times.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S is hardly a surprise. Earlier this month, known leaker Dusk Golem commented on the matter, saying not only that the game will be coming soon to Xbox consoles, but also that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-dlc-xbox-versions-announcement-rumored-to-be-tied-with-movies-release/">the Born of a Wish DLC campaign is getting remade, and that a new PlayStation 5 Pro patch will also be released</a> to solve some of the remaining issues the game has on the premium Sony console. All this should be announced soon, as the announcements should coincide with the marketing cycle of the Return to Silent Hill movie, which is set to hit theaters on January 23, 2026.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, the Silent Hill 2 remake is not only a great remake of a now-classic survival horror game, but a great game in its own right.
