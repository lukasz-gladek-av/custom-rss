            <p>Well, here is something I didn't see coming. Quite out of the blue, Rockstar has released an update for Red Dead Online, which boasts four new adventures.</p>
<p>The update is known as Strange Tales of the West, and those four missions are Strange Tales of The Plague, Strange Tales of Modern Science, Strange Tales of The Bayou and Strange Tales of The Wilderness. This update has really come as a surprise: back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-confirms-end-of-major-red-dead-online-support">Rockstar told fans not to expect any further major updates for Red Dead Online</a>. So, what's this we have here now, Rockstar?</p>
<p>Rockstar has also released a new trailer for Red Dead Online's Strange Tales of the West update, which as noted by <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato">SynthPotato</a>, the last time that happened was several years ago, with Blood Money. You can check out the trailer for Strange Tales of the West below. It's listed as volume one, so perhaps there is even more to come down the line.</p>

<p>Along with Rockstar itself, PlayStation also shared the latest Red Dead Online trailer. "Starting to feel like all this marketing is part of something much bigger for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>," mused social media user <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_">videotechuk_</a>, who also revealed this update comes with a new zombie 'infected' mode.</p>
<p>"It's highly unusual for both Rockstar and PlayStation to come out today to market new Red Dead Online content."</p>
<p>Some are speculating the team is now gearing up for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-next-gen-update-switch-2-port-reports-suggest">that previously rumoured next gen Red Dead Redemption 2 update alongside Switch 2 port</a>. Eurogamer has asked Rockstar for comment on the latest update, and what it all means for the future of the series.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, fans are just happy to see that Red Dead Online is not, in fact, dead, with plenty of celebratory posts popping up on the likes of reddit.</p>
<p>"Author Theodore Levin can't believe the rumours and missives he's been receiving from the four corners of the American frontier. He's working on an anthology of these unexplained and weird phenomena and he needs your help investigating the wildest claims that cross his desk," reads the blurb for Strange Tales of the West, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o327292o933k29/strange-tales-of-the-west-emerge-in-red-dead-online">as shared by Rockstar</a>.</p>
<p>"Strange Tales of the West will require steely resolve and courage in the face of the odd, twisted, and downright supernatural. Embark upon these four new Telegram Missions by picking up Mr. Levin's letter at any Post Office or from your Camp's Lockbox, then opening it via your Satchel or launching Telegram Missions from your Player Menu."</p>

		<p>Unfrozen has released a brand new gameplay trailer for the turn based title Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era, which is the official prequel to the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic games. Originally, the studio was working solely with Ubisoft to develop the game, but yesterday that changed when Unfrozen announced that publisher Hooded Horse has come on board as a publishing partner for Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. Ubisoft remains the IP holder for Heroes of Might &amp; Magic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era - Gameplay Trailer | Fantasy Turn-Based Strategy" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zlVlN7NXF00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First, let’s start with the gameplay trailer for Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. As the game is a prequel to the main series it will have story beats and events that have been referenced in other games, as well as have its own stories. In the gameplay trailer, you can see that the combat will remain turn based and take place across vibrant and varying biomes on the continent of Jadame. As the player you will have the option to choose which faction to play as, and make choices that impact the entire continent. The playable factions include Temple (Classic Humans), Necropolis (Undead and Vampires), Sylvan (The Forces of Nature and Fey Folks), Dungeon (Underground Creatures and Dark Elves), and Hive (Demonic Insectoids). Unfrozen has stated that there is another faction that is yet to be revealed.</p>
<p>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era will have a campaign that can be played solo, as well as classic, one hero, and arena modes. In classic mode, players choose their heroes, upgrade their castle and explore the map. One hero mode is a blitz mode with only one hero so when they fall it is all over. Arena mode is all about jumping straight into battle with different enemies. There will also be an in-game editor where players can create and share scenarios. The game is going to be released into Early Access first via Steam, and you can request access for playtests on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era/">Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era Steam</a> page.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Game-Key Card Street Fighter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c6c91250da4f4/game-key-card-street-fighter.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has today published the transcript of its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506.pdf">85th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders</a>, in which company president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked to comment on the Switch 2's Game-Key Card releases. Unsurprisingly, he came to the defence of the format. Equally unsurprisingly, we're still not convinced.</p>
<p>As highlighted on BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3lsxagrh4tp2j">@oatmealdome</a>, the topic arose from one shareholder's announcement to the Nintendo directors that they have concerns about the Game-Key Card format. "I've seen opinions on the internet saying that Game-Key Cards are unappealing," the investor said, "I'm concerned that if third-party titles using Game-Key Cards don't sell well, it will discourage third parties from supporting the Switch 2".</p>
<p>It's a fair comment, particularly given the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/third-party-launch-games-on-switch-2-reportedly-sold-very-low-numbers">discourse around third-party Switch 2 sales</a> in recent weeks, but Furukawa dodged the issue like a pro. "We introduced the Game-Key Card because game file sizes are larger on the Switch 2 compared to the Switch 1," the company president responded, "We have various ways to distribute games on the Switch 2, and we are working with our third-party partners to ensure their support for our platform".</p>
<p>Let's quickly break that down, shall we? The first section feels like a no-brainer, explaining the very basics of the format, but for all the beefy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fictions</a>, it turns a blind eye to the smaller titles that definitely could fit on a cart. As for the second section, it all feels very focused on the publisher side of things, doesn't it? As if to say, 'Oh, you don't want a Game-Key Card <em>or</em> an expensive cartridge? Have you considered releasing <em>digitally</em>?'</p>
<p>It has been rumoured for a good few months now that Nintendo is <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">only</a></em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">offering publishers a Game-Key Card or an expensive 64GB cart</a>. This has yet to be confirmed, and Furukawa was never going to disclose that kind of information in a meeting like this, but it might have been nice to get a little more reassurance about what "working with our third-party partners to ensure their support for our platform" actually entails. Hey, we can dream!</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether Game-Key Card releases actually have all that much effect on sales, but for the time being, prepare to see them sticking around on Switch 2 for a while.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom%E2%80%99s-pc-strategy-is-paying-off-as-steam-revenue-increases-by-over-61-while-playstation-revenue-declines.1233681/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CAPCOM's focus on the PC market seems to be paying off well, as the Japanese publisher reported a significant increase of its Steam revenue for the previous fiscal year.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-sees-61-surge-in-revenue-from-steam-playstation-revenue-decreases/">Automaton</a> today, the Japanese publisher recently confirmed that their Steam revenue for the April 2024 - March 2025 fiscal year increased by 61.1% over the previous fiscal year, roughly $366 million USD. This accounts for 31% of CAPCOM's total revenue, which includes revenue for other businesses, around 10% increase over the previous fiscal year. Looking at the digital entertainment business alone, Steam revenues account for 42.1% of revenue.</p>



<p>With CAPCOM's Steam revenues increasing, it's no surprise that PlayStation sales have become a smaller part of the publisher's revenue. In the fiscal year ending March 2025, PlayStation sales accounted for less than 10% of the company's total revenues.</p>



<p>CAPCOM's success on the PC market doesn't come as a surprise, especially as the publisher has been focusing more and more on it in the recent past. Earlier this year, Monster Hunter Wilds' PC release marked the first simultaneous multiplatform release for the series, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-was-february-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-us-more-than-half-of-its-sales-came-from-steam/">more than half of the game's total launch window sales were on Steam</a>. Other games from the publisher, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Figther 6</a>, continue to be extremely popular on PC as well, suggesting how the publisher is unlikely to change for the foreseeable future, for the joy of PC players who won't have to wait for any console-exclusivity deal to end to be able to play games from the publisher.</p>

            <p>What <em>is</em> an indie game? Is a self-published game an indie game? Is a game with a small team size an indie game? Is it an indie game if it makes you go "oooo, haven't seen that before"? I got a letter this morning that made me feel slightly wistful but with undertones of mercurial optimism. Is the concept of post, therefore, an indie game? Are you ok? You're looking a bit pixelated this morning. Are <em>you</em> an indie game?</p>

<p>Was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dave-the-diver">Dave The Diver</a> an indie game? The 2023 Geoffrey H. Video Game Awards seemed to think so when it nominated the happy management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> for its 'best independent game' category. "Fie and fuckleberries on that!" came the response. "That's funded by Nexon! They're massive! Also, Nexon's Vice President even said "it may look like an indie, but it’s not necessarily so" in <a href="https://www.gametoc.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=69776">an interview</a>. Case closed, Geoffles!"</p>
<p>The case was not closed. Much online out-loud thinking occurred. Thinkpieces fluttered from the sky like Yuletide's first crisp yellow snow. Then forty five full minutes passed and everyone forgot about it and started arguing about Ebert again.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/">4Gamer</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dave-the-diver-director-addresses-controversial-best-indie-game-nomination-from-2023-theres-nothing-indie-about-us-we-didnt-apply-for-it/">Automaton</a>), Mintrocket CEO and Dave The Diver director Jaeho Hwang addressed 2023's hottest much-ado with a firm nope.</p><p>

"We did not intend for it to have an indie game feel" Hwang says, via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dave-the-diver-director-says-theres-nothing-indie-about-hit-game">NintendoLife</a>. "It's made by Nexon, so there's nothing indie about it".

</p><p>"I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team," he continued, "or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique. For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, ‘Hey, isn’t that a Nexon game?’, but it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves."</p>
<p>Hwang went on to point out how The Game Awards' nomination system works. Namely, that it's chosen by over 100 international games media outlets (not us, afaik) - devs and publishers can't submit games themselves. These parties aren't made aware of nominated games in advance either, Automaton point out. "Independent is a broad term" host Geoff Keighley said at the time. "It can mean different things to different people". As can <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">$250k for a minute of airtime</a>, presumably.</p>
<p>Anyway, my main feeling from back then hasn't changed: Dave The Diver is a great time regardless, and using games as cudgels to police arbitrary categories does them a disservice. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dave-the-diver-gets-godzilla-dlc">It's got Godzilla in it and everything</a>. Phwoar. There's a big lizard if I ever saw one, our Godzilla.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dave-the-diver-director-finally-puts-2023s-silliest-debate-to-rest-no-its-not-an-indie]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Got a loisonce for that Starfield Mod, guvnor?</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Nexus Mods is implementing sweeping changes to the website in order to follow UK and EU laws. These changes include an age verification check for EU and UK users, which will be coming in the near future.</p>
<p>In addition, Nexus Mods will be taking steps to remove "illegal content" from the website, to protect children as demanded in the UK's Online Safety Act. A new tag system for adult content will be implemented, including pornographic, suicide, and depressions.</p>
<p>The Nexus Mods team is also overhauling the website's blocking system. Users can now "Ignore" other users, which replaced the old Block Author function. People you block won't be able to comment or otherwise interact with the media you post. Finally, any images featuring pornographic content can only be shared using the supporter tier of the website's media share feature.</p>

<p>At the end of the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319">official post announcing these changes</a>, the Nexus Mods team stated they "are not optional for us. They are part of complying with legislation, and we are committed to keeping our platform safe for everyone."</p>
<p>The previous owner - Dark0ne - hopped into the comments to support the new team in charge in light of these changes. He wrote: "We did not write these laws, we have no control over these laws. Nexus Mods is not an underground website operating on the dark web - it's a legitimate business that has to follow the laws of the countries it operates in. If we don't follow these new laws then we will get fined out of existence (the fine in the UK alone is 10 percent of worldwide revenue or £18m ($25m USD) - whichever is higher)."</p>
<p>Dark0ne continued: "Whoever owned Nexus Mods, whether it was still me or the new ownership, would have had to have dealt with it this year no matter what. Frankly, I'm relieved that it is not me who has to deal with this or be responsible for the content on the site directly because I have some big misgivings about how it is being enforced. However, if it was me, I would still have followed the letter of the law, and I'd have been doing what is written above. Because I'd have to."</p>
<p>Let's take a look at these two pieces of legislation Nexus Mods is citing as the force pushing these changes. The <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/">UK's Online Safety Act</a> essentially is an online content moderation bill forcing platforms to take steps to stop kids from seeing adult or illegal content.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">UK's Department of Science, Innovation, and Technology online safety bill explainer</a>: "The Act will give providers new duties to implement systems and processes to reduce risks their services are used for illegal activity, and to take down illegal content when it does appear."</p>
<p>The UK law places emphasis on protecting kids and the removal of CSAM (child sexual abuse material), "content that amounts to terrorism", assisting-suicide, and equally dire content.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Services_Act">EU's Digital Services Act</a> is focused largely on "illegal content", essentially demanding all large platforms take steps to remove such harmful content or risk hefty fines.</p>
<p>This sort of content was already not allowed on Nexus Mods, but the terms and services are being updated to make the guidelines absolutely clear, so mod creators can understand what's allowed under UK law.</p>
<p>Community reaction to these changes are mixed. Some are coming from a place of understanding, noting Nexus Mods can't really do much about legislation impacting large websites. Others are welcoming the changes, happy the website will be scoured from illegal content and younger audiences will be protected.</p>
<p>There are, however, plenty of people anxious about how age verification will work. A lot of the future changes coming to Nexus Mods are still vague, due in large part to the team still in the process of figuring them out. Age verification <em>is </em>coming, but in what form? Is it going to be a standard "are you 18?" check box, something which would protect Nexus Mods but all kids will just lie through, or will it request some form of evidence to prove one's age?</p>
<p>If it's the latter, how will this data be protected? It's all a messy soupy problem Nexus Mods will have to fix. It's a real optics roadbump for Nexus Mods, given this sweeping change to content moderation and age verification comes only a few weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/end-of-an-era-nexus-mods-has-been-sold-to-an-unknown-party-after-24-years">Nexus Mods changed ownership to growth-focused company Chosen</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nexus-mods-is-getting-age-verification-for-uk-and-eu-users-weeks-after-changing-owners]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Publishers Krafton have removed multiple senior staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds in a sudden shift that swaps the leadership team for a single head honcho from the studio who made sci-fi horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a>. It's not clear why. At Unknown Worlds, co-founder Charlie Cleveland, CEO Ted Gill, and technical director Max MacGuire have all been "replaced" by Steve Papoutsis, CEO at Striking Distance, the creators of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>-ish game. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Papoutsis replaces the previous leadership team—Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire—effective immediately," said Krafton in <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/">a press release</a>. "While Krafton sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors."</p>
<p>Well, that's ominous. Papoutsis, the man being installed by Krafton, was an executive producer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-3">Dead Space 3</a>. He became a higher-up on Callisto Protocol, the would-be spiritual successor to those spacey horror games, and eventually CEO of the studio, replacing Glen Schofield. I say "would-be" because the game famously ran like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-callisto-protocol-review">a stuttering jelly on an old train</a> when it came out on PC. </p>
<p>"I am thrilled to be taking on this new role within the Krafton family," said Papoutsis, "and to be working alongside the immensely talented team at Unknown Worlds. Player experience is our North Star, and the team is laser-focused on delivering the best possible game for the Subnautica community. We appreciate Ted, Charlie and Max for their past roles in having built this beloved world, and thank the fans for your devotion and patience."</p>
<p>The decision is unexpected to say the least. Subnautica 2 is due to release some time this year into early access, and the studio has been increasingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-teases-new-creatures-and-co-op-among-the-coral">showing off its subaquatic setting</a> in developer blogs and promising <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-will-have-a-bigger-map-and-a-silent-protagonist-say-devs">a bigger world of wetness</a> than in previous games. Given such proximity to launch, the choice to suddenly boot several senior members of staff, including a founder who has been at the company for 24 years, shortly before the game is set to launch, is pretty wild. </p>
<p>It's not yet clear if other developers have also been laid off, or if this is a limited shake-up resulting from a long-term problem between developer and publisher. But none of it looks reassuring. I've reached out to contacts at Unknown Worlds for comment.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If there's one thing I love doing first thing in the morning, it's launching myself into a festively atrocious trench network, where gasmasks glare from the offal like toppled gargoyles, and sea mines dangle overhead like enormous germ cells. Here be monsters. Here be dropped diary pages. Here be a tormenting combo of "handcrafted" characters and permadeath. Here be, er, minigames.</p>
<p>"A grimdark machine for martyrdom, fed by flesh and devotion," is how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-hope-voiden">In Hope Voiden</a> describes itself. In this first-person survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>, you are 12 people in succession, each laden with baggage of one kind or another, each trying to make sense of a rusty hellmouth that marries the grot of World War 1 to the grain of PS1. It's the work of German team Stilbruch Games. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The retro aesthetics might sound tedious on paper. There are a lot of PS1-style horror games. But this one grabs me both for the density and peculiarity of its setting - is that a stained glass window, deep in the catacombs? - and for the ensemble format. "Each individual has a personal mission, unique traits, and only one life," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3726180/In_Hope_Voiden/">the Steam page</a> goes on. "Every action matters. Every failure lingers. When one life ends, another takes its place. The world remembers. The horror deepens."</p>
<p>Aside from exploring the pasts and motivations of the character in hand, you will also "discover the truth of a place where war broke reality". The blurb writing is perhaps a bit over-the-top in the non-World-War sense, though I absolutely don't have the right to complain about this after penning that line about the germ cells. Hopefully the in-game lore is sparser and subtler. Let those gnashing textures speak for themselves, I say.</p>
<p>You might expect the minigames to be a refreshing distraction from all the misery, a touch of match-3 to cheer you up when you're, I don't know, picking ghost shrapnel from your thighs. Fool! The minigames are all part of the plan! They are the grimdarkest bits of all!</p>
<p>"Lighting a flare. Bandaging a wound. Forcing a door. Enemies don't wait. Your mistakes cost you time. And time costs lives," summarises the Steam page. There also appears to be combat, or at least, there is a brief glimpse in the trailer of somebody firing a gun at something ghastly, but I'm not expecting this to be any kind of shooter. That gun is probably going to fill you with undeserved confidence and get you gnawed and despoiled by mutant trench rats.</p>
<p>Parallel-wise, I guess this is the lumbering, corner-peeking lovechild of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker">Amnesia: The Bunker</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a>. It has no release date, only the ominous prediction that it is "coming soon".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-a-torrid-trench-dimension-as-12-perma-killable-lost-souls-in-this-amnesia-style-horror-shooter]]></content:encoded>

The Horus Heresy saw the Emperor finally defeat his Chaos-fueled primarch son, Horus Lupercal, and save the Imperium of Man from destruction, but at a terrible cost: the near-death Master of Mankind was interred upon the Golden Throne as a carrion Emperor sustained by the daily sacrifice of thousands of psykers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The iconic art of the God-Emperor by John Blanche, below, is seared into every Warhammer 40,000 lore fan’s mind. This is how the Emperor looks in the 41st millennium: grim, dark, and barely there at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is this actually how the Emperor looks in the setting? Era of Ruin’s final short story, The Carrion Lord of the Imperium by Aaron Dembski-Bowden, is also its most interesting. It suggests the image of the God-Emperor we see in John Blanche’s art is just that in the setting: an image.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/01/ow852ulpdo731-1751405677082.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The God-Emperor, by John Blanche. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Towards the end of The Carrion Lord of the Imperium, Diocletian Coros, a Prefect of the Legio Custodesan (the Emperor’s ultra powerful and ultra loyal bodyguard), visits the Emperor at some non-specific time seemingly centuries after the end of the Horus Heresy. It’s here things get spicy:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Through the doors, the secret doors, the one behind those renowned gateways decorated in trappings of glory,” the passage reads. “Past the graven image of the Immortal Emperor: a skull-faced warlock on a mighty throne, eternally alive on the edge of death, imposing in His majesty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Through that final door, which opens only to droplets of a tribune's blood, and whose impenetrable locks take an hour to unseal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s stop there for a second. Here, The Carrion Lord of the Imperium suggests the image fans have of the Emperor on the Golden Throne, that image informed by John Blanche's art, is the “graven image” described in the book. It is an image in real life, and an image in the Warhammer 40,000 setting. It is propaganda. And not even propaganda for humans, who we’re told haven’t been down this far inside the Palace for generations. It is propaganda for us, the audience, and all but the most special of characters within the setting.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/01/era-of-ruin-1751405846044.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Era of Ruin is packed with fun Warhammer 40,000 lore. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which begs the question: if this image isn’t of the actual Emperor, what does the Emperor actually look like? Let’s continue:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Inside the innermost sanctum, where the architecture of the walls is uncomfortably organic, strangely spinal. Diocletian approaches the Golden Throne, such as it is, and his kindred — naked but for their cloaks, loincloths, and black helms — move aside in his honour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He ascends the steps. Slowly. Not without reverence, but without the abject worship expected by the people of the Imperium. They would be horrified by its absence; but then, everything about this place would horrify them. It's why they will never be allowed to know of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At long last, Diocletian stands before his king.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He looks past the hanging wires that resemble intestines, and the clicking, ticking life-support engines, and the preservative mist sprayed in the air in nine-second intervals. He looks past the blood bags and vitae-packets linked intravenously to the thing on the throne, which is just a chair compared to the great and grand artworks: a throne without the capital T that makes it both a curse and the salvation of the species.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He looks at the revenant husk of something that was somehow once, somehow still is, a man. Something that shouldn't be alive, and arguably isn't by any mortal measure. Something tortured by its own impossible continuation — physically starved and psychically bloated on the feast of souls it's forced to devour every day of its endless and agonising existence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Or is it forced? Maybe it craves this. Maybe it hungers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s more to this final section of the book, but there’s no need to run through it. We have what we need: the Emperor described here is very different to the Emperor in the John Blanche art ("a throne without the capital T"). We hear of Adeptus Custodes wearing black helms guarding the Emperor, “hanging wires that resemble intestines,” blood bags and preservative mist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans believe this passage describes a very early piece of Warhammer 40,000 art found within the 1987 Rogue Trader rulebook (the 1st Edition of the Warhammer 40,000 core rulebook). It shows the Emperor in a different light, complete with blood bag, mist, wires that resemble intestines, and those Custodes with the black helms.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/01/rogue-trader-emperor-1751405755038.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Emperor's Palace as depicted in 1987's Rogue Trader rulebook. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s safe to say Warhammer 40,000 lore fans are loving every word of this short story. Not only does it reference two classic depictions of the Emperor — potentially even dragging them both into the canon — but it’s all very grim-dark in the way 40K should be. If this passage means what fans think it means, Era of Ruin makes a 28-year-old piece of Warhammer 40,000 art not only relevant to the setting in 2025, but part of an explosive revelation about the true nature of the Emperor himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, <a href="https://youtu.be/NCOSao1KEQo?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the legendary John Blanche has spoken of this before in interviews</a>, revealing his art was never meant to depict the "real" Emperor, rather it was meant to show an image of the Emperor pilgrims who had made their way to Terra would gaze upon as they arrived at what they thought was the God of Mankind's throne. The "real" Emperor, Blanche believes, is kept in a glass tube behind this facade, connected to all kinds of machinery. And so in turn Warhammer 40,000 fans have been hoodwinked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Library author Dan Abnett, who is behind some of the key Warhammer 40,000 lore and novels, <a href="https://youtu.be/VchkiTUisu8?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has expressed a similar idea in interviews</a>, and even called into question the existence of a throne room at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever Games Workshop’s big plan for the Emperor (some believe he is sort of waking up), what fans can safely say is Era of Ruin offers perhaps the clearest depiction yet of the true nature of the Golden Throne and the carrion Emperor within it. Even better, it brings into the setting classic pieces of early Warhammer 40,000 art, now revived and relevant as Warhammer 40,000 looks even further into the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

			<p>A new Stellar Blade patch has gone live today for the PC version of the game, introducing new content and improvements.</p>



<p>The 1.20 patch, which is around 4.9 GB big, introduces seven new arranged tracks based on existing music as a token of appreciation for all the love and support from fans. Additionally, the new patch also unlocks Hard Mode difficulty from the start, which is a very welcome change as Stellar Blade at normal difficulty isn't a particularly challenging game.</p>



<p>Besides introducing new arranged music and unlocking Hard Mode from the start, the new Stellar Blade patch brings a slew of fixes for a variety of issues, such as an issue specific to the "Where is the Fantastic Bait" quest, another related to the NIKKE minigame which made EVE's gun disappear, and a few others. The patch also improves the Expected VRAM display in the graphics options menu, and now shows both current usage and expected maximum usage. You can learn more about the 1.20 patch and what it does by reading the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3489700/view/535480083734855862?l=english">here.</a></p>



<p>Following its release last year on PlayStation 5, Stellar Blade finally made its debut on PC last month, becoming an instant success by selling over <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">1 million units </a>in three days. As of now, developer Shift Up hasn't confirmed if the game is hitting other formats in the future, but there's a very good chance it will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 at some point, as the developer is i<a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-switch-2/">nvestigating the possibility</a> of a port.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Krafton has announced a major leadership shake up for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> developer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/unknown-worlds">Unknown Worlds</a>, with co-founders Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire leaving the studio “effectively immediately”, being replaced by new CEO Steve Papoutsis, who’s coming over from Callisto Protocol team Striking Distance Studios.</p>
<p>This is a very significant change, with the Subnautica 2 early access release still aiming for later this year, and is a major cause for concern amongst the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica">Subnautica</a> community.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg">PUBG</a> publisher Krafton is keep to express that while they “sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors.” So why has this happened?</p>
<p>Through the press release, there’s an expectation that Papoutsis will being “renewed energy and momentum to delivering the long-anticipated Subnautica 2 experience to fans.” While Krafton CEO CH Kim says that “Given the anticipation around Subnautica 2, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The statement goes on to discuss Krafton’s oversight putting regular milestones and progress assessments in place for all its studios, and that “Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process.”</p>

<p>So, it doesn’t take too much reading between the lines to see that Subnautica 2’s early access release might have been in doubt for 2025. That could have been through missing milestone already or from wanting more time. Papoutsis has been put in place to ensure that a product is delivered this year.</p>
<p>Papoutsis has come across from Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance Studios. The tail end of Callisto Protocol’s development was mired in controversy over glorifying crunch culture at the studio, with employees pushed to work 6-7 day weeks. Then studio head <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/callisto-protocol-sequel-glen-schofield-interview">Glen Schofield walking back and apologising</a> for comments that seemed to glorify this approach. In an interview following his departure from SDS, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-callisto-protocol/glen-schofield-interview">Schofield then claimed that Krafton forced the game to be released three months earlier</a> than had been agreed, leading to cut content and the aforementioned crunch.</p>

			<p>Imagine how much better the world would be if we all did parkour and freerunning. Your commute would be twice as fast if you could parkour your way across town to the office, the kids would never drag their heels on a Monday morning if they knew they could hand-spring and wall-run their way to school, and you’d never get bored waiting in line at Asda if you knew you could throw out a standing back-flip every now and again.</p>
<p>Well, prepare to be amazed, my friend. Because in Rooftops &amp; Alleys, everyone can be a freerunner. In your own living room. Whilst sat on your couch. Even while playing a video game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rooftops &amp; Alleys - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gkso_Cs85xc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Rooftops &amp; Alleys gives you six varied maps to explore, with a mixture of time trial and trick rush challenges scattered around for you to test your parkour skills and rack up points. Although the maps aren’t overly large, they don’t really need to be. A diverse range of platforms, poles, walls and ramps are carefully positioned to help you maximise your trick combos. Plus, there’s a handy pigeon mode that, a bit like in Assassin’s Creed, gives you a bird’s eye view of the map to plan your tricks and to help you access hard to reach places.</p>
<p>The music to Rooftops &amp; Alleys does cartwheels around other game soundtracks. This isn’t surprising, given that the solo developer behind MLMEDIA, Michel Losch, worked in the music industry for 15 years. The trance, R&amp;B and electronica vibes partner the game’s style and energy like a precisely executed Double Kong.</p>

<p>In fact, the soundtrack manages to achieve the goal that all good soundtracks should aim for – but all too many fall short of – it makes you <em>want</em> to play the game. It gets you in the mood and keeps you playing. So, I couldn’t help but wall-flip in and try my best to parkour like a pro.</p>
<p>And try I did. I tried. And tried. And tried.</p>
<p>And occasionally actually landed a free running move.</p>

<p>Free running is about the accurate and controlled execution of movements, and Rooftops and Alleys is no different with its controls. This game isn’t for button-mashing. No matter how frustrated you get when you JUST. CAN’T. DO. IT. RIGHT! The controls are tricky and require very precise input from the player. There is a helpful tutorial, but it only covers the basics of the tricks and aerials you can perform, leaving you feeling completely unprepared for when you throw yourself off a platform and faceplant the floor.</p>
<p>The gameplay is then made harder by occasionally fritzy controls. You can actually manage to press all the right buttons in the right order, but for some unknown reason, your avatar doesn’t do the thing you’ve asked it to do. It occasionally rag-dolls even when you’re not doing anything. Oh, and you can glitch through walls. It all adds up to a teeth-clenchingly frustrating ten minutes of trying to do wall-runs, failing miserably and then resisting the urge to parkour my controller straight into my TV screen.</p>
<p>On the plus side, all these major freerunning fails lead to some hilarious wipeouts! The sound effect of my avatar clanging their head on a pole then clattering to the floor made me laugh a lot more than it should. It’s this ability to laugh at yourself – and others! – that makes the online play so joyous. Chasing each other up the walls of a church just to take it in turns to clang the church bell with your noggin will never grow old. Plus, the good-sized fan network of Rooftops and Alleys means there’s always someone to play with, even if they’re as clumsy at the controls as you are.</p>

<p>So, is it cartwheels or wipeouts for Rooftops &amp; Alleys? Fans of the straightforward freerunning elements in Assassins Creed may be left a little overwhelmed by the demands of Rooftops &amp; Alleys. But those who love the point scoring system of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater will relish the challenge offered by the game. The thrill of completing a complex aerial trick with a perfect touchdown brings a true rush to the player, but if you struggle to grasp the complex inputs required, the gameplay suddenly becomes very limited. It’s because of this that Rooftops and Alleys didn’t really stick the landing for me.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Rooftops and Alleys is close to being a flipping great parkour game. This trick-filled, point-scoring, freerunning experience has a banging soundtrack and hilarious online play, but the fussy and frustrating controls stop it from climbing to the next level.	</p></div>

<p>You're looking for your mate Vinny in a mansion, following a big party. There's lots of red lights. A forlorn roomba bashes itself hopelessly against the wall. Someone's boarded up what looks like the elevator shaft. There's a private cinema. Maybe it's Quentin Tarantino's mansion. Maybe he boarded up the elevator shaft to stop whoever he was in the private cinema with escaping while he monologued, in his cocainiest voice, about 70's exploitation films for three hours. The mysteries pile up.</p>
<p>To put a slight damper on my grand proclamations re: resurrected genres, it does look like you can explore the mansion at your leisure without being ferried from one scene to another. The FMV-ness of it all comes in via acted scenes starring Neil Newbon (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, Resi Village) and Ben Starr (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur</a>). First person exploration <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a> aren't exactly in short supply on Steam, and I'm naturally a bit sceptical over leaning on big names to elevate something otherwise plain, but without a creepy doll or lumbering followbeast in sight, I'm into what Dead Take is doing with its setting - more mystery than outright spookshow. You'll edit together video clips and solve puzzles to figure out what's happened here.</p>
<p>"The house is watching. It seems to haunt your steps. Piece together what really happened last night as you discover a side of the entertainment industry only discussed in whispers," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/">Steam Page</a>. "The cruelty. The sordid gossip. The auditions gone wrong. The shadowy figure with the power to make or break your career. There's only one way to guarantee your success: feed me something real".</p>
<p>It's from the Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU devs, Abubakar Salim's Surgent Studios. Salim himself is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqv5l6736qxo">no stranger to some of the nastier sides of working in entertainment</a>, another reason I'd bet on Dead Take being a fair bit more thoughtful than whatever Amnesia clone has popped up in my inbox for the day. It's also the first game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">being funded by Palworld devs Pocketpair</a>. This one's "coming soon", but you can play the seminal masterpiece '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227380/Dragons_Lair/">Dragon's Lair</a>' in the meantime.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-take-is-an-fmv-horror-with-midsomer-murders-ben-starr-and-casualtys-neil-newbon]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/mmorpg-bellatores-opens-korean-cbt-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mmorpg-bellatores-opens-korean-cbt-on-steam-has-switched-to-action-combat-and-ue5.1233582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, South Korean developer Nyou provided an update on its upcoming PC MMORPG, Bellatores. Sign-ups for a Closed Beta Test to be conducted via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3397040/Bellatores/">Steam</a> will open on July 8, while the actual CBT will run for five days from July 30 to August 3. In the CBT version, players will be able to choose from 2 out of 5 planned noble Houses, and the test will focus on core content such as combat, progression, and the skill system.</p>



<p>CEO Jung Hwan Kim stated:</p>



<p><em>Through this CBT, we aim to evaluate whether Bellatores delivers the gameplay experience we envision, in collaboration with the players. We plan to actively incorporate player feedback.</em></p>



<p>You might recall that we <a href="https://wccftech.com/bellatores-qa-pc-mmorpg-gets-in-depth-info-on-pvp-combat-system-game-mechanics-and-release-window/">interviewed</a> the studio CEO a while ago. Back then, the game was being made with Unreal Engine 4 and its combat system was going to use tab-targeting, like the MMOs of old (think EverQuest, World of Warcraft, and up to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic). Now, though, there have been major changes: Nyou has switched to Unreal Engine 5 and also decided to go for full-fledged action combat, with weapon switching and stamina management playing a major role in fights.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="BELLATORES: Developer Interview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BZymINh_k8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Bellatores will also innovate with its skill-based progression system. Here's what Producer Lee Gi Baek revealed in today's new developer diary:</p>



<p><em>A key feature of Bellatores is its Mastery based progression. Instead of following fixed class paths or a linear leveling system, players will accumulate Mastery in different aspects of combat, survival, or crafting based on the weapons they use and the activities they engage in. As you accumulate Mastery and reach certain milestones, you will unlock unique abilities or new combat styles. This approach to player progression will allow for players to experience different playstyles that will change based on what Masteries you acquire.</em></p>



<p><em>Crafting Mastery will also play an important role. Crafting efficiency, resource yields, and the chance to create rare items will all hinge on a player's crafting Mastery. Furthermore, equipment won't be available as farming drops, but are gained exclusively through crafting or trading with other players. Moreover, the appearance and stats of crafted items will vary depending on the creator's Mastery, making crafting not just an optional feature but a core system that ties in player progression with the community.</em></p>



<p><em>However, there will be a limit to how many Expert Masteries a single player can earn in Bellatores. It will be impossible to obtain or handle everything on your own. To get everything you need, players will naturally need to cooperate with one another. This system was designed to encourage active community interactions, a core essence of MMORPGs. As such, players will be able to develop personalized characters with unique identities based on their Masteries, which in turn will affect combat, survival, crafting, economic, and political activities. The goal of the Mastery system is to avoid forcing uniform content on all players, but instead, letting each player enjoy the roleplay they want based on their own playstyle.</em></p>



<p>The Steam page also includes the minimum and recommended system requirements for Bellatores:</p>



<p><strong>Minimum</strong>:<br>OS: Windows 10 64-bit (or newer)<br>Processor: Intel Core i5-8400, AMD Ryzen 5 4600H<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 6600<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Network: Broadband Internet connection<br>Storage: 80 GB available space<br>Additional Notes: SSD required<br></p>



<p><strong>Recommended</strong>:<br>OS: Windows 10 64-bit (or newer)<br>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700K, AMD Ryzen 5 5600x<br>Memory: 32 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070, AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Network: Broadband Internet connection<br>Storage: 80 GB available space<br>Additional Notes: SSD required</p>



<p>Bellatores will launch in 2026 in Russia. However, the CEO of Nyou confirmed to Wccftech that the game is still seeking a Western publisher. We'll let you know when that changes.</p>

			<p>This morning, game developer and publisher KRAFTON <a href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a studio leadership change for Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds, one of its subsidiaries. KRAFTON had <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">announced</a> the acquisition of Unknown Worlds in October 2021 for an undisclosed sum. There were no changes right away. Now, though, the original founders of Unknown Worlds (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire) will be replaced by Steve Papoutsis, former Visceral Games executive and co-creator of Dead Space. Interestingly, Papoutsis was previously the CEO of Striking Distance Studios, another studio owned by KRAFTON (they made The Callisto Protocol).</p>



<p>CH Kim, CEO of KRAFTON, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>There is nothing more important than the gamer experience. Given the anticipation around&nbsp;Subnautica 2, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible. We are thrilled Steve is joining us in our shared commitment at KRAFTON and Unknown Worlds to deliver&nbsp;Subnautica 2&nbsp;as a more complete and satisfying entry in the series—one that truly lives up to player expectations.</em> <em>KRAFTON puts players at the heart of every decision because they deserve the absolute best. We understand how eager our community is to dive into the underwater world of&nbsp;Subnautica 2, and we are working diligently to deliver an experience that meets those expectations—while maintaining our unwavering commitment to quality and player experience. We deeply appreciate the patience and trust of our Subnauts, and we are doing everything possible to ensure the final result is worth the wait.</em></p>



<p>Steve Papoutsis, the new CEO of Unknown Worlds, added:</p>



<p><em>I am thrilled to be taking on this new role within the KRAFTON family and to be working alongside the immensely talented team at Unknown Worlds. Player experience is our North Star, and the team is laser-focused on delivering the best possible game for the&nbsp;Subnautica&nbsp;community. We appreciate Ted, Charlie, and Max for their past roles in having built this beloved world, and thank the fans for your devotion and patience.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-launches-next-year-in-early-access-on-pc-and-xbox-will-also-be-on-game-pass/">Subnautica 2</a> is scheduled to launch later this year in early access on PC and Xbox Series S|X. It will also be available via Game Pass.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mecha Break Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mecha-break-review-in-progress.1233537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mecha Break speaks to a very specific kind of sicko: the kind of person who plays multiplayer games looking for <em>perfection</em>. Not overall – there’s no such thing as a “perfect” piece of art. But perfect moments? The perfect shot, the clutch dodge, confirming the last kill that wins you the match? They’re out there, in that things come together just the way you need them to. I’ve only gotten to play a couple hours of Mecha Break ahead of launch (which, if you’re reading this, has just happened) so I have a lot more to see, do, and unlock in this robot-themed hero shooter, but I can already say it’s a game that lets you build your own stories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the course of a two-hour preview event (playing on PC) I got to play five matches and try out five of the 15 different mechs available (with the free-to-play model Mecha Break is using several of the ones I tested will need to be unlocked once it goes live, but we had free reign for our preview). One of the things I appreciated most was how much variety there is, both in mechs and match types. Mecha Break has every kind of mech you could want: heavies like the Stego with the ability to plant itself in the ground, sit behind a shield, and launch a massive missile barrage; the Falcon, which transforms into a plane, Starscream-style, making it an ideal choice for folks who like to zoom across the expansive battlefield and rain death from above; and my personal favorite, the Alysnes: a medium-weight, more traditional mech that becomes smaller and more agile after its armor is blown off. Survive long enough in this form and you can reapply your armor, like some kind of mech-flavored Magical Girl. Everyone has different armaments to manage, and I had to tailor my playstyle to the mech I tried. Picking the right one is important, because once you’re locked in and the match starts, you’re stuck with it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This list catalogues a small amount of what’s available, and since the mode we were playing kept our six-person team from having duplicate mechs, it led to some really great fights. I had a particularly tense rivalry in one game where my Alysnes faced off against another player’s camo-enabled, melee-focused Stellaris. We clashed several times, and they were long, drawn-out duels that tested everything from our overall map awareness and positioning to when we decided to attack. We were building rivalries in real time, and it made for some memorable moments. Some I lost, others I clutched out, but the fights were all exciting.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Some I lost, others I clutched out, but the fights were all exciting.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Other matches showcased that there’s a ton of variety when it comes to modes, even if none of them is anything too far out of the box. We started in a traditional deathmatch (first to eight kills wins), but we also played King of the Hill, another mode where you have to destroy points that appear on the map, one that asked us to capture launch keys and deliver them to a launch facility, and good ol’ fashioned payload escorts. I had fun no matter what the objective was, and I appreciated that Mecha Break let me contribute no matter what I was doing. Even keeping another mech distracted while your team hits the objective (or killing them outright) can swing a game, especially because respawns take a hot second longer than they do in most comparable games. If you can take a piece off the board for a bit, that matters. For example, while piloting a Stego against another player in the same heavy-hitting mech on the opposite team, keeping him out of the fight long enough for us to secure the last objective helped decide that match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The maps themselves are a smorgasbord of interesting locations. One is a combination mountain range with a valley and a destroyed city. I could set up and snipe at other mechs from the high ground with the Stego, but to get the objectives (and stay in the fights over them) I needed to head down where I was more vulnerable. Another is at a missile launch facility where you can choose between fighting outside with limited cover, or getting up close and personal in the tight corridors of the facility itself. There’s even one set on the moon that includes both open skies and large craters and small canyons just big enough to squeeze through, ideal for dodging enemy fire or moving around out of sight. The real trick there is the pulse storms, which damage your mech unless you take cover. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each map felt distinct and forced me to approach situations in different ways depending on where I was and what mech I was piloting. A Stego’s long-ranged firepower is amazing in open space, but its slow speed makes it a liability in areas with less elbow room. The Alysnes’s versatility, on the other hand, means it’s right at home in both but never hits quite as hard as a Stego in the right conditions. You’ll probably just make use of its melee weapon less when you’re fighting across open ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, two hours isn’t nearly enough to wrap up a review of a game like this, so I have a lot left to see in Mecha Break: I want to get a feel for more of the mechs and the other modes, and see what progression feels like. But so far it’s made a good first impression. I’ve come away liking the little moments, and the stories I’ve already been a part of in a short session. Now we just have to figure out if Mecha Break has the juice to keep telling them for the long haul. If you’re jumping in to play at launch, let us know if anything cool has happened to you thus far.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>Update: It's still waiting on a dev kit</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-07-02T02:55:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Wed 2nd Jul 2025, 3:55am</time>]:</strong> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> game director Guangyun Chen recently provided an update to the website <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/marvel-rivals-nintendo-switch-2-port-still-under-consideration-at-netease-if-they-ever-actually-get-a-dev-kit-for-it/">VideoGamer</a> about a possible Switch 2 release – noting how the team is still "in the process of obtaining the development machine". Once it's acquired this, NetEase intends to "conduct a thorough evaluation" and will make a decision.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals will enter its <a href="https://youtu.be/kIhLPAWKKsg">third season 'The Abyss Awakens'</a> next week on 11th July and is available as a free download.</p>
<p>This update follows other developers claiming they're in the same situation with the Switch 2 and do not have development kits just yet.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:180920 @ 1751453815 --><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>[Sat 15th Feb, 2025 05:30 GMT]:</strong></p>
<p>The popular team-based hero title <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> has experienced an incredibly successful launch and as it continues to grow developer NetEase Games is looking at new ways to expand the experience. While it's reportedly ruled out a release on the original Switch, it seems there's a real chance of the game coming to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Speaking to IGN at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas, Marvel Rivals producer Weicong Wu mentioned how the team was "already in contact with Nintendo" and was apparently working on getting some development kits, so the decision will come down to how the game performs on the system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're already in contact with Nintendo and working on [getting] some development kits. And whenever we find that we could provide great performance for our game on Switch 2, we're open to that."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This goal to provide a "great experience" was the same reason the developer chose to not release the game on the original Switch. So again, as long as it can provide "great performance" on Switch 2, it's "open" to a release on this platform.</p>
<p>This 6v6 team-based free-to-play sees you assemble an "all-star Marvel squad" made up of characters like Spider-Man and Iron Man, and work together by combining strategies and powers. It's available now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, and includes cross-platform multiplayer.</p>
