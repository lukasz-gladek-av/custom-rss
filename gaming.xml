While developers of the games affected are working on addressing issues with new updates, simply allowing players the option to turn the whole thing off would go a long away to ameliorating the frustration in the short-term. <br></p><p>That’s because not all games enhanced for PS5 Pro actually give players the option of reverting to the base performance settings for the games. While Insomniac Games includes that option for <em>Spider-Man 2 </em>and <em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>, other PS5 Pro-enhanced games simply replaced the old options with the new PSSR-only ones. </p><p>The result has been worse performance of games that were actually supposed to look better on the PS5 Pro. While they run at improved framerates, blockbusters like <em>Star Wars Outlaws can </em>suffer from tearing, shimmering, and other weird effects. It’s still unclear if this is a problem with the machine learning tech underpinning PSSR, or simply with how outside developers adapt their games for it. </p><p>In the meantime, Ubisoft’s hotfix for <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora </em>should probably be the default for all PS5 Pro-enhanced games going forward. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s less than a week old, but it’s clear even now that the decisions NetEase makes in the coming months will determine if it stays a chaotic, unbalanced blast or if it joins the ranks of its hero shooter contemporaries as a polished, esports-ready sweatfest that only appeals to a fraction of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its huge fanbase</a></span>. I’ve spent years poring over Blizzard’s <em>Overwatch </em>patch notes, watching content creators nitpick every tiny tweak to damage output and suffering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081">the loss of some of the most interesting shooter kits</a></span> I’ve ever used because someone cried foul at abilities they believed “unfair.” I don’t know what <em>Marvel Rivals </em>will be in a year, so I recommend you play it now before the team behind it has a chance to sand down the things that make it fun.</p><figure id="" data-id="13b028d6ee5b040806b29ba366626296" data-recommend-id="image://13b028d6ee5b040806b29ba366626296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two opposing teams of Marvel heroes and villains clash over a carriage carried by two goats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two opposing teams of Marvel heroes and villains clash over a carriage carried by two goats." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="13b028d6ee5b040806b29ba366626296" data-recommend-id="image://13b028d6ee5b040806b29ba366626296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two opposing teams of Marvel heroes and villains clash over a carriage carried by two goats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve ever played <em>Overwatch</em>, you know exactly what you’re getting into. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>has three roles: the tanky Vanguard, the damage-dealing Duelist, and the supportive Strategist, all of which work together like the extremities on one body toward the common goal of standing in one place together uncontested long enough to win a game. I won’t mince words. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is so derivative of <em>Overwatch </em>that it would be embarrassing if the game wasn’t also a ton of fun to play. It has the same objective structures and more than half the members of its hero roster have a direct parallel in Blizzard’s shooter (if not several). My friends and I have been playing the game for dozens of hours and still fall back on <em>Overwatch</em>’s vernacular when describing escort objectives as “payloads” or calling Star-Lord’s Reaper-esque “Blaster Barrage” ability a “Reaper Ult” because both moves involve dual-wielding gunners swinging their guns around and firing bullets at anyone in their vicinity. To call <em>Marvel Rivals </em>derivative would be an understatement, and if the notion of one big corporation looking at another big corporation’s homework and barely trying to make it look like they didn’t copy it doesn’t sit well with you, you need not apply. If you’re willing to overlook that, however, you’re in luck, as what <em>Marvel Rivals</em> lacks in meaningful iteration, it makes up for in feeling like it hasn’t lost sight of being enjoyable to the average person.</p><p>Like their clear inspirations in <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Duelists outnumber the other roles, but nearly every hero is capable of making big plays through versatile kits. There’s an unevenness to the hero design in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> that is compelling, even if it makes the game itself indecipherable at a glance sometimes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/#:~:text=Marvel%20Rivals%20Fans%20Are%20Ready%20To%20Curbstomp%20Jeff%20The%20Land%20Shark&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/#:~:text=Marvel%20Rivals%20Fans%20Are%20Ready%20To%20Curbstomp%20Jeff%20The%20Land%20Shark">Jeff the Land Shark is an early favorite (to hate)</a></span>, as the little guy has high healing output but can also literally eat an entire enemy team with little opportunity for them to counter. Iron Fist is such a menace that the usually land-locked hero can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1865832432429129957&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1865832432429129957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pester an Iron Man flying away at full speed</a></span>. Cloak and Dagger are a duo Strategist that you can swap between on the fly, with the former specializing in sabotage, such as blinding enemies so they can’t see their targets, whereas the latter is a more supportive healer. These heroes all have such expansive kits that it’s sometimes hard to keep track of what’s happening on screen, much less even remember what every character can do. Most <em>Marvel Rivals </em>fights start with 12 people walking into a space and end with a constellation of color and damage as cheeky voice lines echo across the battlefield. Most heroes in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>feel like they were built for a PvE cooperative game with the levels of unbalanced destruction they’re capable of.</p><figure id="" data-id="93ab14713204f7bfd65d3d921723549d" data-recommend-id="image://93ab14713204f7bfd65d3d921723549d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Star-Lord using his ultimate ability to kill two enemy teammates." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Star-Lord using his ultimate ability to kill two enemy teammates." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="93ab14713204f7bfd65d3d921723549d" data-recommend-id="image://93ab14713204f7bfd65d3d921723549d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Star-Lord using his ultimate ability to kill two enemy teammates." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But in the midst of all the chaos, you’ll still find some heroes who feel more focused in their role. Star-Lord, my main, is an extremely mobile dual-pistol user whose main job is to hit and run. It feels <em>incredible</em> to zip around a battlefield of Marvel heroes as the Chris Pratt chucklefuck and then devastate the enemy team with your ultimate, freely flying around the map while your guns automatically lock on to your foes. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>knows the strength of a good pop-off, and there are so many opportunities to do so. Sometimes it can be as simple as finding a good setup, like leaving a Peni Parker bomb right at the enemy’s spawn door or putting a Doctor Strange portal right in front of them that leads to a chasm off the side of the map. But it wouldn’t be a team-based shooter if you weren’t able to come up with great plays alongside your team, and one thing that separates <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is its use of team-up abilities to incentivize specific team compositions that grant codified perks.</p><p>Team-up abilities include active and passive buffs for specific team compositions. For example, Rocket Raccoon can ride on Groot’s back, sacrificing free movement for increased damage reduction, and Groot gets a pocket healer. Having Scarlet Witch and Magneto on one team gives the latter a metallic greatsword to swing around when enemies get too close. Hulk can throw Wolverine across the battlefield so he can close distance quickly. Not every team-up ability is made equal, but it’s still an interesting spin on the hero shooter format, albeit one that incentivizes specific team compositions. In a more meta-focused competitive game, some would likely argue that this makes certain heroes and compositions inherently advantageous. But I don’t think I really care about those conversations right now, and I hope NetEase doesn’t either.</p><figure id="" data-id="beb6e37321f1ad64e2639d74a14c2989" data-recommend-id="image://beb6e37321f1ad64e2639d74a14c2989" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Marvel Rivals' hero screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Marvel Rivals' hero screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="beb6e37321f1ad64e2639d74a14c2989" data-recommend-id="image://beb6e37321f1ad64e2639d74a14c2989" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Marvel Rivals' hero screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Just days in, I’m already seeing so many people complain that such-and-such hero needs to be nerfed, or that certain abilities need to be patched out of the game. It feels like players and NetEase are both at a point where they need to decide what they want <em>Marvel Rivals </em>to be, and whether or not they want to see the game fall down the same traps as <em>Overwatch </em>has. There’s a version of events in which NetEase hangs on the every word of balance-hungry players looking for their next competitive grind and <em>Marvel Rivals </em>loses a lot of the whimsy and mayhem that it currently possesses. Right now, most characters feel powerful, and that’s because <em>Marvel Rivals </em>doesn’t feel like it’s chasing some unreachable ideal of a perfectly balanced hero shooter in which every character is competitively equal to one another. Such balance is a nice idea, but the pursuit of it has drained some other games of what made them special.</p><p>In a superhero game, you want to feel superpowered, right? <em>Marvel Rivals </em>understands that, and even if there are some notable characters that could use some tweaks (Captain America, you’re a super soldier, why do you hit like you haven’t taken the serum yet?), if it starts catering to those who already think the game is “broken” and needs to be fixed, it’ll likely lose the very qualities that are drawing so many fans toward the game. Not every game has to become the next big esports sensation, and I hope that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>doesn’t sand away all its rough edges chasing the same things other games have lost players aiming for. No, don’t give me any of this “it might work for us” nonsense. Just stay the course. Stay a silly, superpowered blast to play with friends and people will come and they will stay. Don’t start a <em>Marvel Rivals </em>esports division. Don’t give toxic players a reason to treat casual players like they’re ruining their lives by not helping set up some viral pop-off clip. Recognize why people are playing your game now instead of chasing something that never works.</p><p>I feel like I’m coming at <em>Marvel Rivals </em>hard for something that NetEase hasn’t shown much interest in doing yet. It’s just that I’ve spent years watching my friends’ interest in <em>Overwatch </em>crater, and there’s something magical about having a hero shooter that we’re all grouping up together to play for hours on end. Eventually, yes, people will move on to other things. But right now, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>has the potential to learn from its inspiration’s mistakes, rather than repeat them. For now, it’s an extremely fun One of Those. Let’s keep it that way, yeah?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first character, Naoe, is a shinobi/ninja, and she'll have a katana, a ball-and-chain weapon known as a kusarigama, and a tanto dagger that allows her to make quick strikes and double assassinations.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaUaOUUQ8JM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CaUaOUUQ8JM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The samurai Yasuke has a larger arsenal to work with, including a long katana, a naginata [a staff with a blade attached to the end], a kanabo (a spiked war club), a yumi bow, and a teppo flint rifle. Unlike Naoe, Yasuke can also switch between weapons mid-combo for some devastating attacks.</p><p>Yasuke's weapons and strength make him well-suited for head-on combat, while Naoe's speed and stealth make her ideal for more subtle assassinations or missions. Each character has their own light or heavy attacks, in addition to the ability to charge their offensive moves which the game calls posture attacks. Defense is also a key component of the combat, as certain techniques by Naoe and Yasuke can wear down an enemy's guard and leave them vulnerable to a counterstrike.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfHbUiwF958" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dfHbUiwF958" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ubisoft also listed some of the most common enemies in the game:</p><ul><li>Outlaws</li><li>Ashigaru soldiers</li><li>Ronin</li><li>Samurai</li><li>Samurai Daisho</li><li>Guardians</li></ul><p>Each of those enemies has their own strengths and weaknesses, and some are going to be easier to defeat than others.

<p>Counter-Strike is a foundational part of the still fledgling esports scene, and throughout its various iterations, it has always attracted viewers wanting to bet. With hundreds of matches taking place across the world at different events each month, there’s no shortage of competition for viewers to bet on.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-you-bet-on-counter-strike">Can You Bet on Counter-Strike?</h2>



<p>Yes, viewers can bet on professional Counter-Strike matches. The Counter-Strike betting market has been around for a long time now, meaning there are a plethora of sites to use that offer different ways of betting. At this moment, it’s one of the largest aspects of the current state of esports betting.</p>



<p>Viewers can gamble on Counter-Strike match winners, map winners, exact map scores, over and under-round totals, individual player performances, as well as other markets. Depending on the site, players can bet using real money, cryptocurrency, or CS2 skins in their Steam inventory.</p>



<p>Traditional sportsbooks that are accessible on mobile apps like PrizePicks and Underdog have started offering Counter-Strike wagers as well.</p>



<p>Before wagering on a Counter-Strike match, it’s important to learn about responsible gambling practices. There are some golden rules to consider: </p>



<ul>
<li>Never use gambling to replace your primary source of income</li>



<li>Never bet more than you are comfortable losing. Gambling, no matter how sure you are of a bet or result in mind, is still a risk at the end of the day.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you are comfortable gambling and placing bets on Counter-Strike matches, then do your research into what site you want to use. Not all sites are available in every country, so players might be limited to sites they’re legally allowed to wager on. If betting on a specific player or team, shop around different Counter-Strike betting sites to find the best odds that give out the most winnings.</p>

		<p>Have you ever played Factorio and thought, “Hmmm… this could be so much more anime and cosy”? Well, if you have, then Little Rocket Lab is here for you, coming to PC, Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Rocket Lab - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sxL-Dro4pU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Little Rocket Lab takes the production line management sim and sends that conveyor belt in a different direction. You play as Morgan, an incredibly capable engineer who intends to build a rocket ship on the outskirts of her hometown. She’ll have to do so from scratch, starting off with small contraptions and working up to create sprawling automated production lines.</p>
<p>Thankfully most of the town seems to be quite supportive of this, in part because Morgan is more than happy to help people with their problems along the way. I’m just hoping there’s some kind of narrative undercurrent about keeping the whole rocket production under wraps and secret from the federal authorities and military, who would no doubt have something to say about this project.</p>
<p>It’s not all production lines, though, as you’ll also need to mine resources yourself, explore the region’s coasts, railyards, quarries and underground, and solve the problems of each of the town’s areas – the different areas feature electrical elements, water, cranes, furnaces, will nee automated robotics and crafting to overcome, and more.</p>

<p>Little Rocket Lab is in development by Kyle Schmitz, formerly of Ubisoft Winnipeg, who’s been working on the game for the last few years and now has the backing of indie publishing label No More Robots – somewhat ironic, given all the robots in the game…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-combat-overview-for-assassins-creed-shadows-released-breaks-down-enemies-weapon-types/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just like the<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-releases-assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-gameplay-overview/"> last overview</a> Ubisoft released, it has now released a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combat overview</a> for Assassin's Creed Shadows, which goes into detail about the different types of attack and defense you'll be able to use, as well as the enemies you'll encounter, and the different weapons you'll be able to use depending on which protagonist you play as. The full details of the combat overview have been posted on the official website of the game, where you'll be able to see tiny clips of the combat in action, showcasing both player and enemy attacks.</p>
<p>There are three main attack types that you will be able to utilize, regardless of whether you play as Yasuke or Naoe. As said on the website, "Remember that choosing to fight as Naoe or Yasuke - as well as your choice of weapon can alter these building blocks." While both characters will have access to Light, Heavy, and Posture attacks, it will vary for both characters depending on the weapon you choose to use. In the videos shown, the combat bears a resemblance to that of Ghost of Tsushima, where you will be able to put your enemy in a vulnerable state under certain conditions, such as a perfect dodge.</p>
<p>In Assassin's Creed Shadows, the ways to defend yourself have expanded, allowing you to Dodge, Parry, Deflect, or Block attacks. Yasuke has a slightly different Parry mechanic to Naoe, which will enable him to counterattack the enemy if he successfully parries the enemy. Naoe's deflect mechanic requires similar timing to that of the Parry, but the deflect changes the axis of combat, meaning that the enemy's flanks are exposed, but also puts Naoe in a vulnerable position if there are other enemies nearby.</p>
<p>"In essence, our core fight mechanics are the same for Yasuke and Naoe. But as a Samurai and Shinobi, respectively, they each have their own weapon types and abilities that make them feel very different from one another," says Charles Benoit, Game Director for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>Naoe is more of an agile fighter who is quick on her feet and can assassinate enemies easily. However, when she comes up against more than one enemy, she is at a disadvantage, as she has significantly less armor and combat resources than Yasuke. In comparison, Yasuke is a strong warrior who can cut through his enemies with his combos. He will do significantly better against multiple enemies compared to Naoe.</p>
<p>The post also lists some of the attacks that you will have to be mindful of in Assassin's Creed Shadows, giving you advice on studying their attack patterns and tactics so that you can deal with combat, depending on what enemy you're up against.</p>
<p>As stated above, there are some little feature clips showcased in the post that show you some of the enemy attacks in action, as well as attacks from both Yasuke and Naoe.</p>

            <p>It seems as if every "wholesome" game is either a Stardewlike or a Animal Crossingbut. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-rocket-lab-is-a-factorio-and-stardew-valley-mashup-about-building-a-rocketship-in-a-cute-town">Little Rocket Lab</a>? Stardewlike. Piece By Piece? Animal Crossingbut. To be more specific, it's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> but your chibi fox protagonist is specifically running a shop, mending and painting objects to sell while maintaining cleanliness and the plants outside. If you can't get enough of upcycling in Trash Goblin, here's one more for you.

<p>Counter to its cosy vibes, the press release threatens an iota of challenge to your management. "If you think this'll be a walk in the park, Piece by Piece is going to outfox you," it says. "Each day you'll need to tidy up your store, attend to anyone who needs help, then throw a bunch of stuff on sale and see if you can make a tasty profit. Being a good samaritan is great and all, but this fox needs to put food on the table!"
</p>
<p>I am betting I can't end up losing my shop to debt collectors, but maybe I'm wrong.
</p>
<p>I've whizzed through the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/wholesome-direct">Wholesome Snack</a> presentation tonight and written up this and three other stories, representing the most interesting news and games present at the show in my opinion. To cast some judgement across the field: these all seem like pleasant games which could be fun to play, but they're all so derivative, all of them riffing on the same two or three core concepts. It's faintly exhausting. Obviously other genres or tones of games do the same, but this is less "wow, there are a lot of games about shooting" and more "wow, there are a lot of games about shooting realistic weapons specifically, in a modern military setting, with a sniper mission in the desert." Even the dialogue boxes seem familiar.
</p><p>In a way "Animal Crossingbut" is the generous way to describe these games, because at least it requires a "but", suggesting some innovation. I'm not sure that's the case if I compare Piece By Piece to Trash Goblin (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2407830/Trash_Goblin/">on Steam</a> in Early Access) or any of the other shop sims in recent years.
</p>
<p>I hope I'm wrong. Piece By Piece is aiming for release in early 2025 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179050/Piece_by_Piece/">on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ooh, this feels like the biggest news out of this evening's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/wholesome-direct">Wholesome Snack</a> showcase: nourishing photography adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem">Toem</a> is getting a sequel, appropriately called Toem 2. It looks to follow much of what made the first so well liked, including its pocket-sized black-and-white worlds in which you wander about, snapping photos and helping the locals.

<p>I know precious little about Toem 2 as I write this, hours in advance of the trailer's broadcast. I've got a single sentence description of the game, all the details of which I used in the opening paragraph. By the time you're reading this, however, you may be able to <a href="https://s.team/a/2900640">head to the Toem 2 Steam page</a> for more detail and screenshots.
</p>
<p>All I can tell you is that Alice B liked the original game a great deal for its straightforward pleasures. "It's just fun, isn't it? It's not groundbreaking, Toem, but it's somehow nostalgic and modern at the same time, a silly world that you can just enjoy, guilt-free," she wrote in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/toem-review">Toem review</a>. "No overwrought commentary on modern society. No hidden meaning. Occasionally some hidden socks, or ghosts you can only see when you're wearing magic sunglasses, yes. Mostly having fun and taking pictures. I was here, I played Toem. It was good."
</p>
<p>That's good enough for me. I like a spot of in-game photography and cute worlds where I can do favours for people, a la <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-short-hike">A Short Hike</a>. I really should get round to playing Toem.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can tell these were just added as each game’s release date says December 9, 2024. </p><p> Currently, Microsoft doesn’t support Steam and Game Pass account linking, so it would make sense for Microsoft to add <em>CoD </em>and its expansion to its own storefront if it wanted to add them to the PC Game Pass subscription service in the future. </p><p>Originally released in 2003, <em>Call of Duty </em>(and its expansion United Offensive) were never released on consoles. So unless Activision paid a studio to port these classic shooters to console, I doubt they end up on Game Pass for Xbox. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-2007/9nfsz9cxljsn?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-2007/9nfsz9cxljsn?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Modern Warfare</em></a></span>, released in 2007, was available on Xbox 360 and is backward compatible on Xbox One and Series X/S consoles, so perhaps it will be added to both Xbox and PC Game Pass. </p><p>Of course, it’s <em>also </em>possible that these games were just added to the PC store because Microsoft wants to bring more of its back catalog to its own platform. We’ll just have to wait and see. The Game Awards are happening later this week, perhaps an announcement will happen there? At this point, only Phil Spencer and Geof Keighley know for sure. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Winter Burrows, a "woodland survival game" from developer Pine Creek Games, is leaning extra hard into the whole "cosy" thing. It puts players into the tiny shoes of a mouse who returns home to restore their burrow - turning into a toasty retreat from the snowy cold outside. To do that, they'll need to equip for adventure, explore by day and by night, build, make friends, cook and bake, and, of course, cosy up by the fire when the snow sets in. Winter Burrow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008740/Winter_Burrow/">launches for Steam</a> next year.

Little Rocket Lab, from developer Teenage Astronauts, looks to have a little bit of everything. It's an isometric pixel art adventure with crafting, automation, and friendship-making that begins when aspiring young engineer Morgan returns to her childhood town of St. Ambrose, to help her aunt finish building the rocket her mother always dreamed of. It's coming to Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2451100/Little_Rocket_Lab/">PC</a> sometime in 2025.

And if all this talk of building virtual friendships with NPCs doesn't appeal, how about with real people? That's the hook of Loftia, a "cosy, solarpunk, farming/life/social sim MMO" from developer Cloud Games. Player can farm together, visit each other's homes and neighbourhoods, create communities and host social events, all as they work toward building a sustainable city. Loftia is heading to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2320980/Loftia/">PC</a>, Mac, and Switch, and is aiming to launch into early access "late" next year.

If you've been wondering what Toukana Interactive, the studio behind the wonderful puzzler Dorfromatik, is up to, here's your answer. Star Birds is a "cheerful asteroid base-building and resource management game" that sees players venturing out across "countless" asteroids in order to create production networks and guide their colony of spacefaring avians to new horizons. And if that's tickled your tail-feather, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719750/Star_Birds/">launching into Steam early access</a> in 2025.

What if village life sim, but train? That's the basic premise of Green Tile Digital's Locomoto. Here, you take charge of a "dream train" (whether that's a train made of literal dreams, or just a really desirable one is unclear) then renovate and decorate it in order to bring happiness to the animals that reside in the stations along its line. Fishing and farming also feature as your cross-country journey continues, with Locomoto currently set, appropriately enough, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2328650/Locomoto/">for Steam</a>.

Ducklings are cute. Protect the ducklings! That's essentially the premise of A Waddleful Life, in which players become mama duck and guide their tiny charges from hatchlings to first flight.

We've had our eyes on Julián Cordero and Sebastian Valbuena's dreamy Ecuadorian football adventure Despelote for a good long while now. This semi-autobiographical slice-of-life adventure about "childhood and the magical grip soccer held over the people of Quito, Ecuador in 2001" looks like an absolute treat, combining an  immediately arresting art style with some wonderfully laidback tunes. So first the bad news: Despelote won't make its previously announced 2024 release window. On the up side, it's now scheduled to release for Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2367820/despelote/">PC</a> in "early" 2025.

<p>
Sugardew Island island might be yet another farming sim on a list not exactly short of farming sims, but it does add a few wrinkles to the formula. For a start, you're not just running a farm, you're also managing your own farm shop - selling your lovingly prepared wares to the local population of Forest Folk and maybe even indulging in a spot of romance. The big departure from the norm, however, is Sugardew Island's "stress-free" promise. There's no in-game timer and its day/night cycle is turn-based, meaning you won't constantly feel rushed off your feet. And if that sounds intriguing, it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2711030/Sugardew_Island__Your_cozy_farm_shop/">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10011535">PlayStation</a>, and Switch.

<p>
And finally, some exiting news from developer Something We Made: its acclaimed photography puzzler Toem is getting a sequel. Details are limited, but it looks like players can expect more quirky characters and chill beats as Toem's photographer protagonist sets off on a brand-new adventure about "uncovering hidden details, helping friends along the way, and documenting the world's little wonders". The most obvious change this time, is its art; the original's stylised blend of 2D elements and simple polygons has had a bit of a glow-up, retaining its black-and-white looks while embracing far more detailed 3D. Sadly, there's no word of a release date for Toem 2 yet, but we do know it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/TOEM_2/">heading to PC</a>.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley">Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley</a> is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on 17th December, launching on the same day as a new Fuddler’s Courtship DLC.</p>
<p><iframe title="[ESRB] Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley – Fuddler’s Courtship &amp; Consoles | Coming 17th of Dec!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twB2woK3HKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley launched earlier this year, a wonderful adaptation of Tove Jansson’s enduring world and characters. Instead of following the Moomins themselves, it casts you instead as the carefree wanderer Snufkin, returning&nbsp;to Moominvalley in the spring, just as the Moomins are waking up from their winter hibernation, only to find that things have changed and that her best friend, Moomintroll, has gone missing. What was once an idyllic natural area, has been cut down in places, drained out, and transformed into more orderly parks. We can’t be having that, now, can we?</p>
<p>Whether you’re coming to the game new on PS5 and Xbox, or returning to it on Switch and PC,&nbsp;Fuddler’s Courtship will add a new pocket-sized adventure to the game, shifting the season to the autumn, and with the colour palette changing to match. This is a story of romance, as Fuddler needs some help from Snufkin and Moomintroll, diverting from their planned pre-winter camping trip with a chaotically romantic new journey.</p>

<p>Either way, this is a charming game and adaptation. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/05/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley-review/">our review</a>, Aran said, “Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley is a delightful game, which will please long time Moomin fans, and could introduce the characters to a new audience and generation. The game is wholesome, one for all ages, and addresses the issue of environmentalism in a careful and constructive way. It is definitely worth playing.”</p>

            <p>Duck Detective's first case was The Secret Salami, which paired its cosy mystery about stolen lunches with a protagonist whose divorce and destitution were played entirely straight despite his being a duck. The results were seemingly delightful, and here comes a sequel.
</p>
<p>Duck Detective: The Ghost Of Glamping will offer a further 2-3 hours of mystery-solving and is aiming for release in 2025.

<p>"This campsite might have ghosts, but the real thing haunting Eugene McQuacklin is his failed marriage and bread addiction," the press release says. A game like Duck Detective risks having only one joke ("What if a duck... was a detective?") but I confess I do not care because in this instance I like the joke. 
</p><p>McQuacklin is joined by a partner this time, but otherwise the facts of the case seem the same as his first outing: a 2-3 hour, fully-voiced mystery in which you have to find clues and fill-out madlibs-style descriptions of the crime. Alice B described it in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/15-steam-next-fest-demos-you-should-play-first-this-february">write-up of the first game's demo</a> as sort of "My First Golden Idol", and given how many people have been overwhelmed by the Golden Idol's recent sequel, maybe that's what we need right now. Developers Happy Broccoli themselves describe it as a "more humorous spin on deduction puzzlers like The Return Of The Obra Dinn."

<p>Ghost Of Glamping was announced as part of today's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/wholesome-direct">Wholesome Snack</a> stream alongside a spread of other similarly "cosy" games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can choose to receive the refund as a check in the mail or through PayPal. The total amount you get will depend on how many other people also file claims. The FTC is currently projecting the average payment to be about $114 per person, or the equivalent of about six <em>Fortnite </em>skins. </p><h2 id="h10057"><a id=""></a>Why did this happen?</h2><p>The $245 million settlement came amid a regulatory crackdown on how <em>Fortnite</em>’s in-game store works and the way it monitors data that belongs to children. When it comes to the shop that sells everything from Rollie dances to Godzilla costumes specifically, the FTC determined that Epic Games was using “dark patterns to trick players into making unwanted purchases.” </p><p>This included making it too easy to accidentally purchase skins while previewing them and making it too hard to find the refund button while the purchases were still eligible for reversal. The FTC also claimed that some players who did successfully get refunds would then get banned for presumed fraudulent behavior. </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-parents-can-get-started-in-fortnite-1851688072&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-parents-can-get-started-in-fortnite-1851688072">Seven Years Later, <em>Fortnite</em> Is A Better Game Than It’s Ever Been</a></span></p><p>On top of the settlement, the FTC also required Epic to stop “charging consumers through the use of dark patterns or from otherwise charging consumers without obtaining their affirmative consent,” as well as “blocking consumers from accessing their accounts for disputing unauthorized charges.”</p><p>The FTC announced this week that it expects the next round of settlement refunds to go out to impacted players sometime in 2025 after it’s been able to verify all of the current claims.
