<p>Phew! That’s a lot of screenshots, right?</p>
<p>A few days ago,&nbsp;Rockstar announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but the game won’t be coming out in 2025. Instead GTA 6 will launch on 26th May 2026.</p>
<p>This is both good and bad news for the rest of the games industry. Many companies were looking at late 2025 with trepidation, given that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two had constantly been stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>, so even big budget games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">the next Battlefield were being tentatively given a movable release window</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that might have given developers the sense that they could easily slip back to 2026 if they needed the time, and there will suddenly be pressure to try and push for a 2025 release instead. Thankfully, with GTA 6 not coming until May 2025, there’s still a good window from late February through to early April 2026 that could still look like a good launch window for a game.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/bugnie-attempt-at-dismissing-copyright-lawsuit-denied-by-court-due-bungies-inability-to-provide-vaulted-destiny-2-content-as-evidence/">Bungie</a> hosted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh78HmxSq8c">showcase</a> for Destiny 2's next expansion, Edge of Fate, which will launch July 15, 2025. The showcase focused mostly on Edge of Fate, but also announced that the next major expansion to the game, the Star Wars-inspired Renegades, will arrive sometime in December 2025, and that there will be another two expansions coming in 2026, called Shattered Cycle and The Alchemist.</p>
<p>The showcase featured global communications lead Dyland Gafner, assistant game director Robbie Stevens, narrative director Alison Lurhs, art director Dave Samuel and Ben Wommack, the core creative director on the day-to-day experience of Destiny.</p>
<p>There was a lot discussed over the course of the panel, with some major changes coming to Destiny 2 with the Edge of Fate. A key one that players will appreciate, is that Bungie will no longer charge for seasonal content, meaning that when you buy the latest expansion for Destiny 2, you won't have to fork out more when the season kicks off in order to get every bit of narrative content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Cinematic Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buh6WERf-zY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Edge of Fate will kick off what Bungie calls <strong>The Fate Saga</strong>, which will unfold over "<em>several years</em>" according to Bungie, with new and old characters at the core of the story like fan-favorite Ikora. It'll center around a group called The Nine, described as celestial bodies that have been around longer than the Traveller, and represented in each of the planets (minus Pluto) and the Sun. Edge of Fate will take players to the edge of the Sol galaxy, to a planetoid called Kepler, where players will find new dark matter abilities to take advantage of.</p>
<p>Bungie is also introducing what it calls a Metroidvania style of play with abilities like Matterspark, which allows you to transform into a rolling ball of electricity and resembles the ball that Samus herself rolls into when she's cutting through tight spaces.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Official Gameplay Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qlylquFX6EE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We also got to see some environmental puzzle gameplay that'll take advantage of Matterspark and Mattermorph, an ability that lets you manipulate the environment around you.</p>
<p>As a narrative prologue to the Edge of Fate in July, three dungeons called Explorer, Eternity and Ultimatum have been made available today, for free, for all Destiny 2 players to check out and get their first glimpse at the larger story that'll kick off in Edge of Fate.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: Heresy | Rite of the Nine Trailer [UK]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2iy15Z5cRg4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's clear from the showcase that Bungie is doing what it can to continue evolving Destiny 2, specifically regarding its reputation of being too obtuse and difficult to get into if you haven't already been playing for 1,000 hours. "<em>Play your way</em>" and "<em>player agency</em>" were phrases that came up consistently throughout the showcase, and are the driving force behind changes like removing paywalls to seasonal content, gear changes, and the permanent addition of a Shooting Range.</p>
<p>The Shooting Range is a new addition to the Tower, and as the name suggests, it'll be a place where players can test out their new weapons and abilities, with damage trackers and everything you might want to really test out your new loot.</p>
<p>Ending the presentation was our first look at the December 2025 expansion, Renegades, which Bungie confirmed is directly inspired by Star Wars, and will feature lightsabers. It was described as taking the space western vibe of Star Wars and putting it through a Destiny lens, which, at least by the look of the teaser trailer, feels like an apt description.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Destiny 2: Renegades | Teaser Trailer [UK]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6ZeDwkTsKo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pre-orders for the Edge of Fate expansion are available now for players who are keen to jump into what admittedly does look like a new beginning for Destiny, now that the Light and Dark Saga has come to an end.</p>

      </p></div><div><p>The <em><a title="Games > Destiny 2 [46 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>: The Edge of <a title="Series > Fate [66 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a></em> expansion will launch on July 15, <a title="Companies > Bungie [226 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/bungie">Bungie</a> announced. Additionally, the latest <em>Destiny 2</em> update, “Rite of the Nine,” is available today. A second expansion, inspired by <em>Star Wars</em> and titled <em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em>, will launch in December. <span id="more-963278"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Release Schedule</strong></p><table><tbody></tbody><thead><!-- AD: content -->
        <tr><th>Release</th><th>Release Date</th><th>Availability</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Rite of the Nine</td><td>May 6, 2025</td><td>Available to all</td></tr><tr><td><em>Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate</em>&nbsp;(expansion)</td><td>July 15, 2025</td><td>Paid</td></tr><tr><td>Core Game updates</td><td>July 15, 2025</td><td>Available to all</td></tr><tr><td>Ash &amp; Iron (major update)</td><td>September 9, 2025</td><td>Available to all</td></tr><tr><td><em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em>&nbsp;(expansion)</td><td>December 2, 2025</td><td>Paid</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow &amp; Order (major update)</td><td>March 3, 2026</td><td>Available to all</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong><em>Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate</em></strong></p><p>When <em>The Edge of Fate</em> releases on July 15, players will be reintroduced to the Nine, powerful and mysterious beings who existed long before the Traveler, and face a new threat that predates everything Guardians know about Sol. Two major characters will step into the spotlight: Lodi, a new ally from a distant place, and the legendary Warlock Vanguard Ikora. <em>The Edge of Fate</em> will propel Guardians into a multiyear saga that will unfold across multiple expansions.</p><p>The expansion will take place on Kepler, a new destination inspired by the puzzle-solving and pathfinding challenges of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s dungeons and destination design, which encourages deep exploration, mystery, and player-driven discovery.

A "Very Low" option for the game's various display settings have been added to help "improve performance" on some devices, and Bethesda has additionally added support for 32:9 and 32:10 resolutions, as well as more 16:9, 16:10, and 21: 9 resolution options.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the rest of the update, it's largely small quality-of-life tweaks or bug fixes.

		<p>Bungie have just dropped a bombshell as, following the recent Star Wars cosmetic DLC, the upcoming Renegades expansion is going to be based – somehow – on Star Wars, Check out the teaser trailer!</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: Renegades | Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/brUCTPKn6KM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Bungie logo is now animated in the same way as the Star Wars logo, there are familiar sights and sounds and if that wasn’t enough to confirm the Star Wars theme, it’s got a Lucasfilm copyright at the end. Quite how they are going to merge the to universes is unclear but this is going to be a lot more than just cosmetic DLC.</p>
<p>A full reveal of Renegades will happen on September 29th 2025, with the expansion launching in December.</p>

		<p>Update 25.03-11.20.00 has been released for PlayStation 5 consoles and along with the usual “improved system software performance and stability” there’s also something nice, namely the return of the 20th anniversary themes.</p>
<p>Here’s the full details on the update:</p>
<h3>Version:&nbsp;25.03-11.20.00</h3>
<ul>
<li>We’ve added audio focus, a feature that supports broader accessibility and allows players to hear quiet in-game sounds and voice chat more clearly.
<ul>
<li>When audio focus is turned on, specific frequencies of quieter sounds are amplified, making car engines, footsteps, in-game character voices, and voice chat clearer. Multiple presets are available to enhance specific frequency ranges.</li>
<li>To use audio focus, go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Sound&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Volume&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Audio Focus</strong>&nbsp;and turn on&nbsp;<strong>Use Audio Focus</strong>.</li>
<li>This feature is only available when using headphones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now select a design inspired by your favourite PlayStation console generation and apply it to your home screen and other areas.
<ul>
<li>To apply a design, go to the home screen and select&nbsp;<strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>System&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Appearance&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Appearance and Sound</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We’ve improved system software performance and stability.</li>

            <p>
I'm a bit of a sucker for weird genre combos. With the amount of games getting released every single day that often combine the same kinds of genres, you start to get hungry for mashups that make you go, "hang on, would that even work?" So when I saw Drop Duchy release yesterday, which mixes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tetris">Tetris</a>, land-grabbing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>, deckbuilding and roguelite gameplay, I asked that exact question. Turns out the answer is yes!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Here's the lowdown on how Drop Duchy works: like in Tetris and other falling block puzzle games, you have an area where different shaped pieces fall into. You've got your usual shapes, the long one, the L one, the Z one, everyone's played Tetris, you get it. Except each shape represents a piece of land, similar to what you get in something like Civilization. Here you build paths, building upon those with cards from a deck, to slowly build up an area of control that you then have to send troops to battle on against NPCs.

<p>
Just combining the strategy, deckbuilding, and roguelite elements doesn't feel all that novel, but there's something about the Tetris nature to it that feels quite whimsical and improvisational. You've really got to think about how you're building up that space in quite a unique way. I'm not even a big strategy game player, I just love Tetris and clever ideas.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, there's apparently "over 100 unique missions" to make your way through, with three playable factions to choose from. They all come with their own unique quests and rewards too. Just all very neat! And it's got a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525310/Drop_Duchy/">10% discount on Steam</a> for the next week or so, best hop on that now.

Bungie isn’t saying just yet. The announcement came as a “one more thing” tease at the end of its Year Of Prophecy showcase focused on what the future of its sci-fi MMO shooter looks like, and there’s no information yet on just how closely it will bleed into the actual <em>Star Wars</em> universe, though the team isn’t being shy about the inspiration.<br></p><p>A full reveal will come in September, but for now here’s the initial teaser trailer:</p><p>Bungie said the expansion, which launches before the end of 2025 pending any delays, will take players to a lawless frontier within the <em>Destiny</em> solar system that channels the sci-fi Western style of the<em> Star Wars</em> universe. Presumably there won’t be any actual fictional cross-over, even if Bungie has been known to do plenty of branded collaborations and multiverse references in the past. </p><p>Players already went hands on with their first taste of <em>Star Wars</em> in the world of <em>Destiny</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-skins-stormtrooper-empire-price-ps5-1851749688?_gl=1*cve0vj*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY1NDU2ODEkbzc2JGcxJHQxNzQ2NTQ4ODgyJGo0OSRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-skins-stormtrooper-empire-price-ps5-1851749688?_gl=1*cve0vj*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY1NDU2ODEkbzc2JGcxJHQxNzQ2NTQ4ODgyJGo0OSRsMCRoMA..">a few months back</a></span> when Stormtrooper costumes and other <em>Star Wars</em>-themed cosmetics were put up for sale in the game. Despite their lore-crushing vibes, live-service games have embraced more and more crossovers in recent years, presumably because despite their grumbling, that’s the stuff players are actually willing to spend money on. </p><p>It’ll be interesting to see how an entire expansion like <em>Renegades</em> walks that tightrope. Maybe it’ll remain a strictly <em>Destiny</em> expansion in <em>Star Wars</em> cosplay, or maybe it’s a chance for Bungie to try something completely different now that a decade of storytelling around its Light and Darkness saga is finally wrapped up following last year’s<em> Final Shape</em> climax. <em>Destiny 2</em>'s next expansion, <em>The Edge of Fate</em>, will arrive on July 15 and will likely give players plenty to do in the wait for <em>Renegades</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyclades-legendary-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">While the myths of ancient Greece bubble through the substrate of many board games – take <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horrified-greek-monsters-board-game-review"><u>Horrified: Greek Monsters</u></a>, for example – there are surprisingly few that place them front and center. Narrow the frame to the way many people think about the age, one of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games"><u>conquest, bloodshed and warfare</u></a>, and there are even fewer. Which might partly explain the success of 2009s Cyclades, a clever marriage of myth, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">wargame</a> and more subtle strategic mechanisms. Now it’s back in a spanking new edition with some fun tweaks from its original expansions.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box?">What's in the Box</h2></p><div catalogid="61832a28-9027-4b8e-8ae8-991e3325cb30" id="219281"><div id="219281" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cyclades</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aficionados of the original Cyclades might recall its big, oblong box, but this new Legendary Edition comes in a standard-sized square package that’s crammed with goodies. There’s no longer a central map board, which has been replaced by board modules that you can rearrange to make different maps of different sizes, depending on the player count. You can even flip them over for a more advanced map variant. The large board to track gods, monsters and heroes still remains. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are punch-out cardboard strips to represent the gods, while the heroes and monsters get a deck of cards each, plus cardboard standees for those that move around the map. Other punch-out tokens include various buildings and upgrades for the map, plus a horde of cardboard coins. Most of this gets tucked away neatly in a treasure-chest like box insert with a flip-up lid, a smart extra design feature to help you organize and pack away the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player gets a screen, a pile of cardboard control tokens, and a mix of wooden army and navy pieces all in their chosen color. There are six to choose from, rather than the original five, plus a seventh set of gray pieces that represent mercenaries, another new inclusion in this edition. These are nicely cut, but nothing to write home about. If you want to make your game pop even more on the table, there are plastic miniature upgrades available separately for the troops and the monsters, plus metal coins to chink satisfyingly in your hand.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays </h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cyclades-4-1746542932748.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Cyclades was an early example of a design trying to weave together the chaotic combat that characterized American gaming with the more refined sensibilities found in Germany. You start each round with that more genteel aspect, bidding in an auction for the favor of one of the available gods, which will determine your available actions for the rest of the turn. Some gods are face down, so that there are only as many available as the number of players, meaning someone has to take the weakest – and cheapest – god, Apollo. Each round one of the face-down gods and one of the face-up gods gets flipped, so all of them get cycled through.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not all the gods are created equal. The war god, Ares, allows you to recruit or move troops, for example, while wise Athena allows you to build universities and recruit philosophers, neither of which have any immediate effect but can, in time, contribute toward victory. To up the ante, the higher bid slots begin to jump in increments of two, then five, while players will still need to consider holding resources to pay for their actions, most of which also cost money. Finally there’s Apollo who, while free, does very little, allowing you merely to up the income from two of your provinces.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cyclades-2-1746542932748.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this means competition in the bidding can be intense, depending on the board situation, with winning or losing a particular god having a huge impact on the game state. It’s a fraught, exciting auction when there’s a lot riding on a turn, with various other considerations feeding into the bids. Sometimes it’s worth trying to outbid an opponent just to keep yourself safe from a land or sea attack. Sometimes it’s worth leaving yourself short-changed in terms of paying for actions just to corner a particular deity. It’s a dynamic phase, with plenty of interaction.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Winning or losing a particular god has a huge impact on the game state.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Winning requires you to control three metropolis pieces. You can gain these by swapping four different basic buildings, each of which is granted by a different god, or by cashing in four of Athena’s philosophers. One of the other gods, Hera, allows you to recruit heroes, powerful on-board pieces with special powers that can also be sacrificed for a metropolis. Mighty Ajax, for instance, counts as two armies and can be exchanged for a metropolis if you control seven land spaces. Which brings us neatly onto the last way to gain one: take it off another player via military conquest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warfare in Cyclades is short and brutal. In a contested land or sea space you tot up the units on each side together with the value of a dice roll with the loser removing a piece. Repeat until only one side remains. While the dice only goes up to three, this can still be a surprisingly swingy affair. Resources, however, keep a cap on the violence. Each player only has eight army and navy pieces and, of course, winning the bid for Ares is the main way to gain and move troops, all of which limits how many campaigns you can conduct.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cyclades-3-1746542932748.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In this edition, however, there are sneaky ways round these restrictions. Hera not only allows you to gain heroes but also mercenary troops, meaning you can expand on your paltry tally of eight. And all the gods allow you to make heroic moves, which essentially means you can move and fight with any army that includes a hero. This gives the game a surprising amount of maneuverability, clashing not only over valuable buildings but spaces that provide income, and makes heroes particularly valuable pieces to risk in a fight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also means turns that feature Hera or Ares can feel heavily weighted in terms of tilting the game state. And if everyone wants a piece of the action, that can very much be the case. Cyclades, however, is a game about taking the rough with the smooth. You can prosper without violence by taking cheaper bids on weaker gods and building up your infrastructure. But everyone around the table has to be okay with a game where your attempt to play economically can potentially be undermined by a burst of conflict. It’s all about knowing when to change tack, balancing the time to strike out with the time to shepherd resources, but having war and peace so close to one another in the same package can sometimes feel jarring.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Warfare in Cyclades is short and brutal.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Either approach can really benefit from mythological creatures, which you can purchase with any god other than Apollo, but more peaceable players are more likely to be able to afford them. They’re pretty powerful and so work as an effective balance against big bids on warlike gods. Most are one-shot effects, like the Satyr who lets you steal a philosopher from another player, or the Harpy, who destroys an army. Others, however, get a piece on the board which you can keep and move from turn to turn if you’re willing to sacrifice priestesses, gained by winning the auction for Zeus. These include horrors like the kraken, who simply wipes out all fleets in whatever space it enters. Pushing these beasts around the map is enormous fun, so long as you can afford the priestesses to do so.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cyclades-6-1746542932748.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAbZeo?object_uuid=f8d258c7-2fd1-487b-965f-8b85510654fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DXQF894V" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgbn8?object_uuid=f8d258c7-2fd1-487b-965f-8b85510654fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Atomic Empire</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Oy8G?object_uuid=f8d258c7-2fd1-487b-965f-8b85510654fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Hachette</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QObKNn?object_uuid=f8d258c7-2fd1-487b-965f-8b85510654fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Kickstarter</a></li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 6, 2025 4:10 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Cyclades is a rare game that succeeds in making both a peace and war viable approaches to victory. Indeed, to really prosper you’ll likely have to do both and learn when one is more appropriate for the other. This is, in turn, also its greatest fault. Wargamers may feel frustrated by its economic elements, while less aggressive gamers may find its bloodshed and trash talk unfair and unbalanced. But for those willing to stand astride both camps, this is a rare pleasure, built to cater for broader sensibilities, and this new edition is a step up in terms of both presentation and content.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The presentation revealed some new details about what's coming to Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, including two new character classes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two classes are, as <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/17375-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-will-add-2-new-classes-among-others" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">translated by RPG Site</a>, the "Knight of Ides" and "Heavy Armored Knight." Not many details seem to have been revealed outside a name and a look. Those two sets will reportedly be two of the four new armors in the Tarnished Edition, with the other two available to obtain in-game. More new weapons and skills were also teased.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who care for their steed Torrent, the spirit horse is also getting three new appearances. While this content will be part of Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, which also contains the Shadow of the Erdtree content, FromSoftware has also said this content will come to other platforms via the Tarnished Pack DLC. Per RPG Site, FromSoftware said this DLC pack would be available at a low price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some new classes are an interesting addition, though it makes sense as players will largely be starting new files on Switch 2 and might want to shake things up. Getting a little bit of new content right away might be appealing to those who have already played quite a bit of Elden Ring on other platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring has reached a significant number of people, as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-tops-30-million-sales-worldwide-news-in-brief" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring has officially cleared 30 million sales worldwide</a>. It's an absolutely titanic achievement, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that number climb higher as it hits the Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No release date has been set yet for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition on the Switch 2, or for when the Tarnished Pack DLC will arrive, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nintendo-switc-2">other than sometime in 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last July, SAG-AFTRA authorized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">a voice actors strike</a> against the major video game publishers, largely over the issue of AI protections. Nearly 300 days later, that's still the final point of contention between both sides. Now, the publishers have released what they characterize as the "best and last" offer for actors. And the actors have fired back with their counteroffer, all in the court of public opinion.</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/video-game-actors-strike-saga-aftra-final-offer-1236387081/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the latest contract proposals between the studios and the actors have found common ground on most of the terms for a new deal. That includes 24% wage increases over the life of the contract. But the two sides' lack of agreement over generative AI continues to prolong the strike.</p><p>Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the video game publishers, told Variety that, "We are hopeful the union will not choose to walk away when we are so close to a deal."</p><p>In response, SAG-AFTRA noted that the video game publishers presented their latest offer on April 30, and the actors responded with a counter-proposal on May 2. According to the actors, the publishers didn't respond to that before making the negotiation terms public. SAG-AFTRA subsequently released its proposal online as well.</p><p>"SAG-AFTRA condemns the video game companies' attempt to sow confusion in the community by releasing misleading rhetoric about our ongoing negotiations," said the union through a spokesperson. "The statement suggesting that the union would 'walk away' from negotiations on this contract is absurd and the opposite of the truth. It is the employers who have threatened--through backchannel representatives--to move work to foreign countries and recast performers, in an unsuccessful effort to intimidate our negotiating committee and membership to capitulate to their demands."</p><p>Voice actors from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-resident-evil-actors-discuss-ongoing-strike-and-the-issue-of-ai/1100-6529949/" data-ref-id="1100-6529949">Spider-Man, Resident Evil</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">Mass Effect</a> have previously spoken out about why the performers need protections from AI that could potentially recreate their voices without compensating the performers. Until that issue is resolved, it appears the strike will continue.</p>

Whereas the first trailer from December 2023 used Tom Petty's "Love Is A Long Road," this one features the song "Hot Together" by The Pointer Sisters. The song was written by Sharon Robinson and originally released in 1986.</p><p>Similarly to how the lyrics to "Love Is A Long Road" seemingly bore a connection to the story of GTA 6, that may also be the case for "Hot Together." The song is about a couple and their intense, passionate physical and emotional love. The tune tells the story of lovers who could be "hot together."</p><p>"We both know that it could feel good, so good / You led me through the crowded room / And out into the night / You kissed me like you did before / In the quiet of the moonlight," is one of the verses from the song.</p><p>The GTA 6 trailer, meanwhile, shows main characters Jason and Lucia reconnecting after Lucia's stint in prison. There are some steamy scenes in the trailer, too, and it's clear the two are lovers with a complicated connection given their penchant for crime.</p><p>Many have already remarked that GTA 6's story appears to be similar in nature to the story of Bonnie and Clyde, two American outlaws and lovers known for robbing banks and killing people together.</p><p>"Love Is A Long Road" saw a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-helps-tom-petty-song-surge-37000-on-spotify/1100-6519729/" data-ref-id="1100-6519729">huge boost to its streaming numbers</a> after it was included in GTA 6's first trailer, and it's expected that something similar could happen with "Hot Together."</p><p>GTA 6 launches on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.

		<p>The next chapter for Destiny 2 has been revealed by Bungie along with details of the upcoming year.&nbsp; A new trailer shows The Emissary, who is a friend of Drifter,&nbsp; being lectured to by The Nine and eventually transformed into a cybernetic body.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Cinematic Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buh6WERf-zY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Without writing a million pages of Lore, The Nine are extra-dimensional beings that existed before The Traveller, before Ghosts and essentially before Destiny started. They have been mainly background characters during the first chapter of the game, but it seems they are going to be the new bad guys in The Fate Saga, which is going to be running over multiple years. They are individual characters, they are not a collective, so that would give the game plenty of new end of chapter bad guys to fight.</p>
<p>A gameplay trailer for The Edge of Fate was released that shows new weapons, new expansions and new powers. It begins with an invitation to a moment in time “for a very specific” reason,&nbsp; and you will be heading to Kepler, a tiny planet in the Oort cloud on the edge of our Solar System. We are also told that parts of Earth’s past have been pulled in to Kepler, which explains the subway trains and could be the rumoured level based on Chicago.</p>

<p>The new expansion will have ‘World Tiers’ with varying difficulty levels, with puzzles and events changing depending on the level. There’s also a new ability called “Matterspark” that allows you to turn in to Sonic the Hedgehog, or at least the Destiny 2 version, which is a sparkling ball of death.&nbsp; Matterspark is powered by Dark Matter (which is what The Nine are made of) and lucky for us there’s completely made-up thingy that allows everyone to see it.</p>

<p>The Edge of Fate launches on July 15th, with Renegades launching in Winter, followed by Shattered Cycle and The Alchemist in 2026, but before that we have The Right of the Nine, a free prologue event that reuses some dungeons but with a new twist.</p>

The trailer tells us a lot more about the game’s leading couple, Lucia and Jason, and takes time to emphasize the atmosphere of <em>GTA VI</em>’s Florida-inspired setting, at one point showing Jason cruising down the highway listening to “Everybody Have Fun Tonight” by Wang Chung as an airplane flies overhead. And man, am I here for it. However, I see some folks on social media criticizing the trailer for not showing gameplay, suggesting that we can’t know if <em>GTA VI </em>is actually worth our interest until we see what it’s like to play it. I don’t fault anyone for feeling that way, but it’s not an argument that lands with me. For me, at this point <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>is probably more about vibes, environment, characters, story, and immersion than anything else. We know Rockstar can handle the gameplay stuff.

Similarly, the moments that have stuck with me most from all my time with <em>Vice City </em>are because of the immaculate vibes they created: one is all about the delicious tonal contrast I experienced as I dropped bombs on enemies with an RC helicopter while the sunny sounds of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/4N1iwQxiHrs?si=bo2ncSBraJPTQWpe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/4N1iwQxiHrs?si=bo2ncSBraJPTQWpe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Love</a></span>” by The Outfield played on the radio, and another is about the tranquil beauty of flying over Vice City by night to the sounds of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/DCkJ5lGPqFs?si=XLskz0nRJHK-pl28&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/DCkJ5lGPqFs?si=XLskz0nRJHK-pl28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Out of Touch</a></span>” by Hall &amp; Oates. I could go on but you get the idea.</p><figure id="" data-id="338da74a7d804e3859b8d38b7ee6070f" data-recommend-id="image://338da74a7d804e3859b8d38b7ee6070f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man and a woman sit on a dock at sunset in an image from GTA VI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man and a woman sit on a dock at sunset in an image from GTA VI." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Just give me the vibes.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstar Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="338da74a7d804e3859b8d38b7ee6070f" data-recommend-id="image://338da74a7d804e3859b8d38b7ee6070f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man and a woman sit on a dock at sunset in an image from GTA VI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And when I think about <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, the big question in my mind is not “How will its gameplay move the series forward?” Of course I’d love to see that there are some cool new aspects to the gameplay, and I suspect that at some point before the game releases, we’ll get one of those trailers that have become all the rage in recent years, like the one below for <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, in which a woman calmly narrates the various gameplay features of <em>GTA VI </em>as if she’s trying to sell us on a fancy new refrigerator.</p><p>But no, what I wonder most is: What will the vibes be like? What will the characters be like? Will I enjoy driving to the beach just to watch the sunset? Will I encounter unexpected moments of beauty in its violent world? Really, <em>GTA VI </em>could play pretty much identically to <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and as long as it offered a world and a story that I found more compelling than the ones that  game gave me, I’d still be thrilled.</p><p>And because these are the things that matter most to me, I found today’s new trailer thrilling. Yes, I want to see Jason just bumming around the place on the couch when Lucia comes home and collapses into his arms after a long day at work. I want to see Jason just cruising down the highway listening to the radio. Give me those lived-in moments. Those are the things that are gonna sell me on this game. If you need to see gameplay, I get it, and I don’t doubt that the trailer you’re waiting for will come eventually. But for me, when it comes to <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, the vibes <em>are </em>the gameplay. Let me have this. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What he’s watching is very interesting, but before we talk about that I want to point out the PS4-looking controllers and the PS5-looking console in their living room. Now, this won’t be an actual PlayStation, but I’ll be curious if we see the return of the in-universe Degenetron brand first seen in <em>GTA Vice City.</em></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b52dbf239ba2ec9a809ac97ab5807818" data-recommend-id="image://b52dbf239ba2ec9a809ac97ab5807818" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstar Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b52dbf239ba2ec9a809ac97ab5807818" data-recommend-id="image://b52dbf239ba2ec9a809ac97ab5807818" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Perhaps the wildest moment in this trailer, for superfans at least, is the possible return of Phil Cassidy from <em>GTA Vice City</em>. In the trailer he’s on the TV as part of a gun store commercial. </p><p>Now, this is odd because Phil is from the <em>GTA</em> 3D universe (which is all the games between <em>GTA III </em>and <em>Vice City Stories) </em>and hasn’t been a part of the HD universe—the 3D and HD timelines are separate, beyond some stuff crossovers like brands, radio stations, etc. So does this mean <em>GTA 6</em> is set in the 3D Universe? No, I don’t think so. Instead, I think Rockstar is either teasing fans, and this guy will be named Phil Willy or something different, or the studio is willing to create new versions of past characters for its HD timeline. </p><p>Either way, it is very interesting. Will Tommy from<em> Vice City </em>appear in this game? We’ll find out when<em> GTA 6 </em>launches on PS5 and Xbox in May 2026. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/nvidias-rtx-5060-arrives-on-may-19-with-a-hypothetical-299-price-tag/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Nvidia will release the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/even-more-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-games-and-updates-released/">GeForce RTX 5060</a> on May 19 starting at $299, the company announced via press release today. The new card, a successor to popular past GPUs like the GTX 1060 and RTX 3060, will bring Nvidia's DLSS 4 and Multi Frame-Generation technology to budget-to-mainstream gaming builds—at least, it <em>would</em>&nbsp;if every single GPU launched by any company at any price wasn't instantly selling out these days.</p>
<p>Nvidia announced a May release for the 5060 last month when it released the RTX 5060 Ti for $379 (8GB) and $429 (16GB). Prices for that card so far haven't been&nbsp;<em>as&nbsp;</em>inflated as they have been for the RTX 5070 on up, but the cheapest ones you can currently get are still between $50 and $100 over that MSRP. Unless Nvidia and its partners have made dramatically more RTX 5060 cards than they've made of any other model so far, expect this card to carry a similar pricing premium for a while.</p>

<p>Compared to the RTX 4060, the RTX 5060 adds a few hundred extra CUDA cores and gets a big memory bandwidth increase thanks to the move from GDDR6 to GDDR7. But its utility at higher resolutions will continue to be limited by its 8GB of RAM, which is already becoming a problem for a handful of high-end games at 1440p and 4K.</p>
<p>Regardless of its performance, the RTX 5060 will likely become a popular mainstream graphics card, just like its predecessors. Of the Steam Hardware Survey's top 10 GPUs, three are RTX xx60-series desktop GPUs (the 3060, 4060, and 2060); the laptop versions of the 4060 and 3060 are two of the others. If supply of the RTX 5060 is adequate and pricing isn't out of control, we'd expect it to shoot up these charts pretty quickly over the next few months.</p>

<p>Last month, Nintendo and its third-party partners revealed that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common/">many</a> of the "physical" games on the Switch 2 would be made available <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendos-game-key-cards-for-the-switch-2/">only as "Digital Key Cards."</a> Unlike traditional physical Switch games—which contain flash memory with the necessary data to play the game on the card itself—these key cards will simply enable the holder to download a copy of the game to their system and play that copy if and when the transferable key card is inserted in the system.</p>
<p>Already, many players are thinking ahead to what this means for their ability to play Game Key Card releases well into the future. It's not hard to find potential Switch 2 owners publicly worrying about games <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendo%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cgame-key-cards%E2%80%9D-for-the-switch-2.1506662/#post-43644552">"disappear[ing] into the void"</a> or becoming "effectively a worthless piece of plastic/e-waste" when Nintendo eventually disables its Switch 2 game download servers. Some go even farther, calling a Game Key Card <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1jtpjiy/comment/mlvyf6h/">an "eighty dollar rental"</a> rather than a real game purchase.</p>
<p>While these are valid long-term concerns, I think some players are underestimating the likely timeline for when Game Key Cards will become "useless e-waste." As it stands, we already have an example of Nintendo supporting continued downloads of games purchased nearly two decades ago and counting.</p>
<h2>The enduring Virtual Console</h2>
<p>When Nintendo launched the Wii in November 2006, it also launched the Wii Virtual Console <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2006/11/8124/">with 30 downloadable titles</a> ranging from <em>Super Mario 64</em> to <em>Urban Champion</em>. And it may surprise you to learn that Virtual Console purchases made the day the Wii launched can still be redownloaded from Nintendo's servers to this day.</p>
<p>I know it surprised me when I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/nintendo-switch-2%E2%80%99s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common.1507000/page-2#post-43684635">read about it</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wii/comments/17pxta1/can_you_still_redownload_wii_games_on_the_digital/">various forum threads</a> in recent weeks. I've been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/04/end-of-an-era-many-wii-online-services-shutting-down-in-june/">writing</a> about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/the-day-the-mario-kart-died-nintendos-killswitch-and-the-future-of-online-consoles/">the shutdown</a> of the Wii's various online services for years, not to mention <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/why-game-archivists-are-dreading-this-months-3ds-wii-u-eshop-shutdown/">the high-profile shutdown of the 3DS and Wii U eShops</a> in 2023. By now, I figured that Nintendo had pulled the final plug on whatever aging server was letting Wii Virtual Console (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/wiiware-review/">WiiWare</a>) downloads limp along.</p>

<p>True, Nintendo shut off <em>new</em> downloadable game purchases on the Wii in 2019, likely to avoid the financial and customer support hassles of providing payment services for a vanishingly small market of players still actively buying games on the Wii. But when it comes to downloading old purchases, the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Wii/Troubleshooting/Wii-Shop-Channel/Missing-previously-downloaded-games/Missing-previously-downloaded-games-241877.html?srsltid=AfmBOoo1cZU7wGwS4tffto7ToGLE0CMmwIiS2rBi6yVDVEJAN5tkr0u5">official support site</a> still says that "as long as you are using the same Wii console you used to originally download the game, you will be able to re-download it should the game be lost or deleted."</p>
<p>Sure enough, just yesterday, I was able to plug in my aging Wii U, flip over to Wii mode (which still contains <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/12/the-long-frustrating-road-to-recovering-my-wii-downloads/">my recovered and transferred Virtual Console games licenses</a>) and download fresh copies of games like <em>Actraiser</em> and <em>Bonk's Adventure</em> like it was still 2006 (the same goes for redownloading previous Wii U and 3DS game purchases on those consoles, by the way).</p>
<p>When it comes to the longevity of a downloadable purchase, Nintendo now comes close to rivaling Steam, where players can still redownload <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">the copy of <em>Half-Life 2</em> they purchased over 20 years ago</a>. And while those Wii downloads are frustratingly tied to the original hardware used to make the purchase, the Switch 2's Game Key Cards ensure any future downloads will be easily portable to different hardware units.</p>

<h2>Past performance, future results</h2>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that Nintendo has kept the game download servers for the Wii active even though it hasn't <em>sold</em> any new downloadable Wii games for roughly six years. At this point, any server hardware and bandwidth Nintendo is using to support Wii downloads is nothing but a financial loss for the company (unlike Steam, where Valve is at least <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">still selling fresh copies of <em>Half-Life 2</em></a> to new generations of PC gamers). The fact that Nintendo is still willing to provide those downloads with no direct financial upside suggests good things about its future commitment to Game Key Cards.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>You could even argue that Nintendo is <em>more</em> likely to offer longer-term support for Game Key Card downloads since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-will-play-original-switch-games/">backward compatibility seems to be a priority for the Switch hardware line</a>. If we presume that future Switch systems will remain backward compatible, we can probably also presume that Nintendo will want players on new hardware to still have access to their old Game Key Card purchases (or to be able to use Game Key Cards purchased on the secondhand market).</p>

<p>There are no guarantees in life, of course, and nothing lasts forever. Nintendo will one day go out of business, at which point it seems unlikely that a Game Key Card will be able to download much of anything. Short of that, Nintendo could suffer a financial malady that makes download servers for legacy systems seem like an indulgence, or it could come under new management that doesn't see value in supporting decades-old purchases made for ancient consoles.</p>
<p>As of this writing, though, Nintendo has kept its Wii game download servers active for 6,743 days and counting. If the Switch 2 Game Key Card servers last as long, that means those cards will still be fully functional through at least October 2043.</p>
<p>I don't know what I will be doing with my life in 2043, but it's comforting and extremely plausible to imagine that the "eighty dollar rental" I made of a Switch 2 Game Key Card back in 2025 will still work as intended.</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, I think it's highly likely that I will become "e-waste" long before any Switch 2 Game Key Cards.</p>

<p>We also got first looks at some of the new mechanics and powers coming in the expansion.

This new location will be introduced with The Edge of Fate and, unlike its real-world counterpart, will exist within the solar system, right on the edge of it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/06/rockstar-shows-off-six-major-areas-of-vice-city-in-grand-theft-auto-vi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/06/rockstar-just-unveiled-the-second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer">There's a new Grand Theft Auto VI trailer</a>, and even though <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-to-may-2026">the game was recently delayed to May of next year</a>, developer Rockstar opened the floodgates today with new information. Vice City, where the game takes place, has a personality of its own. In addition to new details about the game's story and characters, the GTA VI website has loads of information about the game's new major areas, along with plenty of new screenshots. Here's a breakdown of what we know about each of them.</p>



<p>According to Rockstar's website, the game's central metropolis has "the glamour, hustle, and greed of America captured in a single city." Notable locations include Ocean Beach, Little Cuba, the Tisha-Wocka flea market, and the VC Port.</p>



<h2>Leonida Keys</h2>

<p>A clear parody of the Florida Keys, the Leonida Keys are a beachside tropical paradise, complete with retirees, casual boating, and sea turtles. The site's description also describes it as some of the most "dangerous waters in all of America."</p>



<h2>Grassrivers</h2>

<p>This swampy biome is full of danger. Rockstar says it's got even "deadlier predators" than the state's infamous alligators, and based on the screenshots, I can only assume those predators are the wetlands' intimidating, heavily armed residents.</p>



<h2>Port Gellhorn</h2>

<p>This sketchy area used to be a popular vacation spot, but now its stores have been abandoned and its parking lots are filled with "malt liquor, painkillers, and truck stop energy drinks." As a tourist, I'd be scared, but seeing as I'll be playing as two lovers with a penchant for the illegal, it seems like a great spot to make some money.</p>



<h2>Ambrosia</h2>

<p>The "heart of Leonida" is known for its "old school values," factories, and local biker gang. Based on the screenshots, it also looks like the economy partially relies on farms (even if this one is on fire), and the locals rely on some particularly patriotic women to wash their cars.</p>



<h2>Mount Kalaga National Park</h2>

<p>Full of wildlife and wilderness, the National Park is lush with greenery. Rockstar says the park will have "prime hunting, fishing, and off-road trails," potentially hinting at some of the series' numerous elaborate minigames.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/startplaying-and-roll20-partner-up-for-daggerheart-launch-event<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roll20 and StartPlaying are partnering for a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-darrington-press-hotly-anticipated-ttrpg-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> launch event. Darrington Press' highly anticipated fantasy TTRPG, set to release sometime this year, will have the support of one of the industry's largest VTT platforms and professional GM services.</p>

<h2>The <em>Daggerheart</em> Launch Event Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Roll20 and StartPlaying have put together an extensive <em>Daggerheart</em> launch event. StartPlaying has provided over 150 officially vetted Game Masters with advance copies of the <em>Daggerheart</em> Core Rulebook via the Demiplane Nexus. This means once the TTRPG launches, those wanting to experience it as intended can do so through StartPlaying.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-frog-wizard-artwork.jpg?itok=eJq9SsX9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-frog-wizard-artwork.jpg?itok=31ODN-VT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This won't be a single day event either. The entire launch month of Daggheart will be packed with exclusive online game sessions hosted by StartPlaying. Registration for these gaming tables are limited, so if you are a fan of Critical Role or have been enjoying the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-13-playtest-available-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">past playtests</a> of the game, it is best to register now while you can.</p>

<p>The press confirmed that the Daggerheart Demiplane Nexus will offer everything needed to play the game. This will include a digital reader, compendium, character builder, and GM tools. Furthermore, courtesy of the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-roll20-demiplane-integration-feature-is-now-in-beta" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">platform integration</a> feature, these tools will be completely compatible with Roll20.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is an incredible opportunity for fans who have been eagerly awaiting Daggerheart’s release," said Jayme Boucher, Senior Marketing Manager at Roll20, the parent company of Demiplane. "Being able to learn and enjoy a brand-new TTRPG on launch day with professional GMs is not a typical day one experience, but it’s one that Roll20, StartPlaying, and Darrington Press are delighted to offer the community.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daggerheart is Darrington Press' latest TTRPG. The publishing arm of Critical Role has produced several high-quality TTRPG books and products. These include official supplements for the fantasy setting of Exandria like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tal'Dorei Reborn</em></a> and its gaslamp fantasy TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/candela-obscura-core-rulebook-review-comprehensive-guide-to-newfaire-and-horror" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>More than a year after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity">Microsoft announced plans to start releasing games on rival platforms</a>, the publisher seems to have hit its stride on PlayStation. Sony released <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/05/playstation-store-april-2025s-top-downloads/">its monthly most-downloaded charts for PS5 games</a>, and for April, the top three titles in both Europe and North America all came from Microsoft. No sales numbers were included, but the top games were <em>Minecraft</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/654770/oblivion-remaster-hands-on-xbox-gamepass-bethesda">the <em>Oblivion</em> remaster</a>, and <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314376/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-bethesda-machinegames-xbox"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> charted as well.</p></div><p>This, of course, is a great thing for players, with major game releases available on more platforms. But it’s also part of a slow and steady shift for the platform holders, which once heavily relied on exclusives as a means to move hardware. That’s still largely the case for Nintendo — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">don’t expect to see <em>Mario Kart World</em> anywhere but the Switch 2</a> — but Microsoft and Sony have been steadily pushing in another direction.</p><p>While Sony has yet to release a first-party game on a rival console, it has made the PC a major part of its current strategy, with notable releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24273919/spider-man-2-pc-release-date"><em>Spider-Man 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24340000/the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-playstation-network">soon <em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a> launching on PC after their PlayStation debuts. Part of the goal, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167560/sony-thinks-its-pc-games-will-tempt-you-to-buy-a-playstation-really">according to Sony</a>, is to use these PC games to eventually lure players back to their console.</p><p>Microsoft’s strategy has similarly been gradual, but more expansive. It started with four smaller titles, including <em>Grounded</em> and <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, last February, and covered both the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. And <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games">at the time Xbox chief Phil Spencer told <em>The Verge</em> that</a> “I don’t want to create a false expectation on those other platforms that this is somehow the first four to get over the dam and then the dam’s going to open and that everything else is coming, that’s not the plan today. I also don’t want to mislead customers on those other platforms.”</p><p>Well, the dam seems to have burst. Major Xbox releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606102/xbox-ps5-age-of-empires"><em>Age of Empires</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610817/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date"><em>Indiana Jones</em></a> have made their way to the PS5, while upcoming games like <em>Doom</em>, <em>Gears</em>, and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> are also launching on Sony’s console. Not every first-party Xbox game has been announced for the PS5 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/611255/avowed-review-xbox-pc"><em>Avowed</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647143/south-of-midnight-review-xbox-compulsion-games"><em>South of Midnight</em></a> are still Xbox exclusives, for now, as is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc"><em>Starfield</em></a> — but many of the heavy hitters have, including the likes of <em>Gears</em>, which has long been heavily associated with the Xbox brand.</p><p>It seems pretty clear that Microsoft is still in something of an experimentation phase, seeing how different kinds of games perform on different platforms. And as selling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">increasingly expensive hardware</a> becomes less of a focus for the publisher, the success of those games will be key. Last year, when this initiative was still getting started, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074166/microsoft-xbox-strategy-multiplatform">Spencer said that the long-term goal was</a> “a future where every screen is an Xbox.” Based on the current sales charts, it seems that now includes a PlayStation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> is one of those forever games where occasionally I'll see that it's released something new and think "dang, that old dog is still truckin' along?" It seems to be that time of year again, as both a big update for the game as well as a new expansion dropped yesterday. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/paradox-interactive">Paradox</a> previously described this as a "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-date-stellaris-40-a-phoenix-update-to-attract-new-players-and-improve-performance">phoenix update</a>" to try and sort out a bunch of the game's long-running issues, as well as make some tweaks to help bring in new players.
</p>

<p>
Ironically, based on some recent Steam reviews since the update dropped, a lot of people seem to be saying it's kind of done the opposite, at least in terms of making the game run better. I'm sure that'll get fixed eventually, the game's nearly 10 years old, I doubt one dodgy update will sink this spaceship. In terms of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/502823294872846886">update's big changes</a>, the game now groups singular populations by species, strata, and ethic. These groups then produce Workforce, which then get assigned to jobs on your planets.

<p>
DLC wise, there's lots of additions there too. You'll find a couple of new biological shipsets, which kind of look like different species of deep sea squid. There's also a new origin called the Wilderness, a "Hive Mind exclusive origin" that requires you to play with a biological ship set.
</p>
<p>
Godzilla and giant space creature lovers alike may also be interested in the new player crisis scenario which lets you breed your very own giant monster. Existentially terrifying, but makes for some cool gameplay.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, there's new civics like genetic identification and civil education, a new deep space citadel megastructure, an overhauled genetic ascension, and a lot more. Big DLC! Too much to cover here, but that's ok, it just leaves plenty more for you to discover. Or to just read about in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/502823913043001850">Steam post</a>.
