<p>The in-game image and abilities of the Human Torch in Marvel Rivals have leaked online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As revealed by reliable leaker RivalsLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871707483691245587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the Human Torch is one of the upcoming heroes Marvel Rivals developers seem to be working on. In-game images and abilities of the character have surfaced online, hinting that he might be arriving soon. The character is seen wearing his Fantastic 4 uniform, with his whole body engulfed in flames. Additionally, his hair, eyebrows, and eyes match the colour of the fire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same thread, RivalsLeaks has also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871707598703272309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> the in-game abilities page for the Human Torch in Marvel Rivals. The character’s primary attack is the Fire Cluster, the secondary attack is Blazing Blast, and his Team-Up ability with Storm is called Omega Fire. Other abilities include Supernova, Plasma Body, Pyro-Prison, and Flaming Meteor. Check out what each Human Torch ability does below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Fire Cluster (Left Click): Launches a splittable fireball at the enemy</li>



<li>Omega Fire (X): This team-up ability allows Storm to consume the Human Torch’s fire tornado and add it to her hurricane. Alternatively, the Human Torch can also consume Storm’s Hurricane to create a fiery hurricane that enlarges and intensifies all the fire tornadoes found while the ability is active.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Supernova (Q): The Human Torch will release a shockwave that damages enemies within a radius. During the activation of this skill, flame fields will turn into flame tornadoes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Plasma Body (L-Shift) This ability allows the Human Torch to enter a state of accelerated ascent.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Pyro-Prison (E): Through this ability, players can connect flame fields to create a fire wall that can burn enemies to deal damage.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Flaming Meteor (F): This ability will make the Human Torch dive to the ground and stun nearby enemies.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Blazing Blast (Right Click): Players can create a flame field in a targeted area by launching a fireball through this ability.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

                <p dir="ltr">Many of us have a game franchise that, despite liking everything we hear about it, we have never actually played any of the games. I have a few, but one notable blind spot in my gaming resume was Yakuza, or as it's called now, Like A Dragon.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd been told by many friends that the series has something for everyone, from heavy action scenes to lighthearted goofiness, all with real emotion at the center… and yet I still never found the time. This year saw the release of Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and for a while I thought it would be just another game to add to my backlog. However, thanks to a freelance opportunity, I finally found my excuse to play a Like A Dragon game for the first time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415490-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415490" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415490-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415490"></a><figcaption>Listening to Orlando's story.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415490-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Through the first few chapters, I was enjoying myself, but I wasn't yet seeing what others had told me about the series all these years. That changed in Chapter 4, when I approached a shaved-ice shop on the streets of Hawaii, and Substory 24: Let It Snow began.</p><p dir="ltr">Let It Snow begins with Ichiban finding a man in a plaid shirt buying shaved ice (also known as a snow cone) at a local shop. Curiously, the man asks for no toppings on his dessert, and then once he receives the treat, he throws it into the air. As the ice immediately melts--this is Hawaii, after all--the man screams in anguish and leaves distraught. Ichiban watches this happen, and other than feeling it's really strange, doesn't think much more of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Later, we find the same man being denied shaved ice at a second stand, as the proprietor had caught wind of his weird motives. Dejected, the man sits at a nearby bench, where Ichiban can sit with him and learn his story.</p><p dir="ltr">It turns out this man, whose name we learn is Orlando, is trying to fulfill his wife Ellie's dying wish: "I want to see the snow with you again." The couple, Orlando explains, have a lot of fond memories involving snow, including their honeymoon in Japan, and while he wanted to take her back, real-life responsibilities got in the way. She wants to see snow fall with her beloved one more time before she dies, which can be any time now. Ichiban agrees to help, and the two part ways for the moment.</p><p dir="ltr">So, uh, yeah…when I first saw a weird old dude throwing shaved ice into the sky, I did not think it would lead me to "super emotional story about a man trying to help his wife on her deathbed." This is exactly the kind of thing my friends have been telling me about, and I have to admit it's effective. That's the beauty of the writing at work here; just when you think you have it all figured out, Like A Dragon surprises you. And, as the Substory continued, surprise me it <em>absolutely did</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Later on in a nearby shopping center, Ichiban watches a woman lose a stroller down an escalator. Ichiban chases the stroller--the chase consisting of quick-time events to complete--until he catches it and brings it to a stop. Ichiban looks into the stroller, only to find <em>a grown man in a diaper staring back at him</em>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415492-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415492" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415492-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415492"></a><figcaption>Not what you'd expect to see in a bassinet!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415492-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is Susumu Gondawara, a yakuza boss from a previous game who veteran Like A Dragon players would know to expect, but I was completely caught off guard. This hulking baby man says his stroller got away from the "nanny" he hired, and he wants Ichiban to take him back to her. However, three of Gondawara's henchmen--also, inexplicably, in nothing but diapers--accuse Ichiban of kidnapping Gondawara, and the fight is on.</p><p dir="ltr">Once they're defeated, Gondawara asks for some milk--and the only place to find it is a nearby shaved-ice truck, which uses condensed milk as a topping. One of the henchmen gets in line, only for a man in a familiar plaid shirt to force himself into the front and ask for a shaved ice with no topping.</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Ichiban, Orlando, and Gondawara all speak together, and try to come up with a solution to the problem. Orlando worries they're running out of time, and Ichiban throws his shaved ice to the ground in frustration… however, the group notices that the ice didn't melt, and instead turned to a snow-like substance. How did this happen?</p><p dir="ltr">Are you ready?</p><p dir="ltr">You'll never guess…</p><p dir="ltr">It turns out that the absorbent of the diapers Gondawara and his men are wearing <em>mixed with the shaved ice</em>, and the combination created the "snow." I'd heard Like A Dragon could be wacky, but I don't think I realized just how wacky things could get. After Gondawara explains the difference between his group's "baby play" fantasy and real-world honor, the three agree to a plan.</p><p dir="ltr">The scene then shifts to the hotel where Orlando and Ellie are staying, where--and I cannot believe I'm typing these words--Ichiban, Gondawara, and the underlings mix diaper absorbent with shaved ice, then throw it off of the rooftop of the hotel. Orlando and Ellie, together in their room just below said rooftop, see the "snow" come through the window and are delighted.</p><p dir="ltr">Ellie calls Orlando a "magician," before asking for one more last wish: She wants to see Orlando smile one last time before she falls asleep. He obliges, tears welling in his eyes, and she eventually falls asleep for the final time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415493-like-a-dragon-substory-sold.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415493" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415493-like-a-dragon-substory-sold.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415493"></a><figcaption>Ellie's final moments.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415493-like-a-dragon-substory-sold.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So, to recap, in order to help a desperate man fulfill the final wish of his dying wife, our hero Ichiban:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Enlisted the help of a man who likes to act as a baby</li><li dir="ltr">Mixed absorbent from that man's adult diaper supply with shaved ice to create "snow"</li><li dir="ltr">Threw the mixture off of a roof, so the desperate man and his wife could see it fall from the room below.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">And yet, despite the sheer wackiness making this whole thing happen, the heart at the core of the scene cannot be denied. Ichiban stepped up to help a stranger, simply because he could, and he made a dying woman's final wish come true in the process. Once the "snow" started to fall, and the scene focused on Orlando and Ellie, I forgot about the absurdities of it all and focused on the relatable, human story at the center of the Substory, and it filled me with a warmth that most games aren't capable of creating… until the scene switches back to Ichiban and company, where Gondawara's henchmen are laying on the rooftop exhausted--and buck naked. It's a last bit of wackiness to send us off; this is Like A Dragon, after all.</p><p dir="ltr">After years of being told I would like this series, and never having time to check it out, Infinite Wealth was officially my first foray into what Like A Dragon/Yakuza has to offer. Thanks to Substory 24: Let It Snow, I've seen the light. I'm sold, and I plan to go back and see what I've been missing all this time as soon as possible--and all it took was a little "winter" magic.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

			<p>While 2024 may have felt light in terms of new fighting game franchises, the past year still delivered plenty of excitement for fans of the genre, especially thanks to the release of new entries in some of the most celebrated series in gaming history, such as the Tekken and Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi series. Whether you prefer going head-to-head with your opponents using your iron fists, unleashing ki blasts, pulling off perfect piledrivers, or knocking them off platforms while wavedashing toward them, 2024 offered plenty of opportunities to unleash your fighting spirit against.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a></em></p>
<h2>Tekken 8 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tekken8-key-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The wait for a new King of the Iron First tournament has been long, but the wait has been repaid in full, as Tekken 8 is a game worthy of being part of one of the best fighting games series ever. While the game does leave something to be desired when it comes to single-player content, especially compared to previous entries in the series, and the netcode doesn't always deliver a smooth experience if both players don't have a flawless internet connection, the amazing learning tools it offers and the diverse character roster, which has started expanding beyond the boundaries of the franchise with the introduction of Final Fantasy XVI's protagonist Clive Rosfield, make it one of the best fighting games of the generation for the competitive-minded players. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review:</p>
<p><em>Featuring cutting-edge visuals for fighting games and exceptional learning tools, Tekken 8 stands out as one of the best releases in the fighting game genre over the last few years. While the netcode is generally acceptable, regrettably, it falls short of replicating the seamless offline experience, a drawback that significantly affects the overall experience way more than the limited amount of single player content and somewhat diminishes the effectiveness of the game's outstanding learning tools, particularly for those unable to engage in offline multiplayer matches.</em></p>
<h2>WWE 2K24 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/">8</a>)</h2>
<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WWE-2K24.jpg"></a></h2>
<p>The WWE 2K series has had it rough in the past few years. After stumbling badly with WWE 2K20, the series by Visual Concept had to take one year off to find its footing again, which it somewhat did with WWE 2K22 and WWE 2K23, whose formula, while far from being the best, showed some promise. With WWE 2K24, however, the series finally made a proper comeback from its dark age, with fun new mechanics and match types and a great selection of play modes. The core action could still use some refinements, but it definitely seems like Visual Concept is on the right track to bring the series back to greatness, to the joy of all WWE fans all over the world. Here's what Nathan Birch had to say about the game in his review.</p>
<p><em>With the release of WWE 2K24 this series no longer feels like a carny outcast amongst the other big sports franchises. While the game’s core action could stand to be even further refined, fun new mechanics, match types, and a fully-developed suite of modes, including significantly improved Showcase and MyGM offerings, are worth cheering for. While maybe not quite the total package just yet, WWE 2K24 feels like it’s ready for the bright lights.</em></p>
<h2>Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-an-explosive-love-letter/">9</a>)</h2>
<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></h2>
<p>The Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series has long been left dormant, but it is still considered one of the best series based on the massively popular series created by Akira Toriyama. Topping the third main entry in the series was far from being easy to accomplish, but developer Spike Chunsoft outdid themselves with a game that not only feels great to play but also takes advantage of modern gaming technology and engines such as the Unreal Engine 5 to make players feel as if they were indeed part of the Dragon Ball universe. Sure, the game may be a little unbalanced, but it wouldn't be Dragon Ball if the power levels wouldn't range from 10 to over 2,000,000. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is undeniably one of the best games based on Akira Toriyama's series. With an engaging story mode that includes intriguing what-if scenarios, a combat system that's easy to learn but challenging to master, a massive character roster, and impressive attention to detail, Spike Chunsoft has created a must-have for Dragon Ball fans. If you've ever wanted to be Goku and scream your heart out before unleashing secret techniques, this is the game for you.</em></p>
<h2>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-review-taking-you-for-a-ride/">8</a>)</h2>
<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MARVEL-vs.-CAPCOM-Fighting-Collection-Arcade-Classics.jpg"></a></h2>
<p>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM series took the world of fighting games by storm before it was actually called so with the release of the first tag fighter ever made by CAPCOM, X-Men vs Street Fighter, and seeing it end so ingloriously with the average Marvel VS. Capcom Infinite was truly a shame. Thankfully, it seems like the two companies are still open to working together, and released this year the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, a new collection that includes the first two main entries in the series as well as the other games made by the creator of Street Fighter featuring Marvel Comics characters like X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter and the side-scrolling beat'em up The Punisher. While the collection highlighted how some of these games haven't aged as well as others have, it also highlighted how others, like MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 2, are still a joy to play. Too bad for the lack of cross-platform play, especially on PC where there are more popular options to enjoy these classics. Here's what I said about the collection in my review:</p>
<p><em>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a fantastic celebration of the series, showcasing some of the best fighting games released by the Japanese publisher in the late '90s and early 2000s. Although the lack of cross-platform play reduces the collection's appeal, the additional options and extras are welcome enhancements that make playing these timeless classics on modern hardware even more enticing, especially on consoles.</em></p>
<h2>Rivals of Aether II</h2>
<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rivals-of-Aether-2.jpg"></a></h2>
<p>With the latest entry in the Super Smash Bros. series having been released six years ago, many other platform fighters got their chance to shine, filling the void left open by the series that essentially created a whole new sub-genre. Among the few platform fighters released since, Rivals of Aether II is the one that capitalized the most on this situation, becoming the go-to game for those who cannot live their gaming life without dash dancing, wavedashing, shield dropping, and so on. Instead of attempting to do things differently, which doesn't always lead to the best results, the game developed by Aether Studios went all in on the formula made popular by Super Smash Bros. Melee, making it easier to perform some of the advanced tech listed above to allow players to focus on the fun. While on paper, this may detract from the game's identity a bit, the developer masterfully weaved together these elements with the cast's diverse moveset to provide a game that will only grow in popularity as time goes on.</p>
<p>Sadly, the lack of single-player content prevents Rivals of Aether II from being a must-buy right now for those looking for some casual fun, but hopefully, this issue will be addressed as the game expands in the future.</p>

<p>Okay, so you thought January would kick off 2025 with a slew of new video game releases, right? Well, it’s a generally quiet time for the industry, though we are receiving a few big titles, like Spider-Man 2 and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PC. But it’s February that will really jump-start gaming in 2025. Here’s a look at the biggest video game releases in February 2025!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-hottest-game-releases-of-february-2025">The Hottest Game Releases of February 2025</h2>



<p>I really cannot understate how massive the month of February 2025 is for game releases. It’s overloaded with some truly epic titles, the kind of games you could spend hundreds or thousands of hours playing without looking at the release calendar again. But they come one after another this month, which will take a toll on our sanity and wallets.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </strong>(PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 4, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Civilization VII</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – February 11, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 14, 2025</li>



<li><strong>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Nintendo Switch) – February 14, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – February 14, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Avowed </strong>(PC/Xbox Series X|S) – February 18, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 1</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 18, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S) – February 21, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 28, 2025</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-looking-forward-to-march-2025">Looking Forward to March 2025</h2>



<p>After a month like February, here’s hoping March isn’t overly packed with new video game releases. We could use some time to rest and recuperate and, of course, to finish all of those massive titles like Kingdom Come and Monster Hunter Wilds. But, here’s what you can look forward to in March 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Two Point Museum</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Tales of the Shire</li>



<li>Atomfall</li>
</ul>

<p>Battlestate Games has confirmed that Escape from Tarkov’s next wipe will hit tomorrow, December 26. This patch – which also includes Escape from Tarkov Arena – ushers in the 0.16.0.0 patch, and the 0.2.5.0 patch for the latter title. It’s set to take the game offline for around eight hours, and when it comes back up, hundreds of thousands of players will flood the game.</p>



<p>How many of them will be cheaters or malicious operators?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-good-with-the-bad">Good with the Bad</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has had a tough time of late dealing with more than a few issues. The biggest concern is cheaters, and the epidemic reached such epic proportions that the game’s biggest streamers were turned off, with many players diverting their attention to the game’s ‘offline’ PvE offering.</p>



<p>This month, Tarkov’s viewer counts on Twitch hit their lowest point since the summer of 2019, when the game underwent a monumental boom on streaming and content platforms.</p>



<p>Regardless, Escape from Tarkov will undergo a sizeable upshift in the coming days as the next Tarkov wipe hits and countless players come back to the extraction shooter in droves. It’ll hit the top spots in the charts on streaming sites, and once again, players will start their stories in Tarkov, tackling those pesky early-game tasks.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Tomorrow, December 26, at 7:00 AM GMT / 2:00 AM EST we are planning to install patches 0.16.0.0 for </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#EscapefromTarkov</a><span> and 0.2.5.0 for </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TarkovArena" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#TarkovArena</a><span>. The installation will take approximately 8 hours. The installation of updates may be extended if required. The games will not be…</span></p></article></div>







<p>When Tarkov wipes tomorrow, it’ll bring about the 0.16.0.0 update, which introduces changes to Customs and adds in several new weapons, amongst other things. Battlestate is also tweaking the game’s weapon recoil mechanics, making some major visual adjustments.</p>



<p>It’s also expected that the Unity 2022 upgrade will be wrapped up in this patch.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the next Tarkov wipe? Make sure you keep an eye open for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-winter-twitch-drops-2024/">Twitch Drops campaign</a> starting later this month, and be sure to stop by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It’s that time of the year when you finally treat yourself or someone takes pity on you and buys you that one piece of tech you’ve been eyeing all year. For many, that’s the Steam Deck. If you woke up and unboxed a Steam Deck, well, congratulations! But here are a few of the games you should check out first on your new PC handheld!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-games-on-steam-deck-for-new-owners">The Best Games on Steam Deck for New Owners</h2>



<p>The list of available titles for the Steam Deck grows seemingly daily, with new game releases and old titles finally receiving verification. Before long, everything will be playable on the handheld. But for now, you must still pick and choose, though it’s from an absolutely astounding library of games. Here are just a handful of what you can expect to enjoy on your new Steam Deck:</p>



<h3 id="h-balatro">Balatro</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>I think Tom would be rather upset with me if I didn’t mention Balatro. But more so than that, it’s an incredible roguelike deckbuilder with innovative gameplay, that borderline enthralling one-more-turn style of gameplay we love, and quite accessible mechanics that warrant a playthrough or ten. Oh, and don’t worry if you don’t know poker because Balatro is so simple to grasp!</p>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via ConcernedApe</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not ashamed to admit that Stardew Valley is one of my all-time favorite titles to date. I used to play a ton of Harvest Moon, and then I graduated to Stardew on release day and never looked back. I’ve spent nearly 300 hours playing the indie farming simulator on Steam Deck alone, as it’s such a simple game to pick up and play with the handheld. It runs smoothly, the battery life is excellent, and the game functions better with a controller than with a mouse and keyboard, in my opinion.</p>



<h3 id="h-baldur-s-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Don’t expect to play Baldur’s Gate 3 on Steam Deck for extended periods, as the massive role-playing game will burn through the handheld battery quickly. That said, the turn-based combat and easy maneuverability of the game work splendidly on the handheld controls of the Deck. If you want a game that will suck up countless hours of your free time without leaving the couch, Baldur’s Gate 3 is the go-to choice for many.</p>







<h3 id="h-hades-or-hades-2">Hades (Or Hades 2!)</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>I was initially unsure about Hades, as I was still relatively new to the roguelike genre upon its release. However, after too many recommendations, I gave it a shot and immediately fell in love. It’s a challenging yet satisfying action hack-and-slash in which you’ll power up your abilities and move over time, delving further into the Underworld as you go. It functions perfectly on Steam Deck, and the bite-size maps allow you to play on your own time.</p>



<h3 id="h-cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cult of the Lamb was my Game of the Year in 2022, and an absolute surprise that I wasn’t sure I’d enjoy until my wife bought it for me as an early birthday present. Well, I was hooked. I immediately sunk 50 hours into a single playthrough, and then I did it again on PC. Then, I started playing on Steam Deck and wound up with another four complete playthroughs on the handheld. It runs well and has impressive battery life. But the technical stuff, while fun, is only a small part of the experience. You can run a cult, build your base, and venture into the wilds with powerful weapons and spells!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24312434/best-roguelikes-2024-balatro-hades-2-prince-of-persia<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The roguelike genre has turned from a relative niche into something much bigger. Roguelike games can be famously tough to crack into; generally, they have a high difficulty that means you’ll bang your head against a wall as you learn how to play the game, puzzle out what strategies work best in the procedurally generated levels, and figure out how to overcome tough enemies or challenges. 2024 showed that the genre wasn’t only a commercial force through hits like <em>Hades II</em> and <em>Balatro</em>, and also that a roguelike could be almost anything: from a poker variant to a flashy multiplayer action game.</p><p>Speaking of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a>, it was undoubtedly one of, if not <em>the</em>, best games of the year. The game is supremely easy to pick up because of its roots in building traditional poker hands, but each round feels wildly different because of the clever and sometimes superpowered joker cards that can give you massive bonuses. The game is a perfect mix of skill, risk, and a little bit of luck, and it feels so good when you find a strategy that completely stacks the chips in your favor. I think I’ll be playing <em>Balatro</em> for years to come, especially with whatever’s cooking for the game’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215342/balatro-free-major-gameplay-update-2025">upcoming major update</a>. And now that the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack">is out on mobile</a>, I can play wherever I want.</p><p>That is, when I’m not dipping my toes back into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance"><em>Hades II</em></a>. The game, which is still in early access, is shaping up to be a worthy successor to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"><em>Hades</em></a>, and it’s arguably more fully fleshed out than many finished titles. I’ve already put more than 30 hours into <em>Hades II, </em>and I feel like I still have so much to unlock and master, but I’ve intentionally held myself back from playing more so that I don’t burn out on the game before it reaches v1.0. I only beat the new boss in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">most recent major update</a> a single time before deciding that was enough.</p><p>There are a couple other roguelikes that I have loved and want to put more time into but haven’t because of the sheer volume of other games in the genre to check out. <em>Shogun Showdown</em>, which is all about tactics and positioning, makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24243908/shogun-showdown-review">you feel like a genius by showing you the future</a>. I really enjoyed getting a handle on the game’s weapons and items so that I could pull off well-planned combos against waves of enemies.</p><p><em>Windblown</em>, the new roguelike from <em>Dead Cells</em> creators Motion Twin, takes a lot of what makes <em>Dead Cells</em> great and translates it to 3D. Weapons are varied, satisfying, and can combo well with each other. The game’s biomes are creative and fun to explore, with lots of nooks and crannies. But where <em>Windblown</em> really shines is its multiplayer — until playing the game, I had no idea <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24284956/windblown-roguelikes-friends-multiplayer">how good roguelikes could be with friends</a>. Like <em>Hades</em>, <em>Windblown</em> is also in early access, so I’m expecting to play it a lot more next year as Motion Twin makes major updates.</p><p>And those are just the new roguelikes I’ve actually been able to put time into this year. There are still a bunch more that I want to play or have barely touched that seem extremely promising. <em>Vampire Survivors</em> got <em>two</em> major crossover DLCs that I want to dig into: one with <em>Contra</em> and one with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275710/vampire-survivors-ode-to-castlevania-dlc-konami-collaboration-expansion"><em>Castlevania</em></a>. (I’ve only played a couple rounds of the <em>Castlevania</em> expansion, and I was tickled at just how large the map was.) And while I’m talking about <em>Vampire Survivors</em>: <em>Halls of Torment</em>, which is kind of like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> mixed with an old-school <em>Diablo</em> aesthetic, left early access, and I want to check out what’s changed since I first dabbled in it last year.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172102/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-steam-early-access-impression"><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a>, a roguelike take on classic <em>Prince of Persia</em> action and platforming, is an example of how big publishers like Ubisoft are jumping into the genre — and it seems like something that’s right up my alley. <em>Rogue</em> is another early access roguelike on this list, but it’s gotten a bunch of big updates since its May launch, including a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296619/the-prince-wont-be-purple">significant update in November</a> that revamped the art style and added new biomes, bosses, and more. I should also mention that <em>Rogue</em> <em>also</em> has a <em>Dead Cells</em> connection: it’s made by Evil Empire, the studio that worked on many <em>Dead Cells</em> updates and DLCs, which gives me a lot of faith that they’ll do a great job shepherding the game to its eventual full launch.&nbsp;</p><p>Heck, 2024 has been such a banner year for roguelikes that even the 2014 classic <em>The</em> <em>Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</em> got a significant new DLC update that <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F250900%2Fview%2F7119722540407193807">added online multiplayer</a>.</p><p>The sheer amount of great roguelikes <em>just this year</em> shows that the framework of the genre offers a lot of ways to make interesting games. I particularly appreciate how they’re generally more digestible than blockbuster epics. Next year has some promising roguelikes like <em>Slay the Spire 2</em> and <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, but I know I’ll be returning to a lot of 2024’s excellent roguelikes over and over again — well, after just one more round of <em>Balatro</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was another lowkey great year for what is increasingly becoming the default high-end gaming console. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,193348" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>There were excellent updates to the PS5 home screen UI, a slew of great exclusive games from second- and third-party partners, and an entire update to the console in the form of the $700 PS5 Pro. PS VR2 became platform agnostic, a 30th Anniversary celebration unveiled nostalgic accessories for longtime fans, and the base tier of PS Plus  continued to deliver plenty of premium freebies. The lack of a new big-budget first-party game and the abysmal failure of <em>Concord</em> sent up red flags, but not major hurdles to a platform that soared to 65.5 million units sold last month.</p><p>All of this as an executive shakeup saw Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan replaced by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ceo-ps5-spring-2024-showcase-1851474530?_gl=1*1od6znf*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDk5MDMwNi4xNjUuMS4xNzM0OTk0NzA4LjQ4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ceo-ps5-spring-2024-showcase-1851474530?_gl=1*1od6znf*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDk5MDMwNi4xNjUuMS4xNzM0OTk0NzA4LjQ4LjAuMA..">co-CEOs Herman Hulst and Hideaki Nishino</a></span>, reporting up to Sony COO Hiroki Totoki.

The next phase of PlayStation is coming, and 2024 showed that even seeming “off years” can still deliver for players in spades.</p><h2 id="h774051"><a id=""></a>The Hardware</h2><p>After tons of reporting, rumors, and speculation, 2024 was the year Sony finally <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://o/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched the PS5 Pro</a></span>. Its hefty price tag promised no-compromises gaming, with upscaled 4K resolution at 60fps thanks to a more powerful GPU and new machine learning technology called PSSR. The results so far have been good to mixed, with some games looking more gorgeous than ever while certain third-party releases struggle to play nice with PSSR and studios race to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-pandora-ps5-pro-pssr-hotfix-turn-off-1851717966&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-pandora-ps5-pro-pssr-hotfix-turn-off-1851717966">amend their PS5 Pro updates</a></span> in the face of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pssr-update-silent-hill-2-remake-dragon-age-1851701776&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pssr-update-silent-hill-2-remake-dragon-age-1851701776">unexpected visual downgrades</a></span>. </p><p>This has put the device, at least early on, firmly into the “nice but unnecessary” category of upgrades. Denser visual detail at higher framerates and greater ray-tracing options bring the PS5 console experience into closer parity with mid-level PC gaming, but don’t quite offer the “oh shit!” moments that might make even longtime fans feel the need to run out and immediately pick one up. That’s especially the case when even the base PS5 continues to perform so well and feel perfectly adequate in the near-term.</p><figure id="" data-id="0d4efa6a42876bb96d9a1cc0ba35de47" data-recommend-id="image://0d4efa6a42876bb96d9a1cc0ba35de47" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="30th anniversary PS5 consoles and accessories are lined up.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This could be another indication that the console arms race is slowing to a crawl, with future generations yielding even more granular improvements. But the PS5 Pro’s PSSR tech also provides a glimpse at where console manufacturers could leverage AI to try to make up ground. Sony recently announced a partnership with AMD <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXMwXJsMfIQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXMwXJsMfIQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called Project Amethyst</a></span> to “support broad work and machine learning across a variety of devices” in an effort that would pay dividends for other companies as well. The company is also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps6-chip-release-date-backwards-compatibility-ps5-1851648868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-chip-release-date-backwards-compatibility-ps5-1851648868">reportedly already</a></span> working with AMD on the PS6.</p><p>For now, the PS5 still isn’t getting a price drop. In fact, it actually became more expensive this year in certain regions, including Japan. The DualSense controller also received a stealth price hike. A temporary Black Friday sale took the PS5 all-digital price down to $375, only $25 less than what it launched at in 2020. The PS5 got better in 2024, but not cheaper. </p><h2 id="h774052"><a id=""></a>The Software</h2><p>The PS5 interface received a notable refresh this year in the form of a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ethangach/status/1836798946095538399/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1836798946095538399/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customizable welcome hub</a></span>. The default module when you start up the console comes with new backgrounds and a bunch of tiles that can be swapped in with various widgets, from trophies and controller battery life to news about wishlisted games, console storage, and who’s online. It’s a seemingly small touch that goes a long way toward making the PS5 ecosystem easier to parse, navigate, and engage with, and it might just be the start of a bold new era for the system’s UI.</p><p>There were a few other updates to the firmware in 2024. Adaptive charging made the console more energy-efficient for newer PS5 models, including the Slim and Pro, and party share now lets you circulate session invites directly on social media and other messaging apps. There’s still no great way to directly share screenshots and gameplay footage on social media after Sony cut integration with X (formerly known as Twitter), though the PlayStation App is getting closer to being the remote second screen for the PS5 it deserves to be.</p><p>But the biggest software update of all this year didn’t come to the PS5 at all—it came to the PlayStation Portal. The not-quite-a-gaming-handheld peripheral can now play a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps-portal-new-update-cloud-streaming-ps5-beta-test-1851703376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps-portal-new-update-cloud-streaming-ps5-beta-test-1851703376">growing list of games directly from the cloud</a></span> rather than needing to stream them from a home console strictly as a remote play device. This change essentially doubles the value of the $200 accessory, and potentially serves as a bridge to a future in which a full-fledged Sony handheld <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119">reportedly in development</a></span> can play new games natively as well.  </p><h2 id="h774053"><a id=""></a>The Networks and Services</h2><p>This portion of our annual PlayStation report card usually focuses almost exclusively on the services portion of the equation, but 2024 showcased some significant lapses in network functionality. While it still pales in comparison to the infamous 2011 PSN outage, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-network-slowly-coming-back-online-after-significant-outage&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-network-slowly-coming-back-online-after-significant-outage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the services were down intermittently for almost a full day back in the fall</a></span>. It was a reminder of how much of the platform relies on constant connectivity to deliver on its promise, from multiplayer-only games to always-online single-player campaigns. Any outage, no matter how brief, is also notable in the context of Sony charging $10 a month for the ability to play online. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-stars-outage-broken-down-fixed-1851570048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-stars-outage-broken-down-fixed-1851570048">PlayStation Stars</a></span>, a smaller rewards initiative incorporated into the PS app rather than the console itself, nevertheless raised questions when it was offline for multiple weeks over the summer with no real explanation from Sony as to why the service had gone down. Coupled with issues with activity cards and various high-profile firmware bugs, the normally quite stable PS5 platform wobbled more than usual in 2024. PS Plus’ Netflix-like library of downloadable games was on much firmer footing, however. </p><figure id="" data-id="dcd3fbe90f91cd6ad5aa51b1fd5a0c51" data-recommend-id="image://dcd3fbe90f91cd6ad5aa51b1fd5a0c51" data-format="png" data-width="1703" data-height="733" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows new PS Classics.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>PS Plus Premium, the most expensive of the service’s three tiers at $160 per year, added a bunch more PS classics to help round out its back catalog. Subscribing fans finally got access to the <em>Sly Cooper</em> trilogy, the first two <em>Legacy of Kain</em> games, <em>Dino Crisis</em>, and a bunch of other old-school favorites. For the program’s price, though, there still really needs to be a better alternative for accessing the vast reservoir of PS3 exclusives. Insomniac’s WW2 alien shooter trilogy <em>Resistance</em> also arrived on Premium, but only via streaming.</p><p>And while the middle tier—PS Plus Extra—continues to be hit-or-miss with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-games-leaving-horizon-forbidden-west-marvel-ps5-1851626853&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-games-leaving-horizon-forbidden-west-marvel-ps5-1851626853">what great games are added or rotated out</a></span>, the base PS Plus catalog continues to be full of bangers. 2024 saw the addition of <em>A Plague Tale: Requiem</em>, <em>Nobody Saves the World</em>, <em>Immortals of Aveum</em>, <em>Tunic</em>, <em>Sifu</em>, <em>Borderlands 3</em>, <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, <em>Little Nightmares II</em>, and the <em>Dead Space</em> remake, just to name a few. At the same time, we’ve gotten fewer and fewer high-profile day-one PS Plus releases.<em> Animal Well</em> was a GOTY contender but <em>Foamstars </em>and <em>Quidditch Champions</em> were both duds. Still, the cumulative library competes with the best of what Extra has and offers a great way to catch up on many of the best games of recent years. </p><h2 id="h774054"><a id=""></a>The Games</h2><p>Sony’s impressive first-party studios mostly took a backseat in 2024 with two important exceptions:<em> Astro Bot</em> and <em>Concord</em>. The first, from Asobo Studio, married the whimsy and creativity Sony’s Japan Studio was once synonymous with to the high bar of quality and production values showcased by the company’s more recent big-budget blockbusters. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em> was announced</a></span> in May and won best game at The Game Awards 2024 just seven months later. It’s a top-tier action platformer that also shows how the DualSense controller’s haptic gimmicks can transform the feel of otherwise familiar gameplay. Coupled <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761">with<em> Lego Horizon Adventures</em></a></span>, Sony demonstrated a new family-friendly range outside of the grim, violent prestige games that have defined its brand in years prior. </p><p><em>Concord</em>, meanwhile, was an Icarus moment for Sony’s first-party live service initiative. The hero shooter from Firewalk Studios had a development budget of over $200 million, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">sources told <em>Kotaku</em> earlier this year</a></span>, which culminated in a fine but forgettable multiplayer experience which failed to attract players so spectacularly at launch that Sony yanked the plug less than two weeks later with full refunds and a complete server shutdown. The company closed the studio it had purchased only the year prior and promised to incorporate the learnings from the debacle into its ongoing strategy.</p><figure id="" data-id="2336bbdc45cc5f6cf74715a3290bad46" data-recommend-id="image://2336bbdc45cc5f6cf74715a3290bad46" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro Bot waves at Christmas.

It all comes as the larger game industry grapples with high costs and delayed development timelines in a release climate that’s more competitive than ever. </p><p>Yet where<em> Concord </em>crashed, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em> soared</a></span>. Arrowhead Game Studios’ squad-based, ragdoll-physics alien shooter is one of the bestselling games of the year, especially on PC. Despite controversies around the required PSN login on Steam, nerfs to fan-favorite builds and battle pass gear, and a mid-year slowdown in new content, the game has delivered a fascinating, evolving storyline like a sci-fi <em>D&amp;D </em>campaign made up of millions of players, all while continuing to push out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355">regular new updates</a></span>.

The mix of action adventure, open world, RPG, and survival horror went a long way to rounding out an otherwise sparser release calendar compared to the post-covid high-water mark set by 2023. Xbox’s multiplatform strategy also saw critically acclaimed hits like <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>and <em>Pentiment </em>arrive on PS5 alongside multiplayer juggernaut<em> Sea of Thieves</em> and the open-world survival sim <em>Grounded</em>. and the biggest 2024 game that wasn’t available on PS5, <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, will still arrive their early next year.</p><p>The PS5 might be heading into the latter stage of its lifecycle, but it feels like the best years are still in front of it.

Fans are also still waiting on reveals for Santa Monica’s new not-<em>God of War</em> project, and leaks suggest Bend Studio will offer Sony’s next risky experiment in live-service gaming. Plus a multiplayer <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> game could be arriving as early as next year, and Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em> has been dark for a while as well. </p><p>Sony recently promised at least one new single-player blockbuster every year. 2024 didn’t have one, and it still turned out to be a great year for the platform. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Now that we are mere days from 2025, GTA 6 is starting to materialize as the proverbial elephant in the room, something that nobody in the gaming industry will be able to ignore one way or the other when <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it ships next Fall</a>.</p>
<p>Rockstar owner Take-Two is certainly eager to repeat the success of Grand Theft Auto 5, which became the second best-selling game of all time after Minecraft with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 200 million units sold</a>. CEO Strauss Zelnick recently spoke a bit about the next Grand Theft Auto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R09uNAeQNdg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a video interview with Conner Mather</a>, hyping it up with a single sentence:</p>
<p><em>I would say I think it'll be extraordinary and worth waiting for.</em></p>
<p>Later in the chat, Zelnick spoke in more general terms about the GTA community's feedback, and he seemed to hint that Rockstar has prepared features and content the fans might not even have dreamed of for GTA 6.</p>
<p><em>We definitely listen to feedback from our fans, absolutely. You need to, in our business, and you're able to. But remember, the biggest hits are always the ones that are unexpected. Everything that we do has to be new and different, not derivative. So, by definition when people are commenting on something that is in the market, that means they're looking at something that was done before. Our teams are focused on what's new that you haven't even thought about, like, you thought you were anticipating this thing, but this is way bigger and way better and more exciting and more beautiful than you could have possibly thought of.</em></p>
<p>Looking back at GTA 5 and GTA Online (which just got <a href="https://wccftech.com/festive-events-make-a-return-to-gta-online-through-january-1-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an update for the Holidays</a>), Zelnick revealed that Take-Two never thought the game would sell this much or that the Online mode would get more popular. In fact, it wasn't even going to have a virtual currency in the original plans.</p>
<p><em>I don't think any of us did. I think that we saw it as a really interesting add-on to the title. We actually originally had not planned to have virtual currency in the game, so it wasn't going to be an economic driver. It was relatively late in the day when we decided to pursue virtual currency because it was so long ago - we're looking back to 2013. And it wasn't an immediate success. You may recall it was pretty buggy at first. We had some trouble coming out of the gate because it was all new, and we were innovating; we were doing it all in real-time.&nbsp;It was like building a plane while you're taking off and then flying. It is an incredible, durable success and it continues to to perform many, many years later. It's astonishing and no, I don't think any of us expected that, but we also didn't expect to sell 205 million units. We never expected that. That was way outside of the realm of anything we contemplated.</em></p>
