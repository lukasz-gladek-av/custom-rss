            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-godzilla-dlc-coming-next-week<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The fishing and deep sea exploration hit <em>Dave the Diver</em> is adding one more wonder to its ocean next week, as Godzilla DLC will be joining the game, albeit with a caveat.</p>
<p>The <em>Dave the Diver</em> Godzilla DLC will be completely free to players on all platforms, much like the <em>Dredge</em> crossover of last year, which came not long before Nexon announced that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-sales-3-million" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Dave the Diver Sales Break the 3 Million Barrier"><em>Dave the Diver</em> had crossed 3 million sales</a>. If it's like that you'll need to download it separately to add to the game, making this an optional addition to the game for players who want it.</p>
<p>Beyond the king of the monsters himself, several other parts of the <em>Godzilla</em> franchise will be making their way here, as the G-Force is tracking the injured Godzilla, who will see Dave in the depths of the Blue Hole.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dave-the-diver-godzilla.jpg?itok=-eIGMUen 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dave-the-diver-godzilla.jpg?itok=o0nGsXqE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maybe Godzilla won't be spending all of its time beneath the waves...</figcaption></figure><p>Beyond G-Force and Godzilla, another Kaiju will be making its appearance in <em>Dave the Diver</em> as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/16/dave-the-diver-free-godzilla-dlc-arrives-may-23/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Dave the Diver: free Godzilla DLC arrives May 23">part of the DLC</a>. During the DLC, Dave will be evading pursuit from Ebirah, a sea Kaiju who was featured in the 1966 movie <em>Ebirah, Horror of the Deep</em>.</p>
<p>Finding his trusty harpoon unable to stop Ebirah, Dave will use the G-Force submarine to battle the seabound Kaiju and penetrate its shell. As for what Godzilla will be doing during all this? That is left as a mystery for now, but it's possible he might ally with you against the destructive Kaiju as he has in some of his cinematic appearances.</p>
<h2>When is the Dave the Diver Godzilla DLC releasing?</h2>
<p>The <em>Dave the Diver</em> Godzilla DLC will be released on May 23 for free on PC, PlayStation 4 &amp; 5, and Nintendo Switch. The DLC will only be here for a limited time, so make sure to grab it before it goes away on November 23, as Toho sends it to the depths of removed content. If you are wanting to serve Kaiju sushi, this will be the time to get on board and take action.</p>
<p>For players who are interested in <em>Dave the Diver</em> but haven't picked up the game by Mintrocket, it is currently available as part of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-confirmed-playstation-plus-april-2024-games" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" All Confirmed PlayStation Plus April 2024 Games">April PlayStation Plus Extra</a> lineup. Otherwise, you're looking at its normal retail price, and it generally hasn't gone on deep discounts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-inquisition-game-of-the-year-edition-is-now-free-to-grab-on-epic-games-store/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starting today through next Thursday, the Epic Games Store is offering a free digital copy of <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dragon-age-inquisition-game-of-the-year-edition-2f0cbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: Inquisition Game of the Year Edition</a>. This version of BioWare's RPG includes all the post-launch DLCs: Jaws of Hakkon, The Descent, and Trespasser. The last two, in particular, are absolutely vital to fully understanding the storyline, which is expected to continue in the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: Inquisition is the third installment in the RPG franchise. It was the first BioWare game to utilize the Frostbite engine when it launched in November 2014. The game earned widespread acclaim, winning over 130 Game of the Year awards and becoming BioWare's most successful release in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>While this isn't the first time the game has been given away (it already happened <a href="https://wccftech.com/prime-gaming-november-drops-include-control-ultimate-edition-dragon-age-inquisition-and-rise-of-the-tomb-raider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in October 2021 via Amazon's Prime Gaming</a>), the timing of this new promotion is fairly obvious: EA and BioWare are enticing any potential users who still haven't checked out the game to do so ahead of the long-awaited gameplay reveal of the next installment, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, which will happen at some point next month during Summer Game Fest. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-has-everyone-at-bioware-really-happy-with-how-it-turned-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last rumors</a> suggest that the game's launch will happen this year, and they also hint at a strong level of satisfaction regarding the level of quality.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON AGE™: INQUISITION Official Trailer – Game of the Year Edition" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2Qsvm_EtkA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dragon Age: Inquisition Game of the Year Edition is the first freebie of the latest <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store MEGA Sale</a>, which runs through June 13. The next game is still clouded in mystery, but in the meantime, users can enjoy substantial discounts on many big games. All eligible purchases (including in-game purchases) also provide 5% back as part of the Epic Rewards program.</p>
<p>By the way, the Epic Games Store is not the only place to get free PC games: Amplitude Studios is now giving away 2014's turn-based 4X fantasy-strategy game ENDLESS Legend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289130/ENDLESS_Legend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssd-deals-2024-silicon-power-2tb-2tb-ps5-compatible<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Amazon Prime member exclusive deal</h2></div><div><section><p>SSD prices are trending upwards for 2024, so it's much more difficult to find a PS5 compatible 2TB M.2 SSD for the same  low prices we saw last year. Even so, <strong>Amazon Prime members</strong> can pick up a <a href="https://zdcs.link/GdxoM" target="_blank">Silicon Power 2TB</a> PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 solid state drive (SSD) for only $109.99 shipped. This is one of the lowest prices we've seen this year for a PS5-compatible SSD.</p><h2>Silicon Power 2TB SSD (PS5-Compatible) for $109.99</h2><p><em><strong>Amazon Prime member exclusive deal</strong></em></p><div id="179170"><p><h3>Silicon Power 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD</h3></p><div><p>Amazon Prime members only</p></div></div><p>The Silicon Power 2TB meets all the requirements for your PS5 SSD upgrade. It supports transfer speeds of up to 7,000MB/s read and 6,500MB/s write which is well above the 5,500MB/s minimum threshold. However, it does not include a heatsink. Compatible <a href="https://zdcs.link/6YE8Z" target="_blank">heatsinks starts at $7</a> and they are very easy to install yourself.</p><p>The PS5 is an outstanding  gaming console, but the 1TB SSD is a real bottleneck. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, for example, can exceed 200GB alone. NBA 2K23 weighs in at 150GB and even older games like God of War: Ragnarok and Horizon Forbidden West  require 90GB of space. Future games like Grand Theft Auto VI will undoubtedly demand even more space.</p><p>If you have a gaming PC, this SSD would make a great boot drive. There are faster drives out there, but for OS and general app performance, you won't notice any real world performance difference compared to this drive, which is already very, very fast. The capacity is also ideal. For most people, a 2TB SSD should be enough to cover your OS, apps, and games. A 4TB would be even better, but it would <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ay34j" target="_blank">run you over $200</a>. Instead, put all of your other files on a bigger, cheaper, traditional hard drive and you're set.</p><h2>A 2TB PS5 SSD with preinstalled heatsink costs $129.99</h2><div id="180988"><p><h3>Adata Legend 960 Max 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD (up to 7400MBps) with Heatsink</h3></p><div><p>Amazon Prime members only</p></div></div><p>Installing your own heatsink is very, very easy. However, if you don't want to get your hands dirty, there's an A-Data Legend 960 Max 2TB SSD that's currently on sale for Amazon Prime memberes for $129.99. It has a robust aluminum heatsink pre-installed and it's definitely fast enough for your PS5 console.</p><p>If you want more options, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssd">best SSDs of 2024</a>.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 16, 2024 5:55 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, some of that feedback has been put to use in the game's first patch, and there are still more adjustments on their way.</p><p>Today, Supergiant Games released the first Early Access patch for Hades II, which includes substantial changes to player movement, encounters, and level design as well as a handful of bug fixes. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072263852699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The patch notes</a> are available on Steam.</p><p>"Here's our first patch in <strong>Early Access</strong>!! We're very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes." the patch notes read.</p><p>Most notably, the patch makes sprinting faster, dashing out of attack recovery animations more reliable, and gathering easier (now, players can get resources from any resource point once they unlock the right Gathering Tool, and Tools can be prioritized to make its respective resources appear more often). The design of several areas has also been altered to make dashing and resource gathering easier.</p><p>It also fixes a few frustrating bugs, including certain Boons not working as expected and foes spawning out of bounds.</p><p>The patch is almost entirely inspired by players, with every item in the notes except for two spurred by community feedback. The patch notes also mention that the next patch will focus on balance changes and other adjustments based on feedback.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Hades 2 Early Access Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>First <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-ii-announced-at-the-game-awards">announced during the Game Awards in 2022</a>, Hades II had a short <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-technical-test-announced-how-to-join">technical test last month</a> before heading into <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-technical-test-to-wind-down-today-steam-early-access-release-date-relatively-soon-after">Early Access</a>.

<p>Shortly after Carpenter reported that, Phoenix Labs released the following <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1791161114538987820">statement</a>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today is an incredibly difficult day. After a long period of evaluating how to navigate our economic structure, we have had to significantly restructure the company to pave a path for a strong future. We are reorganizing Phoenix Labs to focus on our best-in-class live service titles, Dauntless and Fae Farm, and serving their communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This unfortunately means canceling work on all other projects at the studio, which will impact many of our colleagues immediately. We are giving notices to everyone whose roles are affected. This restructure has not come easily, and truly has been the last resort to ensure Phoenix Labs can survive, and thrive in the long term. It's impossible to put into words how deeply we value every talented individual who have contributed their hard work and passion to every project at our studio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are doing all we can to help our departing team members in this interim period and encourage any studios looking for incredible talent to speak with the one-of-a-kind people that have been a part of Phoenix Labs' journey."&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BF5C0KohZHI" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Phoenix Labs released its latest game, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/09/13/dauntless-developer-unveils-co-op-fantasy-life-sim-fae-farm">Fae Farm</a>, back in September, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/dauntless/a-prosaic-peak">Dauntless</a> before that in 2019.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/looks-like-the-kar98k-is-set-to-return-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=looks-like-the-kar98k-is-set-to-return-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/looks-like-the-kar98k-is-set-to-return-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4.873264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/looks-like-the-kar98k-is-set-to-return-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=looks-like-the-kar98k-is-set-to-return-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="196" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Rumors and leaks suggested that the KAR98k would be included in the <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> Season 4 update, but Raven Software may have finally confirmed it as part of a marketing campaign. </p> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">The <em>Warzone</em> devs sent 98 care packages to content creators ahead of Season 4. On Twitter, JGOD <a href="https://x.com/JGODYT/status/1791152147494731806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed</a> that the box had a letter K, a bolt-into-action label, and a car with 98 on its door, essentially confirming that the KAR98K will be in the new update. Based on the Season 3 Battle Pass, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-mw3-and-warzone-season-4-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a> will likely start on Wednesday, May 29.</p> <figure data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="602" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">Activision usually releases a blog post for <em>MW3 </em>and <em>Warzone</em> with initial details about the next update one week before a new season starts, so players should expect more news soon. In saying that, the Kar98k is already a noteworthy addition worth paying attention to. <em>Modern Warfare 3’s</em> iteration of <em>Warzone </em>improved one-shot sniping by removing the explosive ammunition requirement. Without needing to use the ammunition type that drastically decrease bullet velocity to get a one-shot kill, sniper rifles dominate the battle royale and are capable of taking out enemies from impressive ranges. </p>
 <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="484" data-injectable="false">During <em>Warzone</em> Pacific in 2021, the Kar98k was widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best, weapons to use on Caldera. If the bolt-action sniper rifle can one-shot kill enemies in Season 4, there’s no doubt that the Kar98k will be a must-use weapon. Because even though the MORS is arguably the best sniper rifle in <em>Warzone</em> right now, the KAR98k will have better mobility and aim-down sight speeds. It will all come down to how far away the new weapon can kill enemies. </p>

<p data-characters="399" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Monopoly GO’s</em> Robo Partners event debuted today, with opportunities for players to get wild stickers, an exclusive Penguin board token, and other useful rewards. Following the previous <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-releases-massive-dice-gift-to-apologize-for-partner-event-mishaps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade Partners event’s mishaps and dice gift</a>, Robo Partners looks promising on its first day, with no signs of past point tracking bugs and a sizable currency gift from Scopely to celebrate its launch.</p> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">Scopely’s Robo Partners gift, announced earlier today through official <a href="https://discord.gg/officialmonopolygo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media channels</a>, includes 1,000 batteries, the event’s currency you use to spin your robot’s points wheel to progress through its reward milestones. Anyone who logs on during the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-robo-partners-event-rewards-and-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robo Partners event</a>, including you and your partners, will receive this currency, allowing you to advance through the event without gaining batteries from other sources.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Monopoly GO Discord</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="792" data-injectable="true">Scopely’s May 16 announcement doesn’t dive into why 1,000 batteries were released for this particular event outside of helping you get started. It also doesn’t require you to answer trivia questions or win a giveaway; you can enter <em>Monopoly GO</em> immediately and find your reward as a pop-up message, even as a newer player. Although some community members reported slight delays with receiving the gift, there are no requirements for claiming the Robo Partners event currency.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">While 1,000 batteries isn’t quite enough to complete one of your four partner robots, it can help you progress through the beginning reward tiers, potentially pushing you into later milestone levels if you’re lucky. You can also combine these with tokens you get from any ongoing banner events and tournaments to gain extra points wheel spins or raise your multipliers.</p>
 <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">It’s&nbsp;currently unknown whether there’ll be any follow-up announcements regarding this partner event or its rewards.&nbsp;However, with the point tracking bug fixed during the last Partners event,&nbsp;you can&nbsp;use them as soon as you claim them. </p>

It’s a less impressive upgrade over its predecessor than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review">well-reviewed iPad Pro</a>, however, and the original still holds up well if you just need a solid tablet that should continue to receive most new iPadOS features for the foreseeable future. You’d get considerable savings, too, as the base <strong>M1 iPad Air</strong> with 64GB of storage is down to $399 ($200 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3HN1KC?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com">Walmart</a>, a new all-time-low price that beats the previous record by a full $100. The 256GB M1 iPad Air also has a new price record of $599 ($150 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3H386P?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> in select colors.</p><p>It’s possible Apple or its retail partners will keep the 2022 Air around as a value buy, so maybe this steep discount reflects a pending permanent price cut. Whatever the case, $399 is a fantastic price for the tablet. Compared to the refresh that launched just yesterday, it’s really only missing out on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24146454/apple-pencil-pro-ipad-stylus-price-availability-features">Apple Pencil Pro</a> support, the M2-exclusive Apple Pencil hover feature, and Wi-Fi 6E (but Wi-Fi 6 is still good).

However, some players have had difficulty adjusting to protagonist Melinoë’s dash, as well as her ability to sprint. Luckily for those folks, Supergiant Games is already on it and <em>Hades 2</em>’s first patch is addressing speed first and foremost.</p><div data-video-id="196539" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Innovative Hades-Like Feels Built For Speedrunners" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="278" data-playlist="196539,196848,195891" data-current="196539"><div><p>This Innovative Hades-Like Feels Built For Speedrunners</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22094.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>As of today’s patch, Melinoë’s sprint (which did feel a little too slow) has been sped up to make her “innately faster.” Her sprint is also much more responsive, since some players found it a little difficult to turn while they were running, which I’m sure became a pain in the ass in some late-game areas that are positively swarming with things trying to kill you.<br></p><p>Melinoë’s dash has also been ever so slightly tweaked so that players can dash out of recovery animations faster. It isn’t that she would necessarily get stunlocked by damage, but I did find she was a bit too slow to dash away from enemies after being struck. Now, she should have the same urgency I have as I slam on the dodge button so as to not lose one of my death defiances on an otherwise phenomenal run of the game.<br></p><p>Melinoë’s dash in <em>Hades 2</em> has been a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1cm8jc5/melino%C3%AB_taking_her_sweet_time_after_i_press_x/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1cm8jc5/melino%C3%AB_taking_her_sweet_time_after_i_press_x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">little controversial</a></span> since it is markedly slower than Zagreus’ from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803">the first game</a></span>. Her dash leaves a trail that she must recover before she can dash again, which is a pretty drastic change from Zagreus, who was able to dash again pretty instantaneously. He was even able to collect boons that granted him multiple extra dashes before he tired. While I wouldn’t mind seeing Supergiant tweak Melinoë’s kit, I think this difference especially makes them unique characters that promote different playstyles. I’d hate to see Melinoë’s footprint stamped out of the game because of the studio’s responsiveness to feedback.<br></p><p>Speaking of faster, <em>Hades 2</em>’s first patch is also speeding up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-to-get-bronze-hades-2-fishing-rod-1851465960&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-get-bronze-hades-2-fishing-rod-1851465960">resource gathering</a></span>. The sequel introduces crafting and multiple different gathering tools that must be unlocked in order to obtain the resources to craft what the game refers to as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-incantations-unlock-first-tips-1851461926&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-incantations-unlock-first-tips-1851461926">incantations</a></span>, which often amplify Melinoë’s abilities and add mechanics and features, like farming. However, you can only use one resource gathering tool at a time, meaning you have to pick if you are prioritizing plants, fishes, ores, or other materials for each run. In my experience, a good run culminating in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diabolical showdown against Chronos</a></span> at the very end could take about 40-50 minutes, meaning that’s a hefty chunk of time to not be gathering other materials.<br></p><p>Now, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hades 2</em></a></span><em> </em>players will be able to collect from <em>any</em> resource point that they find during a run so long as they have the associated gathering tool unlocked. So if you’ve unlocked the spade or the pickaxe, you don’t need to have them equipped to dig up seeds or mine ore, respectively. Toggling a specific gathering tool will allow you to gain as much from the resource points as you could prior to this patch, while “resources for tools you do not prioritize will appear far less often,” according to the patch notes.<br></p><p>Elsewhere, Supergiant has issued tiny (but consequential) fixes, like showing your currency when you’re at a Well of Charon, or repeating the tutorial for Grasp upgrades at the Altar of Ashes. Anecdotally, a friend of mine made it to the third region of the game without upgrading their Grasp to have more passive buffs because they just didn’t know how to do it. If you’ve been there, you know that region is hard as hell even <em>with </em>upgrades, and players have reported that the game does a poor job of explaining the system. As of this patch, more players will hopefully know how to upgrade their Grasp and get beefed up for their fight with Chronos.<br></p><p>For the entirety of the patch notes, which are mostly directed at feedback the team’s received since launch, check them out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072263852699&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072263852699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>. Supergiant mentions that with this first patch out of the way, it’ll be working on balance changes next, which tells me that I better fit in a win soon before the team nerfs my favorite boons/builds.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>New details have emerged about Valve’s new game in development, including that it will officially be called Deadlock. During it’s development at Valve, the game had been known as Neon Prime and Citadel.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791110448114188557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabe Follower on Twitter</a>, there is a lot of new information about the game. </p>



<p>Deadlock will reportedly be a 6 vs 6 third-person hero shooter. The game will feature a large map with four lanes to attack that have tower defense mechanics as well as various items and abilities to utilize. Gabe Follower adds that Deadlock will have a fantasy setting “mixed with steampunk. Magicians, weird creatures and robots.”</p>



<p>Lastly, they say that the game will feature fast travel using floating rails “similar to Bioshock Infinite”.</p>



<p>As of publishing, this information has yet to be confirmed by Valve nor has it been independently verified by Insider Gaming. Because of that, take all information on Deadlock, including the name, with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Valve for comment. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>

Here we'll explain how you can unlock the "Sally" weapon blueprint for the 9mm Daemon.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The Sally weapon blueprint explained</h2><p dir="ltr">The Sally weapon blueprint is an akimbo version of the 9mm Daemon pistol, and the cosmetic is skinned to look like the iconic pistols from the cover of 2010's Call of Duty: Black Ops. In Black Ops 1's Zombies mode, the M1911 starter pistol could also be Pack-a-Punched to become the powerful "Mustang and Sally" akimbo variant.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch has <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1790842985929744580">tweeted a response</a> to a player's mention of Warzone's secret weapon blueprint, so it is very likely a purposeful tease of their upcoming title.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to get the Sally weapon blueprint</h2><p dir="ltr">To unlock the Sally blueprint, you'll need to find the 9mm Daemon in a match of Warzone and get a kill with the gun. <strong>Getting your first kill with the pistol</strong> will complete the secret challenge called "She Never Lets Me Down," and the blueprint will be available for use in both MW3 and Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">This will only unlock the Sally blueprint for whoever picks it up and gets a kill with it, but after you or a teammate unlocks the weapon, it can then be dropped mid-match for any remaining teammates to try and unlock the blueprint for themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">The 9mm Daemon is <strong>very rare </strong>ground loot that can reportedly be found across various modes in standard battle royale and Resurgence. <strong>This gun can be found as loot on the ground or scavenged from supply boxes.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Some players claim that the spawn rates are better in Warzone's Fully Loaded LTM for Rebirth Island, but there don't seem to be any guaranteed spawn locations for the 9mm Daemon.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Warzone, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-how-to-do-rebirth-islands-champions-quest-nuke-challenge/1100-6522448/">full guide for completing Rebirth Island's Champion's Quest</a> nuke challenge.

<p data-characters="316" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Activision has <a href="https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-announces-new-studio-elsewhere-entertainment-all-new-franchise-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced on its blog</a> today that it is forming Elsewhere Entertainment, a new studio that will focus on a new narrative-based “genre-defining” AAA franchise. We don’t know what that franchise will be, nor what genre it will be defining, but we do know it will be headquartered in Warsaw, Poland.</p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">Activision states that the developer will be “built from the ground up” and will establish “an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas.” The team will consist of “storytelling experts” who have worked on such franchises as “<em>The Last of Us</em>, <em>Uncharted</em>, <em>The Witcher</em>, <em>Cyberpunk</em>, <em>Destiny</em>, <em>Tom Clancy’s The Division</em>, and <em>Far Cry</em>.” That’s a lot of storytelling experts.</p> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true">It’s hard not to be cynical about a studio established by a company whose parent <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just shut down a handful of talented studios</a>. It sounds like, “Why are you buying a Mercedes when you just defaulted on your last car loan?”</p>
 <p data-characters="178" data-current-count="178" data-injectable="false">“Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry,” the release says. Yeah, I think you might know a few people who are now looking for work.</p> <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">I know that it’s never quite that simple, but it just seems really galling for Activision to trumpet its founding of a AAA studio so soon while Microsoft keeps <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-lays-off-1900-employees-from-activision-blizzard-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making huge cuts</a> across its subsidiaries.</p> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="false">Hopefully, Elsewhere Entertainment will do well. I don’t know what “narrative-based” means to an executive and “genre-defining” is nothing but PR speak, but at least I don’t see the words “live service.”</p>

<p data-characters="235" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Pugstorm and Fireshine Games have announced the official launch date for <em>Core Keeper</em> 1.0 and all console ports. The developer and publisher have confirmed the game will finally leave Steam Early Access and hit consoles simultaneously. </p> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/top-games-like-stardew-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cozy sandbox adventure game</a> <em>Core Keeper</em> will leave early access on PC and launch on PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>August 27, 2024</strong>. After initially releasing in March 2022, the game has been on a long Early Access road to get to this point, with new biomes, mechanics, and bosses added each step of the way. The complete package that forms the final game later this year will contain everything the developer has added and worked on with its community.</p>
 <h2 id="h-core-keeper-s-1-0-and-console-release-will-get-a-final-content-trailer-next-month" data-injectable="false"><em>Core Keeper</em>‘s 1.0 and console release will get a final content trailer next month</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Core Keeper - Console &amp; PC 1.0 Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ga6q6vUluzE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="513" data-current-count="813" data-injectable="true">Since its initial launch on PC in Steam Early Access, <em>Core Keeper</em> has grown with new features, biomes, items, and more in every update. Senior Brand Manager for Fireshine Games Vincent Coates said in a press release with this announcement, “It’s been amazing to see over 2 million players discover the charm, mystery and fun of <em>Core Keeper</em> throughout the game’s time during Steam Early Access, and we can’t wait for even more to discover everything it has to offer with the full launch.”</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">The final trailer for the 1.0 and console launch will be released in June. This will be the biggest launch for the game since its Early Access debut, so there might even be a few surprises lumped in with the new versions to show off when the video debuts</p> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">I’ve been playing <em>Core Keeper</em> since its Early Access launch and have thoroughly enjoyed how each update has added more depth to the game, instead of just tacking on a new area with the same tired mechanics. It’s an intriguing title because it forces you to tentatively explore a very alien world underground where you must defeat colossal monsters in order to escape.</p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">I’ll never forget the first time I found Ghorm the Devourer, a giant worm that travels in a wide circle around the map, and how I managed to kill it with traps, bombs, and a lot of luck. Each boss defeated opens up a new part of the world and a way to expand your base, the plants you farm, your armor and weapon sets, and the strange magics of this world. </p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="false">I’ve been longing to play<em> Core Keeper</em> on PS5 for ages. It’s a game I’ve already sunk dozens of hours into and can’t wait to play again, exploring every biome, unlocking every merchant, and building up an arsenal of cheeky weapons to hopefully take down every boss I can.</p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When Nightdive Studios announced that they’d be remastering <em>PO’ed</em>, I <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/im-the-fool-nightdives-poed-definitive-edition-is-actually-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thought they were joking</a>. It was April 1st, and they posted a trailer that starts off rather deceptively. But here it is. I’m not sure I really wanted to play <em>PO’ed</em>, but now I’ve played all of it.</p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true"><em>PO’ed</em> was initially released in 1995 on the doomed 3DO Interactive Multiplayer before getting a 1996 port on PlayStation. The first-person shooter genre was still in its infancy, and while these early years resulted in classics like <em>Doom, Quake, </em>and <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, it’s also a graveyard for countless others that are now largely forgotten. If it isn’t obvious, <em>PO’ed </em>belongs in the latter category.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">I hadn’t played it before. There was a copy in one of those early-PS1 cardboard longboxes in the basement of the game store I briefly ran, and I didn’t touch it. There was probably a reason it was in the basement (my guess is disc rot), and I wasn’t <em>that</em> curious. However, reviews at the time of its release weren’t <em>terrible</em>. Though, they probably should have been.</p> <figure data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>

Notably, using the SlaveDriver Engine, it was much better at 3D environments, even though they were incredibly basic. It’s also a lot weirder with the default weapon being a frying pan, a chef protagonist, and walking butts for enemies.</p>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">The story involves Ox, the protagonist, being stranded out in the furthest reaches of space where the locals are hostile. There isn’t much storytelling within the game itself, so it’s not too far off from many FPS games at the time, right down to the abstract environments.</p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">But the level design is a lot different than much of what you’d see at the time. Environments are often huge, open areas. Much of the time, you get around with the help of a jetpack. It’s actually rather impressive, since corridors were the main locale for a lot of ‘90s gunfights. Nevermind that a lot of the surfaces are just flat-shaded, at least we aren’t looking at dirty walls.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="PO'ed: Definitive Edition Announcement Trailer | Nightdive Studios" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nLgTVr_JcA?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true">Having large environments meant that the developers were delving into some unexplored territory, and while I’d argue that there’s a decent amount of talent on display in <em>PO’ed</em>, it doesn’t really coalesce in an enjoyable way.</p>
 <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true">The goal of every level is to simply find the teleporter out of it, but they needed to make that a challenge <em>somehow</em>. Often, this means that you’re scouring through maze-like environments looking for the damned thing, but then there are others where the goal is not so clear. Sometimes you have to kill all the enemies in the area, and other times you need to activate a series of switches to make it through.</p>
 <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">The maze-like environments are bad enough. As I said, a lot of the textures are just flat colors. This can get extremely disorienting, especially when you add <em>PO’ed’s </em>penchant for verticality. I never really got stuck, but I think that was largely just luck. However, I was often uncomfortable, and regularly very confused. Sometimes I would trip over the teleporter’s location within moments of starting a level and of the game’s three secret levels, I found two of them by complete mistake.</p>
 <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="214" data-injectable="false">I didn’t <em>want</em> to find these secret levels. The normal levels were painful enough, that I didn’t want to extend it any further. They were the first warm teleporters I found to cuddle up to, and they betrayed me.</p> <figure data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">I found myself comparing <em>PO’ed</em> to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/william-shatners-tekwar-is-the-technological-future-of-crap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">William Shatner’s TekWar</a></em> for much of the game’s runtime. <em>TekWar</em> also liked to experiment with open environments. But most starkly, they both have the same approach to difficulty balancing.</p> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">Since many of the levels are large, open areas, this can mean a lot of enemies are constantly shooting at you from all directions. The worst are any sort of flying foe, because they are extremely difficult to hit on medium settings. Even if you stay mobile and fly around with your jetpack, you’re going to take a lot of hits. There’s not much choice to it, damage will happen.</p>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">So, to offset this, <em>PO’ed </em>gives you a massive health bar and dumps healing items in stacks all over the place. In order to make later levels more difficult, they just reduce how many stacks of health kits they provide. I mean, that works, it’s just the least well-thought-out and elegant way to do it. It also means that the screen flashes a lot and your dude keeps grunting. It’s not a very fun experience.</p>
 <p data-characters="177" data-current-count="177" data-injectable="false">Speaking of sounds, there’s barely any music. I had to check to make sure it wasn’t just a bug that prevented music from playing during levels, but there really isn’t any.</p> <figure data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="263" data-injectable="false">The <em>Definitive Edition</em> is inarguably the best way to experience <em>PO’ed</em>. Its transition to the KEX Engine means it’s capable of higher resolutions and interpolation to smooth out movement. It also means mouse-look, which wasn’t possible on the 3DO or PS1.</p> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">Nightdive did a decent job of upgrading <em>PO’ed</em>. They didn’t go all the way with it like they did with some previous titles. I asked Director of Business Development Larry Kuperman if they updated the art in any way. “Yes, to the art,” he said. “Tweaked more than redone.” He also said, “Not sure I want to compare what we did for <em>PO’ed</em> to anything close to <em>Dark Forces</em>, Zoey.”</p>
 <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true">So, in comparison to the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-star-wars-dark-forces-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Dark Forces</a></em> remaster, it’s not quite as overhauled. Enemy sprites are still low-resolution mashes of pixels. There weren’t really any cutscenes to redo, either. It’s largely “just” a source port, but it still does wonders for the game. But considering that <em>PO’ed</em> isn’t a guaranteed seller like a game with the <em>Star Wars </em>name on it, it’s not surprising they didn’t give it a complete facelift.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">The best thing I can say about <em>PO’ed</em> is that it can be completed in around three hours. Aside from that, I really didn’t enjoy it. It’s not the worst FPS I’ve played. For all its problems, it at least isn’t bland. It has its high points, demonstrates a capable development team with a willingness to experiment, it just didn’t result in a fun final product.</p>
 <p data-characters="518" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">I also must commend Nightdive Studios for having the guts to remaster a game that can’t even claim a cult following. <em>PO’ed</em> isn’t notoriously bad, but it would probably be better if it was. I’m not sure I’ve ever heard it come up in conversation. I might never have played it had it not been for Nightdive, and for that, I’m grateful in a very strange way. Even if a game is obscure or outright bad, I always love seeing them get dusted off and restored to working order. I just never want to play it again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/stardew-valley-concernedape-haunted-chocolatier-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The lights temporarily brighten on the stage of The Town Hall, a historic New York City venue, and a crowd of over 1,000 people hushes into anticipatory silence. The conductor of the orchestra has just announced that a special guest is in the building. Moments later, <em>Stardew Valley</em> creator Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone, clad in dark slacks, a yellow shirt, and a plain jacket, takes the stage. The audience goes absolutely bananas. You’d be forgiven for thinking, even after taking in nearly an hour of beautifully-performed music, that the <em>real </em>rockstar has finally arrived.</p><p>This was the scene earlier this year at the New York City stop of Stardew Valley: Festival of Seasons, a worldwide tour featuring orchestral renditions of <em>Stardew Valley</em> songs. Originally released in 2016, <em>Stardew Valley</em> is no longer just a game. It’s an institution, a cozy-game genre progenitor that continues to grow via both community efforts and official updates from Barone, who – despite embarking on a new project in <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a> – cannot bear to part with it. It’s also more than just a game. There’s now <em>Stardew Valley</em> merchandise, the aforementioned tour, a board game, and as of this week, <a href="https://stardewvalleycookbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an official cookbook</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Though <em>Stardew Valley</em> did not invent the farming genre – and obviously took a lot of inspiration from <em>Harvest Moon</em> – it certainly triggered the avalanche of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar farming games that followed</a>. On top of that, numerous games have farming and other life sim elements in them now, regardless of genre. <em>Palworld </em>and <em>Hades 2</em> immediately spring to mind, and that’s just from the past few months. <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s popularity, meanwhile, is enduring, with sales <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1762195335936627147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hitting the 30 million mark</a> in February just before the release of the rabidly-anticipated 1.6 patch in March.</p><figure><figcaption>Stardew Valley: Festival of Seasons</figcaption></figure><p>Barone, in turn, has become a singular figure in the world of video games. Once a (largely) solo developer kept afloat by his girlfriend and propelled forward by little more than an ambitious dream, he’s now the captain of a vastly larger and more recognizable ship than the one he started out in. He wrestles with this. On one hand, he appreciates all the praise. He recognizes that people have connected to <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s world and characters on a very deep level. That means everything to him.</p><p>"There's certain aspects to <em>Stardew Valley</em> now that are inextricable from the community that's formed around it,” Barone told Aftermath. “How everyone feels about all the different characters and the interpretations [of them]. … To be in the same room with all of these souls [at the concert], it's a special feeling. It's a reminder that my work does impact real people."</p><p>On the other hand, he doesn’t view himself as that big of a deal, even if fans do.</p><p>"I'm just a dude that made a game,” Barone said. “I was just making the game I wanted to play. What I would say is, I was tapping into a certain zeitgeist that I wasn't aware of, or conscious of, but I wasn't the only one who was feeling that way. We wanted to play games that were a little bit different. ... I think if I hadn't done it, someone else probably would have in a similar timeframe."&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>To be in the same room with all of these souls, it's a special feeling. It's a reminder that my work does impact real people.</p></blockquote></figure><p>On stage at The Town Hall, Barone ran through <a href="https://twitter.com/Vahn16/status/1763416421168533802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a joke-y version of his origin story</a>. He used to make music that nobody wanted to listen to, he said, but “after many years of failure, I finally discovered the secret: all I had to do was develop an entire video game from scratch, and then you guys would finally listen to my music.” The audience ate it up, laughing and cheering in response.</p><p>There was a kernel of truth to the bit, though. "I wanted to make music and somehow have a career making music,” he explained to Aftermath. “I would have been happy with any form that took, but when I was in high school, my original dream was to be in a band and go on tour and play shows. Little dingy venues – that would have been awesome. But I quickly realized that's not an easy thing to materialize. So then I shifted into electronic music, and I would have been happy if I could have been successful just online doing that. But that also didn't work out. So eventually, I finally got the music out by making a video game. I'm happy now because I still get to make music and have it be part of something that people are interested in and want to listen to."</p><figure><figcaption>Stardew Valley: Festival of Seasons</figcaption></figure><p>Now Barone has many more eyes on him than he ever would’ve amassed playing in a band, but it’s a different kind of fame. Barone does his best to entertain his followers inside the game and out – especially online, where he continues to personally keep them abreast of what’s coming next, something many developers who’ve sold even a fraction of 30 million copies would’ve handed off to somebody else by now. To him, entertaining is just part of the job, whether on stage or on Twitter.</p><p>"It's just yet another aspect of game development. I've always had kind of a scrappy 'If someone else can do it, why not me' type of approach," Barone said. "I kind of see myself as an entertainer. … I feel a pressure to have a presence because there's a million people who decided to follow me. I don't want to just do nothing, you know?”</p><p>But Barone’s hands-on approach to all aspects of <em>Stardew Valley </em>stems from far more than mere obligation. The game began as an extremely personal solo project, and even though it’s grown into a millions-selling multimedia behemoth, he still feels intimately connected to it.</p><p>“I feel responsible for any issues that people have, or if anyone doesn't enjoy the game or has a bad time,” he said. “It's not only with <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but anything related to <em>Stardew Valley</em>: the merchandise, the board game, the concert – anything like that. It's weird because <em>Stardew </em>has grown into something beyond me, but at the same time, I still feel very personally responsible for the brand and the concept of <em>Stardew Valley</em>."&nbsp;</p><p>This, in a way, is how the game’s 1.6 update came about. Barone now works with a team on <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s more technical aspects, and he wanted 1.6 to focus on technical tweaks and nothing more. But then he began to dread what fans might think if he didn’t go all out on yet another update. So he paused work on <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, his long-awaited but still mysterious second game, to return to <em>Stardew Valley</em>.</p><p>“It wasn't something that was necessarily planned,” Barone said. “I was like 'I can't just release a technical update, because if I say there's a new <em>Stardew Valley</em> update, and there's literally no new content, I feel like people will be disappointed.' So at first it was just the Desert Festival, but I have this problem where once I start, I can't stop. I'm thinking 'Oh, this isn't enough. It'd be really cool to add this. I would love to add this.'”</p><figure><blockquote><p>I feel responsible for any issues that people have, or if anyone doesn't enjoy the game or has a bad time. It's not only with <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but anything related to <em>Stardew Valley</em>: the merchandise, the board game, the concert – anything like that.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In these moments, Barone isn’t just motivated by a fear of letting down <em>Stardew</em>’s devoted legions. He’s also keenly aware of the impact the game has had on some players’ lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Once I reopen the book on <em>Stardew</em>, I always have a hard time closing it again because I always want to add more things, make it better, make it cooler, make people happy,” Barone said. “It's exciting. Every single thing I'm adding, I'm thinking about how people are going to play this and talk about it and love it. It's gonna be part of their experience. It could make a memory that they might cherish forever. That's a special thing. It's hard for me to not want to do that.”</p><p>That’s not to say Barone is trapped in an eternal, unchanging loop of returning to <em>Stardew Valley</em>. Version 1.6 was the first time he allowed somebody else to leave their fingerprints on the game’s content – its art, especially – and not just technical and programming elements. Barone added a longtime <em>Stardew Valley</em> modder who goes by the handle FlashShifter to the team <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/how-a-stolen-car-led-the-creator-of-mega-mod-stardew-valley-expanded-to-every-modders-dream-of-working-with-eric-barone-on-update-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the latter’s car was stolen</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"He had his car stolen, so he was in a bad situation,” said Barone. “He was like 'Hey, do you want to meet up and get lunch? I'd like to ask you something.’ He was wondering if I would take him on to do some work for <em>Stardew Valley</em>. At the time I was neck deep in working on 1.6 stuff, so I was like 'OK yeah, why not?' … He's studied <em>Stardew Valley</em>'s art style so his mod would seamlessly integrate and look like it fit in <em>Stardew Valley</em>'s world. I feel like he's one of the few people on Earth who really knows how to draw stuff in the exact <em>Stardew Valley</em> art style, which is kind of a specialized skill.”</p><figure><figcaption>FlashShifter</figcaption></figure><p>Barone is uncertain where he wants to go from here. For now he’s working on making sure that 1.6 is bug-free and available on as many platforms as possible, but afterwards he’ll have to make up his mind about a particularly bothersome fork in the road. There is of course the option to let <em>Stardew Valley</em> lie dormant while he completes version 1.0 of <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, but he also ended up assembling a “cool team” to get 1.6 across the finish line. Perhaps, he figures, they could keep expanding <em>Stardew Valley </em>in his absence. Well, within limits.&nbsp;</p><p>“It would probably be difficult, and it would probably inevitably mean that I would not focus on <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> because I would feel like I want to weigh in on and contribute to stuff,” he said of letting the team take the wheel on <em>Stardew Valley</em>. “I have some ideas for things that can be done for <em>Stardew Valley</em> that are less content creation and more technical in nature – more straightforward.”</p><p>Potential (though not set in stone) examples include additional maps for the game’s mines, a new farm type, or a new monster. “It's not like coming up with whole new characters and events and stuff like that,” Barone said. “That's the stuff I feel like I 100 percent have to be doing."&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I don't feel like I owe anyone anything when it comes to<em> Haunted Chocolatier</em>. It's a game that I'm deciding to make. I don't need to make it.</p></blockquote></figure><p>He does want to get back to <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, though – not because he feels like expectant fans are breathing down his neck, but because, as with <em>Stardew Valley</em>, this one’s personal.&nbsp;</p><p>"[Fan expectation] definitely puts pressure on me,” he said, “but it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time. When it's ready, that's when I'll release it. I'm not too concerned with the pressure. I don't feel like I owe anyone anything when it comes to<em> Haunted Chocolatier</em>. It's a game that I'm deciding to make. I don't need to make it."</p><p>At this point, Barone doesn’t really <em>need </em>to do anything. <em>Stardew Valley</em> has sold more copies than most developers – indie or triple-A – could ever hope. And while he’s living better than he was when <em>Stardew Valley</em> was just a sprout peeking out of the soil, he says he hasn’t done anything “extravagant.” That’s by design. Barone just wants to keep doing things the way he always has.</p><p>“Before making <em>Stardew Valley</em>, I spent all day hunched over the computer,” he said. “I still spend all day hunched over the computer. … My goal in life isn't about making money. I want to create things and share them with the world. That's what it's all about. That's what I'm doing. That's what I will do, regardless of any other circumstances, as long as I can financially support myself to be able to do that. If I couldn't, I would get a job and spend my free time creating stuff to try to get back to doing that."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/16/prison-architect-2-preview-incarcerating-the-third-dimension/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s something very different about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/prison-architect-2">Prison Architect 2</a> compared to the original, and I’m not just talking about the jump from 2D to 3D. This game’s whole conception and creation has charted a very different path when compared to the “Early Access before Early Access was a thing” release and public development of the first game. Developed by Double Eleven and now under the stewardship of Paradox Interactive, its creation and planned future will be much more like a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crusader-kings-3">Crusader Kings</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a>, with a base game to be followed by a steady chain of expansions and DLC.</p>
<p>Yet there’s suddenly some uncertainty floating around Prison Architect 2. Announced at the start of this year, it’s been delayed twice, and has now been revealed that Double Eleven has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/prison-architect-2-developer-double-eleven-breaks-up-with-paradox-interactive/">handed over continued development and support to Brazilian team Kokku</a>. To the backdrop of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/18/we-let-you-down-cities-skylines-2-dlc-being-refunded-amidst-player-dissatisfaction/">Cities: Skylines 2’s troubles</a>, that feels like cause for concern, but also for a little optimism –&nbsp;it’s not being forced out the door and the stated reason for the delays is to optimise the game further for lower-end hardware.</p>



<p>I’ve been able to sample the first handful of levels from the game’s career and… well, it’s Prison Architect, but translated into a full 3D game engine –&nbsp;the original had a kind of hacky 3D mode, but this has been designed from the ground up for it. Prison Architect 2 does a really good job of keeping the look and feel of the original game, thanks in large part to the character designs with their perfectly spherical heads, tubular bodies and Rayman hands. You can almost strip away that extra dimension by angling the camera to look straight down on your prison, which can help when laying out buildings, rooms and all the rest.</p>
<p>Something certainly very important for existing fans will be that Prison Architect 2 retains the same construction mechanics as the original. Walls still take up squares on the grid, so a 4×3 cell requires you to lay foundations with a 5×4 footprint, and you have to drag to create a four-sided room as opposed to building one wall at a time. Then, when creating rooms within a larger building still has placing walls and assigning a room’s role handled separately. A Two Point Hospital, for example, combines those two steps into one, which is more immediate, but doesn’t have the same ad hoc flexibility of Prison Architect.</p>

<p>While there is a dedicated tutorial, it almost feels redundant by the career’s opening, which gives you example prisons and hands out missions to complete fundamental tasks. For one prison it was to simply open up a new wing with another 10 prison cells, then it was to give staff a break room and laundry, to cut down on inmate violence through a mixture of building solitary cells and an infirmary, and then getting to the root of the matter by addressing inmate needs for socialising. Each level is wrapped up in a little bit of dialogue from the CEO, Warden, Guards or other characters, pitching the objective before letting you just get on with things, and then quipping as you complete them.</p>

<p>To be honest, you can barely call these scenarios, and as soon as you complete an objective you’re whipped straight back out to the career map –&nbsp;a city and the surrounding countryside –&nbsp;and can pick from the other missions currently available to you. However, what these early levels do provide is a great set of examples for how you might consider building your own prisons in the sandbox mode. One level had some really nice self-contained cell blocks with built in showers, common rooms and more, while others previewed the challenges of having a prison split across a road, or with no room to expand horizontally.</p>
<p>And so we come to what is probably the main appeal to the jump to 3D: multi-floor prisons. This just allows for so much more nuanced creativity in how you might want to lay out your prison, and it’s very straightforward to do. You can switch levels on the right side of the screen or with keyboard hotkeys, and then simply set out walls using the exact same construction tools as for the ground floor. Just make sure that you link floors with staircases, use vertical pipes and wiring to connect up the utilities, and you’re pretty much good to go. Heck, if you’re happy with a prison block layout, just select it, clone it, move up a level and drop it in place again. It’s (almost) exactly that easy!</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn’t have to be a building up there, and you could think of making gantries to overlook a yard, try to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">Panopticon prison</a>, and plenty more besides.</p>

<p>That said, I wish we had more time within these spaces to explore and learn from what Double Eleven has created. Most management sims would let you carry on after completing a scenario’s main objectives, or have the first few levels cover all of the basics, but the first five levels here barely touch upon how to really dig in and manage your prison. It’s through my own curiosity that I sought to grasp how you unlock more room types, more approaches to incarceration or rehabilitation, and the various views and info panels to see how things are running. Those will certainly feature in more career missions to come, but splitting things apart this much is a slightly atypical way of presenting this to players.</p>
<p>I will also say that, while Paradox has said on multiple occasions that Prison Architect 2 has builds certified for all platforms, it does still feel like it needs some refinement before release. I faced crashes upon level exit, some flakiness with item placement and interaction, and just some oddities with the build tools. They’re intuitive on the whole, but I do wish that rooftop items were automatically elevated if you build an additional floor on top, for example.</p>
<p>Still, for fans of the original, I think there’s plenty reason to be optimistic and look forward to this game. Between now and September, new developer Kokku will be refining, polishing and and really honing this game, but from what we’ve seen so far, this is undeniably Prison Architect… in 3D.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24157530/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-switch-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve probably spent more time in <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> jotting down notes and theories than I have actually playing the game. The latest release from Simogo — the Swedish studio behind eclectic titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/21/4013456/year-walk-iphone-ipad-vision-quest-game"><em>Year Walk</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/17/4844472/device-6-iphone-ipad-report"><em>Device 6</em></a> — is a mystery game that is absolutely dense with puzzles. The sheer scale of it is initially intimidating. Everything in the game is locked behind a door of some kind, and figuring out how to open them involves navigating a deluge of cryptic, strange, and often confusing clues. But once I gave myself over to the game’s logic, it all made a certain kind of sense. Eventually, it was all I could think about, and I have the notebook full of scribbled solutions to prove it.</p><p>There’s very little setup. You arrive at a seemingly abandoned hotel in the woods, prompted by a mysterious letter from a cult film director, and from there, well, you’ll have to figure it out yourself. There are some overt goals, like finding some missing script pages for the director, but mostly, the job is to solve puzzles to open up more of this monochrome world and thus learn more about what the hell is going on. The story and puzzles are tightly intertwined, so each solution usually comes with a fresh nugget of narrative. Those nuggets get increasingly weird, full of ghosts, murder, mazes, and obscure movies. And coffee. It’s sort of like if David Lynch designed an escape room.</p><p>It’s intimidating at first because <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>locks literally everything away. Once you get into the hotel grounds — which, naturally, involves figuring out the code for a padlock — virtually every part of the building is inaccessible, hidden behind some kind of puzzle to solve, which then leads to another puzzle. The first time I unlocked a door, I was so excited, only to discover the only thing inside was a locked safe.</p><div><p>It’s sort of like if David Lynch designed an escape room</p></div><p>Often, those puzzles seem to make no sense at all. It required some patience (and faith in the developers), but eventually, I was able to slowly start finding solutions, and each one brought a new insight. Here’s a small list of some of the things you’ll need to deal with to find answers in <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>: Roman numerals, the Greek alphabet, modern art, obscure (fictional) Italian movies, the phases of the Moon, PS1-era video games, and, unfortunately, basic math.</p><p>It all sounds like too much until you realize that every solution is somewhere inside the game itself. Once I came to the realization that <em>everything</em> was a clue, it all clicked into place. It’s still incredibly hard, but that “ah ha” moment made it clear that it was at least possible, which helped me push forward. If I couldn’t solve something, it was almost always because I didn’t have the right information yet. Thankfully, <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> gives you a lot of tools to find that information; the main character has a photographic memory, so you have a running list of every important document, image, and memory for future reference. Even still, I’d say a notebook is required for working out some of the more difficult solutions.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Annapurna Interactive</cite></p></div><p>There’s a remarkable cohesiveness to the game, where the various elements build on top of each other, and nothing is there by chance. Even the most obscure detail makes sense eventually. It’s hard to think of another game where every part seems to connect in such a natural way. The closest equivalent might be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/27/10841320/the-witness-review-ps4-pc"><em>The Witness</em></a>, but <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>links its story and gameplay on a deeper level and does so with an enviable amount of style and personality.</p><p>That shouldn’t be a surprise coming from the team behind the slick <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882183/sayonara-wild-hearts-interview-switch-ps4-apple-arcade-simogo"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a>. The studio’s new game has the dark undertone of noir but with visual influences ranging from classic video games to Saul Bass to Lynch. It’s also a surprisingly playful experience, full of delightful interactions; at a certain point, you can even mail-order playable cartridges for an in-universe Game Boy. It’s weird and unsettling and lovable, and it looks great doing it.</p><p><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>is also part of a truly incredible run of recent indie games, including the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance"><em>Hades II</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24147616/manor-lords-steam-early-access"><em>Manor Lords</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox"><em>Crow Country</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey"><em>Animal Well</em></a>. It’s a tough crowd to stand out in, but <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> does just that with its seamless blend of puzzles, style, and eerie worldbuilding. Just make sure you have a notebook handy.</p><p><small>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes<em> launches May 16th on the Nintendo Switch and Steam.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i%E2%80%99m-going-to-watch-the-moviepass-documentary-for-one-reason-only.873180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158282/moviepass-max-documentary-trailer-schadenfreude<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="WOb47Y">Max has released a trailer for its documentary <em>MoviePass, MovieCrash</em>, coming to the streaming service on May 29. And frankly, it looks awful. The trailer makes the film look like the worst kind of bubbly, hyperbolic TV news report, full of over-the-top voiceover, staccato sound bites, and sensationalist quotes, all trying to inject riffy, bouncy energy into a story that doesn’t need <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/style/jeuje-zhoosh-zhuzh.html">zhuzhing up</a>. The actual doc may be nothing like this; trailers are notoriously unreliable about reflecting what a movie is actually like. But either way, I don’t care. I’m all in, for one reason: I just want to see the faces of the people behind the story I followed with absolute nonstop disbelief for two full years of “Oh God, what <em>now</em>?” schadenfreude.</p>
<p id="nI7VsE">MoviePass was around for six years as a largely under-the-radar, somewhat pricey subscription service for movie tickets before analytics firm Helios and Matheson acquired it. In 2017, the revamped company introduced an unbeatable subscription service: Members could get unlimited movie tickets for about $10 a month. “How could this business model possibly work?” industry-watchers asked at the time. The answer: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872984/moviepass-shutdown-subscription-movies-helios-matheson-ted-farnsworth-explainer">It couldn’t</a>. Helios and Matheson lost hundreds of millions of dollars on the project, while visibly, awkwardly, and very publicly flailing to redefine the company’s intentions every few weeks.</p>
<p id="KlI5Bs">While all this was happening, I was the Movies Editor over at The Verge, and we reported on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/culture/2018/7/31/17634990/moviepass-theater-disrupting-film-subscription-service/archives/2">every new beat in the story</a> as it happened, because our readers loved knowing what new nonsense MoviePass was up to. What made the story so fascinating and engaging was how absolutely clear it was that Helios and Matheson did not know anything about the industry it was trying to disrupt, and how rapidly it kept changing the story about what MoviePass was intended to do.</p>
<p id="8GYDsN">The company clearly thought its subscriber base would give it leverage over the industry, and was willing to endure huge losses while it tried to figure out what to do with that leverage. One week, it was effectively trying to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/26/16936952/moviepass-amc-theatre-feud-movie-tickets-deceptive-earnings-statement">blackmail theater chains</a> into giving it discounts, or risk MoviePass diverting its subscribers to different chains. Similarly, it tried to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/2/17073386/moviepass-limited-access-red-sparrow-death-wish-amc-film-studio-negotiations">extort studios into paying it for advertising</a>, or risk the service blocking subscribers from buying tickets to those studios’ latest movies.</p>
<p id="OEizjy">At one point, the company boasted about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17083280/moviepass-location-based-user-tracking-data-privacy-app-policy-changes">the tracking data it was collecting on its subscribers</a> with the intention of selling that data to investors; after a backlash, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/13/17113872/moviepass-ceo-apologizes-open-letter-location-tracking-comments">abruptly walked that idea back</a>. Then MoviePass suddenly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/19/16909414/moviepass-ventures-distribute-movies-sundance">announced it would become a film distributor</a>. Meanwhile, it changed its pricing and the services it offered too many times to count, often with no notice for subscribers, who would suddenly find themselves opted into new plans, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17916256/moviepass-forcing-former-users-opt-out-new-plan-monthly-charge">even if they’d already left the service</a>. At its lowest point, the company sent out a cutesy email claiming it had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18073750/moviepass-staffed-by-dogs-director-of-barketing-chloe">hired a dog as its new marketing director</a>, and apologizing for the “ruff” time subscribers were having with the service. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17691022/moviepass-q2-earnings-report-operating-losses-shareholder-lawsuit">company’s shareholders sued</a>. The <a href="https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/moviepass-class-action-subscriber-1203126638/">subscribers did, too</a>.</p>
<p id="loI5h3">I don’t need to watch <em>MoviePass, MovieCrash</em> for a summary of all this — I lived it, and not that long ago. What I want is to see the people behind the debacle. Throughout the two-year barrage of frantic, nonstop news about MoviePass’ endless abrupt retoolings, the public face on every new debacle was CEO Mitch Lowe. But there were obviously so many more people battling for control behind the scenes, desperately trying to land on the solution that would turn the ship around. All I want from a MoviePass documentary is to know what it was like for everyone who wasn’t Lowe, who wasn’t in front of the cameras trying to justify how Helios and Matheson was hemorrhaging money, being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17991880/moviepass-fraud-investigation-attorney-general-new-york">investigated for fraud</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/moviepass-parent-company-helios-and-matheson-delisted-from-nasdaq-2019-2">watching its stock plummet 99 percent</a>. I just want to put faces to this wild, freewheeling disaster, at long last.</p>
<p id="7SgfVG">Here’s the official rundown on the film, from Warner Bros. Discovery and HBO Original:</p>
<blockquote><p id="jEBs2E">The HBO Original documentary MOVIEPASS, MOVIECRASH, directed by award-winning filmmaker Muta’Ali (HBO’s “Yusuf Hawkins: Storm Over Brooklyn”), debuts WEDNESDAY, MAY 29 at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT on HBO and will be available to stream on Max. In a span of eight years, MoviePass went from being the fastest growing subscription service since Spotify to total bankruptcy, losing over $150 million in 2017 alone. MOVIEPASS, MOVIECRASH chronicles the company’s beginnings as an innovative movie ticketing model beloved by cinema goers, exploring the visionary mission of its entrepreneur co-founders, its impressive early successes, and its precipitous downfall caused by mismanagement and corporate greed. </p></blockquote>

<p>Phoenix Labs, the studio behind Fae Farm and Dauntless, is laying off over 100 people. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1791158439684587999">Polygon’s Nicole Carpenter</a>, the studio announced the layoffs “over one big Zoom call”.</p>



<p>In a released statement, Phoenix Labs says that the decisions are being done as part of a reorganization of the company. This includes cancelling “all other projects” outside of Fae Farm and Dauntless.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Major layoffs at Fae Farm, Dauntless dev Phoenix Labs today. Two sources said over 100 people have been impacted. On LinkedIn, a former worker said all in development games have been cancelled, including one about to be announced. Devastating news — so sorry to those impacted. <a href="https://t.co/H4LLH6jY3C">pic.twitter.com/H4LLH6jY3C</a></p>— Nicole Carpenter (@sweetpotatoes) <a href="https://twitter.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1791158439684587999?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>“After a long period of evaluating how to navigate our economic environment, we have had to significantly restructure the company to pave a path for a strong future,” they said. “We are reorganizing Phoenix Labs to focus on our best-in-class live service titles, Dauntless and Fae Farm, and serving their communities.</p>



<p>“This unfortunately means canceling work on all other projects at the studio, which will impact many of our colleagues immediately. We are giving notices to everyone whose roles are affected. This restructure has not come easily, and truly has been the last resort to ensure Phoenix Labs can survive, and thrive in the long term.”</p>



<p>The studio says that it’s doing “all we can” to help those who are being let go from the company. It also  “encourage[s] any studios looking for incredible talent to speak with the one-of-a-kind people that have been a part of Phoenix Labs’ journey.”</p>



<p>Since the start of 2024, the gaming industry has seen roughly 10,000 people let go in some way. </p>

From the early days of Serious Sam and Hotline Miami, to more recent hits like Cult of the Lamb and Inscryption, the publisher has a track record of allowing small, creative teams to flourish.</p><p>To celebrate their 15th birthday, Devolver is hosting a huge sale on their entire catalog of games from May 16–23 on Steam. Since they’re turning 15, we figured it only made sense to showcase 15 lesser-known gems from their roster that you can get for super cheap during the sale:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ronin-ninja-platforming-with-a-gory-reward-pax-south-2015"><u><strong>Ronin</strong></u></a></h2><p><strong>On sale for: $2.59 (80% off)</strong></p><p>Released in 2015, Ronin is a turn-based action-stealth platformer created by Polish developer Tomasz Wacławek while he was working as a designer at Shadow Warrior studio Flying Wild Hog. Inspired by the likes of Gunpoint, Ronin is about a young girl determined to strike down five prominent figures of a powerful corporation, one at a time. Over its 15 missions, you carefully plot your movements to set up the perfect strike before retreating back into the shadows. Throw in a handful of ninja gadgets — including, of course, a trusty grappling hook — and Ronin is well worth its short and sharp playtime.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/okhlos-official-launch-trailer"><u><strong>Okhlos</strong></u></a><strong> </strong></h2><p><strong>On sale for: $2.59 (80% off)</strong></p><p>Greek mythology has always been ripe for satire, and 2016’s Okhlos joined in on the fun. Set in ancient Greece under the omnipotent rule of Olympian gods, you’re tasked with mobilising people tired of the abuse suffered at the hands of their rulers through philosophical teachings, convincing them to break free from the chains of Mount Olympus and establish an ochlocracy — literal mob rule. Going from city to city, players look to recruit warriors, peasants, slaves, and even livestock to topple the status quo through eight procedurally generated locations. As you progress, you can unlock special units or swap them for one of 100 legendary heroes to upgrade your mob and increase their savagery. Each run is different, and you may find yourself taking command of the likes of Heracles, Leonidas, Pandora, or even Socrates to turn your mischievous gang into a formidable army. It’s total anarchy in the birthplace of democracy!</p><h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcTW8TyKtaM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>High Hell</strong></u></a></h2><p><strong>On sale for: 80% off (Soundtrack Bundle)</strong></p><p>First exploding onto the indie scene with roguelike shooter Heavy Bullets, Brazilian developer Terri Vellmann and American rapper Doseone teamed up once again for 2017’s High Hell. It’s a neon-soaked, arcade-action first-person shooter that sees you descend upon an underground criminal enterprise with the most blessed of shotguns, bringing lethal salvation to those who have fallen from the light. Righteous fury and fancy footwork are crucial to surviving an escalating, absurd series of outlandish missions. Don’t be surprised to find yourself popping brainwashed chimps, defacing corporate effigies, and dismantling the business dealings of the unrepentant cartel in this vibrant, psychedelic remix of the classic first-person shooter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl3w5baycdw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Not a Hero</strong></u></a></h2><p><strong>On sale for: $3.99 (80% off)</strong></p><p>Long before the critically acclaimed, award-winning OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome, UK-based studio Roll7 dipped its toe into the world of action platforming with 2015’s Not A Hero, a raucous ballet of blood, bullets, and a political incumbent calling himself BunnyLord. You play as Steve, a former assassin turned campaign manager, sent out by BunnyLord to clean up the city by “shooting crime in the face.” You add additional crew members as the campaign picks up steam, including the shotgun-toting Cletus, hip-thrusting SMG master Jesus, and the dangerously enthusiastic katana-wielding Kimmy. You quickly find yourself murdering your way through gangs and police officers alike in the pursuit of winning the mayorship. Shoot, slide, dive, and duck behind a political platform built on ethics, accountability, and an inordinate amount of gunfire.</p><h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br686sJTnmw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>SPACEPLAN</strong></u></a></h2><p><strong>On sale for: $0.98 (67% off)</strong></p><p>SPACEPLAN is an experimental piece of interactive fiction based partly on developer Jake Hollands’ total misunderstanding of Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time. Launched in 2017, SPACEPLAN started life as an idle, browser-based “clicker” game (this was a thing back in the late 2010s) but soon expanded into a full game that was eventually released on both PC and mobile platforms. The game is beautiful in its simplicity: use manual clicks and the passage of time to create and launch potato-based devices and probes from your nondescript satellite orbiting a mysterious planet. Essentially, you can either spend this time unlocking the mysteries of the galaxy or just kill some time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crossing-souls-demo-gameplay-video"><u><strong>Crossing Souls</strong></u></a><strong></strong></h2><p><strong>On sale for: $2.99 (80% off)</strong></p><p>Nostalgia has always been a big thing for gamers, and that’s apparent in 2018’s Crossing Souls, developed by Spanish indie studio FourAttic (named after their “office,” which was literally an attic). Inspired by the dreamlike, Spielbergian wonder of classic ’80s fantasy, sci-fi, and coming-of-age movies, Crossing Souls takes you on a cinematic adventure through California in the midst of a supernatural event that rocks a small community. Taking control of five friends, each one with their own skills and combat styles (not to mention typically ’80s personality traits), you’re charged with flitting between each character on the fly, using each kid's specialties to overcome obstacles and the bad guys’ weaknesses. Featuring a nostalgia-inducing cinematic score that evokes peak John Williams, wonkily animated cutscenes, and dozens of easter eggs, Crossing Souls is a joyful trip back to when VHS fuzz was the worst of your problems.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/25/gods-will-be-watching-review"><u><strong>Gods Will Be Watching</strong></u></a><strong></strong></h2><p><strong>On sale for: $1.99 (80% off)</strong></p><p>Gods Will Be Watching is the first full-fledged release from narrative-driven developer Deconstructeam. Originally developed as an entry for the Ludum Dare game jam back in 2013, Gods Will Be Watching caught the eye of Devolver, who stepped in to help turn it into a full game. The result divided opinion upon its release in 2014, with some critics and players finding it difficult to get past the game’s intentionally punishing mechanics, despite acknowledging the team’s talent. Pitched as a minimalistic sci-fi point-and-click thriller centred on despair, commitment, and sacrifice, this was perhaps to be expected. Nevertheless, Deconstructeam soon implemented The Mercy Update as a way of helping players make the tough decisions that affect their entire crew’s wellbeing. It remains an innovative departure from the traditional point-and-click adventure, taking place in six intimate, tension-filled scenarios linked together through a narrative of interstellar espionage.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/11-minutes-of-gato-roboto-gameplay-pax-west-2018"><u><strong>Gato Roboto</strong></u></a><strong></strong></h2><p><strong>On sale for: $1.99 (75% Off)</strong></p><p>2019 introduced Devolver-owned studio Doinksoft to the world with the Oregon outfit’s debut title, Gato Roboto. Featuring classic NES-inspired monochromatic visuals, the game follows a cat named Kiki attempting to save her owner after they crash land on an alien planet, forcing Kiki to don a mech suit and explore the planet's depths. Pet-troidvania, Meow-troidvania, Mechtroidvania…whatever your genre-bending description of choice, Gato Roboto sees you exploring the underground labyrinth of a deep space outpost, uncovering the dastardly deeds that unfolded before your arrival. Curiosity will often get the better of your feline instincts, as you’ll also need to venture outside your trusty mech and risk all nine lives to explore otherwise inaccessible areas. Secrets abound in this purrfect ode to classic puzzle platformers. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/bleak-sword-dx-official-pc-and-nintendo-switch-launch-trailer"><u><strong>Bleak Sword DX</strong></u></a><strong></strong></h2><p><strong>On sale for: $5.99 (40% off)</strong></p><p>Sleek, thrilling, and wonderfully cruel, Bleak Sword DX is a dark fantasy action game by Spanish developer more8bit, otherwise known as Luis Moreno Jimenez. Originally released for Apple Arcade in 2019, Bleak Sword DX builds on the original game, offering expanded gameplay mechanics, narrative elements, and atmospheric world-building. Its unique, condensed art style is reminiscent of 8-bit classics, but with a modern twist that blends 2D sprites with 3D environments. The game is centred around 12 chapters of cursed diorama battlefields, where your hero must lift the curse of the legendary Bleak Sword by eliminating the hostile creatures in each environment. Somewhat soulslike in its levelling system, you gain experience points by clearing stages but lose those not used for levelling up after dying twice in a stage. Not for the faint of heart, but a hell of a lot of fun.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/13/titan-souls-review"><u><strong>Titan Souls</strong></u></a></h2><p><strong>On sale for: $1.49 (90% off)</strong></p><p>Speaking of soulslikes, what happens when an indie developer takes the brutal “one more try” philosophy of that genre and adds a boss rush on top? Well, Titan Souls is your answer. Conceived and prototyped during Ludum Dare #28, Titan Souls is an open world, top-down action-adventure, where your hero’s only weapon is a single arrow and you can only take one hit. The goal is to defeat 20 giant monsters (21 on hard mode) called the Titans. Just like you, they only take one hit to die, but they also only have one way to be defeated. During combat, you must figure out how each Titan behaves and identify their fatal weakness. The twist is that your single arrow must be charged before it can be shot and has to be retrieved before it can be reused. Oh, and you can only perform either action while not moving, making you a sitting target for the Titans. Did we mention it’s quite hard?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl07NG4ZY5c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Heave Ho</strong></u></a></h2><p><strong>On sale for: $3.99 (60% off)</strong></p><p>Heave Ho tasks up to four players with a simple goal: don’t fall to your death! Created by French developer Le Cartel and released in 2019 for PC and Switch, players take control over a gurning disembodied head with a pair of stretchable arms, using their iron-like grip and the outstretched hands of their friends to grapple across each level on their way to victory. Clambering across one another’s dangling bodies and swinging your pals to safety in a wobbly mass of limbs is made all the more silly by customising your character with all manner of ridiculous accessories and zany accoutrement in a vain attempt to remember who you are.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/olija-review"><u><strong>Olija</strong></u></a></h2><p><strong>On sale for: $4.49 (70% off)</strong></p><p>Another French developer saw their game published by Devolver in 2021, though it came by way of Japan. Thomas Olsson conceived his debut game Olija after moving to Japan, collaborating with a team they dubbed Skeleton Crew, a Japanese saxophonist, a shakuhachi player, and his wife to bring his vision to life. Inspired by Moby Dick, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Prince of Persia, Olija is a game about Faraday, a man shipwrecked and then trapped in the mysterious country of Terraphage. Armed with a legendary harpoon, he and other castaways try to leave this hostile country to return to their homelands. The game mixes exploration and quickfire combat through the use of Faraday’s Harpoon, challenging you to rethink movement through platforming, puzzle, and combat. Inspired by swashbuckling tales and cinematic adventure games, Olija is a story about facing the unknown in adversity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boomerang-x-review"><u><strong>Boomerang X</strong></u></a><strong></strong></h2><p><strong>On sale for: 75% Off (Soundtrack Bundle)</strong></p><p>Continuing the theme of weapon-based traversal in 2021, Boomerang X from developer DANG! is like a rollercoaster ride of fast-paced first-person shooting taken from the classic hardcore boomer playbook. Armed with a magical boomerang, slice, fly, and dive through flocks of evil Ghibli-esque creatures in this acrobatic arena boomer(ang) shooter. As you catapult yourself through the air, the power drawn from the creatures you defeat can be used to slow time and recalibrate your airborne attacks. They really should have called it Doomerang.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-first-12-minutes-of-pikuniku"><u><strong>Pikuniku</strong></u></a></h2><p><strong>On sale for: $2.59 (80% off)</strong></p><p>Pikuniku is a puzzle-exploration game that takes place in a strange but playful world where not everything is as happy as it seems. The brainchild of French-British indie collective Sectordub (Arnaud De Bock, Rémi Forcadell, Alan Zucconi, and Calum Bowen), Pikuniku sees you take control of the titular Piku as he helps peculiar residents overcome their mundane struggles, uncovers a deep state conspiracy, and starts a little revolution on his delightful dystopian adventure. The majority of puzzles involve kicking and pushing objects to open doors and access rooms, but Piku can also lasso his legs to swing from hooks or curl into a ball and roll, allowing you to move around faster and reach higher or previously inaccessible areas. Pikuniku also features a local co-op mode with nine levels, in which a second player controls Niku, Piku’s orange pal.

Combining a mix of classic text-adventure, point-and-click, and first-person puzzle games, four short stories are packaged together into a single mysterious anthology that pulls together ’80s retro nostalgia, innovative and experimental gameplay, and tense, psychological horror.</p><p>On top of this sale, Devolver will be celebrating its 15th birthday by dipping into its archives for a series of blogs on <a href="https://www.devolverdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its official website</u></a> that take a trip down memory lane.

Ubisoft will likely sell the Season Pass separately later, and likely for $40, but it has so far not confirmed this.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exclusive Concept Art</h3></div></output><p>Ubisoft has yet to share meaningful details on the two missions either, but announced that the preorder bonus is called Thrown to the Dogs, and released artwork featuring dual-protagonist Naoe with a dog at her side. As for the Season Pass mission, Ubisoft has only said players must "infiltrate a secret society from the inside."</p><p>The decision to lock day-one content behind additional requirements is perhaps unsurprising to some who experienced the same when Ubisoft announced the different editions of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, its sci-fi open world adventure launching August 27.</p><p>Fans shared their frustration online when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-jabba-the-hutt-mission-locked-behind-season-pass">a Jabba the Hutt mission was similarly locked behind the Season Pass</a> despite being ready day-one, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-responds-to-star-wars-outlaws-season-pass-backlash-insists-jabba-the-hutt-is-part-of-the-experience-for-all-players">Ubisoft insisted this was an "optional, additional"</a> mission that won't impact the overall experience much. The publisher seemingly didn't take fan upset to heart as it's done the same again with Shadows.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The upcoming Assassin's Creed game was fully revealed on May 15, 2024 as a Japanese-set entry where players take control of two protagonists: the stealthy shinobi Naoe and the action-orientated Yasuke, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained">who's a real figure from Japanese history</a>.</p><p>IGN had a wealth of exclusive content on the reveal, and you can read about all the gameplay changes, story beats, and open-world assassinating coming with Shadows <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">in our extensive interview with the development team</a>.</p><p>If that's not enough, check <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/when-and-where-is-assassins-creed-shadows-set">our analysis and explanation of where and when Shadows is set</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-40-details-you-need-to-know">40 key details we've learned about the game</a>.

<p data-characters="333" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With over 50 abilities across all evolutions and more added with each update, it’s hard to keep track of which abilities in <em>Project Mugetsu</em> are the best and worth equipping.

While most abilities in <em>Project Mugetsu</em> are viable, those in S Tier are arguably overpowered and considered the best abilities in the game in all aspects. A Tier abilities are also very strong and you can almost always count on, though don’t quite reach the potential of the S Tier abilities. Those in the B Tier may have situational uses but overall are outperformed by those in the higher tiers, while those in the C Tier are a bit under tuned at the moment and should try to be avoided.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158246/sony-playstation-pc-overlay-hands-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut</em> debuts on PC today, and it’s the first game to feature Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24132846/sony-playstation-pc-overlay-shared-trophies-ghost-of-tsushima">new PlayStation PC overlay</a> and shared Trophies system. I’ve had a chance to get a first look at this new overlay, and my initial impression is that it’s really unobtrusive, clean, and simple.</p><p>There are five main sections here: search, friends, Trophies, profile, and settings. Search lets you find other PlayStation players and add them as friends, whereas the friends section lists both your online and offline friends. You can see your friends’ Trophies, but you can’t message friends or party chat from this overlay, unfortunately. You’ll have to use in-game chat if you want to speak to a console friend, or just use Discord.</p><div><figcaption><em>The PlayStation PC overlay in action.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The Trophies system works just as you’d expect, by syncing <em>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut </em>trophies from the PS5 version of the game to PC, and vice versa. You just sign in to your PlayStation Network ID, and the overlay and Trophies are both available.</p><p>The profile section lets you view all your existing Trophies across all your PlayStation games, and the settings section is largely web links to account management, privacy settings, and PlayStation support. There are settings to enable or disable notifications for Trophies, and the ability to see who you’ve blocked on PSN.</p><p>Overall, the PlayStation PC overlay works much like Steam’s, in the sense that it’s only active within a game. Sony hasn’t created something that’s constantly running in the background like Nvidia’s GeForce Experience or Microsoft’s Xbox Game Bar. </p><div><figcaption><em>A trio of notifications will greet you if you haven’t disabled GeForce Experience and the Steam overlay pop-ups.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>I did notice that if you haven’t disabled notifications for the GeForce Experience and Steam overlays, then you’ll get a trio of pop-up notices when you start <em>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut </em>because the PlayStation one also has its own notification<em>. </em>Unfortunately, there’s no way to disable the PlayStation notification, as the pop-up notifications toggle doesn’t affect this particular message.</p><p>Still, the overlay looks and feels lightweight, even if it’s a little basic right now. Nixxes Software, the in-house port developer that Sony acquired in 2021, helped create it, and I’m hoping this simple start will lead to even more features in the future. It sure would be great to have the option of using the voice chat features of the PlayStation Network instead of having to use in-game chat or Discord. Sony is increasingly investing in the PC space, so there’s a good chance this PlayStation overlay improves over time.</p><div><p><em>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut </em>is available now <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2215430%2FGhost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT%2F">on Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/ghost-of-tsushima">Epic Games Store</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Centered around a cosmic tarot aesthetic, Astrologian is a healer role (one of four in the game) whose kit focuses heavily on drawing cards from a deck to perform actions. Each card has a particular buff that only activates when applied to a party member of a specific role. The randomness of card draws and the requirements for playing them gives Astrologian a particular sense of improvisation as it keeps players on their toes. You can’t just hit a regular rotation of skills if the game randomly gives you your next action. Compared to other healer roles, which can feel stagnant and a bit “set it and forget it”, Astrologian lets me get more involved as a player.</p><p>At least that was the case—once <em>Dawntrail </em>releases all that will change. “The card system will no longer be random,” reads the official change as shown during the live letter, “and will instead simultaneously draw cards with offensive, defensive, and curative effects.” In addition, players will now be able to draw four cards within a 60-second window that they can play depending on the given situation (players can currently draw one card every 30 seconds). Each card pulled will have curative, damage, or buffing abilities. The big issue, at least in this Astrologian’s opinion, is that these changes take away the best part of the job—the randomness.</p><figure id="" data-id="6b0e36caf15822dc4107c2cb0fb73a11" data-recommend-id="image://6b0e36caf15822dc4107c2cb0fb73a11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1141" data-height="643" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A lalafell draws a tarot card" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A lalafell draws a tarot card" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6b0e36caf15822dc4107c2cb0fb73a11" data-recommend-id="image://6b0e36caf15822dc4107c2cb0fb73a11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1141" data-height="643" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A lalafell draws a tarot card" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For a while, there has been a slow, but steady, shift with many of <em>FF14</em>’s jobs towards making them simpler. Healers have faced the brunt of this shift, so much so that the community has identified it as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-dawntrail-healer-job-rework-1851432853&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-dawntrail-healer-job-rework-1851432853">a major problem</a></span>. It isn’t an issue of whether <em>FF14 </em>is too hard or should be more friendly to newcomers— it’s very good at onboarding new adventurers, but it’s a question of job complexity. For healers, that complexity has felt lacking due to how relatively simple average healer gameplay is, which is often reduced to spamming attacks with one or two buttons and healing off the global cooldown with skills as needed. For new players, that simplicity can be helpful for learning the other many systems of the MMORPG but after hundreds of hours, it becomes boring.<br></p><p>Astrologian’s randomness has been a cure for healer boredom. While other healers have a fairly defined rotation, Astrologian has a built-in unpredictability that makes it exciting. For my first three expansions I played as a White Mage, but changed to Astrologian when I needed a job that gave me more to do in moment-to-moment combat. Making split-second decisions based on whatever the deck provides while in encounters makes healing a much more interesting affair and a much-needed alternative to other healing jobs. Taking that away feels like a major loss.</p><p>Although it wasn’t an entirely unexpected one. Ahead of <em>Dawntrail </em>players knew that Astrologian would be getting a rework, but were worried that it would be oversimplified, like the Summoner changes of Endwalker that sought to reduce the fabled two-minute rotation of the job into something easier to pick up. And honestly, it feels like our worries were valid with this erasure of card randomness. It’s part of a larger conversation about job simplification that even director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-more-stressful-1851332485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-more-stressful-1851332485">Naoki Yoshida has said</a></span> may have gone too far in recent updates.</p><hr><p>This doesn’t have to be an either-or situation though. That’s why we have multiple jobs, for multiple styles of play. There should be some jobs that allow for a more complex rotation for players who want that. This is why the coming changes to Astrologian feel like a loss.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This should be good news! The industry needs more studios after thousands of layoffs. However, last week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-closing-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-1851460685&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-closing-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-1851460685">Activision’s parent company, Microsoft, announced it was closing three video game studios</a></span>.

According to Activision’s press release, the new studio will be focused “exclusively” on developing a “new narrative-based,” “genre-defining AAA franchise.” </p><p>That seems to imply that this new studio won’t be another gear in the enormous <em>Call of Duty</em> content creation machine, unlike Raven Software and High Moon Studios. Activision has made headlines over the years for essentially taking <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/now-every-single-activision-studio-works-on-call-of-dut-1846798677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/now-every-single-activision-studio-works-on-call-of-dut-1846798677">all of its studios and throwing them into the <em>Call of Duty</em> mines</a></span>. Perhaps this time, things will be different.</p><p>“Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas. The team’s underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games,” reads Activision’s press release, which was seemingly written by someone who was also trying to set a new record for most buzzwords used in one paragraph. </p><p>Activision says Elsewhere Entertainment features staff who have previously worked on games like <em>The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk, The Division, Destiny, </em>and <em>Far Cry. </em>The studio has seemingly gone public now as it continues to staff up and likely ramps up development on its first big game.<br></p><h2 id="h17833"><a id=""></a>The timing of this news is not great, Bob</h2><p>Of course, the timing of this reveal hasn’t gone over well online. Activision’s parent company—Xbox—was recently in the news after it suddenly closed three Bethesda-owned studios on May 7. </p><p>Things only got worse for Xbox after an all-hands meeting with Bethesda leaked and reportedly revealed that the company had shut down those studios due to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-bethesda-studio-closings-arkane-too-many-games-1851464885?rev=1715203138081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-bethesda-studio-closings-arkane-too-many-games-1851464885?rev=1715203138081">resources and staff being spread too thin</a></span>. Xbox President Matt Booty reportedly said that shutting down these teams would help provide <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-bethesda-layoffs-high-impact-games-1851464703&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-bethesda-layoffs-high-impact-games-1851464703">more money and staff to  projects</a></span> as the company focuses on fewer, more “high-impact” games. </p><p>So, a big AAA studio being unveiled shortly after a bunch of people lost their jobs has gone over poorly online. And while Activision is its own large company with its own leaders and marketing plans, I understand why so many online are reacting poorly to the news. It’s likely that Activision was building Elsewhere Entertainment long before the Microsoft merger happened. But it’s extremely <em>unlikely </em>that Xbox leadership had no idea this studio existed or that it was going to be announced publicly around this time.</p><p>Personally, if I was an executive at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-hits-3-trillion-market-value-2024-01-24/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-hits-3-trillion-market-value-2024-01-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the biggest tech companies in the world</a></span>, I’d probably wait at least, like, I don’t know...a month after closing studios down before letting another part of the corporation reveal a big new video game studio, even if that means delaying plans that have been in the works for months. But hey, what do I know? </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
