            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s mildly shocking that <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425"><em>Hollow Knight</em> was just $15</a> when it came to PC back in 2017. It’s even more surprising that eight years and over a million Steam wishlists later, the sequel is only $5 more. Team Cherry has confirmed <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695"><em>Silksong</em>‘s final price</a> and launch times cementing this upcoming week as the official kick-off of the 2025 fall video game release blitz.</p> <p>While most games have gone up $10 or more in the jump to the current console generation, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is aggressively going against the grain with just a $20 price tag on Steam and elsewhere. Team Cherry only <a href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1962330350681735642">officially confirmed</a> the amount on Sunday night after a weekend of speculation following leaks on GameSpot and elsewhere.</p> <p>The move has won Team Cherry tons of additional good will with fans who were already praising it for withholding review copies so that Kickstarter backers would still be among the first to get access to the game. Plenty of players commenting on the latest pricing announcement still can’t understand why the game isn’t more.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/cR0JuzvhxH">pic.twitter.com/cR0JuzvhxH</a></p> <p>— Kalrim Frosthill (@KalrimFrosthill) <a href="https://twitter.com/KalrimFrosthill/status/1962333593570795730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Make it $40 or I’m not buying,” joked one. Others recalled co-director Ari Gibson’s previous defense of charging so little for the first game, noting the development team’s desire for as many people as possible to play the game. And <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">with 15 million copies sold</a> of the original<em> Hollow Knight</em>, Team Cherry has the flexibility to make that happen.</p> <p>In retrospect, it’s also wild to think one of the biggest games of the year only had a placeholder in the pre-order box until now. Maybe discussions were still ongoing within the team. After all, fellow indie darlings <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-switch-2-exclusivity-pc-steam-1-0-date-1851775233">like Supergiant Games’ <em>Hades 2</em></a> are currently $30 and likely to cost even more at the end of Early Access (the studio behind Bastion and Transistor seems to be doing us all a favor by waiting to launch its own sequel until later in the fall).</p>

 <h2>What time does<em> Silksong</em> go live on Steam?</h2> <p>While the September 4 release date for <em>Silksong</em> has been known for just over a week now, it wasn’t entirely clear exactly when the game would go live until today. Alongside the price, Team Cherry also confirmed the launch time for each time zone:</p> <ul> <li>7AM PT | 10AM ET | 4PM CEST | 11PM JST</li> </ul> <p>That suggests everyone across PC and console will begin getting to play Hollow Knight sequel at roughly the same time.

Hornet is captured and taken to the Kingdom of Pharloom, where she must escape through a realm ruled by silk and song. According to Team Cherry, the game features over 200 enemies and 40 bosses in a world full of “mossy grottos, gilded cities and misted moors”.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gameplay for the upcoming Battlefield 6 Battle Royale game mode has been leaked online. The gameplay originally appeared on the Chinese social media site bilibili but has since found its way onto other social media platforms.</p>



<p>The clip, <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield_inf/status/1962273931819127268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">which you can watch</a> below for now, is 1:53 in length. In that short time, you can see the start of the mode, swimming mechanics, building destruction via sledgehammer, and more. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though details remain slim, the new game mode <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was confirmed during Battlefield 6’s reveal</a> back in July. What is currently known is that there will be a standard Battle Royal mode as well as a more competitive mode called Gauntlet.</p>



<p>While it won’t launch alongside the game, the new mode will be free-to-play and is EA’s challenge to Call of Duty Warzone. Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/">first reported the existence</a> of the Battle Royale mode in early 2024. And although the gameplay footage above is new, it’s not the first leak related to the mode to surface online. In recent weeks, gameplay, points of interest, and the map have all been leaked—though each was taken down within hours.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 releases October 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. If you’re hoping for a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game, game lead Vince Zampella has confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-plans-for-battlefield-6-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there are currently no plans</a> to bring it to the new system, as EA is focused on where the “core Battlefield audience” plays.</p>

            <p>Watch out, there's a goblin over there! Have you dispatched him with a deceased Blade's rusty blade? Good, we can now keep trekking through the revamped Imperial sewers dungeon that unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">Oblivion</a> remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>'s devs have just shown off.</p>
<p>The massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">Skyrim mod</a>'s getting ever closer to the release its creators have pencilled in for later this year. Despite that looming, they've not opted to skip what's become an annual cameo at fan-run <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> modding showcase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CreationModCon/featured">Creation Mod Con</a>, alongside a bunch of other in-the-works Elder Scrolls remake projects and add-ons.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I spoke to Skyblivion project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel ahead of Creation Mod Con about where the modders are at in terms of announcing the mod's full release date. "Progress is generally good, volunteer based projects are always a challenge due to people sometimes dropping out or not having as much time to contribute as in the past," he told me. "To work around that we try as much as possible to keep the project a bit flexible and change our MVP (minimum viable product) according to the team's capability. I'd say recent developments made us come closer to a potential date announcement, but we will be able to share more about that at a later date."</p>
<p>The team also revealed that in addition to the GOG release they announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-and-gog-chat-about-partnering-up-to-release-the-massive-elder-scrolls-mod-following-fallout-londons-troubled-success">back in June</a>, a release via Nexus Mods is also locked in and there are plans to offer the mod for free via Steam too. I'm intrigued to see how that last one might differ from the other two.</p>

<p>Anyway, the modders showed off the opening 15 minutes of Skyblivion in this latest showcase. Big spoiler alert - the sequence sees some youths in hoodies harass Patrick Stewart into freeing Nirn's ugliest prisoner before departing to go and voice a sentient poo in the Emoji Movie several years down the line.</p><p>I'm not joking about it being Patrick Stewart that does this, as shown a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/finishing-skyblivion-is-a-new-dev-diary-series-about-the-last-leg-of-the-oblivion-remake-mods-run-to-release">recent dev diary</a>, Skyblivion's Uriel Septim is his regal spitting image. As for the iconic series of corridors in which he's shanked up while you decide whether you're going to default to a sneak build for the hundredth time, Skyblivion's devs said they've opted to keep things "closer to the original experience" at the start so players can get up to speed with the mod's combo of Skyrim and Oblivion mechanics.</p>
<p>Though, lest you forget this is remake rather than a remaster, something the modders have understandably been keen to stress since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">official Oblivion remaster</a> rocked up through a flaming gate earlier this year, there are plenty of the sort of tweaks and touches that've left me generally more curious to play this interpretation than Bethesda and Virtuos' efforts.</p>
<p>As you battle through the caves, there are goblin cave paintings and brief glimpses of the White-Gold Tower to ensure the background's more than a plain brown mush. They're subtle elements, designed by modders <a href="https://annakhudorenko.com/">Anna Khudorenko</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/users/4419430">Penrutet</a> respectively, but I'm hoping they'll keep the experience feeling a bit fresher than the remaster's intentionally  minimalistic reskinning.</p>
<p>That said, the fresh addition I dug most from what the modders showed off here is the first look at the Imperial Mausoleum, a hall in the Arboretum where Emperor Stewart's body will now be interred once he meets his demise. The Skyblivion crew tell RPS this was designed by Gabriele Floris, aka <a href="https://www.artstation.com/kazuhide">Kazuhide</a>. They've lent their two architecture degrees to shaping the mod's version of Cyrodiil's capital, with real life mock-ups for a restoration of the Roman Emperor Augustus' mausoleum being cited as the inspiration for Uriel's resting place.</p><p>This Septim tomb's just one aspect of what you can expect from the mod's total revamp of the city. "We've really set out to entirely remake the Imperial City to be the grand cosmopolitan city it is known as in lore - that means every district is substantially larger and more detailed," Rebel tells me.</p>
<p>Skyblivion's still looking for <a href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/">volunteers</a> with the skills to help get it over the line.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-borderlands-4-rage-room-is-the-most-obnoxious-thing-at-pax-west-and-people-love-it.1285263/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Stroll by Larian Studios’ <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> display at PAX West and you’ll see fans quietly playing the <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> board game. Linger a little too long though, and you’ll hear what sounds like a car crashing through a McDonald’s drive-thru in the far corner of the show floor. And then another, and another. Follow the piercing sounds for long enough and you’ll arrive at the <em>Borderlands 4</em> Ripper Rage Room, by far the most ridiculous marketing stunt at this year’s expo.</p> <p>Fans of Gearbox Entertainment’s anarchic loot shooter, some adorned with its enemies’ iconic Psycho masks, are wrapped around a small, encased exhibit waiting for their chance to smash aluminum trash cans, glass bottles, and Dollar Store ceramics. Staff dress them in jumpsuits and riot helmets with plastic visors. Then, one at a time, they make their way into a plexiglass-ensconced chamber where they emotionally unburden themselves with a post-apocalyptic baseball bat.</p>   <p>It’s surprisingly loud and jarring, even when you know it’s coming. Imagine the heart-stopping moment in the restaurant when a waiter accidentally drops a giant tray of dishes. The immediate gasps as everyone experiences a simultaneous shot of fight-or-flight adrenaline followed by the hushed murmurings of people gawking at reality’s brief departure from the mundane.</p>

 <p>The Ripper Rage Room debuted during the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/borderlands/reel/DMnrGlOJjgH/#"><em>Borderlands 4</em> Warped Tour fan event</a> earlier this summer in L.A. and is reprising its role for PAX West. The big difference, however, is that the annual Seattle-based expo features lots of booths ranging from PC gaming giveaways to first-time indie developers desperately trying to get someone to pay attention to their passion project.</p> <p>More than one exhibitor has privately confided to me that “it must suck” for all the nearby booths who are trying to get attendees meandering on by to hang a second and listen to their pitch. In the case of Limited Run Games, the boutique physical game retailer closest to the Rage Room, that might mean hanging around long enough to pull the trigger on a copy of <em>Clock Tower: Rewind</em> for the Nintendo Switch. Then all of the sudden: *SNAP* *CRACKLE* *SMASH*.</p>       <p>But Gearbox is the king of PAX and it knows what the people want. Its massive booth for <em>Borderlands 4</em>, filled with dozens of demo stations and massive statutes of each of its Vault Hunter heroes, is both the most packed and the fastest at getting people through the queue. Fans at the Nintendo and Capcom booths complain about wait times and arcane requirements, like a lottery system for who actually gets to try <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> on Switch 2.</p>

 <p>And then there’s the Ripper Rage Room which, despite the absolute vibe-killing antics, always has people watching as each new fan briefly descends into a performative rampage, quietly realizing as they enter the translucent box that they are as much a part of the display as the brutalized silicon dummy standing in the corner. People love smashing shit. They love watching other people smash shit. Like the beautifully cel-shaded Skinner box at the heart of <em>Borderlands</em> franchise, it sometimes is just as simple as that.</p> <p>Less straightforward is the task of needing to reassemble the Ripper Rage Room after each demolition. At least three staff race to stack the trash cans, folding chairs, bottles, and plates in precarious positions for optimal smashing. Trying to replicate chaos is an oxymoron but that is the mandate. Everyone knows what’s going to happen but they wait to watch it unfold again anyway. And what could be more <em>Borderlands</em> than that?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-ditched-ray-tracing-to-focus-on-performance.1285227/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As any PC gamer who played some Battlefield 6 during the recent beta test weekends will have already noticed, there is no trace of ray tracing options whatsoever in the graphics settings. That, alongside the complete absence of any mention from the developers, was already more than telling. However, just to be absolutely certain, <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-bf6-no-ray-tracing-pc-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Comicbook.com</a> got the chance to ask Christian Buhl, who is the Studio Technical Director at Ripple Effect (formerly known as DICE LA, the team working primarily on the Portal mode). Buhl confirmed that ray tracing was not considered and is probably not making it into the game in the near future, either.</p>



<p><em>No, we are not going to have ray-tracing when the game launches and we don’t have any plans in the near future for it either. That was because we wanted to focus on performance. We wanted to make sure that all of our effort was focused on making the game as optimized as possible for the default settings and the default users. So, we just made the decision relatively early on that we just weren’t going to do ray-tracing and again, it was mostly so that we could focus on making sure it was performance for everyone else.</em></p>



<p>Needless to say, it does feel a bit of a downgrade when you consider that Battlefield V was one of the first PC games to support ray tracing back in 2018, specifically for the reflections. Three years later, the ill-fated Battlefield 2042 offered ray traced ambient occlusion. However, Buhl is definitely right that a competitive multiplayer shooter should focus first and foremost on performance.</p>



<p>Players have clearly appreciated that, turning the Battlefield 6 beta into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest ever registered for this franchise</a>. GeForce users can <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further accelerate performance</a> with NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation. AMD users can enable FSR 3 with FSR Frame Generation, and Intel users can select Intel XeSS with XeSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>The full game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In June, Roborock released a line of affordable robot vacuums after the unveiling of ultra-premium models (Saros line) during CES. Luckily, some of these models are already on sale, <strong>like the Roborock QV 35A</strong>, which is now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3822/">listed on the official Roborock website for just $399 instead of $599, which is a nice 40% off for the 11th anniversary of the brand</a>. Even though it is in the budget category, this robot vacuum is still one of the most feature-packed models on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3822/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Roborock.com</a></p>

<h2>Multifunctional Dock</h2>
<p>The QV 35A begins with a bang with an<strong> incredible 8000 Pa HyperForce suction</strong> which is way more than enough to effortlessly remove dust, dirt, and pet hair from carpets and hard floors. Of particular note here is the <strong>zero-tangle arc side brush</strong> that is designed to pick up debris without hair becoming tangled and caught. If you have pets shedding or long hair around, this spares a great deal of annoyance from frequent maintenance.</p>
<p>Its <strong>all-in-one multifunctional station</strong> is a game changer here: Not only is it the charging dock, but it also cleans the mop with cold air drying, auto-empties the dust, and refills the water tank so that the robot is always ready to go without much fuss from you.</p>
<p>The QV 35A also features<strong> twin rotating mops and automatically raises the mop when it encounters carpet</strong>&nbsp;so it’s capable of both vacuuming and mopping at the same time. With this kind of electronic mopping system, you have control over water flow and deep cleaning according to different surfaces so that your floors get the treatment they need without damage or leftover moisture.</p>



<p>Thanks to PreciSense LiDAR navigation, <strong>this model creates a map of your home with incredible precision</strong>. It creates 3D maps and uses intelligent planning to determine the most efficient cleaning route. The robot avoids obstacles on its own thanks to reactive tech, easily working around furniture and other domestic items without stopping.</p>
<p>With the 11th anniversary sale cutting nearly 40% off the cost, it’s the best time to acquire a premium robot vacuum.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> has "enacted" over 23,000 "actions" against cheaters after rolling out a new system to find and detect players who use mouse and keyboard in console lobbies, a practice known as ximming.</p>
<p>While "enacted" doesn't necessarily mean all 23,000 accounts were banned outright, Blizzard says that brings the overall total of banned accounts to over 1m players.</p>

<p>"The new Mouse and Keyboard support will impact how we action users who previously used unapproved third-party peripherals to gain an advantage over players in the Controller Pool," Blizzard explained in a new <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24223576/">blog</a> post. "Bypassing the set restrictions in that pool with unapproved peripherals will be considered cheating and actions will be taken on your account.</p><p>"Previously, we deployed technology to help find and detect players who were using those peripherals on consoles. We enacted over 23,000 actions against players since that deployment. This included players who were directly using unapproved peripherals as well as players who grouped up with them to benefit from that unfair advantage."</p>
<p>Blizzard then admitted that it had to "adapt to new workarounds" but was now ready to "take more aggressive actions against those who try to circumvent the competitive integrity of our console players."</p>
<p>"We’ve rolled out new tech for Season 18 that should help us spot players that use unapproved peripherals faster and with more reliability," the post added. "We’re also laying down harsher consequences on users of unapproved peripherals, since the legitimate opportunity to compete using Mouse and Keyboard on an even playing field is now available, regardless of whether you own a PC or console."</p>
<p>Previously, the team would "warn and restrict" any offenders and send them to the PC Pool, especially for cheats playing at Competitive levels above Diamond.</p>
<p>Now, however, "continuing to use unapproved peripherals and devices in the Controller Pool will result in a full game account ban regardless of the player’s rank or mode".</p>
<p>The recent action has resulted in over one million accounts being banned from playing Overwatch 2. This includes players who used aimbots, wallhacks, and other cheats, as well as those who grouped up with known cheaters.</p>
<p>"While the effort to stop cheaters and the cheats they use is an ongoing effort, we want to reiterate our commitment to ensuring the outcome of every <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> match is determined by skill and passion, and not through unfair advantages," Blizzard added.</p>
<p>Aside from the Stadium update, Overwatch 2 Season 18 introduced significant changes, including heroes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuyang-revealed-as-new-hero-in-overwatch-2">Wuyang</a>, Pharah, Winston, and Brigitte, plus the Route 66 and London maps, new game modes, new All-Star rewards, Endorsements, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ports-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-ps5-xbox-dlss-outlaws-1851782817">coming to Switch 2</a> in just a few days. It’s Ubisoft’s first big port for Nintendo’s new handheld hybrid. So why isn’t the company talking more about its 2024 blockbuster coming to the best-selling console of 2025? Maybe because it’s the latest Switch 2 port to reportedly run less than great.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, a stealth adventure about gangsters and bounty hunters on the fringes of the Galactic Empire, is currently the 10th best-selling game on the Switch 2 eShop thanks to digital pre-orders, but you won’t find it anywhere on the show floor at PAX West this weekend. Despite stations for fans to try big ports like <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo’s new hardware, a demo of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> was only playable behind closed doors, according to YouTube channel <em>GVG</em>‘s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5JbnfU0SVs">new hands-on video</a>.</p> <p>Even worse, the outlet was prohibited from sharing any direct capture footage of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> running on Switch 2. Over-the-shoulder recording wasn’t allowed either. The demo <em>GVG</em> tested included an early section inside of a Star Destroyer and a ship fight in space. The frame rate often appeared to dip below 30fps while the visual quality varied from good to unimpressive depending on the scene. And <em>GVG</em> didn’t even get to try any of the open-world sections down on planets.</p>

 <p>There have been some potential red flags around<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>‘ performance on Switch 2 for a while now. At a Partner Nintendo Direct earlier this summer, Ubisoft only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIBt_Qnf1_M">showcased the game for two minutes</a>, and most of that was developers (Ubisoft Red Lynx is doing the port) talking into the camera rather than direct feed of gameplay. What little snippets the publisher did share didn’t look outstanding either. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCYL2f49jyQ"><em>Digital Foundry</em> pointed</a> to some impressive lighting effects at the time, but was left mostly with concerns about just how downgraded it would be from the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions.</p> <h2>How will <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> run on Switch 2?</h2> <p>While not officially confirmed, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-release-date-1851786749">reading between the lines</a> of recent Ubisoft earnings calls leaves the strong impression that <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> isn’t the only current-gen exclusive the company is planning to port to Switch 2. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> sounds destined to arrive eventually as well. Has Ubisoft been investing more resources in optimizing that port, knowing it’s the bigger franchise, at the cost of quietly leaving<em> Outlaws</em> to flounder a second time (remember,<em> Shadows</em> was originally delayed precisely because of <em>Outlaws</em> launch struggles last year)?</p>

 <p>Right now, there are basically two buckets of third-party Switch 2 ports. One includes <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, which rarely remind you that you’re playing on weaker hardware than what the games were originally designed for. The other includes stuff like<em> Hitman World of Assassination</em>, which despite being serviceable, often feels like a noticeable downgrade (though things improved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjJVzd-FWI">just this week</a> with a capped frame rate option).</p> <p><em>Elden Ring</em>, which reportedly ran like goop when you hit the open-world sections, and now <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> appear to be in that second bucket as well. Bandai Namco tried to prevent people from filming footage of FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-framerate-footage-video-gamescom-2000618923">first Switch 2 game at Gamescom 2025</a> as well, though that game at least doesn’t have a release date yet. Unless a day-one patch or series of other upgrades can improve <em>Outlaws</em> on Switch 2, there’s now a question of whether a potential <em>Shadows</em> port will fall into the “meh” column of ports as well.</p>

            <p>Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam.</p>
<p>Rumours began to swirl when Battlestate's head of studio, Nikita Buyanov, posted a captionless gif to X/Twitter over the weekend showing an old man delightedly holding down the steam button on his iron.</p>

<p>Definitive proof? Hardly, even if Buyanov were willing to troll his own playerbase. Fast-forward to today, though – 31st August – and it's confirmed: Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam.</p> <div>

<p>The page has yet to go live on Valve's digital store, so we're yet to get any of the specific details, but Buyanov shared an image of the Steam logo superimposed on a Steam listing for Escape from Tarkov (see above), and wrote: "Yes! The page on Steam will be available soon. All the details later."</p>
<p>The Steam launch could coincide with another milestone for Battlestate – version 1.0 the tactical FPS will finally release on 15th November, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-fallout-companions-ever/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-best-fallout-companions-in-franchise-history%E2%80%94from-dogmeat-to-danse.1285155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a fact of the franchise that you don’t have to explore the wastelands of Fallout alone. There’s always the option of roaming the open, desolate world with a companion by your side, be that a human, robot, or animal companion. There are dozens of memorable partners stretched across the entire series, but in this list, we’re breaking down the 10 best Fallout companions <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>Does your favourite Fallout companion make the list? Let me know in the comments.</p>



<h2 id="h-greatest-fallout-companions-ever">Greatest Fallout Companions Ever</h2>



<p>It was tough to narrow this list down to just the 10 best Fallout companions, but we did it. If your all-time favourite companion didn’t make the list, let us know in the comments and perhaps we’ll see where they can fit into the line-up. It’s worth stressing that this list isn’t a ranking; it’s just collectively the 10 best Fallout companions ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-dogmeat-fallout-4">1. Dogmeat (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dogmeat is a Fallout staple, having been introduced to the series back in 1997, in the first-ever game. This lovable pup resurfaced in Fallout 3 (2008), and then again in Fallout 4 (2015) – but it’s that latter title in which this canine companion made the most lasting impression on the player. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-boone-fallout-new-vegas">2. Boone (Fallout: New Vegas)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Boone’s story is one of heartbreak, revenge, and devastation, and that’s why he’s one of the best Fallout companions ever. In Boone, you’re not just getting a crack-shot sniper, you’re getting an emotional sub-story that will stay with you long after you’ve decided who gets ownership of The Strip.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-paladin-danse-fallout-4">3. Paladin Danse (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Like Boone, Paladin Danse is a well-trained soldier with an emotional story wrapped around him, only you don’t know that when you first meet him in Fallout 4. While journeying with Danse, you’ll uncover a crushing secret that could devastate or inspire you to change how you think about the rest of the game. </p>



<h3 id="h-4-goris-fallout-2">4. Goris (Fallout 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s right, once upon a time, Fallout players could travel the Wasteland side-by-side with a sentient, intelligent Deathclaw by the name of Goris. From a band of Deathclaws turned hyper-intelligent comes Goris, a <strong>kind </strong>creature that attempts to hide his gruesome appearance by shrouding himself under a robe. Hint: it doesn’t work.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-strong-fallout-4">5. Strong (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Strong is iconic and one of the best Fallout companions for one reason – he bucks the trend. He’s a Super Mutant with a curious streak; a desire to seek out the ‘milk of human kindness’ and evaluate the human race at large. He’s not the first Super Mutant companion in Fallout, but he certainly is a memorable one.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-marcus-fallout-2">6. Marcus (Fallout 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>From one Super Mutant to another, we now come to Marcus, one of the few Fallout characters who has made an appearance in more than one game. In Fallout 2, the player can pair up with Marcus, an unusually intelligent and inspirational Super Mutant with a perfectly normal, reasonable personality. He resurfaces in Fallout: New Vegas, but cannot be recruited.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout/">10 Most Iconic Brands From Fallout</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-7-maccready-fallout-4">7. MacCready (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Like Marcus, MacCready can be found in two different Fallout games – but he’s a less recognisable character. In Fallout 3, MacCready is the mayor of Little Lamplight, the cave in which a band of children survives the nuclear wastes. He reappears in Fallout 4, which is set around ten years later, as a well-honed marksman with a dark backstory.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-nick-valentine-fallout-4">8. Nick Valentine (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nick Valentine is crucial to progressing the core story of Fallout 4, and because of that, he’s vital to the player’s presence in the game. He’s also one of the most interesting characters in Fallout and easily one of the best Fallout companions ever. He’s a synth that’s accepted by the survivors of the Commonwealth, which is no easy feat, and his psyche is that of a classic private eye – an old-school detective. </p>







<h3 id="h-9-charon-fallout-3">9. Charon (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Charon is a super-effective, hyper-powerful Ghoul combatant with not much say but plenty of damage to dish out. He’s a machine, making use of a devastating shotgun to wreak havoc in a fight, but in true Fallout 3 fashion, he’s not invincible and can permanently die if you’re not careful. He’s one of the best companions in Fallout 3, without any doubt.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-ed-e-fallout-new-vegas">10. ED-E (Fallout: New Vegas)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>ED-E is a simple, charming robot with barely any personality whatsoever, and despite being a relatively passive companion, ED-E boasts some great boosts and one of the most curious and subtly complex side quests in New Vegas. ED-E is a permanent companion, cannot be killed, and can repair things at the press of a button – that’s not bad for a broken robot discarded in the town of Primm.</p>

<figure><a title="City Building RPGs" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a3954838839a1/city-building-rpgs.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Given that I love RPGs, I’m sure it’s no surprise that I’m <em>very</em> excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>. What might shock you, however, is that it’s not the return to Osterra, or the excellent turn-based combat, or even the prospect of another new HD-2D game that has me jazzed, nope (I still love all of these things, though, be nice!). The thing I’m most looking forward to? I get to build my own town.</p>
<p>What is it about city building that I love? Is it the allure of making <em>my</em> own space? Is it a power fantasy, where I can make my town however I want, a way of expressing my creativity in a whole new way? Or is it simply that I grew up with <strong><a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/grand-designs">Grand Designs</a></strong> (a British TV show about people with money who build their own houses) on in the background?</p>
<p>Yet, doing it in real life is a complete pipe dream. Building a town — let alone a single <em>house</em> — in this economy? Nuh-uh. Thank god for video games.</p>
<p>While city building is its own genre (hello, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/simcity">SimCity</a>), it’s the cosiness it fosters when part of an RPG that has always enraptured me. Need a break from the Dunan Unification War? Go recruit some pals and improve your base in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/suikoden-iandii-hd-remaster-for-nintendo-switch-2-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars">Suikoden II</a>. Tired of getting rid of the monsters in Alefgard? Good thing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders">Dragon Quest Builders</a> is a <em>font</em> of creativity.</p>

<p>The first game that comes to mind where this unusual amalgamation is involved is one of the earliest and one of the most unique: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/actraiser">ActRaiser</a>. Here, though, you’re not doing any of the building yourself – simply facilitating it. Well, I suppose God shouldn’t meddle in everyday affairs, right?</p>
<p>But there’s a charm to flying around each map as your little angel, fighting off monsters as the humans build paths, settlements, and expand. Sometimes you’ll get advice from the townsfolk or have problems to solve — like famine — but for the most part, you need to defeat monsters and destroy forests and obstacles and guide the people towards sealing the magic seal.</p>
<figure><a title="ActRaiser Renaissance" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a97aa39ca86f7/actraiser-renaissance.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing city building does is invite power dynamics. In ActRaiser, you’re the absolute: ‘The Master’ (the English name, but in Japanese it’s 'God', so not subtle). But in something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles</a>, where you’re rebuilding Colony 6, it serves more as a hub, a place where, if you put the time in, you can get a lot out of it.</p>
<p>You don’t have any actual power or agency there besides putting money and materials in, but you can encourage others to move there. Colony 6 becomes a community project, something that can <em>only</em> happen with Shulk and Juju leading the way; its growth and expansion are a great mirror to the way Shulk and his friends develop during the course of the game.</p>
<p>Back to the SNES and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/breath_of_fire_ii">Breath of Fire II</a> has a surprisingly robust, if simple, town-building aspect. Here, your town — later called TownShip (yes, the pun is deliberate) — starts off as one ruined building and, as Ryu hires the help of a carpenter, it grows from a small pile of rubble to a cosy little town with a laboratory which allows Ryu’s friends to fuse with Shamans to give them special powers.</p>

<p>I had no idea this quest existed until I watched my partner revisit the game earlier this year and, to my surprise, you even have to recruit villagers to move into the individual houses. And every single potential villager has their own function. The catch is that there’s only enough room for six people to move in, so you have to think wisely. Do you want to recruit someone who will sell rare weapons, or would you rather have poison protection for the next 30-odd fights?</p>
<p>It’s rare that a game makes its villagers feel like they have a purpose outside of being NPCs that you talk to, which makes TownShip feel particularly special to me. Imagine if I accidentally asked a man to move to my town and then your money disappears? I’d be pretty annoyed about that. And yes, that <em>can</em> happen – recruiting one potential villager causes all of your money to be stolen. You can get it back, luckily. And yes, it is annoying, but these kinds of events give these seemingly random characters a function, and a bit of personality.</p>
<p>Another game where every resident in your town — or in this case, sky island — has a purpose is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/skies_of_arcadia_legends">Skies of Arcadia</a>. When Vyse eventually becomes the captain of his own ship and starts building up a crew of men and women (and a dog), he realises he needs a base. So, he reclaims the island that he crash-landed on earlier in the game: Crescent Isle. The more crew members you recruit, the more stuff you have access to at your new home.</p>

<p>An item shop, ship parts, and even a kitchen – all of these things provide unique or powerful items that’ll help Vyse on his quest to gather the Moon Crystals. And while I could just flap around the skies trying to find the best healing items or weapons, well, I also have access to everything in one place. And I can decorate the island however I like – I’ll <em>always</em> take the Cupil fountain.</p>
<p>But most of these games are about building up the community and letting them thrive, not the actual <em>building</em> of a town or city. That’s where I look to Level-5. Now that's a developer that <em>loves</em> letting us build cities. It all started back with the studio's first game, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/dark_cloud">Dark Cloud</a> (yes, the "Zelda Killer"), where rebuilding towns and making the residents happy was front and centre. That, and its sequel, are PlayStation exclusives, though they set the template Level-5 RPGs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ni_no_kuni_ii_revenant_kingdom">Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom</a> is one of those, but instead of multiple little towns, you’re building your very own kingdom. Evermore starts off as a series of empty plots of land, but get some money, expand your coffers, and start investing, and you’ll soon have a fantasy metropolis that thrives on serving the king and his needs. Kingdom building is pretty on-rails – it’s both required for the story and gated by story requirements, and you can’t just build willy-nilly.</p>

<p>Every plot has a purpose, and you have to choose when to invest in those. Shops and a town square are easy early requirements, but eventually you’ll need resources like lumber, metal, and even ingredients. And you need people who are <em>good</em> at those things. There’s no point putting Floyd the cook in the Barracks when you have a Cookshop, after all.</p>
<p>Even though Ni no Kuni II is a little more strict with your creativity, I still got a real sense of joy watching Evermore expand and fill up. I love recruiting characters, so giving them tasks to actually do, which in turn rewards you with better items to buy or resources, is even more fulfilling. And then choosing what to invest research in to make that facility, and those staff, even better. Again, as King Evan of Evermore, I am the one with the power, but at least I’m making people happy.</p>
<p>But Level-5 has gone in the complete opposite direction in terms of creativity more recently with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. Now I’m not really building a city so much as populating an island… but I can build an art gallery, multiple homes, furnishings, island decorations, rivers, <em>and</em> terraform? It’s like playing a miniature version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> but with a massive RPG tacked on to it.</p>

<p>Outside of simply decorating and building for fun, customising your island doesn’t really serve much of a purpose. But it’s so easy and seamless that I just <em>had</em> to do it. Admittedly, it’s a bit of a mess right now, but I’m in post-game mode, so, y’know, resource gathering and all that. But it’s become a point of pride for me. Why shouldn’t all of my Buddies, who I’ve rescued throughout the course of the game, have a nice place to live?</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i gradually introduces new building mechanics, so while placing houses down might feel restrictive at first — I don’t know how many times I complained about the river — you can change things later down the line. I’ve gone from moving my favourite Buddies in to rotating them, completing crafting and delivery requests for them so they level up and improve their crafting, gathering, or combat techniques. I already have dreams to turn the island into some kind of cosy, forest-y nook with a little fountain and a town square.</p>
<p>But, like Crescent Island, like Evermore, and like Township, this island can act as a base for you as long as you level up your shop (situated inside the Guild Office) by completing deliveries and requests. Right now, I can get pretty much all the end-game resources from Marco, with only the rare and extremely rare items off-limits.</p>

<p>What encourages me to keep coming back to these cities, these locations that I’ve spent time building up, is that they eventually feel like a home away from home. Like a digital paradise. I’ve spent hundreds of hours in New Horizons perfecting the layout of my island, changing my mind, and redoing everything multiple times, because I want to create something that’s nice and comfortable for me, and somewhere that I think the digital inhabitants will like. It’s the same in all of these games – I’ll pore over every detail, every request, every need for my villagers, accommodating them while also trying to sneak in a little bit of my own flair.</p>
<p>I don’t know what Octopath Traveler 0’s town building will entail other than <em>beautiful</em> HD-2D houses and a new 'Architect' job, but I hope it puts community and creativity at the heart of it. I need another digital home away from home I can create and rejuvenate, and a pixel art one sounds perfect.</p>

<p>While it's not an official confirmation, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=I23MxTm2ku4&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fhollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch%2F432032.html" rel="sponsored noopener">a now-deleted listing on Gamestop</a> that marked the game's price as $20 was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1n3hj7a/gamestop_listed_silksong_with_price/">spotted</a> by fans of the series.</p>
<p>Many assumed this was merely a placeholder price, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n496oj/billbilkun_hollow_knight_silksong_price_is_1999/">Dealabs leaker</a> Billbil-Kun seems confident it's correct, and has even gone as far as to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/hollow-knight-silksong-on-vous-devoile-le-prix-de-sa-version-pc-60443">reveal</a> not only the Steam price but also how much it will be sold for on the rival GOG digital storefront.</p>
<p>The leaker has at least confirmed that the game will sell for under $20 / £20, with the UK price potentially being as low as £16.75 on Steam; the US price is pegged at $19.99.</p>

<p>For the sake of comparison, the original Hollow Knight game is currently available on Nintendo's eShop for $15.00 / £10.99.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Switch and Switch 2 price points haven't been revealed, and Dealabs appears to be confident that, at this point in time, there's no physical version of the game planned – that will almost certainly change post-launch, we'd argue.</p>
<p>If you are wondering if you'll get your money's worth out of this title, the ideas for Silksong have apparently been stacking up for some time, with the team previously mentioning how it could have kept going but ultimately needed to complete the game. In saying this, the developer has already got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/team-cherrys-already-got-ambitious-plans-for-hollow-knight-silksong-additional-content">amibitous plans for additional content</a>.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong launches on September 4th, 2025. It's coming to Switch, Switch 2, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series and PC.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will reportedly sell for around £17/$20/€20.</p>
<p>That's according to eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> fans who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1n3hj7a/gamestop_listed_silksong_with_price/">spotted</a> that the highly anticipated sequel was listed on <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/hollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch/432032.html">Gamestop</a> (link since deleted) for $20.</p>
<p>Initially, it was thought this <em>had</em> to be a placeholder price, as the game has long been the <a href="https://gaminganalytics.info/gbwish_last">most wishlisted title on the Steam platform</a>. When players tried to purchase the game but couldn't complete checkout, this only strengthened the feeling the listing had to have been incorrect.</p>

<p>However, since then, noted and usually reliable <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n496oj/billbilkun_hollow_knight_silksong_price_is_1999/">Dealabs leaker</a> Billbil-Kun has <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/hollow-knight-silksong-on-vous-devoile-le-prix-de-sa-version-pc-60443">all but confirmed the rumour</a>, revealing not just the Steam prices for Hollow Knight: Silksong, but also the price point on GOG.</p>
<p>According to the leaker's "recent research", Silksong will indeed retail for less than £20/$20/€20:</p>
<ul>
<li>UK: £16.75 (Steam) / (GOG Unknown)</li>
<li>Europe: €19.50 (Steam) / €8.29 (GOG)</li>
<li>U.S.: $19.99 (Steam) / $19.99 (GOG)</li>
<li>Canada: $25.99 (Steam) / $27.19 (GOG)</li>
<li>Australia: $29.50 (Steam) / $30.19 (GOG)</li>
<li>New Zealand: $28.99 (Steam) / (GOG Unknown)</li>
<li>Japan: (Steam Unknown) / ¥2939 (GOG)</li>
</ul>
<p>The price points for console and Switch versions remain unknown. Dealabs did, however, add weight to rumours that there is no physical version of the game planned at this time.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong will release on Thursday, 4th September 2025 for PC, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. Yet contrary to what you may believe, Silksong hasn't been in development hell for that time, however – in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">Team Cherry's developers say they were just having too much fun making it</a>.</p><p>The end of months of speculation has not been good news for all, of course; announcing the date so late in the game's development - a mere two weeks from release - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksongs-release-date-causes-delays-for-more-games-than-you-might-think">meant a slew of games which already had early September release dates suddenly found themselves in a difficult position</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A computer is not just a bright new device: it’s also an entrance to your entire digital life. But with that entrance comes the <strong>threat of dark unseen dangers</strong>: hackers, scams, and viruses just waiting to leap at the most inconvenient time. And with Labor Day weekend and back-to-school season already upon us, there’s no better time to lock down your digital life with strong protection that works behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">Avast is offering a fantastic deal with up to 60% off its security products</a>, making it easier than ever to secure your devices without stretching your budget. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">Avast Premium Security is available for just $31.20 for the first year</a> ($2,60 a month) for one device. But if you’re looking to protect the whole family or all your gadgets, their 10-device plan wraps your laptops, phones and tablets under one simple subscription.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Avast Premium Security</a></p>

<h2>Protects Your Digital Life</h2>
<p>So, just what does Avast Premium Security do, then? It’s a lot more than your average antivirus: It prevents viruses, malware, and ransomware from causing harm. It also catches phishing scams that want you to give up sensitive information. And it blocks remote access attacks and keeps would-be digital hijackers at bay. <strong>Whether you’re buying online, streaming, banking, or just browsing</strong>, Avast Premium Security operates behind the scenes keeping everything private and secure.</p>
<p>If you desire the ultimate peace of mind, Avast Ultimate is where it’s at – <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">and it’s currently on sale at $3.67 per month (60% off)</a>. You get all Premium Security features, plus Avast SecureLine VPN which keeps your internet connection safe and your identity hidden (just the thing when you’re browsing public Wi-Fi). And then there’s Cleanup Premium which streamlines and optimizes your PC by deleting junk files and speeds things up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Avast Ultimate</a></p>
<p>So the choice between Premium Security and Ultimate ultimately comes down to what you’re looking for: For superb malware, ransomware, and phishing protection, Premium Security is sufficient. But if you also want extra privacy, advanced device cleaning, and VPN protection, Ultimate offers those extras in one powerful bundle. No matter your choice, Avast is a security leader you can trust and protects hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide. Those days of the “free antivirus” are over—it’s an entire suite of tools for today’s world of connectivity.</p>

Autumn approaches, but we have one more summer month to look back on in this edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>!</p>
<p>August has been a bountiful one, with an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World</a> dropping some surprise hits and announcements. So there's been plenty to chew on alongside a couple of Nintendo highlights.</p>
<p>Before we dive in, let's remind you of the rules: Nintendo Life writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop exclusives for the month, from a list of games that we've reviewed. Afterwards, those games are scored (1 getting the most points, 3 the least) and tallied to determine the top three for the month.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067viuktp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>We've got a familiar story again this month: a certain ninja is missing in action. This time it's Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, as Switch codes were only sent out on the game's release date. You'll have to stay tuned for the verdict on that one.</p>
<p>Still, we have <em>14 games</em> to choose from in total — an Indie World will do that to you! All of the below scored at least a 7/10 with us, so let's have a look at what just missed out on the top three.</p>

<p>Just one of the many shadow drops we saw during Nintendo's Indie World Showcase in August, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> sees you as the manager of a dinky little bookshop on wheels by the ocean. Pure bliss, right?</p>
<p>Well, because you're on wheels, you can park your little store wherever you want around the town of Bookstonbury. You get to decorate your wagon and choose just what books you can sell — oh, and every single book in-game is a real novel, so it might even inspire you to read.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/tiny-bookshop">We scored Tiny Bookshop a nice 8/10</a> — it's extremely satisfying, pleasant, and just a feel-good game all-round.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">2nd Place - Roadwarden</a></h2>
<p>Well, this one crept up on us out of nowhere. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a> was announced just a week ahead of its release, and this award-winning text-based RPG lived up to the hype. It launched on PC back in 2022 and fans have been raving about it ever since. We can see why.</p>
<p>Incredible writing and lovely, simple pixel art help to illustrate a beautiful journey to the peninsula, layered with mysteries and choices that shape your experience. If you love storytelling, this is a must play.</p>
<p>We're so glad more people can experience this one, so check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/roadwarden">our 9/10 review</a> to see why we loved it so much.</p>

<p>When Mossmouth's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> shadow-dropped at the end of the Indie World Showcase earlier in August, we were elated. We'd been asking for this one since we played it at Summer Game Fest 2024 and we watched longing as the game racked up rave reviews on Steam. Fortunately, we had to wait less than a year.</p>
<p>UFO 50 is magical and a must-play experience for anyone who's grown up with video games. The craft and curation that's gone into the whole experience, from the variety of games the fictional story of UFO Soft. And yes, there really are 50 individual games in one package here.</p>
<p>So, congrats to Mossmouth — and UFO Soft — for winning eShop Selects with UFO 50 this month! For those who have yet to dive in, have a read of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/ufo-50">our glowing 9/10 review</a>.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-august-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/heres-morrowind-running-elden-ring-engine/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-morrowind-running-in-the-elden-ring-engine-because-why-not.1285050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Here's something I really wasn't expecting to write about: YouTuber and modder InfernoPlus has successfully ported The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind to the Elden Ring engine.</p>



<p>Originally, InfernoPlus had planned to port Morrowind to Dark Souls 1, then shifting to Dark Souls 3 and eventually to Elden Ring. Not only is FromSoftware's latest game a better title in every regard, including fidelity and gameplay, but its (entirely unofficial and user-made) modding tools have also greatly matured to the extent of making even such a gargantuan undertaking possible.</p>



<p>InfernoPlus said he has been working on the project for quite a while and is now roughly halfway done, but also admitted it's hard to say with any accuracy at this point. The modder said world generation is finished, and lighting and world effects are nearly there, although some lighting processing is still needed.</p>



<p>Interiors are also basically finished, while dialogue generation still must have its scripting data loaded. Voice acting will be added toward the end of the mod's development. However, NPCs, be they animals or humanoids, still have to be properly converted: right now, they're either Elden Ring's default girl (for humanoids) and goats (for animals).</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="I ported Morrowind to Elden Ring" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n89NFtIUWDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the video, InfernoPlus also touches on the inevitable copyright question, stating that the project cannot possibly violate any laws, as it does not include any Morrowind data. It requires the user to have that Morrowind data installed with a legitimate copy of the game, similar to A Tale of Two Wastelands, which combines Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas in a single game while requiring both games. This Morrowind port to the Elden Ring engine is also open source, by the way.</p>



<p>The modder then requested the community's help to keep going. InfernoPlus has a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/infernoplus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon page</a> where fans can support his work, but beyond that, the project could also use more expertise in certain areas. Between this and <a href="https://wccftech.com/skywind-gets-new-gameplay-demo-and-progress-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skywind</a>, Morrowind fans have two total conversion mods to look forward to. There's also the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind-path-tracing-rtx-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Morro RTX mod</a> that aims to take the original game and significantly boost its visuals with the help of NVIDIA RTX Remix. This mod is, however, still in its infancy.</p>
