            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/songs-of-silence-impressions-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Songs Of Silence</em>, man, where has this game been hiding? Last week I had never even heard of it. For the week since I have been doing nothing but playing this game.</p><p>It's a strategy game I've seen billed as everything from a 4X to an auto battler, and many other things in between (I'll take my own swing at what it is in a second). Set in a fantasy world where two races of ancient humans have battled so long they've literally split the world in two, you can play skirmish maps or fight your way through a narrative singleplayer campaign that features both sides caught in a war that threatens to destroy them both.</p><p>For all the tags and descriptors being thrown around about this game--it comes slightly out of left field, so it's difficult to precisely pin down--I'd say the overall experience is closest to playing a <em>Total War</em> campaign if you'd given the <em>Total War</em> series to an engineer and said "trim as much of this as you can while still keeping the overall vibes". Your objective in every <em>Songs of Silence</em> game, whether in the campaign or a skirmish map, is broadly the same: take and hold settlements on a strategic map, which accrue resources you then spend on upgrades, unique buildings or new units.</p><p>Leading your armies are hero units, which in RPG style are unique and can be levelled up, and who also have special abilities they can employ on the battlefield. The armies themselves, meanwhile, are made up of a wild variety of fantasy units ranging from cheap infantry through to expensive, gargantuan behemoths. See what I mean? I'm basically describing the outline of <em>Total War: Warhammer</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Songs of Silence - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yENpBzdm5PE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Only<em> Songs of Silence</em> does away with so much of <em>Total War's</em> faff. Diplomacy? Boring, so it's gone. Trade? Little more than tick-a-box, so it's gone too. All that's left is the heartbeat of Creative Assembly's series: the elastic to-and-fro of armies manoeuvring about a map that's always just slightly too big for them to hold down, and settling things on the battlefield in real-time when two of those armies clash.</p><p>Which is the point where <em>Songs of Silence</em> starts to get <em>really </em>interesting,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_battler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> because it's an auto battler</a>. You're the one building the armies, deciding on their composition and arranging them into formation, but once a battle starts every unit will (mostly) run off and do its own thing, with the player left as a bystander. The only direct input you have on proceedings is to play cards, which is a lot more important than it sounds, because they're the lifeblood of <em>Songs of Silence</em>.</p><figure></figure><p>On the battlefield, each leader gets their own deck of cards with special abilities they can play, and as you progress through a game and level your generals up you'll earn both more and better cards. Defensive abilities, offensive abilities, spawning new units on the battlefield, slowing your opponent down–there's a ton of ways you can influence the battle, even if you're not micromanaging each unit individually.</p><p>As a serial auto-resolver in long <em>Total War</em> campaigns, this is great. Look, I appreciate all the work that goes into <em>Total War's</em> real-time battles, and in decisive moments I'll usually always take control of them and have a blast, but over the course of a sprawling campaign that could feature dozens or even <em>hundreds </em>of engagements, I just can't be bothered taking charge of <em>all </em>of them. <em>Songs of Silence's</em> brevity is a great middle ground here, as I get some involvement, but can then kick back and watch a battle unfold in what is sometimes just a matter of seconds.</p><p>Cards can also be played on the strategic map, replacing much of what other games would build into an interface full of buttons (<em>Songs of Silence's</em> screen is beautifully uncluttered as a result.). These can buff armies or, more commonly, allow you to build structures and improvements on your settlements. Wherever you play these cards, on the battlefield or the map, the act is immensely satisfying; there's a flashy animation and feel to dragging a card onto the map and seeing a big stone tower come roaring out of the ground.</p><p>This all comes together to create an intoxicating pace. You just glide through <em>Songs of Silence</em>, frictionless, from one task to the next, never stopping or needing to pause, dancing in rhythm between moving an army on the map, upgrading something then having a little fight. Management is brief, battles are short, it's like strategic tapas in a genre that's normally only interested in huge steaks.</p><figure></figure><p>Helping drive all this is the fact I could not ever take my eyes away from the screen. Just look at this game. <em>Songs of Silence</em> is <em>stunning</em>. The splash art, the character design, the illustrations punctuating the end of every battle, the card art, the animation of all your little armies zooming around, the unit design, the little sensory thrill of playing a card, it's all wonderful.</p><p>The old cliche isn't as robust as it once was--stuff like <em>Endless Legend</em> and even recent <em>Fire Emblem</em> games have helped--but strategic fantasy in video games is still too often a generic, nondescript thing, one series' elf blurring into another series' stout human infantry. Not here! This game looks like nothing else out there (well, maybe a little like <em>Banner Saga</em> if you squint), and the story it's telling, complete with fantastic voice-acting, is also one that's well-told. This game's got a <em>world</em>, and it is an interesting place to spend some time in.</p><p>I have no idea how this game flew under my radar for so long--I mean I do, games media is broken and Steam's discovery is almost useless because simply too many games are coming out--but hey, whatever, I found it eventually. <em>Songs of Silence</em> is one of the most refreshing strategy games I've played in a very long time, and an unexpected artistic triumph at that. It's ironic that it's an auto battler, a genre often derided for being so hands-off, because I've been glued to this all week long.</p><figure></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2023 sci-fi blockbuster was one of my personal top-10 games of the year but didn’t land on as many people’s lists as <em>Elden Ring</em>. Unlike its fantasy-based sibling, however, <em>Armored Core VI</em> is a lot more straightforward with short missions and generous checkpointing that lets you focus on tough boss fights without worrying about backtracking or losing XP when you die. Plus the grim industrial vibes and anime mech drama are immaculate. </p><p>Who knows how long both games will stay on sale. The games aren’t currently discounted on the PlayStation and Xbox storefronts or Steam, though the digital discounts might be coming closer to Black Friday. So far FromSoftware hasn’t indicated if <em>Armored Core VI</em> will get its own <em>Shadow of the</em> <em>Erdtree</em>-sized expansion, but I’m still holding out hope that it eventually will. Maybe sometime in 2025.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>All in all, Helldivers 2 and Final Fantasy Rebirth VII did incredibly well, with both of them winning four awards each. Black Myth: Wukong also did reasonably well for itself, getting two awards during the ceremony.</p>

            <p>Various games in the Shiren The Wanderer (and Mystery Dungeon) series have been recommended to me over and over, but I've yet to play any of them. I likely won't play the next, either. Shiren The Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island is headed to PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178480/Shiren_the_Wanderer_The_Mystery_Dungeon_of_Serpentcoil_Island/">via Steam</a> soon.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island is much akin to the previous games in the series. These are traditional roguelikes, in which you head into a randomised dungeon split across many floors and attempt to delve ever deeper using the resources you find along the way. It's also got some neat online features, such as the ability to rescue or be rescued by other players should you collapse on a particular floor, so that you can continue with that character.
</p>
<p>Serpentcoil switches up the setting, introduces somewhat rudimentary 3D graphics, and modernises the UI a little, but should otherwise be deeply familiar to anyone who has played previous games in the series.
</p>
<p>The last Shiren game was The Tower Of Fortune And The Dice Of Fate, which you'd be forgiven for thinking was a relatively recent game, given it launched on PC and Switch in 2020. Alas, no, it first launched on Nintendo DS in Japan in 2010, and in the west for the Vita in 2016. That makes Serpentcoil Island the first new game in the series for 14 years.
</p><p>Serpentcoil Island also launched on Switch back in January of this year, which means you can find out every detail about the game if you're so inclined. It was pretty well received, with Famitsu giving it 38 out of 40.
</p>
<p>Why won't I play it? Because I find my patience for traditional roguelikes has lessened, these days. I might have plunged into my last procedural dungeon. Whatever appetite I do have left, I'm saving for the far more ambitious and wild Caves Of Qud, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-teases-a-10-release-date-with-a-tricksy-riddle-about-beetle-moons">due a polished 1.0 release on December 5th</a>. I do continue to enjoy listening to others wax lyrical about these games though, so if you think I'm wrongheaded and I should give Shiren his due, please pen a passionate ode in the comments.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft has provided players with new stealth gameplay details for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The main focus of the new gameplay was Naoe, the agile shinobi. However, some skills are applicable to Yasuke the Samurai, too.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-new-stealth-features">Assassin’s Creed Shadows New Stealth Features</h2>



<h3 id="h-observe-and-eagle-vision">Observe and Eagle Vision</h3>



<p>With the removal of the eagle companion, players in Assassin’s Creed Shadows will have to rely on two different scouting mechanics. The first is Observe, allowing players to identify targets, tag and monitor enemies, and highlight lootable stashes, collectables, and quest objectives. Players can also examine nearby locations through a Synch Point while using the Observe skill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next is Eagle Vision, and this Assassin’s Creed Stealth mechanic identifies enemy positions and lets you tag them behind walls and other objects. Eagle Vision will also isolate any relevant sounds the enemies make and let you find hiding spots. Naoe can use these skills separately and concurrently to survey the area better.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-hiding-crouching-and-going-prone">Hiding, Crouching and Going Prone</h3>



<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows Stealth Features are movement mechanics, which include hiding in shadows, crouching, and going prone. During the nighttime, players will find different hiding pots covered in shadows—the best way to ambush their enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crouching is an effective movement mechanic for indoors. If players crouch, then the sound they make decreases drastically. Also, their visibility is much lower when compared to standing. Crouching will also reduce the chance of you walking into any noisy objects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows stealth mechanic is for both Yasuke and Naoe. Players can be prone to reducing their visibility further when on rooftops, on the ground, or even underwater. When using prone as Naoe, players will be able to roll side to side or front to back by pressing the dodge buttons. There are also certain locations that you can crawl under by using prone.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-stealth-tools">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Stealth Tools</h3>



<p>As a stealthy shinobi in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Naoe uses an array of tools to move around as sneakily as possible. Naoe has four primary tools: Smoke Bomb, Shinobi Bells, Kunai and Shuriken. The first two are great for escaping or distracting enemies, while the others are better for damaging or stunning them.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-return-of-double-assassinations-nbsp">Return of Double Assassinations&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players can go on the ultimate stealth runs, thanks to the return of Double Assassinations. All you need to do is have Tanto as your primary weapon and unlock the dedicated skill to perform the Double Assassination with the Hidden Blade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also a non-lethal stealth mechanic, which is grabbing. Players can silently assassinate their enemies by grabbing them and pulling them into the shadows or bushes to get rid of them. Moreover, Naoe is the “smallest Assassin to date”, so she will be able to squeeze through tiny wall cracks and hide inside small storage spaces and boxes to surprise her enemies.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-enemy-reactions">Enemy Reactions</h3>



<p>While developing Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ stealth mechanics, the developers also focused on enemy tactics. Servants are a new non-lethal enemy that will be introduced in this game. They cannot harm you but can raise alarms to reveal your location to other enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enemies will be more suspicious in the game once you have been detected. If you hide after being spotted, they will start looking for you in pairs and be more on guard moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another unique enemy in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a Samurai. They cannot be tackled as you would with a regular enemy, as they are much more skilled. For example, players can’t assassinate them with a smoke bomb, and Samurai are likelier to deny their assassinations. Moreover, Samurais will also slice bushes when searching for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassination Denial is also a new system, where an enemy is denoted with a white colour if they are an instant kill, a yellow colour if you need to deal some damage, and a red colour if the enemy will completely deny your assassination attempt.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-yasuke-s-stealth-features">Yasuke’s Stealth Features</h3>



<p>Last but not least are Yasuke’s stealth mechanics in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Yasuke is a samurai, a character that players should pick for a more aggressive approach. However, players can be stealthy if they use their bow and start picking enemies off from a distance. Yasuke can get behind enemies and deal swift finishing blows with his melee weapons.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive has announced it's banning mods from public online sessions, blaming them for a "non-negligible" amount of server instability seen by players - even those who don't have mods installed.
</p>
<p>
"We've seen incredible community engagement since launch, and we've noticed that some players have started to create and share mods for Space Marine 2," game director Dmitriy Grigorenko wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/6681747476222836957?l=english">message to the community shared on Steam</a>. "Mods are great, and they will no doubt contribute to this game's longevity."
</p>
<p>
"However, we as developers must also ensure game stability and continuously work towards a smoother experience for all players," Grigorenko continued. "Our data shows that a non-negligible amount of recent server stability issues are related to mods, and that instability impacts even those users who don't have mods installed. We have also received user reports that their save files were corrupted after playing alongside players with mods."

<p>
As a result of the studio's findings, mods will be prohibited from all public online sessions once Space Marine 2's next major update arrives in December. "You will no longer be able to enter a public game if you have mods installed," Grigorenko emphasised. That doesn't mean the end for Space Marine 2 mods, however. Acknowledging them as "a source of fun and creativity", Grigorenko confirmed players can still use mods online in private Operations lobbies, and they'll also be permitted in custom Eternal War lobbies once launched.
</p><p>
"We will also be providing an easy entry point to our backend for games with mods installed," Grigorenkoso added, "so modders won't have to spend time hacking the game executable after each patch." Additionally, the studio intends to give modders access to some of its own tools at a later date, "so they can develop mods with greater ease".
</p>
<p>
Space Marine 2's December update also introduces the Dark Angel Chapter Pack, the Tzaangor Enlightened enemy, plus a new PvE map set on Demerium, titled Obelisk. And if that's still not enough Warhammer to fill your December, Games Workshop recently confirmed Amazon's upcoming Secret Level series will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-getting-an-animated-sequel-in-amazons-new-secret-level-series">include an animated Space Marine 2 sequel</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nows-the-best-time-to-listen-to-aftermaths-52-pickup<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Professional DC Comics expert Alex Jaffe and I have been rereading the ambitious comic book <em>52</em> and podcasting about it. We’ve just reached the halfway point, and even if you haven’t read the series before, we think this is a great place to join us.</p><p>1985’s <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> is a fantastic book on its own merit, but is also a fascinating look at DC Comics’ “events,” which are a way to both boost sales and resolve tricky editorial problems. Through this, writers and artists try to cohere the DC universe from something sprawling and inconsistent into a logical world with more concrete rules. DC has had dozens of such Crisis events, some more successful than others. <em>52</em> is a series that spun off of such an event, but is so, so much better than the circumstances of its creation.</p><p><em>52</em> was an experiment in American comics that worked exactly once. After the event <em>Infinite Crisis</em>, the DC universe jumped ahead in time by one year as a way to explain the new radical status quo for the characters. To help readers learn what happened in that missing year, four of the most popular DC comics writers–Greg Rucka, Mark Waid, Geoff Johns and Grant Morrison–got together to put out a weekly series exploring the events of the DC universe in real time, week by week.</p><p><em>52</em> did not do a particularly good job of telling the editorially mandated story of that missing year, but it did something much better: it was a successful weekly comic book that revitalized several smaller DC Comics characters. For manga readers, that may sound like no big deal, but the American comic books industry does not have the infrastructure to support a weekly, full color comic book. As Jaffe and I have explored this comic in depth, we’ve learned how many times this project almost failed. Most recently, I learned that in one week, the line art got lost while in transit to the Brazilian studio that inked the book, and they had to do a rush job working off photocopies that were overnighted. The fact that this comic book was released on time every week was a miracle. The fact that it’s <em>also extremely good</em> almost defies reality.</p><p>If you haven’t read <em>52</em>, feel free to start at the beginning of the podcast and read along with us. If you just want to start listening, <a href="https://aftermath.site/52-pickup-podcast-dc-comics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest, episode 27, is a great place to start</a>. Jaffe and I summarize each of the simultaneously running plotlines in the book. For Aftermath subscribers, we have a ton of bonus episodes for people who want to know more about the projects that spun off of <em>52</em>, including many aspects of the DC extended universe movies (except the Zach Snyder films, which Jaffe will not watch unless he personally receives three thousand dollars). We’ve also spoken to artists who have worked on <em>52</em>, including Greg Rucka, Mark Waid, and Geoff Johns. I have not given up on interviewing Grant Morrison, and if anyone has their contact information please do reach out.</p><p>Understanding <em>52</em> is the key to unlocking the entirety of DC comics. It is an exercise in its star writers exploring their specific fixations, working with and around an editorial mandate, and following in the tradition of <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> to use fiction to solve other editorial problems. I doubt we’ll ever see a comic book like it ever again, but you may see adaptations of bits and pieces of this book in popular culture as James Gunn takes control of the DC movie universe. I mean, it already began before his tenure—The Rock’s <em>Black Adam</em> movie is directly inspired by the Black Adam storyline in <em>52</em>. But Gunn in particular has the same fondness for the freaks and losers of the DC universe as the writers of <em>52</em>, like Peacemaker, Vigilante, the Creature Commandos. His comic book inspiration for the upcoming <em>Superman</em> movie comes from a <em>52</em> writer, Grant Morrison. These are the kinds of stories and characters that truly differentiate DC from Marvel, and made a lifelong DC obsessive out of me.</p><p>Jaffe and I have already embarked on reading the second half of the series, where the narrative gets even weirder. I hope you’ll join us.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But thanks to recent events, their new strategy is mostly unchanged from their old one.</p>

<h2>Asmodee Group's Future Acquisition Plans</h2>

<p>According to its Capital Markets Day <a href="https://ir.financialhearings.com/asmodee-cmd-2024" rel="nofollow">presentation</a>, Asmodee Group plans to restart its strategy of buying smaller board game publishers and distributors following their separation from Embracer Group.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/catan-game-board-image.jpg?itok=5LTGCh3k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/catan-game-board-image.jpg?itok=KkimFzmJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This strategy is central to how the company has become one of the largest tabletop companies in the business. The broad group of companies under Asmodee's ownership includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/z-man-games-announces-arkham-horror-lovecraft-letter-eldritch-twist-on-classic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Z-Man Games</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-unlimited-shadows-of-galaxy-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fantasy Flight Games</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-is-coming-to-board-game-arena" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Catan Studios</a>.</p>

<p>In the presentation, Asmodee Group's CEO, Thomas Koegler, states they have a pipeline of more than 20 acquisition opportunites. Those opportunities include social and party game studios across the US and EU, and local distribution players to help strengthen their position in established companies.</p>

<p>According to Koegler, the acquisition targets being monitored are companies Asmodee knows well. Most of them are business partners the company interacts with on a daily basis spread across distribution and publishing. None of these companies were explicitly named.</p>

Those circumstances include being bought by Embracer Group in 2021. This was part of a string of purchases by Embracer, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Space Marine 2</em></a> developer Saber Interactive and The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-lord-of-the-rings-prototypes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a> IP.</p>

<p>This came to an end when one of Embracer Group's deals fell through and they were saddled with <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2023/06/13/asmodee-owner-embracer-group-to-make-layoffs-to-help-tackle-1-5bn-debt-pile/" rel="nofollow">$1.45 billion</a> in debt. This lead to layoffs, selling studios, spinning off Asmodee Group and saddling them with €900 million in debt.</p>

<p>That debt is less daunting thanks to an investment by Embracer. As part of the proceeds of selling mobile game developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Easybrain</a>, Embracer <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-intends-to-contribute-eur-400m-to-asmodee-and-presents-asmodees-financial-targets-dividend-policy-and-net-financial-debt/" rel="nofollow">is investing</a>&nbsp;€400m into Asmodee Group.&nbsp;€300 million will go towards the debt, the&nbsp;€100 million remainder will go to strengthening their balance sheet ahead of their company listing, allowing them to continue their M&amp;A business strategy.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is making changes to how it handles stealth, versus other games in the long-running series. Gone is the companion eagle who can spot enemies for you, for a start; instead, players can hide in the - hey - shadows, lie on their tummies for the first time, and make use of a "shinobi and assassin arsenal" of smoke bombs and bells.
</p>
<p>There are old moves that are coming back after an absence, too: Shadows will allow for 'double assassinations' again.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ubisoft outlined their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/4478361902017151340">approach to stealth in a new blog post</a>, which also includes links out to brief illustrative videos.
</p>
<p>"For the first time in the Assassin's Creed series, hiding in the shadows will make you invisible to enemies. During nighttime, any pocket of shadows becomes a dynamic hiding spot in which you can progress without being seen. This applies to both interiors and exteriors," explains the post. "The ability to use shadows in this way invites you to carefully study your environment for hiding opportunities and routes... or create them yourself by destroying lanterns with a shuriken."
</p>
<p>Likewise, "Naoe and Yasuke are the first protagonists able to go prone in the series." While lying down, you can roll in any direction, crawl under certain buildings, and commit special ankle-based assassination attacks.
</p>
<p>The post mostly focuses on Naoe, one of Shadows' two protagonists, who will carry a smoke bomb, shinobi bells for tossing to distract guards, throwing knives called Kunai, and shuriken which can stun enemies. Yusuke seems to have a similar set of stealth capabilities, but with a different arsenal and some unique wrinkles that will apparently be outlined at a later time.
</p><p>Perhaps most interesting is the return of double assassinations, a one-time iconic feature of the series. "By equipping the Tanto as one of your main weapons and unlocking the dedicated skill, you can eliminate two enemies standing next to each other at once with your Hidden Blade - whether on the ground or from the air," says the post.</p>
<p>The various RPG mechanics of more recent games of the series still remain, however, so it's possible to try to have your attempt denied if you have neglected your "Assassin Hidden Blade upgrades". The assassination prompt will change colour to let you know the outcome in advance: white if it's an instant kill, yellow if you'll deal just some damage, and red if it won't work at all.
</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows was originally supposed to come out this year, but was delayed until February 14th, 2025 seemingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-due-to-ubisoft-finally-listening-to-developers-pushing-for-a-delay-for-some-time-says-report">at staff's urging</a> and in response to somewhat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">lukewarm sales of Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Outlaws continues to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-latest-patch-is-out-and-aims-to-make-stealth-and-combat-more-satisfying">receive patches to improve its own stealth systems post-release</a>.
</p>
<p>I love a good lie down in a video game, so these changes sound appealing to me. I still hate that enemies can out-level a knife, though. My reward for the risk of getting close to an enemy, particularly a strong one, should be the ability to take them out in a single blow - although I realise that other philosophies of stealth may be valid also.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Increasingly, people have gotten in the habit of pre-ordering DLC too, paying up front for content that won’t be delivered for months or even years, if ever. Valve’s now cracking down on the whole thing with stricter rules for companies selling everything from DLC packs to season passes.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195805" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: September 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="338" data-playlist="195805,196013,196131" data-current="195805"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: September 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21320.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Steam <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/seasonpass&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/seasonpass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will now require more transparency</a></span> around season pass and DLC content, including details about what’s included and expected release dates. Anything that ends up delayed could then potentially be eligible for a partial refund. “By offering a Season Pass, you are promising future content,” the new guidelines to development partners read. “In the process of launching a Season Pass you will be asked to commit to a launch timing for each content release in the Season Pass. That launch timing is a commitment to both customers and Steam.”</p><p>  Steam adds that while game development is complex and challenging, with delays sometimes necessary and understandable, companies will only get to reschedule DLC and season pass release timing once. “If you aren’t ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC AND when each DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn’t offer a Season Pass on Steam,” the company writes. </p><p>In addition, season passes are supposed to include at least one piece of content that’s already accessible at launch unless it’s for a currently unreleased game. Even if there aren’t customer complaints in a given instance, Steam reserves the right to auto-refund players for any potential violations of the new rules. And if any DLC is cancelled outright, players will get the “value of unreleased DLC” refunded into their accounts instead of relying on whatever in-game currency or other make-good the companies promise instead. </p><p>It sounds like the sections on Steam store pages beneath the buy button that list all of the microtransactions included in a game are about to get even more chaotic to look at, but at least it will hopefully incentivize companies to be more conservative about what they promise and charge for. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, Final Fantasy XIV Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida has answered at least some of these questions in a new video released exclusively to IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While we were keen on the idea of a mobile version, we had doubts about adapting some core aspects such as monetization and core gameplay to be more accessible to mobile users. Therefore, we provided challenging feedback to the Final Fantasy XIV Mobile dev team," Yoshida explains.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida goes on to reveal that Final Fantasy XIV Mobile will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/11/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-review">indeed start with A Realm Reborn</a> — the original campaign that helped reboot Square Enix's struggling MMORPG back in 2013. The rest of the content will then be "released gradually based on player feedback."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, Final Fantasy XIV and FFXIV Mobile will be developed and operated independently, with FFXIV naturally being ahead in its release schedule," Yoshida says. "However, we see FFXIV Mobile as a sister title and we are thoroughly involved in its supervision. We will continue to provide guidance and feedback as the project moves forward, hoping that both versions will grow hand-in-hand."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is the Final Fantasy XIV will be relatively similar to the PC and console version, though Yoshida does not say whether it will unify accounts or progression. In addition to "faithfully recreating the story for mobile users," it will incorporate elements like the Gold Saucer, Triple Triad, and crafting and gathering. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We see FFXIV Mobile as a sister title and we are thoroughly involved in its supervision</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the battle system, Yoshida doesn't offer many specifics on how it is being adapted to mobile, but does allude to its virtual joystick and how the actions are being tuned for touchscreen play. "In particular, when it comes to the battle system, which involves player parties, we had to adjust each duty and its mechanics to ensure players would have a satisfying experience. Our battle and content designers as well as myself personally played through early builds and provided feedback on how to create a multiplayer experience that would be enjoyable to mobile users."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, the biggest difference between Final Fantasy XIV Mobile and the original release on PC console is that the former version will be fully free-to-play. However, that doesn't mean it will include "gacha" play or other exploitive mechanics. Instead, Yoshida says it will be geared toward encouraging "long-term engagement."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our goal is to ensure that players can enjoy Final Fantasy XIV for a long time while generating a small and sustainable revenue allowing as many people as possible to play the game. So, there's no need to worry too much — just dive in and enjoy the game," Yoshida says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida says that team will aim to gather feedback and begin conducting tests, including monetization in various regions globally. It will launch first in mainland China and gradually expand to a global release. In the meantime, Final Fantasy XIV continues to move head on PC and console, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail expansion having come out earlier this year</a>, and it sounds like there's still plenty more to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For us, there's no finish line," Yoshida says. "As long as I'm still around and haven't retired I will continue to give my all to Final Fantasy XIV."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

The Ukrainian game developer behind this first-person shooter survival-horror title was derailed by Russia's invasion of its country in 2022. But the game was finally released earlier this month with some noticeable issues. Fortunately, a day-one patch has reportedly dealt with some of those problems, while others remain.</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-tech-review-pc-xbox-series-x-s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer and Digital Foundry</a>, the patch arrived after reviewers had already played through Stalker 2. The good news is that this patch seems to have significantly helped the game's frame-rate performance. But the site notes that "the game still suffers from everything to minor, amusing bugs to more serious issues and heavy CPU utilization." On Xbox Series X, the game is said to occasionally freeze entirely for a few seconds when visiting large towns, before continuing with an erratic rate of frames per second.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHQ3jAeza60" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cHQ3jAeza60" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Overall, the first impression left by Stalker 2 remains positive. GameSpot's Richard Wakeling wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-in-the-zone/1900-6418320/" data-ref-id="1900-6418320">Stalker 2 review</a> notes that it "boldly sticks to the studio's vision of a seamless open-world survival shooter, which the series has always strived to be. It's rough around the edges and uncompromising in a way that is sometimes off-putting. Yet the series' emergent gameplay remains intact and is further complemented by a fascinating setting and the most accomplished combat in the series so far." However, Wakeling also reiterated many of the technical issues stated above, as well as crashes and other bugs that hampered the experience.</p><p>Xbox released the behind-the-scenes documentary <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/war-game-trailer-chronicles-the-making-of-stalker-2-during-wartime/1100-6526549/" data-ref-id="1100-6526549">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> last month, which chronicles the ordeal that GSC Game World's team went through in order to complete the game during war time. Ultimately, many of the developers had to leave Ukraine to finish the development while others remained behind to fight for their country. That war continues to this day with no resolution in sight.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' stealth has been much debated, though not hotly. Some people think it's rubbish, some others think it's basically fine. Ubisoft themselves seem to think it's one of the key issues with the game, with the creative director previously saying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-admits-forced-stealth-sections-are-incredibly-punishing-says-next-patch-will-ease-up-on-them">the forced stealth sections are "incredibly punishing"</a>.
</p>
<p>Now there's a new patch, apparently Outlaws' biggest yet, and stealth and combat are firmly in the crosshairs. The AI and player detection has changed; you can now choose combat in areas where it was previously not allowed; and enemies have had weak points added, for those who wish to cause massive damage.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Title update 1.4.0 has several notable changes, but the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-140">patch notes</a> neatly call them out, so I'm going to quote them here:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Notable updates to stealth and combat that allow players greater choice, including using stealth or reaching for their blaster, even in syndicate territories in cities.</li>
<li>Enemy AI and detection improvements, with players being notified when they're being detected and can choose to escalate or change tactics to remain in stealth.</li>
<li>Enemy weak points have been added to reward strategic gameplay, which if targeted can trigger explosions or cause enemies to die in spectacular new ways.</li>
<li>Re-tuned Kay's blaster and pickup weapons to improve the combat experience, including being able to carry two handed weapons in more situations.</li>
<li>Facial expressions and animations in dialogue scenes have been improved, the option to toggle off the cinematic lens during gameplay has been added, and the visibility of distant lights has been improved.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The full list of changes has plenty of interest in it. As well as enemy noggins now taking more damage when shot, weapons themselves have been adjusted, with new damage values across the board and revisions to spread and recoil. As if to balance these changes, enemies will now use cover more capably.
</p><p>"It’s hard to get lost in the scoundrel fantasy of stealth that lets you knock out an imperial officer in the middle of conversation with a subordinate to no suspicion; that lets you drop loudly from a walkway a few feet away from an oblivious stormtrooper, only to take him down with one of several ponderous, bubble-wrapped canned animations," wrote Nic in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws review</a>. "But there’s still fun in the <em>performance</em> of outsmarting science fiction’s most famously maladroit mooks, even if all you’re doing is keeping crouching pace with the reverse side of a floating baggage carrier."
</p>
<p>I've yet to play Outlaws, but I'd like it to be good, and I typically enjoy crouching around Ubisoft games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>. Whatever you thought of it at release, it's nice that they're continuing to bring it up to scratch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If a DLC drop gets delayed, Steam will let developers reschedule it up to 3 months later. And if developers have to cancel a DLC, buyers must get a refund for the item value.</p><p>Steam is also redefining what a season pass is:</p><div><blockquote><p>Because a Season Pass is effectively a DLC pre-purchase, creating a Season Pass on Steam has many of the considerations and restrictions as outlined in the documentation on&nbsp;<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/prepurchase">pre-purchases</a>. For these reasons, we will not offer a Season Pass except in a few rare cases with partners with which we have a well-established relationship and that have a proven track record on Steam.</p></blockquote></div><p>Steam also provided a strong disclaimer for developers:</p><div><blockquote><p>If you aren’t ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC AND when each DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn’t offer a Season Pass on Steam.</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/pc-gaming/steam-is-forcing-games-to-be-more-clear-about-whats-in-their-season-passes-and-only-allowing-devs-with-a-proven-track-record-to-sell-them/">As noted by <em>Games Radar</em></a>, the new rules might be more challenging for indie developers who don’t have a lot of games under their belts to pass Steam’s requirements. They also may not have enough resources to build up a guaranteed DLC list — but in that case perhaps they aren’t big enough to offer a season pass anyway.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301975/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-plan"><h2>Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have spelled out their plans for DOGE</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301740/hyundai-ioniq-9-three-row-electric-suv-laas"><h2>The Hyundai Ioniq 9 is a three-row electric SUV with room to grow</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300569/jaguar-rebrand-new-logo-ev"><h2>Jaguar is now JaGUar</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300617/doj-google-search-antitrust-chrome-breakup"><h2>DOJ says Google must sell Chrome to crack open its search monopoly</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301489/amazon-echo-show-21-smart-display-price-specs-release-date"><h2>Amazon’s new&nbsp;Echo&nbsp;Show 21 has a huge screen and built-in&nbsp;smart home&nbsp;hub</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
