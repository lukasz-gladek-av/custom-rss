            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tequila-works-auctions-off-its-brand-and-ips/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/tequila-works-cancels-game-and-lays-off-a-few-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceling a new game</a> and laying off employees in October 2024, Spanish developer Tequila Works closed down around a month later due to insolvency. Now, the Spanish website Escrapalia has <a href="https://www.escrapalia.com/en/event/evento-de-subasta-activos-intangibles-de-tequila-works-s-l-202503311113069684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the auction details for the brand itself and all of its assets.</p>
<p><em>The auction comprises the following assets grouped into 9 lots, classified according to their nature and stage of development.</em></p>
<p><em>Bundles included in the event:</em><br>
<em>Video games published with consolidated intellectual property:</em><br>
<em>Deadlight</em><br>
<em>Rime</em><br>
<em>GYLT</em><br>
<em>The Invisible Hours</em><br>
<em>Video games in development (with vertical slice available):</em><br>
<em>Brawler Crawler</em><br>
<em>Dungeon Tour</em><br>
<em>The Ancient Mariner</em><br>
<em>Ideas Tequila Works</em><br>
<em>Corporate Identity Assets:</em><br>
<em>"Tequila Works" Brand</em></p>
<p><em>The assets will be transferred under the exclusive account and risk of the successful bidder and are subject to the specific contractual conditions detailed in each lot sheet. The technical, legal and commercial documentation will be available in a digital data room accessible upon signature of NDAs.</em></p>
<p>Bids have already started, with RiME and GYLT already at €15.5K after 150 bids each. Bidding will go on until May 14. The former was by far the most critically acclaimed of the games released by the Spanish studio throughout its 15-year history. Back then, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rime-when-in-doubt-follow-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a 9 out of 10 score</a> from Wccftech reviewer Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>RiME does great what it sets out to do: provide an emotional and engaging experience that very few players will be able to forget. As with similar games, however, the Tequila Works developed adventure is not a game for everyone: it is a journey of mystery and self-discovery, a journey that's supposed to make players think, and not only about the puzzles. Those looking for enemies to defeat around every corner will probably end up being disappointed.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>After such a long and troubled development, many feared that RiME would be a failure, but Tequila Works proved that there can be light at the end of the tunnel. With peculiar storytelling, varied puzzles, well-crafted platforming elements and gorgeous presentation, RiME can rival with the unique beauty of Team ICO's games.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-17-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-7-release-date-revealed.1161711/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-17-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.7, with the latest update for the gacha action RPG due to end the first season later this month.</p>

<p>Arriving on April 23rd,&nbsp;Version 1.7 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-16-march" rel="nofollow">follows on from March's Version 1.6</a>, and HoYoverse says it'll mark "the grand finale of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Season One". The story will revolve around the Sacrifice crisis; you'll "finally reveal the long-sought truth" behind the crisis and learn more about two new characters as well.</p>

<p>Both of those characters, Vivian and Hugo, will be available as S-Rank agents, and it sounds like they'll be heavily involved in the climactic story of this update as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.7-release-date-vivian.jpg?itok=yDWwETYS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.7-release-date-vivian.jpg?itok=TMvkPnDW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.7 arrives later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>The first S-Rank agent, Vivian, is an Ether Anomaly Agent who uses her parasol and rapier to shift "seamlessly" between ground attacks and aerial combat. She can also amplify Anomaly damage and boost her team's Corruption damage.</p>

<p>Hugo, meanwhile, is an S-Rank Ice Attack Agent who uses a suitcase that transforms into a scythe. How very&nbsp;<em>Gungrave</em>. He can increase his damage based on enemies' stun duration, and he's got a pretty good area-of-effect game as well.</p>

<p>This version's banners will also bring back Jane and Lighter for reruns, so if you missed your chance to recruit them both to your team when they debuted, you'll have another shot at doing so now.</p>

<p>According to HoYoverse,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.7 will also provide opportunities to "unwind or embrace new challenges through in-game events" like the new "Say It With Flowers" shop management minigame.</p>




<p>If you prefer a more thrilling challenge, the return of Bangboo Bash, which sees you participating in "obstacle and survival courses" to earn exclusive rewards, is also making a return in this Version cycle.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.7 arrives on April 23rd. The game is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-release-date-seemingly-leaked</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-seemingly-leaked-via-steam.1161708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-release-date-seemingly-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>release date may have been leaked by a now-amended Steam blog post, if a new report is to be believed.</p>

<p>According to the folks at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-old-country-release-date-revealed-steam/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a>, a post was recently uploaded to the game's Steam page in which an upcoming PAX livestream was highlighted. The livestream will be aired in early May, and it's aiming to celebrate the 23-year lifespan of the&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the post, a release date of August 8th was apparently listed. I say "apparently", because the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/592894082264596999" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">same post</a> has since been scrubbed of that information, although the promo for the PAX livestream remains.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-leak-lemons.jpg?itok=JbuvzkbE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-leak-lemons.jpg?itok=ZruTkqYt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nice lemons. Be a shame if anything were to happen to them.</figcaption></figure><p>At the moment,&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>simply has a broad release window of "2025" listed, and it would make sense if a full release date was announced during a retrospective of the&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>series as a whole. We'll probably have to wait until May for confirmation, though.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>, it's the latest entry in the&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>series, which so far consists of three mainline entries (not counting remakes like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mafia-definitive-edition" rel="nofollow"><em>Mafia: Definitive Edition</em></a>, that is).</p>

<p>Although the games are technically open-world sandbox affairs, they're usually much more focused on their narratives than on freeform gameplay, so you might want to put comparisons to&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>out of your mind.</p>

<p><em>The Old Country&nbsp;</em>is the series' first game not to be set after the previous one, chronologically speaking; instead, it's a prequel taking place in 1900s Sicily, where you'll play as indentured laborer Enzo Favara as he seeks a better life for himself.</p>




<p>Assuming this leak is correct, you'll be able to get your hands on&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>on August 8th, when it'll launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mafia-the-old-country/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mafia-the-old-country/9P834N9S4LL0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/646776/switch-2-price-editorial-dollar-yen-exchange-rate-inflation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-nintendo-can-get-away-with-a-450-switch-2-price.1161705/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/646776/switch-2-price-editorial-dollar-yen-exchange-rate-inflation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When Nintendo announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">the Switch 2 would cost $450</a>, my initial reaction was disappointment. “Why does it cost so much more?” I thought to myself. “Why does Japan get it cheaper?” my brain jealously added, once I learned that Nintendo would sell <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/switch2">a Japan-only model</a> for the equivalent of just $333.</p><p>It felt like Nintendo was about to overcharge the entire rest of the world for a modest improvement to its original $300 console, one that doesn’t come with an OLED display <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644457/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controller-hall-effect-joystick-drift">or anti-drift magnetic sticks</a>. Surely it can’t cost Nintendo that much more to make, especially seeing how it’s selling the exact same hardware for so much “less” in Japan? </p><p>But while Nintendo might be charging more than I’d like to spend, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive">particularly with its $80 games</a> and its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/645351/auto-draft">button that makes you pay extra</a>, I no longer think the company’s being distinctly unfair to gamers outside of Japan. The $450 price makes more sense when you consider what’s happened to the dollar and the yen. </p><p>Since its March 3rd, 2017, debut, Nintendo basically hasn’t changed the price of the original Switch in either the US or Japan. The portable console cost $300 USD or ¥32,378 in 2017; it costs the same $300 USD or a very slightly higher ¥32,978 today, eight years later. But the US economy and the Japanese economy have <em>not</em> been the same since 2017. Inflation and exchange rates have drastically changed since then.</p><p>On the one hand, the US dollar now buys less in the US than it did in 2017. Dramatic US inflation means that an original $300 Switch <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">would cost</a> nearly $400 if introduced today. The same is not true in Japan, which has historically had low inflation, or even deflation, until fairly recently. A ¥32,378 Switch <a href="https://www.officialdata.org/japan/inflation/2017?amount=32378">would cost</a> <a href="https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/cpi/index.html">more like</a> ¥36,000 today if Nintendo had followed the trend.</p><p>On the other hand, US dollars are now worth dramatically <em>more</em> in Japan because the Japanese yen is remarkably weak. Compare: on January 13th, 2017, the day Nintendo announced the original Switch’s price, you could only get 114 yen per US dollar. On April 2nd, 2025, the day Nintendo announced the Switch 2, each dollar was worth almost 150 yen. Each dollar buys 30 percent more in Japan than it did back then.</p><p>Japan is experiencing more tourism than ever before as a result of that weak yen, to the point some particularly scenic locations have become overrun — <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/fujikawaguchiko-japan-photo-blocking-barrier-intl-hnk/index.html">it was international news</a> when a small town near Mount Fuji erected a barrier to keep people from blocking the streets while duplicating an iconic Instagram shot of the mountain merged with a convenience store. I just came back from a two-week trip to Japan, and I’ve never eaten so well for so little cash. </p><p>But Japanese residents can’t say the same. Not only is Japan starting to experience <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3300871/people-are-angry-japan-braces-new-unknown-prolonged-inflation">inflated food prices</a>, but their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYd7yI5Hd6s">wages reportedly aren’t keeping pace</a>. It’s not fair to say, “Oh, Japan only has to pay $330 for the Switch 2 while we pay $450,” because <em>both</em> the Japanese and international versions cost almost exactly 50 percent more than Nintendo charges for an original Switch. Going from $300 to $450 is a 50 percent increase; going from the Switch’s ¥32,978 to the Japan-only Switch 2’s ¥49,980 is 51.6 percent. That suggests Nintendo might be telling the truth that the price <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643277/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-doug-bowser-interview">was not designed to preempt tariffs</a>.</p><p>Instead, the disparity we see is likely because the dollar goes so much further right now, and because the yen does not. As one Tokyo-based game streamer <a href="https://x.com/aevanko/status/1907818983480336424">put it</a>: “Salaries and cost of living hasn’t changed at all here so 49,980 feels like 450 usd.” A fun thought experiment: if exchange rates were the same as they were in 2017, the Japan-only Switch 2 would cost $434 in US money. It would cost $450 USD there if the dollar sinks to 111 yen or below, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JPYUSD=X/history/?period1=1488326400&amp;period2=1744156800">which it did</a> during large portions of 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.</p><p>If Japan-based Nintendo decided that the right price for the Switch 2 is 50 percent more than the original Switch, it does kind of follow that the US model would cost 50 percent more, too.</p><p>Even the region lock makes some sense, as much as I hate the idea. If Nintendo didn’t lock it down, foreigners could take advantage of the weak yen to buy and scalp the Japanese versions all over the world, similar to what’s <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/best-of-2024-the-truth-about-retro-game-hunting-in-a-post-pandemic-japan">already reportedly happening with Japan’s retro game stores</a>.</p><p>But can Nintendo <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553517/price-interview-tariffs">justify charging 50 percent more</a> for a new handheld eight years later? That’s where I’m less sure. While US inflation might help justify a $400 Switch (again, the $300 original Switch would cost nearly $400 in today’s money) or even a $80 game, I think it’s more that Nintendo can <em>afford to get away</em> with a $450 Switch because real competition is slim.</p><div><p>Sony and Microsoft won’t have true handheld PlayStations and Xboxes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/628073/microsoft-xbox-handheld-project-kennan-notepad">for years to come</a>, and handheld PC makers are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24351383/handheld-pcs-challenge-switch-2-editorial">still struggling to beat the Steam Deck</a>, let alone the Switch. (Nintendo can sometimes sell more Switches in a month than handheld gaming PCs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">sell in a year</a>.) </p></div><p>And while you can currently buy a new PS5 in the US for less than a Switch 2, that isn’t true in Japan — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24229420/ps5-prices-are-going-up-again-in-japan">after <em>three</em> price hikes</a>, the cheapest PS5 Digital Edition now costs ¥72,980, 46 percent more than the new Japan-only Switch, and Sony’s pricey PS5 Pro costs a staggering ¥119,980 there. </p><p>Even Japan’s cheapest Steam Deck costs 20 percent more than a Switch 2, at ¥59,800 for the 256GB LCD model, so the Switch really and truly stands alone. Perhaps that’s why the gamer vibe in Japan is reportedly quite positive despite a 50 percent higher price. “The general consensus among Japanese gamers in response to this has been “Thank you Nintendo, please become the ruling party of our country next,” <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-pricing-discourse-in-japan-reaches-stunned-silence-as-gacha-gamers-bring-up-their-spending-habits/">writes <em>Automaton</em></a>.</p><p>The vibe definitely isn’t as rosy in the US, but at least the price now makes some sort of sense to me. And now that President Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646029/trump-announces-a-90-day-pause-on-tariffs-outside-of-china">given companies like Nintendo a 90-day reprieve</a> from many of his tariffs, a period of time that covers the Nintendo Switch 2’s June 5th launch, Nintendo may be able to have its cake and eat it, too. Nintendo can launch with its promised price and blame Trump for any later increase. Perhaps today’s $450 will look generous by comparison. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Back in the 90s, there were essentially two kinds of Sonic The Hedgehog 2 player. Firstly, the juvenile Mussolinis who monopolised the Blue Blur himself in the callously-defined "single player" mode, and secondly, the absolute saints and/or craven appeasers who consented to be Sonic's sidekick Tails, and had to spend the whole run struggling to keep pace with the Sonic player's camera. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Tails in Sonic 2 "single player" is a grieving immortal, his soul lashed to the wheel of Sonic's whirling footsteps, doomed to respawn indefinitely until his prickly tormentor finally exhausts their shared stock of lives. Yours was an existence doled out in offscreen "du-dum" noises, as poor Tails ran half-knowingly into any spikes or Robotnik creations eclipsed by the Sonic player's passage. Yes, I'm aware there was an actual splitscreen mode, but let's be honest with ourselves, 30 years on - it made your TV look like a mitotic error.
</p>
<p>
Sonic players will look at the just-announced multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platform game</a> SpeedRunners 2: King Of Speed and see only another  checkerboard mountain of astroturf to conquer. Tails players will look at it and see an opportunity to put everything they've learned from those Mega Drive humiliations to the test. For SpeedRunners 2 is a game about a bunch of Tails players competing to be Sonic.

<p>
I apologise if I'm making too big a fuss of the SpeedRunners concept. I missed the first one, which came out in the 2010s, and which we have covered in no less than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/speedrunners">five seperate feature articles</a>. In any case, the apposite comparisons here are probably Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Trials and The Flash. 
</p>
<p>
In SpeedRunners 2, up to eight superheroes sprint through 2D spy-fi levels, striving to be the last remaining character on screen. You've got base movement mechanics such as wall-kicking and a grapple hook, plus power-ups such as missiles, traps and freeze rays with which to Blue Shell the other players into screeching submission. The levels include terrain fixtures such as ceilings you can swing from and boost pads. It all looks slick, jolly and decently nail-biting.
</p>
<p>
"The original multiplayer gameplay formula of SpeedRunners is timeless, unofficially dubbed as the 'Mario Kart of 2D platformers'," comments <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183760/SpeedRunners_2_King_of_Speed/">the Steam page</a>. "With the sequel, our goal is to carefully bring this unique 'SpeedRunners feel' into the new era without compromising on the depth and fluidity of the movement system while still keeping it easy to grasp. On top of that, King of Speed introduces vibrant high-definition graphics and improved netcode." 
</p>
<p>
The game launches later this year. Speaking as a recovering Tails player, I am reasonably stoked. The only thing the trailer seems to be missing is that little intangible margin of error around the screen in Sonic 2 - that Last Chance Saloon from which the double-tufted fox might heroically scoot back into visibility.

            <p>
Beleagured high street chain GAME has begun auctioning off the fixtures and fittings from its Basingstoke head office and main warehouse, following the site's recent closure as part of the company's continued assimilation by its parent firm.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-wont-have-in-store-switch-2-pre-orders">first reported on the closure of GAME's headquarters earlier this week</a>, with the expectation of job losses. 
</p>
<p>
The move is yet another step in the brand's demise as its own entity, as it becomes just another arm of the Frasers Group, which also owns House of Fraser and Sports Direct.
</p>
<p>
GAME's Basingstoke facility had served as its headquarters for more than two decades. Now, dozens of office and kitchen items, warehouse equipment and a few more unusual oddities are all up for auction on <a href="https://bidonline.ncmauctions.co.uk/auctions/9241/ncm-au11168">bidding site NCM Auctions</a>.
</p>
<p>
Items listed include a shopfloor pirate ship display unit for products from TY, the maker of Beanie Babies. That's currently going for £40. Alternatively, you can buy the company's breakroom football table for £120, or a perspex-fronted poster of CJ from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for £30.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-1_SP3fwr5.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>GAME</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Several of the photos give a glimpse behind the scenes in the Basinstoke office - at its board rooms, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-u-turns-on-pokemon-card-price-hustle-that-caused-cost-to-almost-triple">decisions like the one to sell Pokémon cards for almost triple the price</a>, were presumably made. One meeting area has a poster for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expansion Forsaken on the wall. Another small room has a wall decorated with a mural of Nintendo characters.
</p>
<p>The downside? The items are all collection only, so you'll need to be in Basingstoke yourself later this month to pick them up. Suddenly GAME's oversized £10.99 delivery price for those Pokémon cards doesn't seem so bad.</p>
<p>
While GAME's brand still exists, it has largely been reduced nationwide to a concession area within other Frasers Group stores - typically in Sports Direct. 
</p>
<p>
The changes have meant the loss of hundreds of dedicated GAME staff, a continued shift towards GAME's focus of selling toys, and a loss of all the chain's previous customer programmes. 
</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer previously reported, you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-wont-have-in-store-switch-2-pre-orders">won't be able to pre-order a Switch 2 in-store at GAME</a>. Indeed, Eurogamer has been told by GAME staff that in-store pre-orders will now no longer offered for any item, despite outdated messaging on the company's website saying otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-fall-of-game-no-games-no-accessories-instead-we-received-136-zendaya-action-figures">Eurogamer reported on GAME's various ongoing issues as it is further integrated into Sports Direct's Fraser Group, and suffers store closures, redundancies, and stock problems</a>.

		<p>The immersive sim genre is one that’s full of quirky delights as you figure out new and inventive ways to twist the world to your will with the abilities at your disposal. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a>, though, is a game that’s more immersivey and simmy than most.</p>
<p>You see, this is the kind of game where sneaking through vents will raise a sneeze-meter until you loudly achoo and alert guards in the room below. It’s the kind of game where crashing through a glass window leads to shards of glass in your feet… because you have no shoes. Coming from Blendo Games, I’d honestly expect nothing less.</p>
<p><iframe title="SKIN DEEP | Coming to PC April 30" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4SvXMG8Ghaw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We played Skin Deep at New Game Plus last week –&nbsp;a new public show in the same spirit of WASD and Rezzed that’s part of London Game Fest –&nbsp;running through the tutorial and an opening level. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301280/Skin_Deep/">There’s also a demo available on Steam</a>, if you want to try it from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>You’re Nina Pasadena, an insurance commando who’s kept in stasis aboard starships transporting valuable cargo across the galaxy, to wake up and protect the ship from any pirates and gangs that try to board and ransack the place. What happens from there is basically Die Hard in space, as you sneak through vents, make use of your environment and try to take down the invaders one-by-one.</p>


<p>The opening tutorial is a wonderful snapshot of the game’s particular style of action. It’s a sequence of short moments, each themed around a particular control or navigation quirk, before skipping forward in time to the next moment. It feels like a bundle of highlights from a film, but also gives you a good tour through what the game offers.</p>
<p>Skin Deep is unashamedly individualistic, shall we say. The crew of the ship is made up of cats (which have all been captured and locked up in boxes for you to rescue), enemies can have a Skull Keeper ability which, in the case of death, detaches their head and slowly moves them back toward respawn points, and one of the most useful items you can find is black pepper to give enemy goons a nasty sneezing fit.</p>
<p>At that point, you can leap onto their back, guiding them around the room to smash into things until you’ve knocked them out. Then pop off their head and flush them down the trash or squat toilet to remove the threat.</p>
<p>You find interactive elements and moments in the strangest of places, such as smashing the front of a washing machine, releasing all the soapy water over the floor, turning it into a slip-n-slide with the emphasis on slip.</p>

<p>If you get hurt, you can heal yourself from a menu, with some great animations to complement the action. Glass in your feet? You’ll be pulling those shards out from your sole in rather gory fashion. Died in the blast from an explosion? Well, luckily, you can have an auto-defibrillator equipped that will kickstart your heart and give you a second chance.</p>
<p>The wider game seems to drop you into a stage to tackle how you see fit, stringing together a bunch of rooms, populating with enemies to defeat, cats to rescue, and hazards and things to interact with. How you take things on will be up to you. Do you take it slow and steady, making use of the fundamentals of stealth? Or do you learn how to embrace the sheer chaotic potential of your surroundings, blasting pipes, venting rooms by shooting out windows (from both inside and outside), and making the floors slick with soap? There’s sure to be some outrageously slick speed runs in a couple of months.</p>
<p>The twist in the tale is that, as is revealed at the end of the tutorial stage, it’s revealed that it’s not the ship’s cargo that the invaders are after. Sure, they’ve been trying to extract from the cat crew details about your location, but instead of just trying to figure out where the danger to their mission is coming from, it’s because their mission is actually to try and find you. Weird, huh?</p>

<p>All of this is rendered in Blendo’s chunky style. OK, so it’s not quite as chunky as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/07/25/quadrilateral-cowboy-review/">Quadrilateral Cowboy</a>, but it’s still full of retro tech, bright colours and the general vibes that you might expect from an 80s action film.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to like about Skin Deep’s riff on the immersive sim, and I’m keen to see how it all comes together later this month on 30th April.</p>

			<p>In the span of a month and a half, we've gone from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of La Quimera (and the rebranding of 4A Games Ukraine to Reburn) to the confirmation of the release date, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/sci-fi-co-op-shooter-la-quimera-arrives-on-pc-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled</a> for April 25 on PC. However, select players will have the chance to try the new sci-fi first-person shooter game this weekend as part of a Closed Beta Test available via Steam.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we reached out to Reburn to discuss their debut project (which is also their first multiplayer game), the split with 4A Games, and more. Keep reading for the answers from Project Director Oleksandr Kostiuk, CEO Dmytro Lymar, and CTO (Chief Technical Officer) Iurii Sashchuk.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera -  Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVCU_hdG3Iw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How long has La Quimera been in development?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> La Quimera has been in development since 2020, when we began pre-production with a small team. Around 2021, the project moved into full production, though the team was still growing at the time. Unfortunately, the full-scale invasion of Ukraine at the beginning of 2022 disrupted our plans and affected our timeline—like many others, we had to adapt to a new reality while keeping the project moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>The press release said you received funds for it. Can you disclose the source? Did you ever consider partnering with a publisher?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dmytro Lymar:</strong> The development of the game has been funded through profits from our previous projects, along with additional undisclosed minority investments. These funds were raised to support both the growth of the company and the development of the game. While we are completely open to potential partnerships with publishers - both now and in the future - the current state of the industry makes such collaborations more difficult than usual.</p>
<p><strong>Can you discuss the split of 4A Games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dmytro Lymar</strong>: The split of 4A Games happened back in 2014 when there was an initial invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation and the annexation of Crimea. However, we continued to work on the same project, Metro Exodus, as one team. After completing work on it in 2020, we started our own project, La Quimera, while the other part of 4A Games continued working on Metro and, around the same time, was acquired by Embracer Group. Additionally, due to the confusion of having two companies with the same name now working on different projects, we had to somehow resolve this, and we agreed that it would be better to keep the 4A Games trademark with Metro, so our studio got a new name - Reburn.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose Latin America as the central location for your sci-fi setting? Did you consult with local experts to ensure an appropriate portrayal of the culture?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> Latin America fascinated us as a setting because of its incredible mix of cultures and rich historical layers. Combined with the near-future timeframe of La Quimera, it gave us almost limitless creative freedom to build a unique and compelling universe.</p>
<p>We’ve consulted with Latin American experts to get feedback and help analyze our work to ensure respectful and thoughtful representation. It’s also worth noting that the world of La Quimera is very much a vision of a cosmopolitan future—where the region's historical and cultural roots are blended with new technologies and global influences brought in by settlers from around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit more about the setting and the story's background?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> While we’d prefer to keep some of the significant plot twists under wraps for now, we can share a bit about the setting and story. La Quimera takes place in the 2060s, in a future shaped by political instability that has completely redrawn national borders, effectively erasing global states.&nbsp; The world now resembles a kind of feudal fragmentation on a global scale, yet with 21st-century technology. In this dystopian, post-industrial world, private military companies and corporations that control key resources—such as energy and information—hold significant power and influence.</p>
<p>The game takes place in Nuevo Caracas, a newly-formed city-state where elements of the past mix with future trends. The game’s lore is so rich and detailed that it could fill dozens of pages. We’re incredibly grateful to our writers, Nick and Ed, for their work in bringing this world to life. We’re also planning to launch an online encyclopedia for the game’s world, allowing anyone who’s interested to dive deeper into the setting and learn more.</p>
<p><strong>You said that La Quimera is a story-driven game. I assume this means it won't be semi open-world like Metro Exodus, right? Is there any optional side content in La Quimera?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> Yes, we are highly focused on delivering a tight, story-driven experience where the narrative acts as a guide for the player through the world of the game. As a result, we’ve chosen a more linear approach for the design of our locations. That said, players will still be able to discover secret areas and optional zones that aren’t required for the main storyline. The development of additional content for La Quimera is still in progress, and we’re carefully considering how best to expand on the experience while staying true to the core narrative.</p>

The development of additional content for La Quimera is still in progress, and we’re carefully considering how best to expand on the experience while staying true to the core narrative.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How long do you expect the game to take for the average player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> Given the challenges we faced during the development of La Quimera due to the war in Ukraine, we made the decision to focus on a more compact experience while still including the most essential elements of the game.</p>
<p>The main storyline for a solo player will take seasoned FPS fans around 5 hours to complete. If you are looking for some additional challenge with your friends playing cooperatively, this should extend your playtime by quite a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>This is your first co-op game, correct? Can you share the main challenges when making a multiplayer game? Also, how is it going to work in terms of hosting/joining, and will it be cross-play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> Probably the biggest challenge was creating a story-driven game that’s equally engaging whether played solo or with friends. We wanted to ensure the experience remains rich and immersive in both cases, even though there are some nuances that make the two approaches different.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to play both solo and with friends or random players. At the start of each level,<br>
you’ll have the option to choose how you want to play. As for matchmaking, it is a bit too early to say, as currently we release only on Steam, but we aim to make the multiplayer experience as accessible as possible across different platforms.</p>
<p><strong>How does the game scale to take into account co-op players when they join a session?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> The game adjusts the intensity and density of encounters based on the number of players in the session. This includes the number of enemies that can be engaged in combat at once, their overall count, spawn rates, and damage output, all of which scale depending on how many players are present.</p>
<p>Additionally, we’ve developed a system where each player can choose their personal difficulty level in a co-op session. This difficulty will apply specifically to the player who selects it, but it will still be balanced with the difficulty levels of the other players to maintain a fair and enjoyable experience for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>What is your post-launch plan for La Quimera?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> We have a lot of plans and ideas for expanding the storylines and gameplay elements within the world of La Quimera. Player feedback and impressions are also incredibly important to us as we move forward. At this stage, our post-launch plans are still in the works, but we would be excited to share them with the community as soon as they are ready.</p>
<p><strong>Are you still using the 4A Engine or something else? Will the game support NVIDIA DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 4? What about ray tracing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Iurii Sashchuk:</strong> For La Quimera, we’re using Unreal Engine 4, which allows us to create a multiplayer game more easily, having all the necessary tech and tools. However, our experience with the 4A Engine remains a vital foundation—shaping our approach to rendering, performance optimization, multi-threading, streaming, visibility determination, memory management, task scheduling, and content optimization.</p>
<p>Compared to Metro Exodus, we have introduced several key improvements. Notably, we overhauled texture streaming to allow for greater variety and better performance. Scene detail in La Quimera is significantly higher, which required us to develop a new visibility culling system. This lets us handle more objects in a scene without compromising performance. We also made enhancements to Unreal’s shadow mapping cache, enabling us to support more dynamic lights simultaneously. Overall, our goal has been to give artists and designers as much creative freedom as possible while maintaining strong technical performance.</p>
<p>We implemented a custom solution for global (indirect) lighting instead of real-time ray tracing.<br>
This gave us better performance, broader hardware compatibility, and more efficient data storage, while keeping a strong level of visuals. We use DLSS and FSR. They are interesting technologies with frequent improvements. But we have not implemented the latest versions yet, which we plan to implement in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about the recent release of the DirectX Raytracing 1.2 preview with neural rendering support? Do you believe it will take long for it to be applied in games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Iurii Sashchuk:</strong> We’re genuinely excited about the potential of DirectX Raytracing 1.2 and neural rendering. While La Quimera doesn’t currently use real-time ray tracing due to our priority towards achieving strong performance across a wide range of hardware, we do utilize raytracing during the asset creation process to enhance visual quality.</p>
<p>We absolutely see great potential in ray tracing and other neural network–based technologies. These are still relatively early in their development, but we believe they will continue to evolve and eventually become more widely adopted in production environments. As for how quickly this happens—it really depends on specific features, hardware adoption, and the complexity of implementation. We’re following these developments closely and definitely plan to integrate more of these technologies into our future work as they mature.</p>
<p><strong>Would La Quimera support PlayStation 5 Pro if the game makes it to consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Iurii Sashchuk:</strong> We have not yet announced any plans for consoles, so it is difficult to tell anything specific. But we always try to squeeze as much as possible from any hardware, PlayStation 5 Pro should not be an exception.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

But the current <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3E7e?object_uuid=05961934-c1ee-4ca7-b827-976157765e36&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Buy Deal of the Day</a> has me genuinely interested, and not just because I’m weak in the face of shiny foils and stitched-edge playmats. As with all DotD discounts, this is limited just to today as well, so pick up the cheap boosters while you can. Let's dig into what's available, and what I'd recommend picking up.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Discounts On Foundations, Aetherdrift, and More </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s talk <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-foundations-preorders-are-live-right-now-on-amazon">Foundations</a>. This set isn’t trying to wow anyone with lore about a haunted mansion or a squirrel-led uprising. Instead, it focuses on being playable, readable, and shockingly welcoming. I think that’s a big deal, especially since we’re about to get Marvel and Final Fantasy collaborations through Universes Beyond. New players are going to get dropped into the multiverse with zero context, so a solid on-ramp like Foundations is going to be essential.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Foundations Bundle</h2><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218544"><div id="218544" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Foundations Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve never touched a deck in your life, the Foundations Beginner Box is a better teacher than half the humans I’ve seen try to explain Magic at a kitchen table. Pre-constructed decks, visual aids, and a guided tutorial make it absurdly approachable. t. There’s also the Foundations Bundle, which is going for $42.49. That's under market price and loaded with boosters and accessories. It’s great value, especially since Foundations is going to stick around in Standard for five years, giving you time to figure out what the heck a stack is.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Foundations Jumpstart Booster 2-Pack </h2></div><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218545"><div id="218545" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Foundations Jumpstart Booster 2-Pack </h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's Aetherdrift, which is for people who read the card <em>Blasphemous Act</em> and said, “but what if we did more?” The Aetherdrift Bundle is currently $34.99, which is a solid $16 off its usual price. It includes some of the more unhinged red spells and flashy threats to come out of Standard lately, including Marauding Mako (which is basically Magic's version of a landshark with anger issues) and Momentum Breaker, a mono-black tool that's found a home in aggressive Pixie decks. Yes, apparently that’s a thing now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Ravnica Remastered Draft Booster Sleeve</h2></div><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218546"><div id="218546" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Ravnica Remastered Draft Booster Sleeve</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Foundations also includes some pretty desirable chase cards if you're cracking packs. I’m looking at you, Rise of the Dark Realms with the new Borderless treatment, and Sire of Seven Deaths, the Eldrazi with seven keywords that feels like it was printed specifically to cause someone a rules headache. And don’t sleep on Banner of Kinship, which casually turns your Goblin deck into a math test your opponent definitely didn’t study for.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Bundle</h2></div><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218547"><div id="218547" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, I noticed Ravnica Remastered is part of this sale. You can grab a Ravnica Remastered Draft Booster Sleeve for $4.99 (down from $6.99), which is actually one of the cheapest ways to chase after format staples like Crypt Ghast, Spark Double, and Divine Visitation. I think that’s a great price for anyone looking to bulk open product or toss a few into a sealed night with friends.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Collector Booster</h2></div><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218548"><div id="218548" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Collector Booster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I love Ravnica sets. I’ve always been a sucker for guild mechanics, and Ravnica Remastered is basically Wizards saying, “Let’s throw all the good stuff into one nostalgic blender.” You get a mix of old-school Commander hits like <strong>Cyclonic Rift</strong>, weird-but-powerful tech like <strong>Cloudstone Curio</strong>, and alternate art versions that will either delight you or make you question whether you’re playing Magic or flipping through concept art for a lost anime series</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Commander Deck - Living Energy</h2></div><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218549"><div id="218549" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Commander Deck - Living Energy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up a few sleeves myself, partly for the shot at Anime Borderless Bruvac, and partly because I have no impulse control when it comes to reprint sets. You don’t need to justify $5 packs when they include Shock Lands and cards with infinite combo potential.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Fallout Commander Deck - Science!</h2></div><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218550"><div id="218550" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Fallout Commander Deck - Science!</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're already building for Commander or just pretending your collection isn’t entirely impulse buys, the Fallout Commander Deck – Science! is on sale for $33.99. That’s $26 off retail, and includes one of the better face Commanders to come from Universes Beyond: Dogmeat, Ever Loyal, who floods the board with Junk tokens if you build around equipment and auras. In my opinion, this deck is an underrated engine, and you get to play cards like Radstorm and Feral Ghoul, which sound like B-side punk albums but are surprisingly effective in-game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG: Ultra Pro Mana 8 Stitched Edge Playmats</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t usually care about playmats, but these Mana 8 stitched-edge ones are kinda gorgeous. At $16.49, they’re dramatic in all the right ways without costing you the same as a new commander deck. I think the Lotus one is low-key perfection.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 11, 2025 10:23 am</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>The grand finale of the Sacrifice crisis.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.7 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Bury Your Tears With the Past,” will launch on April 23, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [190 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-957540"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Version 1.7 “Bury Your Tears with the Past” will deliver a riveting finale to Season 1’s story. The long-sought truth behind the Sacrifice crisis will finally come to light as Proxies delve into Vivian’s shadowed past and unravel the mysteries behind Hugo’s demise. Amidst the turmoil in New Eridu, a Void Hunter-rank special investigator—assigned by the Mayor—will join forces with Proxies to confront the encroaching darkness, while vibrant in-game events weave moments of joy and cheer into the thrilling and dangerous journey.</p><p>After Hugo’s fall into the Hollow, tensions between Mockingbird and TOPS continue to escalate, and deeper secrets await revelation in this chapter. Partnering with Vivian, Proxies will infiltrate enemy territory to search for the Sacrifice Core, unearth the mysterious past she shares with certain old acquaintances of hers, and expose the Exaltists’ conspiracy. With a formidable new ally, the Sacrifice crisis comes to a climax, finally unveiling the truth behind all the chaos.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_957541"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Mockingbird’s two S-Rank Agents bring elegance and precision to the battlefield. Vivian, an Ether Anomaly Agent, dances across the battlefield with a parasol and rapier, seamlessly shifting between grounded and aerial attacks. Her Basic Attack: Featherbloom amplifies Anomaly damage and synergizes with allies’ EX Special Attacks to boost the team’s Corruption damage. Hugo, an Ice Attack Agent, wields a suitcase that transforms into a sharp scythe, carving through enemies with slashes and devastating area sweeps. When hitting stunned enemies, Hugo can trigger the Totalize effect, elevating his damage based on the enemies’ remaining stun duration. Joining them is Robin, Mockingbird’s agile Bangboo companion, who pelts enemies with randomized cards that have various effects. Additionally, the Physical Anomaly Agent Jane and the Fire Stun Agent Lighter will rerun in this version’s banners.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Beyond the battlefield, Version 1.7 invites Proxies to unwind or embrace new challenges through in-game events. In “Say It With Flowers,” players step into the role of a flower shop manager, crafting gorgeous floral arrangements for different clients. By completing floral design commissions, Proxies will unlock a permanent interactive floral arrangement gameplay for Quality Time mode and receive exclusive rewards, including A-Rank Bangboo Overtimeboo. For thrill-seekers, the adrenaline-fueled Bangboo Bash returns with a ranked mode. Proxies can compete in obstacle and survival courses, earning points based on match placement and rank. Those who ascend the leaderboards can claim exclusive event titles, Polychromes, and other rewards.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,241 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,854 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Across <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight's</a> 14 chapters, you'll be able to find 103 notes to read that add a good chunk of context to the greater story being told.</p>
<p>The storytelling is arguably the best thing about South of Midnight, so you'll want to find and read all of these notes. Here's where to find all the notes in Chapter 3.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 3</h2>
<p>There are a total of 7 notes to find in Chapter 3, and the first one will come ahead of meeting your big fishy friend.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Happiest Day</strong> - You'll find this note right after learning the double-jump ability. It's once again a painted symbol note that appears just ahead of collecting the first Health Filament, so if you've reached the Health Filament and haven't collected it, turn back.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The St. Sylvain Bulletin</strong> - Right after your conversation with Rhubarb, turn back to look at his house. This note is on the very front, right next to the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Follow the Lights</strong> - Before leaving Rhubarb's house, go around the back of it to find a set of stairs leading down to a dock. At the back of the small building, there's a Floof knot and a note that's attached to a small post.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Ain't Wanted Here</strong> - After following the main path from Rhubarb's house, just past the first expanding bramble hazard you'll face, there's a two-story house you can walk into. Just beyond the door and on the right-hand side, you'll find this note next to a wooden owl.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Gift for Corrine</strong> - Once you've cleared the first stigma that reveals a memory, to your left will be a house that you'll notice has a staircase you can weave. Weaving that staircase and following it will lead you to a Floof knot, but not this note. Instead, go beyond the entrance to the house and follow the path to the right. At the end of the dock here you'll find a note and a piece of metal you can push for some extra Floof's.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Beggin' your pardon, Mayor</strong> - After collecting the last note, follow the main path, and at the end of your first wall-running section you'll enter into a two-story house. On the first floor, on a table to the left, you'll find this note to the Mayor.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Come One, Come All!</strong> - This last note for Chapter 3 is on the second floor of the same house you'll find the last note in, attached to a post and just ahead of another Floof knot.</p>
<p>That's where you'll find all 7 notes in Chapter 3 in South of Midnight. Only 89 more to go, if you've been following along these guides.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/streets-of-rage-finally-hits-nintendo-switch-online-plus-two-more-genesis-games.1161639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/streets-of-rage-nintendo-switch-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added three more Sega Genesis games to its Nintendo Switch Online library, and one of them is one of the most celebrated beat-'em-up games of its generation.</p>

<p>Having already brought the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-genesis-november-2024" rel="nofollow"><em>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron</em></a>, super-hard platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-online-june-2023-genesis" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghouls 'n Ghosts</em></a>, and side-scroller&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-gets-new-genesis-games" rel="nofollow">Altered Beast</a>&nbsp;</em>to the Switch Online Genesis lineup, the first game in today's haul is another bona fide classic.</p>

<p>That's right: none other than&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>is making its Nintendo Switch Online debut. You might think you've already played this one on the service, but in fact, you've played the 1992 sequel&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage 2</em>, which was, until today, the only&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>game on Switch Online.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-streets-of-rage-genesis.jpg?itok=TKceEK6N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-streets-of-rage-genesis.jpg?itok=sbCc2yz2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>is finally available on Nintendo Switch Online.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not just about&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage</em>, so if you've never been of the side-scrolling beat-'em-up persuasion, don't worry; there are two more games that might tickle your fancy.</p>

<p>The first of these is&nbsp;<em>Super Thunder Blade</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Space Harrier</em>-slash-<em>Star Fox</em>-style shooter with some impressive (if somewhat hard to look at in the year of our lord 2025) visual effects.</p>

<p>Lastly, today's Genesis haul brings&nbsp;<em>ESWAT: City Under Siege&nbsp;</em>to Switch Online. It's a side-scroller, but it's a shooter with more in common with the likes of&nbsp;<em>Super Turrican&nbsp;</em>or the&nbsp;<em>Contra </em>series&nbsp;than with&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage</em>.</p>

<p>All three of these games are available right now with a Nintendo Switch Online membership, although you will have to pick up the Expansion Pack addon if you want to play them.</p>




<p>These Switch Online games come at a time when Nintendo is gearing up to release the Switch 2, the successor to the original Switch (if the name didn't already give that away).</p>

<p>The console is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to launch on June 5th</a>, although pre-orders in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">US</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">Canada</a> have been delayed due to the former's President Donald Trump imposing sweeping economic tariffs on various countries and economic bodies around the world.</p>

<p>With that being said, Trump subsequently issued a 90-day pause for those tariffs in all countries but China, so there's every possibility that we'll get a new pre-order date for the Switch 2 sometime soon. While we wait, you can check out these three new Genesis games on Switch Online right now if you've got the Expansion Pack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It makes sense that other people want to capitalize on the success of Schedule 1. The indie title continues to eclipse all expectations and is one of the most successful games of 2025. Its creator has now commented on other games copying its title, and also given a hint toward a console port.</p>



<p>The days and weeks are going by, and Schedule 1 is showing no sign of slowing up. The player base is reveling in the chance to deal <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drugs</a> and show up thugs. An ongoing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-rival-drug-dealer-simulator-says-there-is-no-lawsuit-amid-review-bombing-investigation-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigation</a> can’t stop it, and with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new updates adding a Pawn Shop</a> and more value-adding features, it’s hard not to love Schedule 1 right now.</p>



<p>Other companies feel this way as they’re using its name. Schedule 1’s developer has taken to X to address the ongoing movement, and also given hope to PlayStation and Xbox fans.</p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-developer-would-love-to-port-schedule-i-to-console">Schedule 1 Developer Would “Love to Port Schedule I to Console”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It might not be on a computer screen forever. Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Tyler_TVGS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tyler1</a> is the main developer at TVGS—the maker of Schedule 1. This is the company’s first game, and they probably didn’t expect this level of success.</p>



<p>On April 11, Tyler took to X to comment on a recent trend concerning the game: “Hi everyone, As you may be aware, there have been some games on the PlayStation store appearing over the past few weeks with the name ‘Schedule I’ in them. Just confirming these are not affiliated with me in any way.”</p>



<p>You get a lot of ‘smaller’ games appearing on the PS Store in the same fashion as Steam. It can be easy for games to slip through the cracks. But as Schedule 1 isn’t on PlayStation, it gives other games (with the name) a chance to be on there. Whether they get to keep the name remains to be seen. But Tyler1 also commented on Schedule 1’s platform status and plans.</p>



<p>“I’d love to port Schedule I to console when the game is at the right stage for that, but I will announce it to the Schedule I community well before it happens,” he says.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Hi everyone,

<p>Search volume for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 console port</a> is high. The people want it, the people need it, and it’s clear TVGS wants to make it happen. We’ll keep on top of this to see if a Schedule 1 console port does eventually happen.</p>

			<p>The first version of the Dark Souls Remastered Seamless Co-op mod is now available for download, allowing PC players to enjoy the entirety of the game together with other players with little to no restrictions.</p>
<p>The mod, developed by Yui, the same developer behind the Seamless Co-op for <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-now-works-with-shadow-of-the-erdtree-adds-optional-invasions/">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-seamless-co-op-mod/">Dark Souls 3</a>, overhauls the multiplayer component of the vanilla game, allowing up to five players to enjoy the entirety of the game together, removing fog walls and barriers that limit the co-op multiplayer experience of the vanilla game and making game progression and world state sync for all players in a session. To make the experience more enjoyable, the mod also introduces some balance changes with enemy scaling extended to all enemies, unlike the vanilla game, which only has it for bosses, and some quality-of-life improvements, such as the ability to rejoin the session's host from anywhere in the game's world and light sources created by one player in the session becoming available for all players. You can download the mod from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksoulsremastered/mods/899?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and see it in action in the video below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-catan-sixth-edition-is-out-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A brand new edition of <em>Catan</em> is now available. The aptly named <em>Catan Sixth Edition</em>, is the first significant evolution of the iconic strategy game since 2015, bringing a streamlined and more accessible experience to players worldwide.</p>

<h2>The <em>Catan Sixth Edition</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Catan Studio announced the changes coming to <em>Catan Sixth Edition</em>. Generally, the core gameplay that made <em>Catan</em> a pop culture and tabletop gaming staple is still here. Gathering resources, trading among friends, getting into small arguments over wood and sheep, etc..</p>

It will feature brighter box art alongside updated components and packaging. it isn't as elaborate as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-masterpiece-kickstarter-fully-funded-within-hour-promoting-bespoke-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Catan Masterpiece</a> Kickstarter, but it is a modest upgrade nonetheless.</p>

<p>These new components will be part of <em>Catan Sixth Edition's</em> more eco-friendly design. Box trays have been redesigned to be more environmentally conscious, and the box will contain fewer plastic pieces. The box also has expanded storage, allowing it to accommodate the 5-6 Player Extension Pack. This doesn't mean the base box can contain all expansions, but it is a start.</p>

<p>On that topic, <em>Catan Sixth Edition</em> will have several expansions. These include Seafarers, Cities &amp; Knights, and the aforementioned 5-6 Player Extension Pack.</p>

<p>Lastly, the game will feature more inclusive, user-friendly design elements. The game's artwork will portray more diverse character illustrations. The newly textured hex tiles and premium card trays will provide a more tactile play experience.

            <p>
Tequila Works, the indie developer behind Deadlight, Rime and Gylt, is selling off all of its assets in an open auction after declaring bankruptcy at the end of last year. 
</p>
<p>
The rights and trademarks to its games and several unfinished prototypes are now <a href="https://www.escrapalia.com/en/event/evento-de-subasta-activos-intangibles-de-tequila-works-s-l-202503311113069684">listed for sale on auction website Escrapalia</a>, with bids being taken for the next 32 days.
</p>
<p>
Rime and Gylt are currently both fetching the most interest, with around 150 bids for each and an asking price of €15.5k (£13.5k) for each. At the time of writing, Deadlight is going for €2600 (about £2250).
</p>
<p>
Intriguingly, this sale also reveals prototypes for other Tequila Works projects, sold as "vertical slices" the company likely made to pitch to publishers. 
</p>
<p>
The Ancient Mariner is described as an open-world narrative action adventure "focused on human emotions as the engine of gameplay". 
</p>
<p>
Dungeon Tour, meanwhile, would have been a "mid-core cooperative party game for up to four players" where you managed a horde of tourists through dungeons. Tequila Works says it was aiming for a visual and narrative style featuring "dark and absurd humour, in a conceptual mix between Overcooked and Dungeon Keeper".
</p>
<p>
Then there's Brawler Crawler, a multiplayer title focused on combat in "a chaotic urban universe where the player explores and struggles to master their own combat style". This would have featured procedurally-generated lanes with tough raids and bosses.
</p>
<p>
Back in November 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gylt-and-rime-studio-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency-says-prolonged-market-conditions-left-no-other-option">Tequila Works announced it was filing for insolvency</a> as "prolonged market conditions" had left it no other option. Founded in Madrid in 2009, the company's most recent game was Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story, which was released under the now-defunct Riot Forge publishing label.
</p>
<p>Announcing the company's shutdown, Tequila Works boss Térence Mosca said he was "proud of what [the team] has accomplished together".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The beta version of an impressive Devil May Cry 3 overhaul mod called Crimson will be released next month, introducing many features and improvements that wouldn't look amiss in an official remake.</p>
<p>The release date for the mod's beta, May 13th, was announced with a five-minute-long trailer that goes over the many improvements it will bring to the PC version of the third entry in the series, such as inertia for aerial combat, which will allow players to create intricate movement-based combos, Guardfly, a unique mechanic that allows Dante to fly all over the screen using some unique properties of the Royal Guard's Guard abilities while in the air like in Devil May Cry 4, increased jump cancel hitboxes for better jump canceling, increased enemy juggle time, revamped HUD, and a weapon wheel and on-the-fly style switching, similar to those introduced in the Nintendo Switch port of the game's Special Edition released a while back.</p>
<p><iframe title="Devil May Cry 3 Crimson - Beta Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cEVPo9wxjeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition/">latest entry in the series</a> having been released a few years back, the Devil May Cry series got into the spotlight once again this month thanks to the release of the Netflix animated show, which has been confirmed to have been renewed for <a href="https://x.com/DevilMayCry/status/1910332636712608222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a second season</a>. Unfortunately, with series long-time director Hideaki Itsuno having left CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/">last year </a><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-creator-hideaki-itsuno-joins-tencents-lightspeed-to-work-on-aaa-action-games/">to join Tencent's LightSpeed</a>, the future of the franchise is uncertain, but hopefully, the success of the animated show will convince the publisher to continue the series even without Itsuno-san's involvement.</p>

<p>Balatro creator and developer LocalThunk has praised Blue Prince as one of the best games he’s ever played.</p>



<p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Thunk <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1910361969288225080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>, “Blue Prince is already one of the best games I’ve ever played and I still feel like I’m scratching the surface. Released today but lucky me I’ve been playing it all week (perks of the job)”</p>



<p>“Get a journal, a pen, and buy the game already,” he continued. </p>



<p>Blue Prince is developed by Dogubomb and see’s the player explore a mysterious manor with shifting rooms called Mt. Holly. </p>



<p>“In&nbsp;Blue Prince, you embark on a genre-defying experience, filled with a unique mix of mystery, strategy, and puzzles that weave together to create an unpredictable journey. Will your explorative steps lead you to the rumored Room 46?” the game description reads.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, reviews of the game went live and has amassed a 92/100 score via 31 critics, receiving “universal acclaim” status. For those who played the game, it’s already being hailed as a Game of The Year contender and at the very least, is in the running for winning Indie Game of The Year.</p>



<p>Blue Prince is available now on the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and available via PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass.</p>

            <p>Black Mirror may show us a variety of near-future dystopias, but at least those unfortunate to live through one of them can play Balatro.</p>
<p>The poker-themed roguelike Balatro became a smash hit on its release last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poker-themed-roguelike-balatro-deals-out-1m-sales-in-first-month">selling 1m copies in its first month</a>, and things have only gone from strength to strength for solo developer LocalThunk.

<p>Yes, Balatro is in the new Black Mirror series, in the third episode of its seventh season. This episode is called Hotel Reverie, and its synopsis reads thus: "A high-tech remake of a classic film sends its A-list star into another dimension, where she must stick to the script if she ever wants to make it home."</p>
<p>Balatro is a pastime of the A-list star's agent. When the two are on the phone together early on in the episode, the card game can be seen on the agent's laptop.</p>
<p>This moment was spotted and shared on social media, with LocalThunk quickly responding. "So uh Balatro is now canonically in Black Mirror," the developer wrote. The show's creator Charlie Brooker then replied with a saluting emoji.</p>
<p>I wonder where Balatro may show up next? Hollywood, perhaps. </p>

            <p>
The director of A Minecraft Movie has reacted to the chaotic scenes seen in some cinemas as viewers interrupt screenings to stand up, scream and empty buckets of popcorn over other people.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie is a breakout success that's performed far beyond initial expectations</a>, seemingly fuelled by its viral nature among younger viewers. In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">videos on social media have shown crowds reacting wildly to the film's now-notorious "Chicken Jockey" scene</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while the trend may be popular, it hasn't gone down well with all cinema goers. Viewers have been removed from showings for disruptive behaviour and <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/mat-su/2025/04/08/wasilla-police-eject-rowdy-teens-from-minecraft-movie-showing/">police have been called</a> as the trend has continued - escalating now to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/people-are-taking-live-chickens-into-screenings-of-the-minecraft-movie-now-as-chicken-jockey-meme-gets-out-of-hand">disturbing incident where someone brought a live chicken into a screening</a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps unusurprisingly, A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess doesn't sound too bothered about it all. 
</p>
<p>
"It's way too funny," Hess told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/movies/chicken-jockey-minecraft-movie.html">New York Times</a>. "It's been a total blast. I'm just laughing my brains out every time someone sends me a new video.
</p>
<p>
"Just the fact that people are making memories at the movies  - that's what it's all about," Hess continued. "That's why we do it. I never could have anticipated this level of passion and fun and craziness that's happening."
</p>
<p>
Is it okay to dump your popcorn over other people? Hess seems to think so. 
</p>
<p>
"No one's going to get hurt from popcorn," he concluded. "Look, when I go to the movies with my kids, it’s like a popcorn massacre that happens and they're not throwing anything, but it ends up on the ground, regardless."
</p>
<p>
Just spare a thought for the minimum wage employee who has to come along a clear it up.
</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">the success of A Minecraft Movie has already sparked talk of a sequel</a>.
</p>

		<p>It’s been the week of the Switch 2 pre-order. I won’t bore you with the details, but getting mine felt like one of those levels in a game where annoying enemies keep swiping health off you, making you fall down a hole, and sending you back to the start. Still, I got one in the end, and now I can rest easy that I won’t be mournfully watching all my friends playing Mario Kart World on the 5th of June. When I wasn’t doing that, I was playing the excellent South of Midnight, which has to be one of the most beautiful games of 2025, more Yakuza: Like A Dragon and loads of retro stuff as well, including a blast on Sega Rally Championship and Mario Kart 64.</p>

<p>Aran has played and reviewed his first game of the year contender, Blue Prince. He says, “Every puzzle game fan should play it, because this game will be talked about for years. I’ve also started Promise Mascot Agency for review, and that has made me chuckle quite a few times. Review hopefully next week.” Blue Prince is on PlayStation Plus and Game Pass, so you really have no excuse not to play it!</p>
<p>Tuffcub has been Destiny 2ing as well as making a start on Steel Seed. His review of that will appear in two weeks!</p>
<p>Jim is making good progress in Assassin’s Creed Shadows and he says that some of those rougher gameplay edges have been worn down after unlocking various character upgrades. “Naoe has become a truly overpowered Shinobi who can clear enemy castles with ease – that’s probably thanks to me fiddling with some of the stealth difficulty options but it makes the game damn more enjoyable.”</p>


<p>Gamoc has kept things simple this week, playing Hogwarts Legacy and Balatro. Meanwhile, Steve has enjoyed some time revisiting The Simulation in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/10/the-talos-principle-reawakened-review-more-in-heaven-and-earth-than-your-philosophy/">Talos Principle Reawakened</a>, and he says that, “It joins The Blue Prince in possibly the best day of releases for puzzle fans in history. Also finished Atomfall with the self-destruct ending but will replay at some point to clear up stuff I didn’t do. Played some indie games for review so will get those up soon. Still persevering with Skywalker Saga but easing the pain of that by starting the beautiful South of Midnight. Combat is a bit one-note (although abilities are unlocking to help this) but the world is superb and I’ve always got time for a good linear game with a solid story and an identity of its own.”</p>
<p>Tef, meanwhile, has continued to give us a rundown of every game he played on Switch 2, which has only continued to cause jealousy and dissent amongst the team.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played? And did you get a Switch 2 pre-order?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-players-on-pc-wont-need-a-playstation-account-say-bungie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>You won't need a PlayStation account to play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> on PC, promise Bungie as their shooter's marketing blitz picks up speed. Previous games under Sony's umbrella, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, caused frustration and backlash when PC players were forced to register for a PlayStation account just to play online. But it looks like Sony's recent backpedalling on this requirement will save the upcoming extraction shooter from pissing off PC folks. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox," said the developers in the game's <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1303855380845301861/1359676173122146395/1359709351086129326">official Discord</a> (as spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/556790/marathon-psn-account-xbox-pc-playstation-bungie">Polygon</a>). A plain and straightforward confirmation that they won't be doing any of that nonsense. Fans reacted with lots of fire emojis and some pink cats, a reference to the cyberdermal kitty that lies down with the corpse of a defeated runner in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungies-pink-cyborg-pussycat-teases-a-proper-marathon-trailer">most recent teaser trailer</a>. </p>
<p>That teaser was released to build hype for another trailer which Bungie plans to unveil tomorrow, and which should show some footage of the actual stuff you'll be doing in the game. I'm looking forward to knowing what the bullets sound like.</p>
<p>The PSN account fiasco began in earnest when the requirement was introduced to Helldivers 2 post-release. Players were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">deeply annoyed at the inconvenience</a>, and some pointed out that it meant the game would become unplayable in certain regions in which PlayStation accounts could not be set up. </p>
<p>PlayStation eventually relented and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">removed the requirement</a> for Helldivers 2 in the wake of angry review bombing but still tried to enforce it on other games, some of them entirely single player in nature, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered. In the end, the company seems to have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">totally backed down from the idea</a>, making a PSN account optional for their upcoming games. And from Bungie's words it looks like this will also be the case for Marathon. Good to know.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> may have dominated any and all Nintendo news this month so far, we still have some Sega-related goodness for the here and now to break things up a bit.</p>
<p>Nintendo has today updated its Sega Genesis / Mega Drive catalogue for Switch Online members, and added three more classic games for us to enjoy. These games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streets of Rage</li>
<li>Super Thunder Blade</li>

<p>Does anything there catch your eye?</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news - and there has been a lot of it - last week the company announced that some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">classic GameCube games will be coming to Switch 2</a>, via Switch Online.</p>
<p>So far, the company has revealed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soulcalibur-ii">Soulcalibur 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a> will all be available for those who have Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members, starting on 5th June. While those three are just the start, more titles will be added to the Switch Online GameCube library as time goes on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
