<p>Reliable leaker NateDrake has claimed that Final Fantasy 16 is arriving for Xbox soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NateDrake was asked on ResetEra (via <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/08/15/rumor-final-fantasy-16-coming-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>) whether any more games were coming to Xbox and if a Final Fantasy 16 release is possible. NateDrake replied that Final Fantasy 16 on Xbox “is going to happen. Just waiting for Square to announce it”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that this claim about Final Fantasy 16 being released on Xbox comes just a week after rumours about the game coming to PC surfaced. Last week, keen-eyed Reddit users spotted a Game Ready profile for Final Fantasy 16 in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidias-latest-driver-includes-a-game-ready-profile-for-final-fantasy-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia’s latest driver</a>, suggesting an announcement for a potential PC release could be on the horizon. We might receive more clarity on this at Gamescom 2024. </p>



<h2 id="h-about-final-fantasy-16">About Final Fantasy 16</h2>



<p>Final Fantasy 16 is the newest standalone entry in the long-standing Square Enix series, exclusive to PlayStation 5. The game is set in Valisthea, a world filled with Mothercrystals that provide aether fuel to help the population survive. However, the light from the Mothercrystals is slowly fading, and the Blight is gradually destroying everything in its path.</p>



<p>You play Clive Rosfield, First Shield of Rosaria, in the game. Your mission is to free humankind from their fate and use Eikonic powers as the Dominant to defeat all enemies that come your way. Eikons are the most powerful and deadly creatures in Valisthea, and you have to harness their power to overcome them.</p>

            <p>The release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> has been revealed in a last-minute leak thanks to a naughty video advertisement. Electronic Arts had planned to share the game's debut-day in about... *checks watchless wrist* ... 7 hours, as part of a special <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8DkDQhPx2A">release date trailer</a>. But the internet will ever internet, and thanks to some slip-up or other, we have the knowledge just a smidge early. Will I tell you what the actual release date is? Sure. I guess so.</p>

<p>The very purple <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is coming out October 31, according to the wayward ad, which was <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1823957103859396777">caught by Xitter leak-enjoyer Wario64</a>, among others. I've embedded the upcoming release trailer anyway, so you can enjoy that when it finally does land. I haven't seen it yet, so let's see if I can accurately predict what will happen in it.</p>
<ul>
<li>A creature squeals and is upset</li>
<li>A mage crosses their arms haughtily</li>
<li>VFX blasts a bunch of wooden crates to pieces</li>
<li>Varric looks suggestively at the camera</li>
</ul>
<p>Did any of that come true? As you can see, I'm struggling. I lept from the Dragon Age tour bus after the city of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a> pulled the series away from being a world-crossing jaunt and focused on one (I think) fairly uninteresting city. The opening area of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> didn't reinvigorate me. But I know lots of folks follow the trials of these warlocky weirdoes with relish. "Dragon Age II, unfairly maligned in my opinion, is about one city facing external and internal conflict over a long period of time," said Alice B <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-dragon-age-inquisition-2">once upon a time</a>. "Inquisition is about a world at war with itself, literally and metaphorically." It also has a fun bit where you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-joy-of-being-the-belle-of-the-ball-in-dragon-age-inquisition">gatecrash a fancy masked ball</a>. </p>
<p>It's been a while since Inquisition came out, so you can be forgiven if you have no idea why elf mage Solas is suddenly doing some dubious portal opening. Luckily, Veilguard will bring you through the story so far, and even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-let-you-bring-over-your-choices-from-inquisition-whether-you-still-have-your-save-or-not">let you stick to your old choices</a>, if you can remember them.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>How do you make a game stand out in the modern age? Innovative ideas and designs might be the path to longevity, but, if we’re all being honest, a game’s visuals are the initial hook. Cataclismo manages both feats though, with a beautiful, distinctive aesthetic married to an inventive take on tower defence and RTS mechanics. Launched into Early Access last month, Cataclismo is an enigmatic, atmospheric, and even at this point, borderline essential title from the team behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">Moonlighter</a> and The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cataclismo - Sandbox Mode Trailer | Base Building RTS/Siege Defense" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9nacsUxzSLQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You take on the role of the Lady Iris, leader of the last remnants of humanity. This was once a vibrant world, and remained so when the perlas appeared, giant glowing orbs that carried immense power. Humanity accepted their gifts, but, as with most things, this power came with a price. The world became covered in Mist, its enveloping cloak hiding a malignance that transformed people into foul, thoughtless creatures known as horrors. These grim remnants are attracted to the remaining humans, and so, you must defend against this ongoing threat.</p>


<p>The remaining people reside in Hogar, the last city yet to fall to the Mist. As their leader, Lady Iris commands the steadily growing troops, oversees building, and assists in the city’s defence as well. Unusually, Lady Iris was born with a perla within her, an oddity that allows her to perform Artes. These special actions form the cornerstone of your defense against the monstrous hordes. These abilities can be discovered, upgraded and strengthened as you progress, and likewise you’ll unlock new buildings and structures to help you guard against the horrors as they grow ever more dangerous and greater in number.</p>


<p>Cataclismo is dark. Its landscape leers out of the gloom, black edges teetering against stone and tree alike. It marries well with the bold lines and simple shapes of the people that dwell there, and there’s a comic-like design to each of the different units and the Lady Iris herself. That ties into the cutscenes, which in turn remind you of the more thoughtful artstyle of books like Y: The Last Man or Mike Mignola’s Hellboy. Whichever comparisons or influences are apparent, Art Director David Aguado has absolutely nailed it.</p>
<p>Controlling your army is reassuringly familiar. Selecting units and deploying them is as simple as it’s ever been, though at the outset they might just be the chattiest group I’ve come across since Warcraft III, acknowledging your every request with a selection of dialogue. While actions are played out in real-time, you can pause the action whenever you like, issuing commands or simply gathering your breath for the next assault. It’s especially important when you’re about to indulge in Cataclimso’s most rewarding aspect: building.</p>
<p>Each settlement you build must be designed to protect the people within. You have to build up your defenses, make them accessible for your troops, and think about the most effective way to fight off your attackers. This means chunky stone walls and parapets thrusting into the air behind your ground troops, as well as walkways and stairs for your ranged units to clamber up.</p>

<p>Hogar’s impressive Solas Gate forms the initial defensive structure, and it stands as the last line of defense against the swarms that come every night, attracted to the people within. Your first major task in the campaign is to build further walls, and you immediately get a sense of the straightforward but powerful building tools that let you quickly create new structures.</p>
<p>The higher your walls, the more strength they have. There’s then a variety of bonuses that can be bestowed on your troops by adding Tactical Pieces to your structure. The team have previously likened the building tools to Lego, and there is a glorious simplicity to the way it all locks together, telling you when something isn’t correctly supported, or making you rethink your approach so that you create a structure using the finite resources at your disposal.</p>
<p>As you try to push back against the horrors, you build new settlements, or reinforce those that have fallen. To do so, you have to build up a working economy, with wood, stone and oxygen forming the central points within it. A Sawmill is the first building you must put down, but you then have to make sure there’s a clear route to your Citadel for it to function. The city-building tools are as well thought out as you’d hope, and the modularity of the walls carries over to each of the buildings, with flat roofs allowing you to continue building further structures on top of them.</p>

<p>The music here is the final, and perhaps most important, layer to Cataclismo’s atmosphere. Synth-led tones grow and pulsate, rising out of the gloom in the same way the visuals do, while plaintive acoustic guitar tells its own story in the quieter moments. These are then juxtaposed with bombastic moments of drama, the two key instruments joining together to create something powerful and moving.</p>
<p>Cataclismo is tough. You have to get used to the rhythm of pausing the game to build, organise your troops and prepare, before letting the timer wind down to the evening and a fresh wave of horrors. It’s well worth persevering though, and with Iris’ ability to rewind time, you can return to several set points through each level, allowing you to correct where you’ve gone wrong.</p>
<p>This is all in the stellar campaign, with hours of gameplay to be found here alone. The addition of skirmish mode, where you can play across hand-crafted maps, including your own, and an endless mode that gives you a steady stream of procedurally generated maps means that Cataclismo is capable of taking all your gaming time, and then probably a bit more. I didn’t go to sleep until 1AM last night, and it is definitely Cataclismo’s fault.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for this year’s most innovative, genre-splicing indie, then Cataclismo has set a standard that looks unlikely to be beaten.</p>

		<p>EA and BioWare will reveal the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> release date later today, with an announcement trailer set to go live at 5PM BST, but the game’s 31st October 2024 launch has already leaked by way of a video advertisement – picked up by the ever-watchful <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1823957103859396777">Wario64</a>.</p>
<p>So…. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on 31st October.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g8DkDQhPx2A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/06/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-single-player/">previously known as Dragon Age 4 and then as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> – is the long-awaited return of one of BioWare’s most popular RPG series.</p>
<p>The studio has ramped up the reveals and announcements in the last few months, starting with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/the-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-reveal-is-here/">a big gameplay trailer</a> during Summer Game Fest, which showcased the earliest part of the game with our player character, Rook, and series mainstay Varric delving into the very pretty, but seedy city of Minrathous on the hunt for Solas. This also introduced a few other companions, as they raced against time to stop&nbsp;Solas from conducting a ritual that’s breaking the barrier between world, the Veil, which is allowing demons to enter this world.</p>

<p>At the end of July, BioWare then revealed the full cast list of voice actors for all the companions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rook </strong>voiced be&nbsp;Erika Ishii&nbsp;(Apex Legends, Destiny 2),&nbsp;Jeff Berg&nbsp;(Battlefield 1, NCIS),&nbsp;Bryony Corrigan&nbsp;(Baldur’s Gate 3, Good Omens) and&nbsp;Alex Jordan&nbsp;(Cyberpunk 2077, The Amazing World of Gumball).</li>
<li><strong>Harding the Dwarven Scout</strong> voiced by Ali Hillis (Mass Effect 3, Naruto)</li>
<li><strong>Davrin the Grey Warden&nbsp;</strong>voiced by Ike Amadi (Mass Effect 3, Halo 5: Guardians, Insomniac’s Spider-Man)</li>
<li><strong>Bellara the Veil Jumper </strong>voiced by Jee Young Han (Perry Mason, Unprisoned)</li>
<li><strong>Neve the Shadow Dragons rebel </strong>voiced by Jessica Clark (True Blood, Pocket Listing)</li>
<li><strong>Taash the Dragon Hunter </strong>voiced by Jin Maley (Star Trek: Picard, Silicon Valley)</li>
<li><strong>Emmrich the Necromancer </strong>voiced by Nick Boraine (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Black Sails)</li>
<li><strong>Manfred, Emmrich’s skeletal assistant</strong>, voiced by Matthew Mercer&nbsp;(Critical Role, Fallout 4).</li>
<li><strong>Lucanis the Assassin </strong>voiced by&nbsp;Zach Mendez (Horizon Forbidden West, Married Alive)</li>
</ul>

Over here. Do you know a cheeky sort with a passion for unbridled mayhem and adorable two-dimensional llamas? Alright then.

Their enemies will do the same. Those actions will then play out simultaneously before the cycle begins again. It's a system of action, consequence, and reaction that becomes unpredictable thanks to the inclusion of anarchic abilities and items that can sometimes defy the flow of time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Choices made throughout your adventure will also raise the stakes. Each playable character has a guilt level. As that increases, the emotional strain will physically manifest as hostile spirits that hunt players on the battlefield. These supernatural foes don't subscribe to the laws of physics and can pursue players even when time has paused. The more inner demons you collect, the more difficult your skirmishes will become. Heavy stuff. But those llamas should take the edge off.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Searching for the sweet spot between control and carnage">Searching for the sweet spot between control and carnage</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sitting down with Game Developer ahead of launch to unpack </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arco's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> combat system, Nowotniak, Uribe, and Garcia said they wanted to create a system that felt truly "dynamic." They felt combat in other action titles often relies on rapid button presses or reflexes, which might be fun for those who can master that specific craft—but can also feel restrictive. Conversely, bread-and-butter turn-based combat was too sedate. The team didn't want players to be forced to watch turns unfold rather than being an active participant. So, they combined the two.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That core concept didn't fluctuate too much during development, but there was still plenty of room for fine-tuning. "The first time we [implemented combat], it was very slow," says Nowotniak. "We made you control the exact movement in the turn phase. You had to drag the mouse around to draw a line you would follow. A lot of controls were very slow and exact, while later, we realized you could just click somewhere to [queue an action]. We didn't need to micromanage every little thing."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another challenge that threatened to derail proceedings was the failed inclusion of a combat time bar. The team canceled a side quest that would have incorporated a timeline that told players what would happen during each turn, asking them to counter those actions. It was, in theory, a twist that turned combat into something more akin to a prophetic puzzle. But it just didn't work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think the main problem was we we're trying to implement that while trying to figure out a lot of the combat itself," says Nowotniak. "If we made the combat from the start into what it is now and then tried to add it, it could have worked. But we tried implementing too many features at the same time, and then if one of those didn't work, the other had to change."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nowotniak explains that keeping skirmishes smaller in scale worked better in the long term. That's not to say things won't get hairy. Death will come for players eventually, and that could have been a problem.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We wanted to make sure that players know there isn't much consequence to dying," says Nowotniak. "It's a linear game with different paths. It's not like a roguelike where you die and get pushed back to the start. [...] We wanted players to try different things and fail—but then try again. Because the combat shines when you play around with it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The consensus was to try and avoid punishing players for experimentation. "It's not turn-based, so I think if players are approaching it in an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Into the Breach</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> kind of way and studying the situation for 10 minutes, it's not that kind of game," says Uribe. "It's more just 'fuck around and find out.' Make the mistakes, because if you get killed, it'll happen fast."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Uribe says the combat system is fluid in a "chemical" way. There are items and abilities that can chain together to create rampant, unpredictable carnage. The reality is you really </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>have</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to fuck around to find out. Even if that means flirting with your mortality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For example, there is an item where, if you throw it, it creates a gas cloud. Then if you shoot an arrow through that, it poisons the arrow. Then if it hits an enemy it poisons the enemy," Uribe continues, outlining how those sequences can unfold. "We don't tell you these things, but you might discover [a lot of situations like this]. There are some combinations even we probably haven't discovered. That's where I think the game shines."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are currently "way too many" items, abilities, and possible combinations to list here. So, to encourage experimentation and dissuade those players with a tendency to horde items until the credits roll, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arco</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will be generous when it comes to dishing out the contraband. Environmental hazards such as exploding cacti and bear traps have been deployed to tempt players to live a little. The title teases players with the question, 'What if you just did this?' and dares them to find the answer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the team mentioned earlier, death will also pass in a flash to avoid creating a vicious cycle of negative reinforcement. "I think the biggest thing you can take away from players is their time," says Nowotniak. "So we tried to minimize the time between [death] and starting again." He says the team even tried to implement an 'undo' button that would essentially allow players to rewind time if they perish, but ultimately, it had to be dropped due to production constraints.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's also the hope that players will feel compelled to share their barmpot maneuvers, creating a llama-riding community of chaos merchants who can push each other to greater heights. Experimenting on your own is fun, but devising a system that compels players to record and distribute their unique brand of tomfoolery on the World Wide Web could perhaps deliver another level of success for a group of intrepid indies. Wouldn't that be something?</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>
Warhorse Studios has revealed a delay to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which will now arrive on 11th February 2025.
</p>
<p>
"We aimed for the end of the year and almost made it - almost is not good enough though, so we slipped to 2025," Warhorse's Tobias Stolz-Zwilling said in a video posted to X. 
</p>
<p>
The next week will still be a busy one for the game, though, as it pops up during Gamescom's Opening Night Live show next Tuesday, 20th August, and is then showcased in a 20-minute gameplay reveal video set to go live online the following day. 
</p>
<p>
(Oh, and if you're at Gamescom in Cologne yourself, it's playable on the show floor.)

        <p>This happened to my buddy Eric</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Steam’s seeing a good few sweeping changes of late. They’ve <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-now-has-a-trending-free-tab-for-demos-full-free-games-and-free-to-play">recently added a ‘Trending Free’ tab</a> to separate the no money down and no, money down playables. And, as of September, they’re cracking <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4201376568915048836">down on links to other websites</a> in store pages. Now, horror of horrors, they’re coming for your ascii gigachads and “nobody is going to read this review so I’ll just say I’m gay” bangers. The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4326355263805583415">outlined here</a>.</p>
<p>The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will. I like it!</p>

<p>Historically, Steam has sorted reviews by the number of ‘helpful’ community votes. The (absolutely unexpected, wildly unpredictable, who could have ever foreseen this?) side-effect of this system has meant a lot of “jokes, memes, ascii art and other content that might not be the most helpful for a potential purchaser” being bumped to top billing. Steam love jokes, they’re eager to remind. They’re on the level, and feel that such tomfoolery is “often a lot of fun for existing customers of a game”. But, they say, “it doesn’t always help new players in making informed purchasing decisions.”</p>
<p>Now, user reviews that are “identified as being unhelpful for potential customers, such as one-word reviews, reviews comprised of ASCII art, or reviews that are primarily playful memes and in-jokes, will be sorted behind other reviews on the game’s store page.” The post later clarifies that “identified” here means a combination of user ports, moderation, and “some machine learning algorithms to help scale the human judgment calls.” It’s worth reading the full list of question, but I did find this one interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Q. If you've identified a review as unhelpful, why not delete the review?</p>
<p>A. We have found that many players want to express an opinion about the game, but don't always have the words to describe their experience with the game, or aren't interested in writing much. Their indication of whether they would recommend the game is still valuable data, even if they are not able to articulate why.</p></blockquote>
<p>Valve reiterate that you’ll still be able see “humorous, but unhelpful posts,” just less frequently. They also point out that the changes won’t impact the overall review score for a given game - “it is simply changing the order that reviews appear on each store page.”</p>
<p>My main take here is that Valve have conveniently absolved me from needing to have one, since there’s a toggle to decide whether to use the changes or not. My other, actual take is that this sounds broadly good, although I do still wish they’d do something about those aggressive clown emojis, which sort of reinforce the clout-chasing Valve are presumably trying to avoid here, just from the opposite end of the spectrum. The jester reaction’s “once jovial smile is now perma-wrenched into a mocking rictus by anonymous puppeteers intent on using it for assorted acts of wankery,” as I put it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unpacking-the-cursed-digital-object-that-is-steams-clown-reaction-emoji">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare's long-awaited next entry in its fantasy role-playing game series, will launch on 31st October. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to an early version of tonight's release date reveal trailer which has popped up online early. 
</p>
<p>
It's been a long wait for BioWare fans - just a month shy of a full decade since 2014's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> - but finally the next chapter in the saga is only a month and a half away.
</p>
<p>
BioWare will officially date Dragon Age: The Veilguard tonight, in a trailer set to go public at 5pm UK time. From the trailer's title art, this looks to be a longer look - including a glimpse at some custom versions of the game's protagonist Rook - than the short video now circulating.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, BioWare laid out a marketing roadmap as it ramps up to The Veilguard's 31st October release, which will include looks at the game's high-level combat and PC version next week, and a focus on detailing the game's companion the week after. 
</p>
<p>
On 30th August, BioWare will hold a developer Q&amp;A via Discord, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>"Whisper it, but Dragon Age: The Veilguard has me thinking the unthinkable: it looks like BioWare is back," Chris Tapsell wrote, coming away impressed from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard first hands-on</a>.</p>
<p>
Check back at 5pm UK time to see what BioWare has in store within the game's official release date trailer, below:

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-gets-delayed-february-2025-release-date/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> has been delayed from its planned 2024 launch to a new release date on 11th February 2025.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1823949533128036374">Twitter</a>, Warhorse PR Manager Tobi Stolz-Zwilling explained, “We aimed for the end of the year and… almost made it –&nbsp;almost is not good enough, though, so unfortunately we slipped to 2025. However at least we have a real precise release date now, which is 11th February 2025, the anniversary week of Kingdom Come: Deliverance.”</p>


<p>The announcement comes just days before Gamescome 2024, which will see plenty of significant news for the game. There will be a full 25 minutes of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 gameplay showcased during Gamescom 2024, there will be a Collectors Edition reveal, and a drop of previews from press and creators alike.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance - Full Cinematic Story" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9MlMOSQnrW4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Announced back in April, Warhorse is following in the footsteps of the original game, but while Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is a narrative sequel, the intent is that it should still provide a good starting point for newcomers. The game will feature Henry of Skalitz (Tom McKay) as our protagonist once more, still trying to track down those who slaughtered his family and village, but he is also the squire to his liege, Sir Hans (Luke Dale), as they journey through medieval Bohemia in the early 1400s. However, where the first game was focussed more on towns and villages dealing with banditry, the sequel deals with the problems of kings and wars.</p>

<p>This will take players to two locations: the region known as Bohemian Paradise, with lush and vibrant countryside to explore near Trosky Castle, but it surely won’t be long before heading to the major city of Kuttenberg, which rivalled Prague in economic, cultural and political power during this period, thanks to silver mining in the region. In both maps, Warhorse has worked hard to try and capture the colours of medieval bohemia, dispelling the common perception that the time period was simply drab, muddy and squalid.</p>
<p>Through all of this, the intent is still for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 to be a classic RPG, with all of the player choice and narrative implications that this brings. Despite being a sequel, Henry is still a character in relatively formative stages, and so you can shape and play as him in different ways. You’ll be able to gear him towards combat prowess, be a bit of a sweet-talker, a thief, scoundrel, and more.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is coming out for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, BioWare <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1823751789453435295" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the launch date for Dragon Age: The Veilguard would be revealed later today. However, a leaked video already shared that information; as <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1823957103859396777/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by Wario64, the game will launch on Thursday, October 31.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is also opening its pre-orders later today. It is possible that the game will follow the recent trend of allowing pre-orders of high-tier editions to get in early, for example, on Monday, October 28, but we'll have to wait for the official info before we know for sure.</p>
<p>Overall, it's good news for RPG fans after the delays of <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a>, both now scheduled within a week of each other next February. The other major RPG in the release schedule, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, still <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-dev-diary-explains-dialogue-choice-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clings</a> to its Fall 2024 launch window, but that might change soon, leaving the door wide open for BioWare's latest game.</p>
<p>The developer and publisher EA are planning a few weeks of hard-hitting news. According to the freshly published roadmap, next week will be devoted to a high-level combat overview and a PC spotlight. The latter announcement will probably reveal a partnership with one of the three major hardware manufacturers (Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA). The following week will be fully dedicated to companions, while another developer Q&amp;A on the official Discord server has been set for August 30. On September 3, IGN will begin its month-long exclusive coverage, and there will be more press coverage throughout the month.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is the fourth mainline installment in the fantasy franchise. It is set around ten years after the events shown in the previous game and its narrative follows directly on that thread. The main character isn't the Inquisitor anymore, but players will encounter the Inquisitor throughout the game.

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is a game I'm very interested in. I was interested in the original way back in 2017 <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when I previewed it</a> following a hands-on. I played the game and thoroughly enjoyed it, and considering it has sold six million copies, I would say more than a few other people enjoyed it, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-out-this-year-and-its-looking-great-not-to-mention-twice-as-large/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we covered several months ago</a>, Developers Warhorse Studios has been aiming for a 2024 release. Like the first game, the sequel has now hit a delay, though not to the same extent as the original, and it's almost fortuitous in its timing. Kingdom Come: Deliverance launched on Tuesday, February 13th, 2018, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 will launch on Tuesday, February 11th, 2025. It's close enough to consider it the seventh anniversary.</p>
<p>While any delay is always disappointing for those looking forward to a game, it's expected in the industry. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is said to be twice as big as the original. Much work has gone into <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-dev-says-combat-will-be-more-accessible-explains-why-the-game-still-uses-cryengine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improving the combat</a> and making it more accessible without removing what makes it unique, such as improving aspects like <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-incredible-animations-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">animations</a>. Adding to this are elements like <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-dev-talks-about-dynamic-npc-routines-and-emergent-storytelling-for-side-quests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamic NPC's</a> to add to the feel of a living, breathing, medieval world.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 will now be released on February 11, 2025, on the PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. This is just a week before another major action RPG, Obsidian's Avowed, which was also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> from Fall 2024 to February 18, 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-xbox-game-coming-to-playstation-next-week-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.953529/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-game-coming-to-playstation-next-week-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Another Xbox console exclusive appears to be set to come to PlayStation soon. According to multiple claims, the next Xbox game will be announced for PlayStation 5 next week.</p>



<p>First, in response to a question on ResetEra about when the next ports to PlayStation would be coming, Shinobi replied, “What are you doing next week?”. He then followed up another question about multiple games coming with, “[I don’t know] about multiple [games]. But a big one at least.”</p>



<p>After that surfaced, eXtas1s posted a simple tease of a GIF that said “Feliz Cinco de Mayo”. </p>



<p>Based on that tease alone, it could be assumed that the game being announced will be Forza Horizon 5. For what it’s worth, Insider Gaming has heard similar of Forza Horizon 5 coming to PlayStation. However, we haven’t been able to confirm when that could happen.</p>



<p>In an update on these rumors, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/rumor-another-big-xbox-game-is-heading-to-ps5-to-be-announced-next-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden of Windows Central</a> claims that a port is going to be announced next week, but it’s not expected to be Forza Horizon 5 at this time.</p>



<p>If an announcement is to come next week, it could be during Gamescom Opening Night Live on August 20. Speaking of Gamescom, Insider Gaming will be on site all week for the annual event, so stay tuned for the latest gaming news live from Cologne, Germany.</p>

                <p>Valve has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4201376568915048836" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that</a> it will be changing the rules surrounding what developers and publishers can write in their store descriptions on Steam.</p><p>Starting in early September, four sections on Steam store pages will be impacted: "About The Game," "Short Description," "Any Special Announcement," and "Awards." The first new rule is that no links to other websites will be allowed in those sections, including links to social media pages. This is due to the store pages already having specific link fields for common social media platforms or websites.</p><p>No embedded imagery that mimics Steam store UI or buttons will be allowed either, including ones that look like wishlist buttons, game capsules, or prices. Additionally, no images, links, or widgets that point to other games on Steam will be allowed. It basically means that developers cannot use the store page description to advertise other products on Steam.</p><p>Steam has implemented other changes recently, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-steam-store-update-makes-searching-for-games-easier/1100-6513883/" data-ref-id="1100-6513883">making it easier</a> for players to search for particular games, as well as making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/changes-to-how-steam-demos-work-are-on-the-way/1100-6525327/" data-ref-id="1100-6525327">game demos</a> easier to discover.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-nintendo-switch-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Out of all the modern consoles available on the market, Nintendo Switch easily has the most diverse lineup of games available on the system. Nintendo itself has published over 130 games on the platform since it first launched, with thousands from third-party developers also available. Depending on whether or not you buy games physically or digitally, it can be challenging to search for where to overall best place to buy Nintendo Switch games is at any given time.</p><p>If you're new to the console and don't know where to find games, we've put together the ultimate guide on everything you need to know regarding where to buy Switch games  online or in stores. Take a look below and add some new games to your Nintendo Switch collection!</p><h2>Where to Buy Switch Games Online</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/nintendo-switch-games-target-circle-deal-1720436188581.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>There are multiple ways to purchase Nintendo Switch games for your console. Purchasing then online tends to be the easiest way to buy any of the most popular <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-games-2">Nintendo Switch games</a>, as you can purchase digital or physical versions. Since you don't need to drive to pick up a game, you can either ship a physical copy to your home or purchase a digital key to start playing immediately. Take a look below to discover the best way to score <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">deals on Nintendo Switch games</a>. </p><h3>Best Places to Buy Digital Switch Games Online</h3><p>By far, the <strong>best place to purchase digital Switch games is the Nintendo eShop</strong>. This is directly accessible from any Nintendo Switch console. The entire library of Nintendo Switch can be bought from the eShop, with many games exclusive to the platform. Since some games are digital-only, you won't be able to buy physical or digital copies from retailers.</p><p>Speaking of, you can also buy certain digital games <a href="https://zdcs.link/jo6L2?object_uuid=8e7d805f-3ac2-4d4e-805a-00e1728dabb5&amp;t=article" target="_blank">from online storefronts such as Amazon</a>, Best Buy, Walmart, and more. These retailers will offer digital codes that you can purchase, which are sent directly to your email inbox upon payment. </p><p>Overall, it's important to pay attention to prices on both the Nintendo eShop and across retailers. The eShop tends to have many more sales throughout the year, but outlets like Amazon and Best Buy will offer discounted digital games for certain sales events that may be better than the eShop discounts.</p><h3>Best Places to Buy Physical Switch Games Online</h3><div catalogid="50d4b603-9e89-4276-b46d-2fc4e05d6650" id="206022"><div id="206022" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nintendo Switch Games</h3></p><div><p>The best places to buy Nintendo Switch games online right now.</p></div></div><p>As the best place to buy physical Switch games, we recommend Amazon. With a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-amazon-prime-cost">Prime membership</a>, it's incredibly easy to purchase a physical Switch game and receive lighting fast shipping. Most of the time, you can get in stock Switch games within 24 hours. Plus, Amazon doesn't charge your card for pre-orders of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">upcoming Switch games</a>, as the company waits until the item is in stock.</p><p>There's also other solid options like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. Though, for the latter, you'll want to be careful when purchasing, as sometimes Walmart has listings for European Switch games. These will work on your system fine, but some players do prefer to own North Amercian, ESRB-rated copies.</p><p>Beyond these picks, you can also find rare or limited Nintendo Switch physical copies at retailers like Limited Run Games and Video Games Plus. Since these games are either reprints or limited print runs, you won't be able to find these at retailers like Amazon or Best Buy.</p><p>Beyond traditional retailers, you can even buy physical Switch games directly from Nintendo! Nintendo's store has almost every Switch game published by the company available, and often, you'll find discounted titles throughout random periods of the year.</p><h2>Where Can You Still Find Switch Games in Stores</h2><p>With the physical market slowly shrinking over the last few years, sometimes it can be difficult to find Switch games in store. Luckily, there are still dozens of stores that carry all sorts of Nintendo Switch games on their shelves. Although the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-to-phase-out-sales-of-physical-media">removed its collection of Blu-rays</a>, Best Buy still offers plenty of Nintendo Switch games. It's easy to walk into any store and browse the collection of 50+ physical games available, with most of Nintendo's first-party offerings available.</p><p>Additionally, GameStop is a solid option. While we don't necessarily recommend purchasing online from the retailer, it's still easy to walk into any GameStop storefront and find a wide variety of Switch games available. In addition, other major retailers like Target and Walmart still offer physical games, but the offerings can vary depending on the store.</p><h2>When Is the Best Time to Find Discounts on Switch Games</h2><p>Collecting and purchasing Nintendo Switch games is not a cheap hobby, but you can offset some of that by buying when games are the cheapest during the year. There are many <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-video-games">great times to buy video games</a>, but we recommend holding off for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a>. By far, this is usually the best time to score discounts on Nintendo Switch games, both physically and digitally. Nintendo will discount many of its own titles, and you can score on hundreds of third party releases from major publishers. </p><p>The only main downside with this sales event is that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> is at the end of the year, so it can almost become a waiting game in earlier parts of the year. Overall, this Holiday will be an exceptional time to buy Switch games, especially as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is coming soon.</p><p>While the best options for physical games are limited, it's another story with digital games. The Nintendo eShop hosts countless sales events throughout the year, and it's easy to find great deals. Our advice is to pay close attention to the news posts on the Nintendo Switch home page, as those will mention any new eShop sales on the horizon. </p><p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/witchfire-comes-to-steam-early-access-later-this-year/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Witchfire, the brand new project created by The Astronauts, a team that contains three video game veterans who worked on games such as Painkiller and Bulletstorm, is set to be released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3156770/Witchfire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam in Early Access</a> later this year.</p>
<p>This new RPG shooter has plenty of cosmic horror to explore in a dark fantasy atmosphere. For those interested in checking out Witchfire, <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfires-performance-doesnt-really-improve-much-with-dlss-3-and-the-hitches-are-still-there/">the game is already available</a> on the Epic Games Store. In addition to being on the Epic Games Store, Witchfire received an update called "The Wailing Tower," a huge new patch that adds a whole new map to explore new enemies, loot, gear, and brand-new features.</p>
<p>With the new update come brand-new levels of cosmic horror and a new raid map, the first to be released since the game was released for the Epic Games Store. In the update, Arcana power-ups now feature "prophecies" and "curses," which players can use to help or hinder them through their experience in Witchfire.</p>
<p>In Witchfire, you play as a wicked sinner turned witch hunter on their last mission to reach salvation. You have to try and overcome the Witch and her minions, which is a difficult journey, especially as you get Arcanas, which can either boost you through the game or make your struggle that much harder.</p>
<p>You also get to go on expeditions that will take you through immersive and expansive biomes, where you can choose your battleground as you fight off the Witch's minions. However, each completed encounter with the Witch's forces means you get stronger, and your arsenal improves as you make your expedition using the roguelike system called Arcana.</p>
<p>As you progress, you can craft your own Preyer, undead assassins sustained by Witchfire. Your base of operations is called the Hermitory, and there, you can design your own Preyer, where you can give them special weapons, abilities, and artifacts that will help bolster them and you through your journey.</p>
<p>While this game was released in September 2023 in Early Access on the Epic Games Store, it does not yet have a release date for Steam. However, you can wishlist it, and you'll be notified when the game is released.</p>
<p><iframe title="Witchfire - Official Early Access Showcase 2024 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ts1ZZkx2d1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's noted that Witchfire will continue to change during the Steam Early Access period, where the game will continue to receive updates, bringing new areas, weapons, and enemies to the game for an even more chaotic experience.</p>
<p>As it stands, Witchfire has an estimated release date for Steam Early Access in Q4 of 2024.</p>

Some notable deals include the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23043644/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-gaming-mouse-price-release-date-specs"><strong>G Pro X Superlight 2 gaming mouse</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23988405/astro-a50x-gaming-headset-xbox-playstation-pc-hdmi-passthrough-switcher-price-availability"><strong>Astro A50 X headset</strong></a>. The former is down to $134.99 ($25 off) in white at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Superlight-Lightspeed-Lightweight-Programmable/dp/B09NBWQDKX?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and $139.99 ($20 off) at <a href="https://howl.me/cmSJlRrnkaZ">Best Buy</a> (or $143.99 in all three colors from <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-mice%2Fpro-x2-superlight-wireless-mouse.910-006628.html">Logitech</a>), while the latter is discounted to $341.99 ($38 off) at <a href="https://howl.me/cmSJuFSB1Lm">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRXJN3KY?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, and <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-audio%2Fa50-x-astro-wireless-headset.939-002126.html">Logitech’s online storefront</a>.</p></div><p>While we’ve seen the black version of the Superlight 2 fall a little lower in the past, it doesn’t go on sale very often, unlike <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/21/17763016/logitech-g-pro-wireless-mouse-gaming-release-date-price">previous</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21562618/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-release-date-price-features-weight">generations</a>. Part of what makes the G Pro X Superlight 2 so good is the way it balances its gaming chops with everyday good looks. The wireless mouse features a new Hero 2 sensor that tracks at 500 inches per second (and up to 32,000 DPI) and weighs just 60 grams, meaning it’s capable enough for tournament-level play without looking out of place even in a professional work environment. I’d say it’s closer to a “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214857/logitech-subscription-mouse-decoder-podcast-hanneke-faber">forever mouse</a>” than whatever Logitech’s own CEO was talking about during her <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206847/logitech-ceo-hanneke-faber-mouse-keyboard-gaming-decoder-podcast-interview">recent interview on <em>Decoder</em></a>.</p><div><p>The G Pro X Superlight 2 is Logitech’s lightest and most advanced mouse to date. It features a 32,000 DPI Hero 2 sensor and 4kHz polling rate as well as support for USB-C charging and Logitech’s Powerplay mouse mat. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23043644/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-gaming-mouse-price-release-date-specs">Read our hands-on impressions</a>.</p></div><p>As for the Astro A50 X headset, this is one of the few times it’s been discounted from its lofty $380 price since it launched at the end of 2023. It’s a bit pricey for a gaming headset, but if you frequently game on different platforms, it has a unique docking station that allows it to act as a central hub for all your systems. By routing your consoles through its HDMI passthrough ports, you can take up one less HDMI 2.1 port on your monitor or TV and switch between your consoles or PC with a tap of a button. The earcups are also incredibly comfy for long play sessions, with some great audio coming through the 40mm drivers.</p><div><p>The A50 X is the flagship wireless headset from Logitech-owned Astro.

<p>It is a sad day for BOOM Esports fans, as the popular gaming organization has officially announced they will be dropping their entire Dota 2 roster. The popular Southeast Asian team will no longer be competing in Dota 2 amidst their failure to qualify for The International 2024.</p>



<h2 id="h-boom-esports-will-no-longer-compete-in-dota-2-drops-entire-roster">BOOM Esports Will No Longer Compete In Dota 2; Drops Entire Roster</h2>



<p>Following the team’s massive Dota 2 success back in 2022, where they placed well during The International 2022, the team has struggled to continue with victories as such. Many, who loved and cheered for BOOM Esports during those days, were saddened to hear the news of the organization dropping the entire roster.</p>



<p>“We’re changing our Dota 2 roster from active to inactive and allowed all of our players to search for new opportunities,” said BOOM Esports on Twitter (August 14, 2024).</p>



<p>The five-player team still plans to compete together under a new name, Team Waska. </p>



<p>The team posted on Twitter earlier today, stating they will be looking for new representation going into the next Dota 2 season.</p>

</ul>



<p>Hopefully, the team will be able to find a new home following their departure from BOOM Esports.</p>

<p>Whether or not BOOM Esports will compete next year in the 2025 Dota 2 season is unknown. While this could just be a complete overhaul to their Dota 2 roster, it could also mean they will no longer pursue competition within the popular MOBA.</p>



<p>As the year progresses, fans will just have to wait in anticipation on whether the popular esports team dives back into the Dota scene, or if they have quit the game for good.</p>
