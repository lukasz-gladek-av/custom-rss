		<p>Oh man, not only is the sun shining, but Nintendo are shining down on us too with the glorious reveal of all the Switch 2 details you could want (apart from pesky things like what chipset it’s rocking or the amount of RAM, but who needs to know that when there’s Mario Kart!). The battle is now on for pre-orders, and ShopTo have already told me I’m not in there first allocation. This has caused panic, but I’m sure that when the Nintendo store invites roll out I’ll be there. Surely, I’ll be there.</p>
<p>So this week, I asked the team what they were playing, and whether they were going to jump right into the Switch 2, hold off, or just play on the consoles they already have!</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has played Croc for review, saying, “I found it pretty average. I’m currently playing Blue Prince for review and I’ll have more on that next week. Regarding the Switch 2, I won’t be getting one. I have a Switch that was barely used and I just don’t have the time I used to have to be able to keep up with games on multiple consoles anymore. I’m still playing Witcher 3 and I started that back in November!”</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has returned from Japan, and has dipped his toe into Monster Hunter Wilds in anticipation of Mizutsune (coming soon) and MTG Arena in anticipation of Tarkir (also coming soon). He says, “It’s gonna be a good month for games I like, but boy do I miss Japan already! As for the Switch 2, I’ll get one as soon as I can, but I doubt I’ll be in the preorder list as I haven’t had Switch Online for two years straight (I let it lapse when I have nothing to play online)!”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Balatro, Phasmo, Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Hitman regrettably not in VR. When asked about the Switch 2, he simply said, “Price increases on games sucks.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> is still very much in his ‘play one game at a time’ mode so he’s been putting a few more hours into Assassin’s Creed Shadows. He told us, “I wasn’t really vibing with the gameplay and open-ended story progression but something seems to have clicked – getting to this point has taken longer than what I would have liked but there’s a lot of fun to be had stalking the cities and castles of feudal Japan as Naoe, then bull-rushing everything as Yasuke.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been thoroughly enjoying Atomfall, saying, “It’s just a brilliant setting and great characters make it a joy to explore. Combat is perfunctory but the amount of dialogue options and accompanying meaningful choices that have genuine impact on the world more than make up for that. I’ve also just started on Commandos Origins for review. I’m not gonna pre-order a Switch 2, mostly because I’m poor. Though I’m sure I’ll eventually pick one up when Nintendo’s brilliant first-party stuff starts coming through.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing the required Destiny 2, but also Black Myth Wukong which he says, “Is how games should be, nice short intro with stabby bits and not too long to get in to the game, and Indika in which I go against type and play as a nun. It’s very atmospheric.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also been enjoying Atomfall, whilst persevering with the ridiculous amount of collectables in Lego Skywalker and getting stuck into Metroid Dread. He says, “I’ve got a load of Switch games I’ve yet to play so no plans to pick up a Switch 2 any time soon – especially as many of the things it has to offer can already be done by my Steam Deck.”</p>
<p><strong>Tef</strong> meanwhile, has been out in Paris playing on the Switch 2 in real life! He has lots of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">thoughts</a> and words about it, all of which you can find on TSA over the next few days.</p>
<p>How about you? What have you played? And were you impressed enough by the Switch 2 Direct?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-costs-80-will-gta-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Mario Kart World <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-costs-80-30-cheaper-if-you-buy-it-bundled-with-the-nintendo-switch-2"><u>cruising its way onto store shelves at $80</u></a>, Nintendo fans who were otherwise stoked about the promise of the Nintendo Switch 2 have spent the last 24 hours balking at the prospect of doling out that many coins, even for a game they feel is a must-have.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>wrote earlier today</u></a> about why Mario Kart World, as well as the Nintendo Switch 2 itself and many of its accessories, are so dang expensive. But knowing the “why” of it doesn’t really ease the pain on the wallet. What’s more, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-isnt-the-only-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-costs-80-some-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-do-as-well"><u>we learned just this morning</u></a> that a number of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games, including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Kirby and the Forgotten Land, will also be $80. And with the AAA game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-70-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-games-make-sensebut-the-timing-couldnt-be-worse"><u>price increase from $60 to $70 still firmly within recent memory</u></a>, fans are now worried that more and more games, Nintendo or otherwise, are going to start getting more and more and <em>more</em> expensive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what does the future hold? Are $80 games the new Nintendo normal?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As usual, rather than speculate ourselves, we went and found some expert analysts to tell us what they think is going to happen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">A New Nintendo Normal</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">NYU Stern professor and author of <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/the-joy-of-six" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SuperJoost Playlist,</u></a> Joost van Dreunen, believes Nintendo is using Mario Kart World as a “test case for premium pricing,” and will evaluate consumer response before applying this more broadly. Spoilers: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendos-switch-2-treehouse-livestream-is-just-a-flood-of-angry-comments-shouting-drop-the-price"><u>the response hasn’t been great so far</u></a>! But sentiment is not the same as sales, and Nintendo will likely measure success by how well Mario Kart World actually sells.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>“</strong>If the $80 price point succeeds, Nintendo will likely extend it selectively to their most valuable franchises rather than making it standard across their first-party lineup. Franchises that could potentially justify the premium pricing include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Legend of Zelda - the next mainline entry following Tears of the Kingdom could command $80 given the series' prestige and the expansive scope these games typically offer.</li><li>New 3D Mario adventures - for major releases in the vein of Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo could position these as premium products.</li><li>Super Smash Bros. - the next installment of this franchise would be a strong candidate for premium pricing due to its extensive roster and competitive staying power.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">“Games that likely wouldn't justify the premium price include smaller-scale entries, remasters, and series with more niche appeal. Nintendo will probably maintain a tiered pricing strategy, with their tent-pole franchises at $80, mid-tier releases at $60-70, and smaller titles at traditional price points.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhys Elliott, games analyst at Alinea Analytics, had a similar take, pointing to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>top 10 best-selling Nintendo Switch games</u></a> as a guide for what we might see get an $80 price tag in the future. “I could see Nintendo pricing mainline Pokémon games, mainline Zelda games, and the inevitably imminent 3D Mario and Animal Crossing games at $80 physical (but $70 digital still).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And James McWhirter, analyst at Omdia, added a suggested hypothetical Splatoon 4 to the list of possibilities, along with another thought on future monetization:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For titles that do not adopt the $80 base price, Nintendo could lean in more heavily in alternative forms of monetisation, including those it has so far refrained from using, such as tying paid early access to higher value editions of its games.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Grand Theft, Grand Price?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">That covers Nintendo, but what about other games? Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto"><u>we covered a flurry of speculation on one specifically: Grand Theft Auto 6</u></a>. At the time, we were responding to rumors and discussion that Take-Two might price the sequel to the over 200 million selling blockbuster at $80, $90, or even $100. Analysts suggested that the high end of this was rather unlikely, but what about now? Will Grand Theft Auto 6 cost $80... or even more?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tiago Reis, market analyst at Newzoo, certainly thinks so. “For sure. Big hits that are highly anticipated (e.g., GTA 6, new CODs) can get away with it due to franchise recognition. Most people are not going to stop buying these games because they are $10 more expensive. If consumers are willing to wait, they can get it at a discount a couple of months after release. But by then, these companies have already extracted max value/price from the people who are less price sensitive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reis’ colleague Lauren Universe, client services manager at Newzoo, added: “Frankly, I expect base GTA to be at least $80, with multiple options of various increased prices (like Civ 7) that include expansions, DLCs, and ‘early access.’”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, agreed, and even expanded on who might be interested in raising prices beyond just Take-Two. “I do believe there is a chance that companies like Microsoft or Sony could feel encouraged to raise their prices now. Would you be shocked if Take-Two now thought to themselves: ‘If Nintendo can charge $80 for a Mario Kart game, we can do the same for GTA 6 - a title thousands of people have been working on for 12 years?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nuno Domingues Marques, also a market analyst at Newzoo, similarly brought up Sony and Microsoft as possible candidates for price hikes. “I am unsure if Sony/Xbox will wait for their next generation to make the push or if they will adjust post-Switch launch, but certainly, it seems like the way forward. Third-party publishers will jump on it as soon as they feel it is justified, which is likely ASAP. Not all exclusive games will cost $80, in my opinion though. Games like Ratchet &amp; Clank or other smaller niche experiences are likely to keep lower price points.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Elliott pushed back a bit on the idea that Mario Kart World could have opened a higher pricing floodgate. He pointed out that at least in the UK and Europe (U.S. price discrepancies are still unconfirmed), Nintendo is charging more for the physical edition of Mario Kart World than digital in an effort to push more consumers toward the digital edition. But he suspects that because the other two console platforms are far more digitally-oriented than Nintendo (something he discussed in more detail in our other piece on the Switch 2 pricing), this would be a tougher sell for other publishers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While I believe Take Two could charge over $70 for GTA 6, I maintain that it is a bad idea.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“While I believe Take Two could charge over $70 for GTA 6, I maintain that it is a bad idea for three reasons. [One,] the real cash cow is GTA Online and its recurring revenues, so limiting the total addressable audience at launch wouldn't be smart. There’s also a cost-of-living crisis happening globally and GTA appeals to everyone – rich and less fortunate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Two,] Rockstar needs to move players from GTA 5, and a higher floor for the switching cost would limit the GTA 5-to-GTA 6 player acquisition. Players not budging from GTA 5 is probably one of GTA 6's biggest threats, one GTA hasn't really faced before. After all, live services are mostly zero-sum in today's oversaturated attention economy. GTA 6 isn't just competing against competitors' games, it's competing with TikTok, Netflix, and even its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Three,] Rockstar can easily charge $100 or more for an edition of GTA 6 with a week of early access, maybe with a shark card thrown in. Players with disposable income will pay for it. This is the best of both worlds for Take-Two. This is pretty much the norm for AAA games these days.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elliott concluded that even with all that in mind, GTA 6 nonetheless stands a better chance than any other game at withstanding a price hike with its consumer base intact. So ultimately, the question of GTA 6’s pricing remains an impossible one to answer up to the point where Take-Two finally announces it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Living in Interesting Times</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll end on a hopeful note, though, which I got from both Mat Piscatella, analyst at Circana, and a couple of analysts at Newzoo. These folks told me that while we’re likely to keep seeing games get more expensive (and, as Piscatella points out, have already been for a while via Collector’s Editions and similar), we may also see them get cheaper in certain ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Other Nintendo games will certainly follow suit,” said Brett Hunt, market analyst at Newzoo. “It could, however, open the door for Nintendo to have an adjusted discounting strategy for the Switch 2.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marques agreed. “Maybe we will see a bigger window of pricing as well, as seen from the Donkey Kong game. Creation of space for multiple different-sized games; games that cost $49.99, $59.99, etc., having distinct content depth and breadth expectations. I agree that maybe a new discounting strategy is coming from Nintendo.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And as Piscatella put it, Nintendo may not be the only company that sees the need to break with $70 convention in more than just one way. “We certainly could see other publishers try and establish even higher base prices for some of their new games. But we could also see more significant price promotion and discounting as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With all of the uncertainty in the market, we're at a point where both publishers and consumers will have to figure out where things go next. These are, after all, interesting times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> - the early access life-sim game from Krafton - debuted at the end of March, and has since passed a record breaking sales milestone for the company.</p>
<p>In its first week of release, InZoi crossed the 1m sales mark. This lofty figure marks the fastest sales milestone ever achieved by a Krafton published title.</p>

<p>"We are grateful and excited to present InZoi to players around the world through Early Access," said CEO CH Kim, adding: "We will continue to actively communicate with players and foster InZoi as Krafton’s long-term franchise IP."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1908082411906449478/photo/1">writing on social media</a>, the team said this is a "number that still feels unreal to us and a milestone we could not have reached without each and every one of you".</p>
<p>
"Your excitement, your creations, your feedback, your content, and your support have brought InZoi to life in ways we never could have imagined."</p>

<p>Despite this impressive start, InZoi's launch hasn't been without its issues. Last week, Krafton had to patch out a bug in its early access release, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inzoi-developer-resolves-to-strengthen-internal-review-processes-following-bug-which-allowed-players-to-run-over-and-kill-children">allowed players to run over children in InZoi with a car and kill them</a>.</p>
<p>"This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch. These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of InZoi," a Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer. </p>
<p>
"We understand the seriousness of this matter and age-appropriate content and we are strengthening our internal review processes to prevent similar incidents in the future."</p>

<p>Team Cherry has had the world waiting with bated breath for a long time. It seemed like Hollow Knight Silksong didn’t exist at one point, but new developments mean we have a release period—and we might finally get to hear Silksong’s voice.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong has become somewhat of a myth in recent times. The Metroidvania sequel might be the most sought-after sequel after GTA 6. If you think I’m being hyperbolic, you only need to look at Steam’s wishlist page at any point in the last few months (maybe years) to see it’s been a constant number one.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event</a> was massive for Nintendo fans, but inadvertently got the Silksong hopefuls up in arms.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-release-period">Hollow Knight Silksong Release Period</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Anything more specific? Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We know Hollow Knight Silksong is set to release at some point in 2025, but there’s no official release date yet.</strong></p>



<p>Honestly, we’ll take it at this point. Six years after the game’s official announcement, a Silksong release date continues to elude us. But at least the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct confirmed it’s arriving this year.</p>



<p>The presentation had a “Partner Sizzle Reel” showing off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several games coming to Switch 2</a>. Hollow Knight Silksong was thrown in early on with a few seconds of gameplay. But crucially, it showed off the “2025” release period. The sequel is finally starting to look like it’s arriving in 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming will duly (and excitedly) update you once <a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> has an official release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-hollow-knight-silksong-taking-so-long">Why is Hollow Knight Silksong Taking so Long?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The world is ready. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Cherry hasn’t given an official reason as to why Hollow Knight Silksong is taking so long, but it’s more than likely due to the studio wanting to improve and perfect the experience to ensure it’s complete for release.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, Silksong was supposed to release in 2023. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silksong-delayed-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay was announced</a> with the developer explaining on <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1656106351184199680%7Ctwgr%5E0123a947c87bc1d12a132d80aea81715e67f8dc6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fsilksong-delayed-2023%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>: “We had planned to release in the 1st half of 2023, but development is still continuing. We’re excited by how the game is shaping up, and it’s gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-rating-suggests-release-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong was officially rated in April 2024</a>, leading everyone to believe a release was imminent. Unfortunately, 2024 came and went with no sign of the game. In January 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-cherry-gives-small-update-on-hollow-knight-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Cherry explained</a>: “Yes, the game is real, progressing, and will release.” This addressed concerns that Silksong’s development was troubled or canceled.</p>



<p>Fast forward to April 2025, and we finally have a Silksong release period. After six years, it feels the waiting is nearly done!</p>

            <p>The Marvel Rivals team has admitted it's feeling "pressure" to keep the game exciting as it prepares its second season, which boasts a Hellfire Gala theme.</p>
<p>"Since the launch of season one, we've been deeply contemplating how Marvel Rivals can continuously deliver fun and engaging experiences for you all," Marvel Rivals creative director Guangyun Chen shared in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOuv0tO_aLI">accompanying Dev Vision video</a>. The developer noted that "discussions on social media have certainly added some pressure on us to keep the game as exciting as it has been since December", but the team wants to ensure it fulfills "everyone's fantasies about Marvel Super Heroes".</p>
<p>Hellfire Gala was initially a 12-part X-Men comic book storyline, and is now making its way to the free-to-play shooter. "After the intense Eternal Night saga and defeat of Dracula, Emma Frost has prepared a lavish celebration, inviting everyone to don their best attire and venture to the Mutant haven of the Living Island Krakoa for the annual Hellfire Gala," the Marvel Rivals team teases.</p>

<p>Of course, things don't go to plan, and Ultron eventually pops up and crashes the festivities. "Attending heroes must spring into action to protect Krakoa's greatest treasure from his grasp."</p>
<p>Season two kicks off on 11th April. Following this season, players will notice the developer shifting to a "two-month format", and each month a new hero will make their debut.</p>
<p>As for the second season specifically, you may have surmised given that official blurb, when it launches, Emma Frost will join the roster of heroes, in a Vanguard role. She is a telepathy master, and can "adeptly utilise her telepathic and diamond abilities as the situation demands, standing at the forefront to shield her allies and obliterate her foes". Ultron will also be arriving as a playable hero, but later in the season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as far as maps are concerned for the second season of Marvel Rivals, the first one coming is - understandably - Hellfire Gala: Krakoa. This map will feature the gala itself, which the development team describes as "grand" and full of "dreamy botanical landscapes and beautiful fireworks" (which, honestly, every party should have).</p>
<p>This season will also introduce some adjustments to the Marvel Rivals' Team-Up Abilities, while the developer is "implementing weekly missions alongside the existing daily missions and challenges, which will help active players fully claim all rewards from the Battle Pass by the end of the season".</p>
<p>You can check out the various <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/">patch notes for Marvel Rivals here</a>. Meanwhile, you can watch a teaser for season two below.</p>

<p>Back in February, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">Marvel Rivals had amassed over 40 million players since its launch</a>. Despite this success, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">laid off an unspecified number of the Marvel Rivals development team</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Following this, the Marvel Rivals publisher said the layoffs were a "difficult decision" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">made to "optimise development efficiency" for the game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has revealed the size of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a>, so you can calculate how much storage is required.</p>
<p>To reiterate from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Direct earlier this week</a>, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> comes with 256GB of internal storage - eight times that of the original Switch. But how quickly will you fill that up with games?</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/">Japanese My Nintendo Store</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will be the largest launch game at 23.4GB - around 10 percent of overall storage capacity.</p>

<p>Nintendo's other major first party game is Donkey Kong Bananza, which comes in at 10GB.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the GameCube Nintendo Classics collection will be 3.5GB, though this only includes three games to begin with: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soul Calibur 2, and F-Zero GX</a>. This suggests each new game added to the collection will likely be just over 1GB each.</p>
<p>Then there are the upgraded Switch games for the new console: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> will total 7.7GB, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> will be 5.7GB.</p>
<p>Nintendo is known for keeping its game sizes relatively low, which at least means it will be a while until an expansion of the internal storage is required.</p>
<p>This will be through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-best-micro-sd-express-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2">microSD Express cards</a>, as explained in the Direct, which offer high speed data transfer. However, it does mean microSD cards used in the original Switch won't be compatible, so is an extra cost to consider.</p>
<p>What's more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">physical games will be more expensive than digital</a>, which feels like a push from Nintendo towards a digital future. Ultimately, that's going to require more storage space.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch-claims-nvidia">Nvidia has also detailed the tech specs of the new console</a>, claiming it has "10x the graphics performance" of the original Switch. It also supports DLSS for AI-enhanced upscaling - perhaps another reason for the relatively low game sizes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo love a gimmick. Sometimes it ends up with three prongs on your controller, other times it’s waggle controls that even your nan can have fun with, and sometimes it’s something that you think is going to be a quirky niche idea, but that has the potential to be so much more. That’s the Joy-Con 2’s mouse input mode.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, this is destined to be one of the many console-specific features that most third parties are going to overlook or pay the most minimal lip service to, but when it is used effectively, it can be, dare I say, game-changing?</p>
<p><iframe title="Drag x Drive – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hku89o38-hQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s optical sensors in the connection rails of both left and right Joy-Con 2 controllers, making them both equally usable as impromptu computer mice. It’s as simple as tipping or holding the Joy-Con on its side with the sensor to a surface and, combined with the gyroscope and motion sensor, the Switch knows immediately that you’ve got it in mouse mode. You don’t need to have the strap attachment on the Joy-Con to do this, but with the two glides at top and bottom of the rail, they do help give you a smooth motion when using it as a mouse.</p>
<p>Thanks to modern optical sensors, which take tiny pixellated images thousands of times a second for motion tracking, the Joy-Con 2 can be used on many surfaces. Sure, a tabletop with a large mouse mat gives the best experience, but this is adaptable and, just like using a computer mouse in an awkward spot, you can use the Joy-Con 2 on your trouser leg or arm of your sofa.</p>


<p>From the initial batch of games, Drag x Drive is the one that is really built around the mouse controller. It’s not about using it as a pointer here, but rather as a physical motion to simulate pushing left and right wheels on your character’s wheelchair. Just push the mouse along the surface to get yourself up to speed, use only one in order to turn, the triggers to brake, and then motion controls to lift up the basketball and shoot from range –&nbsp;you can, naturally, go in for a sick ramp jump and dunk the ball.</p>
<p>It’s a tiring game from the repetitious, uncommon arm movement, and it takes a while to adjust to manoeuvring yourself like this –&nbsp;speaking as someone who does not use a wheelchair. In that way, I’m reminded somewhat of ARMS, the boxing game from around the launch of the Nintendo Switch. Physical motion and controls, a small-scale sports game, and a testbed to prove the potential.</p>

<p>More likely, mouse mode will be used for smaller spin-off modes and minigames. That’s exactly what you find in Super Mario Party Jamboree’s Switch 2 Edition expansion. We got to try out six of these, with a mixture of shaking and spray painting, air hockey, pulling back to launch windup cars, and one of those precision mazes where you can’t touch the sides. They’re great little games and rather intuitive, but some will be more suited to trouser play than others.</p>
<p>But for me, the most impactful use was actually with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. If you’re holding individual Joy-Con 2, then at any time you can switch from standard gamepad controls to mouse mode just by tipping the controller on its side. It sounds dumb, but it was an ample reminder of just how much more precise mouse controls are for aiming than gamepads are.</p>
<p>The section that we played was action heavy with plenty of battles against Space Pirates that build up to a boss battle against a Metroid-infested monstrosity. The precision of the mouse mode let me track and aim at enemies just so much better and more intuitively.</p>

<p>However, there’s a few added quirks here. For one thing, there’s still a target lock-on, a bit of a holdover from earlier Metroid Prime titles, and there’s also a free-aim toggle that can be used with motion or mouse mode control. Motion felt floaty and vague here, when trying to hit multiple targets on a door, but mouse mode was absolutely precise.</p>
<p>It got to the point where I thought that I’d switch back to gamepad controls, but found that I basically couldn’t aim anymore. I quickly just tipped my hand over and went back to mouse mode.</p>
<p>And that’s the power of this option. It will only really be applicable as an instant control mode shift when playing with Joy-Con in hand, but if that’s how you play (as opposed to with a Pro Controller or in handheld mode), then this has the potential to be a great option. But that caveat of needing to play with separate Joy-Con is probably what will doom this to being a niche and oft-overlooked feature.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-explains-why-the-switch-2-has-an-lcd-screen-first-info-on-game-download-size-is-promising/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-explains-why-the-switch-2-has-an-lcd-screen-first-info-on-game-download-size-is-promising.1155126/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-explains-why-the-switch-2-has-an-lcd-screen-first-info-on-game-download-size-is-promising/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen features&nbsp;<span>many advancements compared to the Switch 1. It's larger (7.9 inches versus 6.2) and has a higher resolution (1080p versus 720p). It also supports High Dynamic Range and Variable Refresh Rate (the latter through NVIDIA G-SYNC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as confirmed yesterday by NVIDIA</a>), with a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz</span>.</p>
<p>However, it is not an OLED screen, which means <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-oled-model-feels-like-more-than-a-toy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch OLED</a> users (who were also blessed with a larger 7-inch screen) may feel like it's a bit of a downgrade when it comes to the lack of infinite contrast and truly inky blacks. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-decided-to-go-from-the-switch-oled-to-an-lcd-screen-for-switch-2-after-a-lot-of-consideration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to IGN</a>,&nbsp;Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager of the Technology Development Division and Senior Director of the Technology Development Department at Nintendo, explained:</p>
<p><em>Now there's a lot of advancements that have been made in LCD technology during development. We took a look at the technology that was available to us now and after a lot of consideration we decided to stick to LCD.</em></p>
<p>In all honesty, many fans are simply convinced that Nintendo is waiting to release a more expensive OLED model a couple of years down the line. On the upside, at least there's a cheaper LCD model available with this approach.</p>
<p>On another note, as spotted <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/preeliminary-switch-2-game-file-sizes-revealed-mk-world-23-4-gb-donkey-kong-bananza-10-gb.1155054/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on ResetEra</a>, the Japanese My Nintendo Store already includes preliminary information on how much space will be needed to install Nintendo Switch 2 games on the new console.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario Kart World - 23.4 GB</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Bananza - 10.0 GB</li>
<li>GameCube Nintendo Classics - 3.5 GB</li>
<li>Super Mario Jamboree Switch 2 Edition - 7.7 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>There's definitely an increase when it comes to the required install space compared to the Switch. However, we are nowhere near the size of most PC, PlayStation, and Xbox games, which approach or even surpass 100GB nowadays. On the flip side, those platforms have much larger drives available, whereas the Switch 2 only has 256GB (albeit expandable with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microSD Express format</a>).</p>

            <p>Bungie have broken a silence surrounding their upcoming extraction shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> to tweet <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907840558544072722">a short video full of cryptic symbols</a>. It's proven hard for fans to decrypt so far, but the developers have since followed up with a few more teasey posts, including one that certainly reads like a notice to fans that more information on the game will be revealed soon. "The signal is coming. The truth is coming," says a line of plain text in the marketing spritz. "Are you ready?" </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first post on Xitter to send fans into a flap was that spliced video of various symbols swishing around. Some users think you have to <a href="https://x.com/johnotron604/status/1907862522490769613">cut up the video</a> and piece it back together correctly before attempting to decode the symbols' meanings. But most of the Xitterati just immediately gave up and asked the social media's built-in AI Grok what the video meant. Grok didn't know. It said the post <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1907844677363011806">was marketing</a>.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the studio's social media account shared more. It posted an animation showing a code being slowly decrypted, while warning of an <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907931118780788824">"unauthorized transmission"</a>. Alongside this was a link to an ARG website with a Twitch login. Currently the Twitch login just brings you to a page saying "Access Denied". It all basically looks like a fancy and playful way of saying "broadcast incoming", but who knows.  </p>
<p>Finally, the most recent post shows another animated image, depicting <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907956872046690602">a snake with a written message alongside</a>. "The signal bleeds through their jamming," it reads. "Symbols not random. Not accident. Not noise. But VOICE." It compels the reader to "decrypt decrypt decrypt" and ends with a final hypey warning. "The signal is coming. The truth is coming. Are you ready? RISE RISE RISE."</p>

<p>Bungie have been fond of these ARG marketing tactics since the days of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-2">Halo 2</a>. The last concrete news we got of Marathon was in a brief video from game director Joe Ziegler in which he reassured everyone that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">the game was still alive</a>. That was in October last year. He didn't share much about the actual game itself, however, beyond brief mentions of two playable character classes, one referred to as "stealth" and the other as "thief". </p>
<p>Marathon has had a troubled development so far. The company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">laid off hundreds of people</a> last year, doubtless impacting the game's production. And director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">taken off the project</a> after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-the-text-messages-that-allegedly-got-a-former-bungie-executive-fired-according-to-a-court-document-written-by-sony">allegations of "predatory behaviour"</a> towards several women working at the studio. Marathon will be the studio's first release since being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sonys-purchase-of-bungie-is-now-complete">bought by Sony in 2022</a>, and Sony have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">somewhat ruthless</a> towards the makers of live service games lately. The stakes feel quite high.</p>
<p>As someone who enjoys the feel of Bungie's shooters (and who still counts the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-full-original-marathon-trilogy-is-now-free-on-steam-but-bungie-are-still-quiet-on-the-reboot">original Marathon trilogy</a> as good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> games) I'm interested to see how this reboot might play with the extraction shooter genre. But I'm also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">like others</a>, dead tired of live service games. I think I just preferred Bungie when they made Halo. Anyway, we'll keep an eye out for more news on the feeds - both the real ones, and the ones that shout RISE at you a lot. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-will-release-on-pc-in-april-adding-a-grand-hub-mizutsune-and-new-quests">first big title update</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is upon us like a large, iridescent squirrel dragon covered in bubbles, and when I say a large, iridescent squirrel dragon covered in bubbles I am, of course, referring to the Mizutsune – a new Wilds monster last seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>.</p>
<p>It and a new, high rank version of the Zoh Shia are the title update’s headline additions. But it’s not <em>all</em> monster hunting. There’s also a new social area, the Grand Hub, wherein you can hang with your mates, bowl exploding barrels and do some arm-wrestling. With your mates, I assume. The changelog just says "Arm Wrestling Barrel". I assume you won't be arm-wrestling a barrel. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The update requires 6GB of storage space, or 16GB if you’re using the high resolution texture packs. If you’re wondering where to find the Mizutsune, you’ll need to reach Hunter Rank 21 to unlock a mission you can start by speaking to Kanya in the Scarlet Forest Base Camp. Complete that mission, and the bubble-huffing rainbow lizard is yours for the slaying. There’s a Tempered version of the Mizutsune to fight after HR 41. As for the high rank Zoh Shia, you’ll need to be HR 50 to access the relevant story mission. 
</p>
<p>
Naturally, these munsters bring with them new weapon and armour crafting options. We can also expect new skills, status ailments, pop-up camp gear options, limited bounty categories, voice lines and poses. The Grand Hub becomes available after completing a tutorial mission that appears from HR 16.
</p>
<p>
It’s a bountiful rework indeed, with a bunch of balancing adjustments and fixes to wash down the extra critters, gear and quests. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-easing-up-its-vram-hogging-toughening-up-even-more-monsters">promised</a>, there have been some PC technical improvements as well, though it’s hard to gauge from the fleeting description just how much difference they’ll make: “Improvements were made to VRAM usage, and the DirectStorage version has been upgraded.”

            <p>In a recent episode of the <a href="https://youtu.be/f_VP86VvwDk">Quad Damage podcast</a>, Arkane founder Raphaël Colantonio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arkanes-founder-is-open-to-the-idea-of-making-dishonored-3-just-dont-place-any-bets-on-it-actually-happening">spoke about his ideas for a new Dishonored game</a>. He, Harvey Smith, and Dinga Bakaba all had their own ideas for a sequel, he said, although the odds of any of them being developed are low as all three devs now work on different projects.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the podcast, the subject turned to Colantonio's thoughts on AI and the future of immersive sims. In short, he sounds optimistic. "If AI could really remember everything, and take meaningful human decisions like a Dungeons and Dragons Gamemaster, then that would actually be very valuable. Things we could not do. There would not be a team that is big enough to do this kind of thing."</p>
<p>"One of the things about immersive sims is that we are always trying, either to plan for everything that we think the player might do - and that's authoring, that's painful," Colantonio said. "Or, we're doing a lot of failsafes with systems that somehow fall back on their feet if the player does something we did not plan. There's always some stuff the players do that we haven't planned, so that's why you have the net under. But that net's a little janky. Sometimes it works, sometimes not."</p>

<p>"Everybody hates AI ... and for frankly good reasons. But there is space for AI to improve the tools," he continued.  "Not to do our job, but improve the tools. If you look at the way we made games in the nineties, it's pretty similar to how we make games today. The tools have barely evolved. I mean, they have, but it's still the same principles, the same ideas. If you need to make your level a little bigger, you still have to pull the props apart and add the middle prop that's missing there, make sure the textures match. It's an absolute pain."</p>
<p>He thinks that level designers spend a lot of time doing "grunt work", and that this could be improved if "there was an equivalent of a chatbot GPT embedded in some tools. And I'm sure it's going to happen tomorrow. You'll look at your building, and say: make it bigger. Make it wider. Change the style. And then it's done very fast. And then you become the director of that level."</p>
<p>The tools for making games Colantonio began his career with have evolved, he goes on, but not that drastically (as ever, the difficulty with genAI discussions is distinguishing between the current wave of new product announcements and older tools which make less showy use of automation and generation.) Meanwhile, team sizes and budgets <em>have</em> gone up dramatically. "We're throwing people at the problems. Making games with 1000 people doesn't make sense. It was not meant to be. There's nothing admirable about that. It's just a lot of money and a lot of people that are probably not having a fun job. I would rather go back to the way things were when teams were between 20 and 50 people."</p>
<p>WolfEye, Colantonio's current studio, indeed started with around 19 people, and now<a href="https://gamerant.com/wolfeye-studios-new-game-interview/"> sits at "50-60"</a>. They're currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfeyes-new-first-person-rpg-is-an-evolution-of-prey-and-dishonored-featuring-mechs-magnets-and-a-continuous-world">an unnamed first-person RPG</a> that harkens back to the immersive sims their alumni are famous for. "The ingenuity and gadgetry of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> and Prey with a 'real <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>' experience redolent of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> and modern-day Fallout."</p>
<p>I've obviously made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-some-better-terms-for-genai-output-slop-is-too-benign">my own thoughts about GenAI known</a>, but I've still got some learning to do, and there's evidently a distinction between aiding artists and trying to replace them. And, hey, call me biased, but I'm more inclined to listen to someone like Colantonio than I am some LinkedIn bozo screaming about the future without giving me a reason to care in the present. That said, I'm concerned that he's still speaking mostly speculatively here, about "space for" and "tomorrow". And the sort of people gaining wealth and power in this space between "might" and "does" aren't necessarily the ones that share Colantonio's values. If WolfEye ever decide to make a new protagonist specialise in the ol' six-finger discount, I'm going to live with the rats.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The free Title Update 1 for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> was released yesterday, bringing with it new quests where players compete for the fastest hunt time. However, Capcom has warned of potential cheaters, which will lead to account suspension and invalid completion times.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/topics/arena-quests/">new Arena Quests, Challenge Quests, and Free Challenge Quests</a> allow players to take on monsters with either pre-determined or their choice of equipment, as they compete for the fastest times. Players will be rewarded with a position on the leaderboard and cosmetic pendants.</p>
<p>However, in a statement shared on social media, Capcom warned against cheaters and the use of external tools. "To ensure a fun and fair experience for our players, we will take action against accounts participating in fraudulent ranking activity, such as the use of cheating or external tools," it said.</p>

<p>"Accounts deemed to be in breach of this may be suspended, or have restrictions placed on them, such as being unable to receive rewards from these quests.</p>
<p>"Also, if cheating is confirmed in a multiplayer hunt by any member(s) of a team, the completion time for the quest will be deemed invalid and the right to rewards can be revoked for the whole party.</p>
<p>"Please take caution to avoid playing multiplayer with those who are engaging in prohibited activity, or those you suspect of such."</p>
<p>Capcom also requests any suspected prohibited behaviour is reported, by navigating to their Hunter Profile screen. It also noted these quests can be completed solo, or with Support Hunters, to avoid cheaters.</p>

<p>Potential cheating or use of external tools is most likely to be from PC players, though crossplay is enabled between PC and console players.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Capcom has noted it's aware of a game crash when players talk to Nata and select Sekka to trade items at the Village Intermediary. This can be resolved by waiting for a while or resting at the BBQ Menu.</p>
<p>It's also updated its <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060">list of currently known issues</a>.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has proven exceptionally popular. Earlier this week, Capcom announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-rises-beyond-another-impressive-milestone-in-first-month">game had surpassed 10m copies since its release</a> on 28th February.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-content-update-detailed-ahead-of-next-weeks-release">new update is available now</a>, which on top of the new quests adds Mizutsune - first seen in 2015's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-generations">Monster Hunter Generations</a> - as well as other new features and gear.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As promised, CAPCOM has released the first major Monster Hunter Wilds update today. On Steam, the update is a 6GB download or 16GB if you have high-resolution textures installed. There are a lot of bug fixes, of course, but the main highlights are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>New monsters can now be hunted after meeting certain in-game conditions.</li>
<li>Mizutsune has been added. Reach HR 21 to unlock an extra mission that can be started by speaking to Kanya in the Scarlet Forest Base Camp. Complete the mission to unlock Mizutsune.</li>
<li>Tempered Mizutsune has been added and will appear when you are HR 41+ after completing the Mizutsune extra mission.</li>
<li>Zoh Shia has been added as a high-rank monster. Reach HR 50 to unlock a story mission that unlocks Zoh Shia.</li>
<li>New story, extra, and side missions have been added to Monster Hunter Wilds.</li>
<li>New weapons, armor, and skills have been added.</li>
<li>The upgrade limit has been increased for armor of rarity 5 and above.</li>
<li>The Grand Hub has been added. It can be unlocked by completing a tutorial mission that appears from HR 16.</li>
<li>The following features have been added to the Grand Hub: Barrel Bowling; the Diva; Arena Quest Counter; the Canteen; the Arm Wrestling Barrel.</li>
<li>The Expedition Record Board has been added to the Grand Hub, along with rankings for time attack quests.</li>
<li>Arena Quests have been added.</li>
<li>Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests (Challenge Quests with no equipment restrictions) have been added and will be made available at a later date.</li>
<li>New status ailments have been added.</li>
<li>New voice lines for Alma (the Handler) have been added.</li>
<li>An arena log page has been added to hunter profiles.</li>
<li>The Change Appearance menu in the camp now has an option to change Alma's outfit.</li>
<li>New pop-up camp gear options have been added.</li>
<li>New limited bounty categories have been added.</li>
<li>New voice lines, pose sets, and gestures have been added.</li>
<li>Preparations have been made for the Festival of Accord, planned to run from April 23 to May 6.</li>
<li>The following features will be temporarily modified during the Festival of Accord: the Handler's Outfit; Seikret decoration; the Diva's song list; the Grand Hub decorations; the Canteen's menu.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Free Title Update 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6y-0sBUKGI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There's also a limited-time Event Quest where hunters can head to the Ruins of Wyveria and face a Guardian Doshaguma in "Anguish and Atrocity". Successfully completing the quest will see them earn extra Hunter Rank Points. The Event Quest is available until April 8 at 4:59 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>By the way, the developer warned players of a known issue where the game crashes when talking to Nata and selecting Sekka to trade items at the Village Intermediary. The current workaround requires waiting a certain amount of time or resting at the BBQ Menu.</p>
<p>CAPCOM has recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Monster Hunter Wilds broke the publisher's all-time records for first-month sales, with over 10 million units sold across all platforms. It is, therefore, well on its way to surpassing its predecessor, Monster Hunter World, which currently leads with 21.30 million units sold; still, the developer's continued support with patches and DLCs will be critical to reaching that objective.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/trump-tariffs-board-games-ttrpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Board gaming, which during the 2010s was an ascendant medium and an industry finally finding its feet after decades of being seen as child's play, <a href="https://kotaku.com/board-games-are-having-a-bad-time-1842653367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was rocked in 2020 by the pandemic, whose disruptions to manufacturing and shipping costs</a> sent a lot of companies to the wall. Five years later, those challenges seem quaint compared to what's coming in the wake of<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/03/donald-trump-tariffs-world-trade-republicans-join-democrats-block-canada-tariffs-us-politics-latest-news-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the Trump administration's tariff announcements</a>.</p><p>Like most other businesses around the world, many board game companies have been using Chinese manufacturing for years now. In most countries it's the only way to get components made for commercial purposes, since local manufacturing capabilities--or at least those capable of operating at the scale necessary to keep costs down--simply don't exist.</p><p>The imposition of a 54% tariff on goods imported from China will have a cataclysmic effect on the entire industry.<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oldhammerpodcast.bsky.social/post/3llwhylnfh22u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> A statement put out by publisher Steve Jackson Games earlier today</a> puts those numbers into context:</p><blockquote><p>On April 5th, a 54% tariff goes into effect on a wide range of goods imported from China. For those of us who create boardgames, this is not just a policy change. It's a seismic shift.</p><p>At Steve Jackson Games, we are actively assessing what this means for our products, our pricing, and our future plans. We do know that we can't absorb this kind of cost increase without raising prices. We've done our best over the past few years to shield players and retailers from the full brunt of rising freight costs and other increases, but this new tax changes the equation entirely.</p><p>Here are the numbers: A product we might have manufactured in China for $3.00 last year could now cost $4.62 before we even ship it across the ocean. Add freight, warehousing, fulfillment, and distribution margins, and that once-$25 game quickly becomes a $40 product. That's not a luxury upcharge, it's survival math.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Extrapolate that math--$40 games going to $60, $60 games becoming $90 games--and you can see how quickly this gets away from both publishers and retailers. That’s something the industry representative group in the US, The Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA), is all too aware of, saying in a statement today that "The latest imposition of a 54% tariff on products from China by the administration is dire news for the tabletop industry and the broader US economy. As an industry highly dependent on producing goods overseas and importing them into the US, this policy will have devastating consequences."</p><p>Those consequences won't just hit publishers and retailers;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/552558/tabletop-panic-tariffs-on-china-layoffs-bankruptcy-gama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Polygon's Charlie Hall broke down</a> how an entire ecosystem of board game businesses could now face extinction, from distributors to studios who have Kickstarted a game recently but are yet to manufacture their game to TTRPG companies who are already cancelling production runs.</p><p>Even companies outside the US are in trouble; like so many other industries, from cars to electronics, the United States is one of (if not <em>the</em>) single biggest market for board games. Even studios and publishers based in Europe could be looking at huge drops in sales, whether because of tariffs placed on their own exports, or just because Americans are about to have a lot less expendable income to spend on things like board games.</p><p>I know board games aren't going to be grabbing the headlines in the same way cars and electronics will be amidst all this political chaos, but seeing how deeply these proposed tariffs will impact even your hobbies shows how destructive they're going to be, not just to the wider American economy, but your downtime as well.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts"><h3>Psycho Patrol R Is A Hilarious Dream Of A Brutal Future</h3></a><p>The follow-up to Cruelty Squad is a brilliant, euro-septic vision of a the future and one of the best immersive sims I've played in ages.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-price-release"><h3>Nah, Man</h3></a><p>It's not Nintendo's fault, but 2025 sure is a time</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thomas-tank-diesel-10-scary"><h3>Fuck This Anthropomorphic Diesel Engine In Particular</h3></a><p>Thomas and the Magic Railroad's Diesel 10 gave me nightmares</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/643173/trump-tariffs-steve-jackson-board-game-industry<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The CEO of Steve Jackson Games, which makes board games and card games, says that the 54 percent tariff on goods imported from China that will go into effect on April 5th is a “seismic shift” for the board game industry and that “prices are going up.”</p><p>“At Steve Jackson Games, we are actively assessing what this means for our products, our pricing, and our future plans,” CEO Meredith Placko says <a href="https://www.sjgames.com/ill/archive/2025-04-03">in a post</a>. “We do know that we can’t absorb this kind of cost increase without raising prices. We’ve done our best over the past few years to shield players and retailers from the full brunt of rising freight costs and other increases, but this new tax changes the equation entirely.”</p><p>In the post, Placko spells out an example of how the tariff could affect costs. “A product we might have manufactured in China for $3.00 last year could now cost $4.62 before we even ship it across the ocean,” she says. “Add freight, warehousing, fulfillment, and distribution margins, and that once-$25 game quickly becomes a $40 product. That’s not a luxury upcharge; it’s survival math.”</p><p>Placko adds that the company doesn’t manufacture in the US because the infrastructure “doesn’t meaningfully exist here yet.” She acknowledges that tariffs can be “an effective tool” when they are “part of a long-term strategy to bolster domestic manufacturing.” But she says that “there is no national plan in place to support manufacturing for the types of products we make.”</p><p>If you’re frustrated with the tariffs, Placko suggests writing to your elected officials. “Ask them how these new policies help American creators and small businesses,” she says. “Because right now, it feels like they don’t.”</p><p>The Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA) has also issued a grim warning. “The latest imposition of a 54% tariff on products from China by the administration is dire news for the tabletop industry and the broader US economy,” GAMA said, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/552558/tabletop-panic-tariffs-on-china-layoffs-bankruptcy-gama">according to <em>Polygon</em></a>. Card-grading company PSA has released a statement about the new tariffs, too, saying that the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643117/psa-pausing-submissions-outside-us-tariffs">has paused</a> direct card grading submissions from outside the US.</p><p>In March, Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-ceo-on-trump-tariffs-higher-toy-prices-are-looming-184955178.html">told <em>Yahoo Finance</em> that</a> “when you’re talking about tariffs in the neighborhood of 20 percent plus, that’s a cost that we can’t fully accommodate. It will have to be passed on.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-valhalla-origins-odyssey<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em><a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16792/assassins-creed-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has reviewed well</a>, folks are into it,<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-elon-musk-twitter-ratio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it's trending on social media</a>; all of that is great, because I'm loving it as well. But looking over a lot of people's reviews and general feedback, I can't help but wonder where some of you have been for the last ten years.</p><p>For all the cool stuff <em>Shadows </em>does around the edges of the <em>Assassin's Creed </em>formula, the core experience–the way the game feels and plays and what it has you doing moment to moment–feels largely unchanged from <em>Origins</em>, a game released all the (relative) way back in 2017.</p><p>This is not a criticism. That makes sense! Of course they feel the same; a lot of the same tech is underpinning both games, which is why Bayek and Naoe move with largely the same momentum and stick to walls and doorframes the same frustrating ways. These aren’t the only familiar things, though; even <em>Shadows</em>' missions, quests and, most important, sandbox playthings are much the same.</p><p>For all of Ubisoft's efforts at making elaborate, scripted story missions for the game's two playable characters, the centrepiece of <em>Shadows</em>--and the last few <em>Assassin's Creed</em> games, but <em>Shadows </em>does it slightly better--is its open world, sandbox mayhem. It’s those personally-curated, freestyle moments when the game shows you a city block, farm or entire castle full of bad guys, a number of different ways you can approach them and says "have fun".</p><p>These are the moments that the game, and indeed much of the series, was built for. When every button press and inventory item is geared towards player expression, whether they’re opting for stealth or combat. Every sandbox encounter, from its scale to its architecture, is designed with the multiple paths towards the same goal: You can sneak your way through and steal some loot; you can sneak your way through killing everybody; you can try to sneak post everybody, fail and have to fight who's left; or you can just kick the front door open, say "surprise motherfuckers" and kill everyone.</p><p><em>Assassin's Creed</em> has always had some iteration of these playgrounds (<em>Black Flag's</em> fortress battles were great), but they started getting <em>really </em>good in <em>Origins</em>, which was the first true open-world <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, meaning it was the first to really flood the map with staged encounters and let you have at them however you wanted. And while the quality of these sandboxes has ebbed and flowed slightly over the years as settings and characters have necessitated slight changes, for me they've remained the highlight of each successive game.</p><p>The flexibility you're given, the freedom of expression, the possible strategies lying before you, the satisfaction of a self-imposed job well done, I love it all. Ubisoft know exactly what it is that's best about this series–not long horseback rides or eavesdropping, but the act of sneaking up to a guy, shanking him in the ribs then dragging his body into the bushes. Wash, rinse, repeat.</p><figure></figure><p>In <em>Shadows </em>these moments--its towering castles especially--remain the highlights. Especially since our creative impulses have been spun off into two distinct characters, each with their own strengths and approaches: Naoe for more traditional stealth and Yasuke for when I just want to kick a man to death.</p><p>I get the impression they're the highlights for a lot of other people out there, too. This is anecdotal, but three out of five co-founders here at Aftermath didn't unlock Yasuke until around 15-20 hours into the game, because we were all too busy climbing viewpoints and rinsing castles and just generally doing cool assassin stuff. (The other two co-founders...haven't played the game.)</p><p>I'm happy for everyone finding out that these skirmishes are the best part of the game but, as someone who put over 100 hours into each of the last three main games, I just wanted to say here that <em>Shadows</em>' highlights aren't substantially different to those found in <em>Origins</em>, <em>Odyssey </em>or <em>Valhalla</em>. <em>Assassin's Creed</em> has been this good for a long time, and I don't think enough people either remember that, or were aware of it in the first place.</p><p>There's a feeling on the wind, especially now that everyone is having so much fun with <em>Shadows </em>and that<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/ubisoft-had-an-absolutely-dire-2024-and-desperately-needs-a-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ubisoft has been in such trouble lately</a>, that the last few <em>Assassin's Creed</em> games have been <em>bad</em>. But that's not true. The last three (four if you count the glorified spin-off <em>Mirage</em>) have been <em>fantastic</em>, full of memorable characters and breathtaking locations and extremely cool missions. Their <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/9439/assassins-creed-valhalla" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews at launch</a> were <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/4503/assassins-creed-origins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as glowing</a> as <em>Shadows</em>’ have been.</p><p>Their problems aren't that they suck, but that they were just too big. Too long. <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla </em>especially vastly overstayed their welcome with drawn-out (sometimes multiple) storylines and DLC, meaning a lot of people parted with those games on poor terms. Those negative views have perhaps coloured both game's legacy in ways unfair to their core experience.</p><p><em>Shadows </em>was supposed to be different. This was hoped/believed by many to be some kind of silver bullet, a fix for the series' woes, a game that could not only<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-controversies-are-for-babies-and-racists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> weather a culture war storm</a> but also restore people's faith in a series that had supposedly grown stale. But for all that, and its delays, <em>Shadows </em>is just another <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game. You climb the towers, upgrade the stuff, shank the baddies.

            <p>
The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), which represents all major gaming companies in the US, has responded to US president Donald Trump's sweeping trade tariffs, saying the measures will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the games industry.
</p>
<p>
Trump imposed wide-reaching trade tariffs earlier this week, with some of the highest levies targeting countries which also happen to be critical centres of video games hardware manufacturing. Vietnam, for instance - where much of Nintendo's hardware production now takes place - was hit with 46 percent tariffs, while China's reach as high as 54 percent.
</p>
<p>
Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/esa-trump-tariffs">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, ESA senior vice president Aubrey Quinn said the increased costs associated with these tariffs "are going to have a real and detrimental impact on the video game industry". Quinn also noted the way parts are sourced and devices are shipped means, "Any one product that a consumer would buy is likely to be subject to many of the tariffs announced, all compounded on top of one another."

<p>
The situation could also worsen, Quinn suggested, as countries affected by the tariffs begin to take retaliatory measures. "I think what we heard yesterday is not the end of the story," she added, "not for the United States, not for other countries."
</p>
<p>
Tariffs have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">already been a major talking point following Switch 2's reveal</a>, with analyst Daniel Ahmad noting, "Nintendo shifted its manufacturing to Vietnam to avoid tariffs and with today's reciprocal tariff announcements they're likely going to end up paying tariffs anyway." Ahmad also suggested the console's higher US cost compared to Japan "is likely a calculated move on Nintendo's part, driven by tariff impacts, the weak Japanese yen, and local market conditions."
</p>
<p>
There've also been fears <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, which is priced at $450 in the US, could see its cost eventually rise to as much as $600 if impacted by the Trump administration's tariffs. However, Ahmad argued it's "unlikely that Nintendo will raise the price of the console at this point, but it's also unlikely to see a price drop in the next five years."
</p>
<p>
Back to Quinn, though. When asked if video game manufacturers should consider producing more goods in the US to lessen the effect of tariffs, she concluded, "I think every company, every industry... needs to think about what's best for consumers, best for business, and best for employees. Supply chains are complicated and, certainly, supply chains don't change overnight. Everything that is considered or decided can't be a quick turnaround and can't be a knee-jerk reaction to any particular announcement."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> has exceeded most everybody’s wildest expectations, moving <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-sales-surpass-150-million-units-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 150 million units</a> on the way to (most likely) breaking console sales records set by Sony’s PlayStation 2. Following up on that sort of success is no simple or easy feat, and Nintendo has taken what some have deemed the “safe” route by simply delivering a more powerful, feature-enhanced <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Of course, sometimes the appeal of new hardware isn’t obvious at first glance. You need to actually go hands-on to get that exciting new console feel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recently had the opportunity to do just that, going hands-on with the Nintendo Switch 2 for several hours at a press event in Paris, tackling upcoming games, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. While I’ll have deeper thoughts to share about individual Switch 2 games in the near future, we’re going to focus on the hardware itself in this article. Has Nintendo delivered a new level of Switch splendor or should you keep your expectations docked? Scroll on for my early hands-on impressions…</span></p>

<h2><b>Form Factor</b></h2>
<p><span>Those who have had a Nintendo Switch rattling around in their backpack for the past eight years will find themselves on familiar ground with the Switch 2 in terms of basic form and function, although almost everything about the new system feels a bit more polished and cohesively designed. While slightly larger than its predecessor, the Switch 2 still feels manageable to hold, and despite packing a lot more processing power, the system remains surprisingly thin and light (perhaps even lighter than the original Switch). The matte plastic the system is made of feels nice to the touch, and, hopefully, won’t be a magnet for palm sweat.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Various small tweaks to the Switch 2 make it feel like a more modern, deluxe device, including a sturdy new flexible kickstand and dual USB-C ports, which could open the way for a broader range of accessories, like the newly-announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-camera-function/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</a>. I didn’t spend a lot of time examining the new Switch 2 dock closely as they were almost all hidden behind glass, but Nintendo has said it has a fan to actively cool the system now, boosting performance gains when playing docked.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch23.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>The Switch 2 offers up a larger (approximately 8-inch) 1080p screen, with a slimmer bezel. The screen looked quite sharp, lacking the jagginess often seen when playing the OG Switch in handheld mode, although it is noticeable that the screen is a touch less bright and vibrant than the Switch OLED’s screen. For now, greater sharpness in exchange for a bit less brightness is a trade-off you’re going to have to make (as somebody who only plays Switch in handheld mode on occasion, I don’t mind, but your mileage may vary).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Overall, the Switch 2 is a handsome little devil that you may want to spend a few minutes just admiring in your hands before you jump into a game, although I’d be lying if I said the design upgrades are truly transformative. This is the Switch you know, just polished up a bit.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch24.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><b>The Joy-Con Grows Up</b></h2>
<p><span>Arguably the lion’s share of the Switch 2’s design upgrades have gone towards improving the detachable Joy-Con controllers. The OG Switch’s Joy-Cons always felt like a good idea that hadn’t been fully realized – too small, too finicky, too flimsy and prone to stick drift and other failures. While the Switch 2’s new Joy-Cons have been extended less than an inch compared to the original models, they do feel more substantial in the hand. The sticks feel less flimsy, and a Nintendo rep present at the preview hinted they’ve been re-engineered to head off drift (something the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NY Times got hints about too</a>). Whether the new Switch 2 Joy-Cons will be more resilient in the long term remains to be seen, but they felt sturdier to me.</span></p>
<p><span>The Switch 2 Joy-Cons also come with some new functionality, including an IR sensor that allows the player to use a Joy-Con like a mouse. I had a chance to test the mouse functionality with several games, including Metroid Prime 4 and the updated Switch 2 version of Mario Party Jamboree and the controls were perfectly responsive and holding the Joy-Con on its edge felt surprisingly comfortable. That said, Nintendo may still have to hone their approach to mouse controls, as some games, particularly Metroid Prime 4, still require you to press the face buttons on the Joy-Con you’re using as a mouse, which doesn’t feel intuitive. The new Joy-Cons’ HD Rumble also feels as though it’s been subtly updated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oh, and yes, as somebody who likes messing around with anything magnetic, the way the new Joy-Cons satisfyingly snap onto the side of the Switch is an immense improvement over the old janky rail system. Once connected to the main Switch 2 unit, the Joy-Cons felt fully secure, but again, we’ll have to wait and see regarding long-term durability.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><b>Nintendo Power</b></h2>
<p><span>Nintendo’s developers are a talented lot, but they’ve been working with more or less the same toolbox for well over a decade, given the Switch was only marginally more powerful than the Wii U. While Nintendo remains largely mum about the Switch 2’s under-the-hood improvements, it’s clear the toolbox has finally received an upgrade. That said, it’s also clear it will likely take Nintendo devs a while to adapt to the new power at their fingertips. Much like the earliest crop of Wii U titles, which marked Nintendo’s first foray into HD gaming, Switch 2’s first games look better than most of what we’ve seen from the company before, but it also feels like they’re leaving a lot of potential on the table.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the first-party content shown by Nintendo at the hands-on event can be roughly sorted into three piles – new big AAA-style experiences (Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Metroid Prime 4), enhanced “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition” versions of older Switch games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> + Star-Crossed World, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-party-jamboree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Party Jamboree</a> + Jamboree TV), and quirky stuff designed to show off the system’s new control features (Drag x Drive, Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, and, uh, Super Party Jamboree again).</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch27.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>The most successful group were the big headline games. Mario Kart World very much feels like a direct follow-up to Mario Kart 8, and that’s not a bad thing. While Mario Kart World doesn’t necessarily stand out that much visually next to MK8, Nintendo is undoubtedly putting the Switch 2’s power to some use with the game’s higher 24 racer playercount and interconnected open world. Donkey Kong Bananza offers up a bold reboot of the Kongiverse and looks to provide all the varied challenges, collectibles, and hidden extras you’d expect from a major Nintendo release. The slice of Metroid Prime 4 I got to play left me with some questions, but there was no denying its technical prowess, running an impressive 120fps in Performance mode, with none of the rough un-aliased edges we've become used to seeing from some Nintendo games.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch29.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades didn’t land with quite as much impact. While playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom with 4K visuals and a smooth framerate was certainly nice, it wasn’t the transformative experience I expected it to be. Perhaps my favorite upgraded Switch experience was Kirby and the Forgotten Land, which looks better than ever (it was already one of the prettiest Switch titles) and adds the new Star-Crossed Worlds content, which promises to be just as fun as the original game.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Quirky Stuff bag was a bit more mixed. The additions to Mario Party Jamboree were all quite entertaining, but I’m not sure how much they’ll extend the life of the game. Drag x Drive was, frankly, a bit of a drag. Perhaps the best of the quirky crew was actually Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, which features some fun diversions and ought to come at a nice price.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch210.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Each individual game’s pros and cons aside (again, I'll have more to say about that in the future), it really does have to be stated how refreshing the technical polish of all of them were. Almost every game I played, from Mario Kart World, to Donkey Kong Bananza, to Metroid Prime 4 ran at an unblemished 60fps (or more). The OG Switch has been showing its age for some time now, so just the clarity, smoothness, and general technical prowess of most of the games I played felt revelatory in its own small way. I’m particularly excited to see what Nintendo might do with the hardware a few years down the line.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><b>Current Thoughts on Nintendo Switch 2</b></h2>
<p><span>It’s been a long time since Nintendo last chose to simply iterate on a successful formula with a new console. Since the 90s with the Super Nintendo, arguably. They’ve been so dedicated to throwing the baby out with the bathwater for so many successive generations, that the Switch 2 ends up feeling rather refreshing in a way. That said, they’re also asking quite a bit for this “Super” upgrade – $450 for the console itself, with games perhaps as much as $80. That may complicate the “Should I buy this right away?” math for some people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re one of the sizable number of folks who have affection for their trusty Switches, it seems quite likely you’ll enjoy the Switch 2. The system looks better, feels better, the Joy-Cons are sturdier and more versatile, and playing Nintendo games with some decent hardware grunt behind them is a nice change of pace. Whether the Switch 2 reaches the commercial heights of the OG Switch will largely depend on its library of games, but titles like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza show Nintendo can still deliver fun, and sometimes unexpected, experiences with their long-running franchises. While I need more time with the Switch 2 to render a final verdict, it feels like the pieces are there for another hybrid hit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep an eye out for my hands-on impressions of Switch 2 games, including Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and more over the coming days. The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5 with pre-orders going live on April 9.</span></p>
