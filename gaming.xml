  <p id="FRhJKf">There’s a new brand of pre-painted tabletop gaming terrain on the market, and no one that I’ve talked to seems to know how it’s being made. Best I can figure, it’s Polish space magic.</p>
<p id="BQXK7i">In February this year Archon Studio (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/25/21147787/wolfenstein-board-game-announcement-miniatures"><em>Wolfenstein The Board Game</em></a>, <em>Masters of the Universe: Battleground</em>) announced <a href="https://archon-studio.com/blog/prismacast-a-revelation-in-rpg-terrain-market">PrismaCast</a>, its new line of pre-painted tabletop terrain. But the pitch — that these bits would come out of the box, on a plastic sprue, but with “detail typically reserved for the industry’s elite painters” — simply sounded too good to be true. Now that I’m holding the first of its retail releases, fresh out of a box from its Polish factory, I’m fairly shook. These <a href="https://archon-studio.com/dungeonsandlasers?product=1">Dwarven Mine pre-painted half-height walls</a> look great, with multiple shades to build up a highlight and a nice, evenly-applied wash to bring out those little details. There’s even an attempt at object source lighting, with lanterns and torches casting colorful shades and shadows along the walls.</p>

<p id="MIDYnm">Simply put, Archon’s terrain looks excellent — not quite as good as I could do <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23643118/how-to-paint-miniatures">here myself at home</a>, but far better than anything I’ve ever seen come fresh out of the box. And I have absolutely no idea how they’ve done it, nor how they managed to make it so inexpensive. The set here costs $89.99 and covers a fair amount of the table. For a proper layout, you’ll probably want at least a couple of them.</p>

<p id="jhE2pP">I’d say they were doing it by hand, but the pieces are simply too consistent. There’s a machine involved somewhere in the process, that’s for sure. Trouble is that none of the professionals in the world of industrial printing that I’ve quietly talked to this week have seen anything that can do this kind of work here in the United States. They, too, are stumped.</p>
<p id="Tn4fij">“It is entirely our own technology and we develop it consistently,” said project and marketing manager Kamil Grochowski in an email to Polygon. “The product you have in your hand is the first in a series. So it is safe to assume that the quality will only get better!”</p>

<p id="seHp5r">So while we don’t know what kind of equipment they’re using, Archon has provided the broad strokes. According to its initial press release, the terrain is first hand-painted by a professional artist. This box lists Kuba Sawicki as its painter on the Dwarven Mines, and they are even credited on the back of the box. Sawicki’s work was then turned into a digital model using <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/25/5547708/how-the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-devs-are-using-photography-to-mimic">photogrammetry</a>, a technique that’s been in circulation in the world of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/17/11251930/star-wars-battlefront-gdc-photogrammetry-at-at-foot">video gaming</a> for at least a decade now. But then... somehow... they then put it on to the highly irregular surface of the miniature.</p>
<p id="QMh5KD">How remains a mystery. But I tell you what: The finish is strong as hell. Scratching it with a metal drill bit, even with a decent pressure, does next to nothing to it. If you want to repaint or otherwise improve on it, Grochowski says not to bother stripping it. Instead, he says to just paint right over the top.</p>
<p id="xHm3gI">In addition to these Dwarven Mines, Archon also has another set coming out shortly. Designed in partnership with Paizo, the <a href="https://archon-studio.com/shop/products/dungeons-lasers/pathfinder-terrain-abomination-vaults-pre-painted">Pathfinder Terrain: Abomination Vaults Pre-Painted</a>, with all its mindflaying horrors, will begin shipping soon.</p>

Fight all the way down until you get to another terminal to activate and then fight your way back out. The mission will end once you’re outside of building A on the elevated landing that looks out on the beach. </p><hr><p><br>With its excellent assortment of combat challenges in a semi-free-roaming mission structure, “The Silent Cartographer” is easily one of the all-time best <em>Halo</em> missions. Don’t miss this chance to experience it with up to three friends, which really changes the dynamic and makes it feel akin to a <em>Destiny </em>strike. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws was one of the more exciting gameplay trailers we saw during Summer Game Fest, specifically kicking off Ubisoft Forward. It looks like a mixture of Red Dead Redemption 2 and Star Wars, and I’m all here for it! But I have a question, as do many of you. How many planets are in Star Wars Outlaws?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-planets-can-we-explore-in-star-wars-outlaws">How Many Planets Can We Explore in Star Wars Outlaws?</h2>



<p>In all, Star Wars Outlaws features five planets for us to venture to and explore, with quests on each one to flesh out the main and side stories. The available planets include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Akiva</strong>: Akiva is a jungle planet home to numerous droid factories and industrial complexes. Its large city welcomes outlaws.</li>



<li><strong>Cantonica</strong>: A hub world full of wealthy criminals, where gambling is the go-to vice daily for many. There’s even a luxury resort, should you care to sneak in and lift a few items.</li>



<li><strong>Kijimi</strong>: A frozen-over world, which we first saw in The Rise of the Skywalker, that fell to bandit attacks and became a haven for criminals.</li>



<li><strong>Tatooine</strong>: An iconic Star Wars planet from the films—a seemingly endless desert expanse home to criminal organizations, such as the Hutts, but full of opportunity for an outlaw.</li>



<li><strong>Toshara Moon</strong>: The Moon of Toshara, while not technically a planet, is a brand-new location explicitly built for the game. It features settlements, a sprawling city, and plenty of open land to race your speeder bike.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-does-star-wars-outlaws-feature-space-flight">Does Star Wars Outlaws Feature Space Flight?</h2>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws does feature space flight to some extent, though many liken it to Starfield’s mechanics. It appears you can fly around the immediate orbit of a planet or moon, but if you want to travel between two planets, you must use a hyperdrive to immediately zip through space.</p>



<p>If this is disappointing to you, consider the fact that Star Wars Outlaws isn’t a space simulator. It’s an on-the-ground story about an outlaw and her pals, and space flight is simply a means to an end for the group.</p>



<p>That said, here’s hoping it’s a little more fleshed-out and fun!</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/carcassonne-board-game-buying-guide</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/carcassonne-board-game-buying-guide.898608/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/carcassonne-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Carcassonne is a modern classic that stands up against any of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><u>best board games</u></a> today. Like Ticket to Ride or Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne has widely become known as one of the gateway board games thanks in part to an approachable ruleset that gives players an introduction to popular mechanics while still offering enough strategy for serious hobbyists. </p><p>Also like other gateway games, Carcassonne features dozens of expansions and spin-offs that allow new players to grow alongside the series. Unfortunately, a wealth of options can sometimes be a double-edged sword for newer tabletop gamers as it often leads to analysis paralysis. That’s why we have compiled this easy-to-follow guide to the entire series. Naturally, the best place to start is with the base game, as all expansions require it to play.</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><h3>Carcassonne</h3><div id="201749"><p><h3>Carcassonne</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 7+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 30-45 mins</li></ul><p>Carcassonne is a relatively straightforward tile-placement game. Players take turns drawing tiles to help build out the ever-expanding map. During a player’s turn, they can also choose to place a meeple on the board to claim landmarks such as roads or cities. Claiming landmarks scores points and the player with the most points after the map is completed is the winner. Of course, things are never that simple as other players will also want to claim valuable landmarks and potentially keep you from scoring as well.</p><p>Placing tiles soon becomes a strategic operation where players want to expand the map in a way that benefits themselves but not others. Sometimes, however, it cannot be helped. The luck of the draw may not give you the tile you so desperately need, meaning you’ll be forced to weigh your options and make the best of a bad situation. </p><p>As two rounds of Carcassonne never quite play out the same way, the base game offers plenty of replayability. In fact, the base game is likely all newer players will need for quite a while. Still, it’s nice to have some variability for games like Carcassonne that tend to get to the table quite often. Many of the various expansions add features and mechanics that relate to scoring, giving players even more strategic options. It should also be noted that the latest version of Carcassonne includes both the fan-favorite River and Abbot expansions. All river tiles must be played first and the abbot is a special meeple that can be picked up and scored before landmarks are completed.</p><h2>Expansions</h2><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 1: Inns &amp; Cathedrals</h3><div id="201750"><p><h3>Carcassonne Inns &amp; Cathedrals Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Pink Meeples for Sixth Player</li><li>18 New Land Tiles Featuring Inns and Cathedrals</li><li>Six Large Meeples</li><li>Double-sided Scoring Tiles</li></ul><p>Before diving into the inns and cathedrals aspects of the expansion, this add-on is noteworthy in that it includes components for a sixth player. These components are designed to be inserted directly into the original box, giving players even more options for crowded game nights. If you want to see our recommendations for even more titles that play well with large groups, check out our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-6-player-board-games"><u>best six-player board games</u></a>.</p><p>The titular inns and cathedrals are new landmarks that allow for additional scoring when completing roads or cities. These tiles simply shuffle into the original box and are otherwise placed normally. When scoring, cities with cathedrals and roads with inns net more points than those without. Lastly, Inns &amp; Cathedrals adds a big meeple that essentially counts as two regular-sized meeples, leading to even more scoring and serving as a tie-breaker for controlling landmarks.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 2: Traders &amp; Builders</h3><div id="201751"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Traders &amp; Builders Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>24 New Land Tiles</li><li>20 Goods Tokens</li><li>6 Builder Pieces and 6 Pig Pieces</li><li>1 Cloth Bag</li></ul><p>Traders &amp; Builders isn’t a game-changing expansion, but it does offer some new ways to score and place tiles. Arguably the biggest addition is the new tiles that feature symbols for goods such as cloth, wine, and wheat. Players collect goods when claiming landmarks with these icons, and bonus points are awarded to those with the most of a certain resource at the end of the game.</p><p>Additionally, Traders &amp; Builders introduces two new pieces – the builder and the pig. Essentially, builders allow players to place a second tile during their turn if placed on a landmark that already contains a meeple, and pigs score additional points for meeples claiming fields.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 3: The Princess &amp; The Dragon</h3><div id="201752"><p><h3>Carcassonne: The Princess &amp; The Dragon Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>30 New Land Tiles</li><li>1 Dragon Token</li><li>1 Fairy Token</li></ul><p>The Princess &amp; The Dragon introduces the biggest tweak to gameplay thus far, meeple removal. Volcano tiles summon the dragon token that takes out those who get in its way. Additionally, the princess tile can be played to remove knights from cities. The only protection against these tactics is the fairy token. The other new addition is the magic portal tile which allows players to place meeples on previously laid tiles.</p><p>Rather than incorporating new ways to score, The Princess &amp; The Dragon adds new competitive tactics to Carcassonne. It’s still not a fundamentally new game, but it offers one of the bigger deviations from the original title.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 4: The Tower</h3><div id="201753"><p><h3>Carcassonne: The Tower Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $19.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>18 New Land Tiles</li><li>30 Tower Floors</li><li>1 Tile Tower</li></ul><p>The Tower is one of the more divisive expansions as it focuses more on building up rather than expanding outward. Towers essentially act as area control landmarks, but even more than that, these structures can capture opposing meeples on adjacent tiles. The higher the tower goes, the further its reach. Captured meeples can be returned to their original player, but only for the ransom price of three victory points.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 5: Abbey &amp; Mayor</h3><div id="201754"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Abbey &amp; Mayo Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12 New Land Tiles</li><li>6 Abbey Tiles</li><li>Barn, Mayor, and Wagon Pieces for Each Player</li></ul><p>The Abbey &amp; Mayor expansion takes a break from removing meeples and instead gets back to offering players even more ways to score points. The new abbey tiles act as a sort of wild card piece designed to plug holes that might otherwise be difficult to complete. Mayors, on the other hand, serve as tie-breaker pieces for city control when two or more players are vying for the same town. Barns are placed in fields to score points from completed cities and wagons can move to adjacent landmarks after existing ones are completed.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 6: Count, King &amp; Robber</h3><div id="201755"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Count, King &amp; Robber Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 Large City Tiles</li><li>22 New Land Tiles</li><li>Count, King, and Robber Pieces</li><li>King and Robber Tiles</li></ul><p>Count, King &amp; Robber is yet another expansion that deviates considerably from the base game. Arguably the biggest change is the addition of the large city tiles that allow players to move meeples from the city to complete landmarks and vice versa. Players can even add meeples to the city after completing other players’ landmarks, promoting even more interaction and strategy. Additionally, the king and robber components reward players for developing the longest road and the biggest cities. Because of the added rules and components, Count, King &amp; Robber is not quite as easy to teach as other expansions, but it’s still simple enough to understand after a round or two.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 8: Bridges, Castles &amp; Bazaars</h3><div id="201756"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Bridges, Castles &amp; Bazaars Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12 New Land Tiles</li><li>12 Castle Tiles</li><li>12 Bridge Pieces</li></ul><p>Before we dive into Bridges, Castles &amp; Bazaars, some eagle-eyed mathematicians might have noticed that we skipped Expansion 7. That’s because the dexterity-based add-on is out of print. As we’ll discuss just a bit later, Carcassonne has released dozens of expansions over the years, and many of them have since been discontinued.</p><p>One of the more notable features of this expansion is the bazaar tiles that allow players to host an auction where they can spend earned points on desirable tiles. This is a bit of a hit-or-miss add-on that some fans find fun and others feel slows the game down too much. Additionally, the expansion allows players to build around dead ends using bridges. Castles, on the other hand, can be placed in cities to score even more points. </p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 9: Hills &amp; Sheep</h3><div id="201757"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Hills &amp; Sheep Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>18 New Land Tiles</li><li>18 Flock Tokens</li><li>6 Shephard Piece</li><li>1 Cloth Bag</li></ul><p>The Hills &amp; Sheep expansion adds a sort of test-your-luck mechanic thanks to the shepherd piece and flock tokens. Shepherds are placed in open fields and players then select tokens blindly from a bag. Sheep tokens score points while wolf tokens remove the shepherd piece from the board. Hills, on the other hand, are a new tie-breaking feature. Additionally, vineyards are added for even more scoring potential.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 10: Under the Big Top</h3><div id="201758"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Under the Big Top Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>20 New Land Tiles</li><li>12 Circus Tiles</li><li>8 Acrobat Tiles</li><li>16 Animal Tokens</li><li>1 Big Top Token</li><li>6 Ringmaster Meeples</li></ul><p>Under the Big Top goes all in on its circus theme. Interestingly, however, the circus tiles are a bit of a gamble. When new circus tiles are played, the big top tile is moved from the previous one and replaced by an animal token with a number value. The number value is then attributed to surrounding meeples. Additionally, the ringmaster meeple scores additional points for every circus feature adjacent to it. Not to mention, meeples can stack on acrobat tiles to net even more points. Rather than other expansions that allow players more scoring options, Under the Big Top more or less changes the focus of Carcassonne altogether. This isn’t necessarily a good or bad thing; rather, it’s a change of pace that can make an old favorite feel like new.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Carcassonne Big Box (2022 Edition)</h3><div id="201759"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Big Box (2022 Edition)</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $89.99</p><p><strong>Components</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Carcassonne Base Game</li><li>Inns &amp; Cathedrals Expansion</li><li>Traders &amp; Builders Expansion</li><li>The Abbot, The River, The Flying Machines, The Ferries, The Messengers, The Gold Mines, Mage &amp; Witch, The Robbers, and The Crop Circles Expansions</li><li>More Than 150 Tiles</li><li>7 Different Types of Meeples</li></ul><p>Every so often, Carcassonne releases a new big box that contains the base game and several expansions. The most recent edition contains the base game, the Inns &amp; Cathedrals expansion, and the Traders &amp; Builders expansion, as well as the abbot, river, robbers, and several other pieces from previous expansions. The big box is a great place to start as it offers quite a bit of content all in one package. Many fans consider the first two expansions some of the best, so having both in one package is certainly a win for the Carcassonne Big Box.</p><h3>Carcassonne 20th Anniversary Edition</h3><div id="201760"><p><h3>Carcassonne 20th Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $49.99</p><p><strong>Components</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>87 Land Tiles</li><li>17 River Tiles</li><li>40 Meeples</li><li>5 Abbotts</li><li>1 Scoreboard</li><li>Character Stickers</li></ul><p>Carcassonne also offers a 20th-anniversary edition that is mostly the same as the base game but adds some upgraded visuals and meeple stickers. Additionally, the anniversary edition also includes exclusive tiles that add even more variability and scoring opportunities.</p><h3>Carcassonne: Amazonas</h3><div id="201761"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Amazonas</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $34.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Carcassonne: Amazonas is a standalone title incompatible with the original game and its expansions. Amazonas plays similarly to standard Carcassonne, but it introduces boats that venture down the river. However, in a given turn, players must decide if they want to play meeples or advance their boat. Both actions score points, giving players various potential paths to victory.</p><h3>Carcassonne: Gold Rush</h3><div id="201762"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Gold Rush</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $34.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Like Amazonas, Carcassonne: Gold Rush is a standalone title incompatible with the original game and its expansions. This time, however, the franchise takes a trip to the Old West. Outside of aesthetics, the major difference between Gold Rush and standard Carcassonne is the mining mechanic. Claiming mountains more or less works like any other landmark in Carcassonne, except they return mining tokens. These tokens can award up to five points (or pieces of gold) or as little as zero points. Essentially, it's like mining gold – sometimes you get lucky, and sometimes you don’t. </p><h3>Carcassonne: Hunters &amp; Gatherers</h3><div id="201763"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Hunters &amp; Gatherers</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Carcassonne: Hunters &amp; Gatherers is a prehistoric-themed version of Carcassonne. It mostly plays the same as standard Carcassonne, however, players can score additional points for animals located within their landmarks. Additionally, finishing forests (Hunters &amp; Gatherers’ version of cities) awards players special valuable tiles. This occurs even when finishing another player’s forest, promoting even more player interaction. Like other standalone titles, Carcassonne: Hunters &amp; Gatherers is incompatible with the original game or any of its expansions.</p><h3>Carcassonne: Safari</h3><div id="201764"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Safari</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 7+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Carcassonne: Safari is yet another standalone version of Carcassonne incompatible with other entries in the series – this time, with an African safari theme. The rules largely remain the same, however, additional points are scored for different animals present on landmarks. Additionally, the newly added safari truck game piece also serves as a new mechanic. These pieces are placed in yet-to-be-played tile areas and can be picked up and moved for additional points when the map eventually expands to that part of the grid. Strategic placement can even lead to blocking other players, or at least, encouraging them to help you. </p><h3>Mists over Carcassonne</h3><div id="201765"><p><h3>Mists Over Carcassonne</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Mists over Carcassonne is the first cooperative iteration of the series. This version plays similarly to standard Carcassonne, however, players score points together to try and reach the threshold for victory. While that sounds simple enough, players also need to worry about managing the number of ghosts on the board present by finishing up the new mist landmarks. Allowing too many ghosts to run rampant on the board or failing to achieve a certain amount of points in a given period means that players lose. Also, for fans of the traditional Carcassonne experience, there is an additional set of rules to play Mists as a competitive experience.</p><h3>My First Carcassonne</h3><div id="161851"><p><h3>My First Carcassonne</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $34.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 4+</li><li>Players: 2-4</li><li>Play Time: 10-20 mins</li></ul><p>As the name would suggest, My First Carcassonne is a simplified version of Carcassonne that targets a younger demographic. Due to its streamlined ruleset and more colorful artwork, we identified My First Carcassonne as one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds"><u>best board games for five-year-olds</u></a>. This title leads younger gamers nicely into standard Carcassonne, which is easily one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games"><u>best family board games</u></a> available and suited best for ages eight and up.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Carcassonne: Digital Version</h3><p>Like many other popular titles, Carcassonne has also made the leap to digital on several platforms. It is available as Carcassonne on the Nintendo Switch <a href="https://zdcs.link/mV2gN" target="_blank">eShop</a> for $19.99 MSRP. Additionally, it can be found as Carcassonne - Tiles &amp; Tactics on PC and mobile for $9.99 MSRP. Expansions such as Inns &amp; Cathedrals and Builders &amp; Traders can be purchased as DLC. Carcassonne can also be played online at <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board Game Arena</a> with a Premium subscription. Premium memberships start at $3 per month and give subscribers access to hundreds of popular board games like Ark Nova, Terraforming Mars, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-buying-guide">Wingspan</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/azul-board-game-buying-guide">Azul</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/catan-3d-review">Catan</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-legacy-legends-of-the-west-board-game-review">Ticket to Ride</a>, and more.</p><h2>Discontinued Versions</h2><p>In your Carcassonne research, you may come across discontinued titles like Carcassonne Star Wars, for example. Entries like this, the Old Testament-themed Ark of the Covenant spin-off, and the missing Catapult expansion referenced earlier are generally only available on the secondhand market. While current publisher Z-Man Games has reprinted many iterations, some are simply lost to time, potentially destined to become collector’s items.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Carcassonne is a versatile game that can be enjoyed simply as its base experience or be iterated upon through its various expansions. Luckily, many of the games listed above can be found for well under MSRP at retailers like Amazon, Target, and Walmart.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shop-titans-celebrates-its-fifth-anniversary-with-a-myriad-of-new-content<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The free-to-play tycoon simulator/adventure RPG Shop Titans is celebrating its fifth anniversary with gifts to players. The game just launched a big new update that's available now — players can earn several rewards by logging in during the anniversary event, and there will be giveaways and sales too.</p><p>Since its launch in 2019, Shop Titans has attracted players with its cozy, relaxing gameplay, charming aesthetic, and endless options for creating and customizing their perfect shop. Available on both PC and mobile devices, the game lets you step into the life of a new shopkeeper. Set in a fantasy world filled with character-driven banter between its Champions and city Workers, you can become a fantasy shop tycoon by crafting epic weapons, managing a store to success, building a team of adventurers to quest for loot, and selling items for huge profits.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/31/5-year-key-art-1717180495800.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Customers will consistently come by your shop, but won’t know what you have to offer if it's not on display. So you need to create weapon racks, armor mannequins, and the like to show off your crafted gear. Customers will buy items off the rack, giving you money that you can use to improve your shop. You can expand your space, add decorations, or hire more craftspeople to give you access to new types of items.</p><p>As you craft more of each item, you’ll unlock blueprints for higher level items that will make you more money. Some of them will require materials you don’t have on hand, so you’ll need to hire Heroes to go out and gather the materials for you. That’s where the RPG elements come in. After you hire Heroes, you’ll equip them before sending them on quests to gather the materials you need. Once their quest is over, they’ll return with the materials you requested in addition to treasure chests with even more loot.</p><p>All of these different systems also have their own levels. As you craft items to sell, the craftspeople will level up. As you sell items, your merchant level will grow. As you send heroes out into the field, their levels will increase. They’ll learn new skills and be able to tackle more difficult quests, spurring constant growth.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/05/shop-frame-1717568364632.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The new Fifth Anniversary update extends that growth even more, adding several new blueprints, merchant level loops, shop expansion options, and more. Players can look forward to the update's biggest addition — a new type of very rare blueprint called artifacts that come in three minor or major levels.</p><p>The six new artifacts are each a different type of equipment — there’s a katana, suit of armor, amulet, cowl, spellbook, and pickaxe. They are difficult to acquire and craft, but they're much stronger than other blueprints of the same tier and give special bonuses that can’t be achieved any other way.</p><p>Those bonuses can make certain artifacts especially useful to specific classes. For instance, the new artifact katana gives a 200% boost to critical damage but limits critical chance to 20%. However, the Samurai automatically gets a critical hit in the first round. So that attack gets the benefit of the damage boost without the drawback of lower chance. Similarly, the amulet gives a boost to evasion and skill HP bonus, but it seals that character’s weapon and makes it useless. Well, that drawback doesn’t affect fist fighters.</p><p>The artifacts aren’t the only new addition. There are now looping merchant levels that allow you to progress past level 100. Once you pass level 100, you’ll get a new level banner and loop back to level 1. You can level up to 100 again, and you can do this up to five times for a total level of 500. You’ll still get gems every time you level up, and each time you enter a new loop, you’ll get added bonuses with every level of that loop.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/31/backyard-example-1717180371697.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Then there are new options for shop customization. You’ve always been able to expand your shop with new sections in a 3x3 grid, but now you can transform any of those sections into yard space. That means you can place outdoor decorations in those spaces, giving you lots of new ways to get creative with the look and layout of your shop.</p><p>There’s still more coming, too. There will be a daily giveaway exclusively on the Webstore starting June 14, where players can claim a free item every day. The giveaway item changes every 24 hours, so if you want to get everything, make sure to log in each day. There will also be a big sale from June 14–17, where players can get all kinds of discounts, as well as a new item called the Seed of Merit, which can increase a Hero or Champion’s level past the level cap, available exclusively during the anniversary sale.</p><p>In addition, players can expect an in-game anniversary login calendar that will give free rewards, and two additional new artifacts will be revealed during the anniversary event as well. In short, now’s the time to jump into Shop Titans and take advantage of all these exciting opportunities. Players rave about the game on Steam, IOS, Google Play, Epic Games Store, and the Microsoft Store, so download the game for free and start your shopkeeping journey.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the video, we see a more grown-up, Max Caulfield, as a photographer for Caledon University.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Life is Strange: Double Exposure – Announce Trailer (ESRB)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TOYz4NCFIXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">Compared to the original <em>Life is Strange</em>, <em>Double Exposure</em> ups the ante in terms of graphics. Max’s character design, especially, has much more detail, making her seem more lifelike.</p>
 <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false">In addition to the Announcement Trailer, a <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5oyn4xIYRY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">special livestream</a> is on its way. Look forward to the event on June 13 at 9 a.m. PT/5 p.m. BST/6 p.m. CET.</p> <h2 id="h-is-life-is-strange-double-exposure-a-sequel" data-injectable="false">Is Life is Strange: Double Exposure a sequel?</h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">Given that the game is a continuation of Max’s story, it is assumed that <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure </em>is a sequel. However, the <a href="https://deckninegames.com/introducing-life-is-strange-double-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deck Nine Games</a> site states that it is a “standalone experience.” That means you don’t need any knowledge of the original, and they may offer a potential recap of the events that transpired before.</p>
 <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">Even though it’s a standalone game, it’ll likely feature plenty of callbacks to <em>Life is Strange</em>. We already got some hints of this in the trailer when Max mentions that she made a promise never to use her powers again. This, of course, refers back to the original when she harnessed her ability to time shift.</p> <h2 id="h-is-chloe-in-life-is-strange-double-exposure" data-injectable="false">Is Chloe in Life is Strange: Double Exposure?</h2> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">Many <em>LiS </em>fans have wondered about Chloe Price’s whereabouts, as she is not mentioned in the trailer. As of right now, it isn’t clear if Chloe will reappear in <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>. We can hope that she will make her return to the game or get some clarification about her current standings.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Dontnod Entertainment/Deck Nine Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="false">While we don’t know about Chloe’s fate in <em>Double Exposure</em>, she was at least mentioned in <em>LiS 2</em> and <em>True Colors’ Wavelengths</em>. The same thing could be done for her again in this new entry, but we’ll need to wait and see.</p>

            <p>
Sumo Group, the parent company of Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Texas Chain Saw Massacre developer Sumo Digital, has announced plans to reduce its workforce by up to 15 percent, putting nearly 270 employees across the UK, Canada, Poland, Czech Republic, and India at risk.
</p>
<p>
"Whilst Sumo has been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced," the company <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2024/sumo-group-update/">wrote</a>, "we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward."
</p>
<p>
To that end, Sumo has made "the difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways", which "unfortunately will include a reduction in the number of people the business can support". While Sumo says it has considered "every alternate route to limit the impact to our people", it confirms up to 15 percent of employees in the UK, Canada, Poland, Czech Republic, and India (from a workforce of 1,790 according to <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/">its website</a>) will be affected.

After ten years of waiting, BioWare is finally blowing the lid off the fourth entry in its fantasy RPG series. The studio put out a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">cinematic trailer</a></span> showcasing the game’s party members during the Xbox Showcase, and released a gameplay trailer that showed off 20-minutes of in-game footage. There’s a lot to sift through, but here are some big takeaways from the past week of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> reveals.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7176fe9a5ca4d1e30ea51b482caac94c" data-recommend-id="image://7176fe9a5ca4d1e30ea51b482caac94c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Veilguard combat encounter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Veilguard combat encounter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7176fe9a5ca4d1e30ea51b482caac94c" data-recommend-id="image://7176fe9a5ca4d1e30ea51b482caac94c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Veilguard combat encounter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Straight up, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is the hardest pivot to an action game the series has ever done. While <em>Dragon Age II</em> and <em>Inquisition</em> tried to blend the tactical combat of <em>Origins </em>with real-time action, <em>The Veilguard </em>forgoes any notion of doing that in favor of something that resembles a character action game like <em>God of War</em>. It looks <em>really</em> solid as an action game, at least. But your mileage may vary on if that’s what you’re looking for out of a new <em>Dragon Age </em>game.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-recommend-id="image://4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Veilguard ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Veilguard ability wheel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-recommend-id="image://4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Veilguard ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While there’s a focus on real-time action this time around, you will still have abilities to use, cooldowns to manage, and a way to pause the action as you sort through which of those you want to use. <em>The Veilguard </em>will have its own equivalent of the <em>Mass Effect </em>combat wheel that lets you stop the fight, pick an ability, aim it at the baddie of your choice, and fire it off. The wheel we saw in the gameplay trailer had nine ability slots, but it appears that you’ll be able to tab over to another wheel similar to previous games.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-recommend-id="image://e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Davrin, and Bellara prepare for a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook, Davrin, and Bellara prepare for a fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-recommend-id="image://e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Davrin, and Bellara prepare for a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first three <em>Dragon Age </em>games let you have three party members with you at all times. That won’t be the case in <em>The Veilguard</em>. In keeping with the aforementioned <em>Mass Effect</em>-ification of things, <em>The Veilguard </em>will only let you have two companions by your side at once. This will naturally affect party composition and strategies, but if <em>The Veilguard </em>keeps the series’ beloved party banter, it will change how those conversations play out as it will often be between only two characters.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-recommend-id="image://db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor serving cunt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor serving cunt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-recommend-id="image://db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor serving cunt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given <em>The Veilguard</em>’s focus on Solas, the party-member-turned-antagonist from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, it’s not a surprise that The Inquisitor, the protagonist from the 2014 RPG, will be returning. Players will be able to customize the appearance of The Inquisitor similar to how they did <em>Dragon Age II </em>protagonist Hawke in the last game. We don’t know yet what their role will be, but it’s at least good to know they’ll be around for the conclusion of the story they started ten years ago, even though I would argue they should have been the protagonist of <em>The Veilguard</em>, but I digress.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-recommend-id="image://31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Emmrich, and Harding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook, Emmrich, and Harding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-recommend-id="image://31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Emmrich, and Harding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While BioWare has yet to publicly show <em>The Veilguard</em>’s character creator, <em>Kotaku</em> saw a glimpse of it at Summer Game Fest, and it has some real depth to it. You can play as four races: Human, Dwarf, Elf, and Qunari, and it will have sliders to change your body type. BioWare confirmed that even if you make your Rook a short king, the team has done work to ensure animations fit any character build. You’ll also be able to pick Rook’s pronouns, as well as their origin based on what faction they come from. This includes the Shadow Dragons, Grey Wardens, Antivan Crows, Lords of Fortune, Mourn Watch, and the Veil Jumpers. Each of these orders has a distinct place in <em>Dragon Age </em>lore and whichever one you pick will affect how some characters interact with you and open up new dialogue options. Like <em>Inquisition</em>, <em>The Veilguard </em>will have four voice options, two with British accents and two with American ones.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-recommend-id="image://5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Dragon Age Keep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Dragon Age Keep." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-recommend-id="image://5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Dragon Age Keep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>BioWare has become synonymous with importing choices from old games into new ones, but it’s been ten years since the last <em>Dragon Age</em>. As such, the studio is changing how it’s approaching bringing those choices across games. <em>The Veilguard </em>will allow you to pick what big decisions you made in the old games in its character creator, rather than importing an old save from <em>Inquisition</em>. This also means it won’t draw from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ages-save-file-solution-lets-you-rewrite-your-h-1217092939&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ages-save-file-solution-lets-you-rewrite-your-h-1217092939">Dragon Age Keep</a></span>, a browser app that lets you craft world states to import into <em>Inquisition</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5004a09b1ba7fc2df6fe274a5493b32c" data-recommend-id="image://5004a09b1ba7fc2df6fe274a5493b32c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook picking a dialogue option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook picking a dialogue option." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5004a09b1ba7fc2df6fe274a5493b32c" data-recommend-id="image://5004a09b1ba7fc2df6fe274a5493b32c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook picking a dialogue option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Veilguard </em>is bringing back <em>Dragon Age 2</em>s dialogue system, which was tone-based and resulted in its protagonist Hawke falling into one of three different personality states. You have three general tones in a conversation: kind, humorous, or aggressive, with slight variations depending on the situation. This dialogue system was interesting in the 2011 RPG because it would shape Hawke’s personality, even in scenes where you weren’t directly picking a dialogue option. We’ll see how <em>The Veilguard </em>handles it, but I will miss <em>Inquisition</em>’s less codified approach.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="560d3b40cb081a20caa15a2e0f6eb8bf" data-recommend-id="image://560d3b40cb081a20caa15a2e0f6eb8bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="560d3b40cb081a20caa15a2e0f6eb8bf" data-recommend-id="image://560d3b40cb081a20caa15a2e0f6eb8bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>BioWare has been adamant that changing this game’s name from <em>Dreadwolf </em>to <em>The Veilguard </em>has been in service of better representing the party-focused story it tells. That shift in messaging has been pretty apparent since the cinematic trailer put a spotlight on all seven companions who will join Rook on their quest.

<p>With the ongoing Steam Next Fest, which allows players a chance to download and check out various demos for upcoming games, folks find themselves drawn to Once Human. It was the first demo downloaded, and I’m finding it absolutely fantastic. But there’s a question in the air. Is Once Human Early Access?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-once-human-early-access-or-full-release">Is Once Human Early Access or Full Release?</h2>



<p>When Once Human officially releases on <strong>July 9</strong>, it will do so as a full-release title. Unlike most other survival-crafting games on the market today, the upcoming open-world survival shooter will not launch into Early Access. </p>



<p>It’s a fresh take and one we’re wholly open to. The current gameplay is satisfying, the creature designs are phenomenal, and, with a little more polish, it’ll prove itself as a long-term survival game for fans of the genre!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-survive-in-once-human">How to Survive in Once Human</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Starry Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>When you first dive into Once Human, either in the beta during Steam Next Fest or upon launch in early July, you’ll find the prologue rather welcoming. It does a fantastic job of smoothly introducing you to the gameplay mechanics, loot, and overall story beats. But then you’re thrust into the open world alongside a magical crow and told to survive. Here are a few tips:</p>



<ul>
<li>While you won’t die of hunger or thirst immediately upon touching down, it’s a wise move to keep food and water in your inventory for when times get tough. After all, this is a survival game. You require both to operate at peak efficiency.</li>



<li>While playing on a PvE server, don’t be afraid to make a friend or two. You can group up to tackle challenging points of interest, share loot, or even build a small community together in the open world. Even better is you can ask for help!</li>



<li>Your starting crossbow is excellent at dealing with shambling zombies and Watchers, but you’ll require smoothing with more oomph before long. Do your best to seek out a better weapon, ideally a firearm, quickly!</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>Alongside Once Human, there’s a handful of quality <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-next-fest-june-2024-10-games-you-need-to-check-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demos we recommend from Steam Next Fest</a>!

Here are Sethos’ best Quicken teams to maximize his damage!</p> <h2 id="h-sethos-in-quicken-teams" data-injectable="false">Sethos in Quicken teams</h2> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">First, a brief <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-dendro-reactions-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overview</a> of Quicken and Aggravate reactions. When Electro and Dendro combine in any order, an enemy receives the Quicken status. This looks like a green lightning effect around the enemy. Hitting an enemy in this state with Electro attacks triggers Aggravate, which increases the attack’s damage.</p> <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">Since Sethos relies on Quicken and Aggravate reactions, his best teams will feature Dendro teammates. You can supplement additional Electro or Anemo units, too, for additional damage and buffs.</p>
 <h2 id="h-best-dendro-teammates-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Best Dendro teammates for Sethos</h2> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Sethos should be paired with <strong>at least one Dendro teammate</strong> in order to maintain the Quicken status on enemies. Off-field Dendro application is particularly important, since Sethos will want to stay on-field <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-sethos-in-genshin-impact-normal-vs-charged-attack-playstyles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">using either Normal or Charged Attacks</a>. The best Dendro teammates for Sethos are:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Nahida</strong> – Provides high off-field Dendro application and damage.</li> <li><strong>Dendro Traveler</strong> – Provides good off-field Dendro application, but less damage than Nahida.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baizhu</a></strong> – Has less Dendro application, but still good enough, and provides healing.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yaoyao-healer-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yaoyao</a></strong> – Budget Baizhu.</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-other-teammates-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Other teammates for Sethos</h2> <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">Once you have your Dendro unit(s) picked out, fill in the empty slots on your team with some flex picks. Try a second Electro character who can deal off-field damage. Some examples include:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a></strong> – Provides energy and significant off-field Electro damage.</li> <li><strong>Yae Miko</strong> – Deals off-field Electro damage.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">You can also add an Anemo teammate holding the 4pc Viridescent Venerer artifact set. This set reduces enemies’ Electro RES, causing Sethos to deal more damage. Any Anemo unit can work here, but the best Anemo teammates for Sethos are:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Sucrose</strong> – Grants Elemental Mastery buffs.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kazuha-builds-in-genshin-impact-updated-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuha</a></strong> – Increases your team’s Electro DMG.</li> <li><strong>Jean, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xianyun-support-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xianyun</a>, or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sayu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sayu</a></strong> – Provide healing.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">Certain Geo characters also work well with Sethos. There is an opportunity cost to using some of them, though, since Geo characters often do best in full Geo teams, not Quicken teams. Nevertheless, these Geo units can have a place in Sethos’ teams.</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-zhongli-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhongli</a></strong> – Provides a shield and reduces enemy RES to all elements.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-albedo-build-in-genshin-impact-updated-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Albedo</a> or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-chiori-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chiori</a></strong> – Deal off-field Geo damage at intervals.</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-example-teams-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Example teams for Sethos</h2> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Sethos – Fischl – Yaoyao – Sucrose</li> <li>Sethos – Fischl – Baizhu – Kazuha</li> <li>Sethos – Yae Miko – Nahida – Baizhu</li> <li>Sethos – Fischl – Nahida – Zhongli</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="202" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Niantic has revealed details for the upcoming <em>Pokemon GO</em> Scorching Steps event, which kicks off on June 21, 2024. The event will start at 10 am local time, and ends on June 25, 2024, at 8 pm local time.</p> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">During this event, <em>Pokemon GO</em> players will get to take advantage of a number of event bonuses and catch a variety of featured Pokemon. Here are all the event bonuses active during <em>Pokemon GO</em> Scorching Steps:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false"> <li>Twice the amount of candy from hatching eggs</li> <li>Half distance required to hatch eggs that are placed into incubators during the event</li> <li>The first three eggs will only require one-fourth distance to hatch when using the <em>Pokemon GO</em> egg hatching widget</li> <li>There will be an increased chance to encounter hatch Shiny Slugma and Shiny Litleo</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h2 id="h-featured-pokemon" data-injectable="false">Featured Pokemon</h2> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">As the event bonuses suggest, the <em>Pokemon GO</em> Scorching Steps revolves around egg hatching, and will reward players for hatching eggs during this event. Larvesta can be hatched from 2 km, 5 km, and 10 km eggs during this event. All other featured Pokemon can be hatched, depending on the egg and the distance required to hatch it. Here are all the Pokemon you can hatch through eggs during the event:</p> <p data-characters="9" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true"><strong>2 km eggs</strong></p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li>Growlithe</li> <li>Slugma</li> <li>Houndour</li> <li>Magby</li> <li>Larvesta</li> </ul> <p data-characters="9" data-current-count="209" data-injectable="false"><strong>5 km eggs</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true"> <li>Hisuian Growlithe</li> <li>Darumaka</li> <li>Litwick</li> <li>Larvesta</li> <li>Litleo</li> <li>10 km eggs</li> <li>Larvesta</li> <li>Turtonator</li> <li>Charcadet</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">There are also event-themed field research tasks coming with this event, which will allow players to catch Slugma and Litleo by completing the tasks, and some players might be lucky enough to encounter Turtonator in the task rewards as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/rebel-moons-directors-cut-is-coming-with-a-new-title/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rebel-moons-directors-cut-is-coming-with-a-new-title<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="119" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Rebel Moon </em>director’s cut is coming to Netflix on August 2, and when it gets here, it will have a new name.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">Actually, it’ll have two new names. Zack Snyder took to social media today to unveil the release date for his extended double-feature as well as the fresh titles for each chapter of “Rebel Moon.”&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true"><em>Chalice of Blood </em>and <em>Curse of Forgiveness </em>are inevitably going to tell the same story as the PG-13 <em>Rebel Moon </em>movies, but fans are still going to have plenty of new things to see. Snyder told Variety that the new movies feature over an hour of extra content, and some of the new scenes were specifically held back until now. “We shot scenes just for the director’s cut,” Snyder said, adding, “So in that way, it’s really a revelation because it gives that second kick at the can for big fans.”</p>
 <p data-characters="757" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="false">The extra runtime will presumably flesh out the multiple worlds and characters that make up the core of <em>Rebel Moon</em>. The original <em>Child of Fire</em> had to introduce so many characters and concepts that the experience felt rushed, but that almost certainly won’t be the case with the new R-rated version. We’ll see how many people tune back in for these new versions. Both <em>Rebel Moon </em>movies were critical flops, and there might not be many people willing to sit back down for a longer version of the original experience, even if it does depict – as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-snyder-cut-is-on-the-way-later-this-year/1100-6524155/">official description states</a> – “the viciously sexier, bloodier world of <em>Rebel Moon</em>.” If it does well enough, maybe Snyder will get to make the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/latest-sci-fi-news-spielbergs-ufo-movie-for-all-mankind-renewed-and-rebel-moon-part-3/"><em>Rebel Moon 3</em> he’s apparently already plotted out</a>. </p>

            <p>I try to avoid describing video games in mathematical terms, but I can hardly avoid it here. Treasure Planet's flying galleons plus Spirited Away's bath house plus Spiritfarer's gentle building and management mechanics equals Hotel Galactic. Watch the trailer below and tell me I'm wrong.

<p>I'm not being reductive, right? Although it's not like Spiritfarer wasn't already channeling Ghibli.
</p>
<p>You build your hotel and design each room to cater to different kinds of guests, manage your staff by assigning actions and priorities, and seemingly form friendships with alien companions with special abilities and traits they can pass on to new joiners. 
</p>
<p>There's an implied villain at the end of the trailer above, although there's no real mention of potential conflict on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183670/Hotel_Galactic/">Hotel Galactic Steam page</a>. The closest it gets is a reference to a "spooky underground complex", in which you can discover "new materials, creatures and expand the construction space." Otherwise it's pitched as cosy from top to bottom.
</p>
<p>Hotel Galactic has no release date yet, but I'm intrigued. It'll apparently have a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/528325741/hotel-galactic-studio-ghibli-inspired-25d-inn-management">Kickstarter in July</a>, although whether that's to fund its existence, or polish, or something else, I don't know. In the meantime, let me do what YouTube did to me after I watched the trailer, and recommend Jenny Nicholson's latest video <a href="https://youtu.be/T0CpOYZZZW4?si=pG-I1fkZLA0NpIRF">on a different kind of galactic hotel</a>. I've watched all four hours of it twice.</p>

It was an exciting time for sure, but also a very busy time for the game industry. </p><p>With all these new trailers, teasers, announcements, and reveals, it’s likely you missed some of the coolest and biggest trailers from the last few days. If that’s the case, don’t worry, as we have cataloged the 16 best trailers from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">SGF 2024's wild weekend</a></span>. Here you go!</p></div></div><div><p>The Doom Slayer is back and this time he’s got a big shield, a gun that shoots skull fragments, and a cybernetic super dragon. In other words: <em>Dark Ages</em> looks awesome! We can’t wait to kill demons in <em>Dark Ages</em> when it arrives on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Lego and<em> Horizon: Forbidden West</em> make for a strange combo for sure. However, the announcement trailer for <em>Lego Horizon: Adventures</em> looked wonderful and fun. But perhaps the biggest surprise is that this odd spin-off is launching later this year on PS5, PC,<em> and Nintendo Switch. </em>Now that’s strange!</p></div><div><p>We are always down for a new retro-themed beat ‘em up with couch co-op options. Watching the trailer for<em> Rita’s Rewind </em>made us remember how great <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge </em>from 2022 was, and this new <em>Power Rangers</em> brawler looks to be a lot like that game. That’s a good thing! <em>Rita’s Rewind</em> is set to arrive in late 2024.</p></div><div><p>What happens if you toss <em>John Wick</em>-like combat, <em>GTA V</em> gameplay, and uh...a walking bean into a blender? You get a weird but cool-looking video game called <em>Killer Bean.</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/killer-bean-game-90s-just-cause-max-payne-roguelike-gta-1850757817&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/killer-bean-game-90s-just-cause-max-payne-roguelike-gta-1850757817">We’ve been following this indie game for a bit now</a></span> and the latest trailer once again got us excited to play as a gun-toting bean on a mission to take down a shadowy organization. <em>Killer Bean</em> arrives later this summer on PC. After it leaves early access, it’ll arrive on consoles, too.</p></div><div><p>We all were hoping for a new<em> Gears of War </em>game to be revealed during SGF 2024 and it happened, but it’s not <em>Gears 6</em>. Instead, we got a trailer for something new: <em>Gears of War: E-Day,</em> which is a prequel set about 14 years before the original game and which will focus on Marcus and Dom’s first adventure together. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-e-day-gears-6-ending-storyline-2025-1851528933&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-e-day-gears-6-ending-storyline-2025-1851528933">While I hope we eventually get a<em> Gears 6 </em>(and it sounds like we still might)</a></span>, I’m excited for the OG bros to return. No release date yet.</p></div><div><p>Sometimes it takes a while for a trailer to catch our attention. And then other times you see something like <em>Phoenix Springs</em>—a modern spin on the classic point-and-click genre—and you immediately want to play it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/21&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/21"><em>Phoenix Springs</em></a></span> has a fantastic and instantly captivating lithographic-like art style that just pops off this screen. If this looks cool to you, good news: It’s out soon. <em>Phoenix Springs</em> arrives on September 16, 2024.</p></div><div><p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was not only a really good game, it’s also one of the biggest and most successful titles ever published by Capcom. So it’s not surprising to see the sequel, <em>Wilds</em>, going bigger as Capcom likely has a lot of faith in this upcoming game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-state-of-play-1851510565&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-state-of-play-1851510565">The new <em>Monster Hunter: Wilds</em> trailer looks epic</a></span> and we can’t wait to hunt new and old monsters in 2025 on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p></div><div><p><em>Astro’s Playroom </em>was a free pack-in for the PS5 meant mainly to showcase the new controller and features of the console. However, the cute platformer ended up being one of the best games for the next-gen console and Sony has thankfully realized that Astro Bot deserves a whole video game. The first trailer for this new game looks amazing, featuring <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kratos-aloy-nathan-drake-parappa-playstation-1851512540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kratos-aloy-nathan-drake-parappa-playstation-1851512540">a ton of PlayStation Easter eggs</a></span> for old and younger fans alike.</p></div><div><p><em>UFO50 </em>was announced back in 2017. So it’s hard to believe that it’s finally, for real, almost here. But it is and the latest trailer for this 50-game retro-inspired anthology from the folks behind <em>Spelunky</em> (and a bunch of other devs) has us counting down the days until September 18. Then we can dive in and check out all the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/7">various games included in <em>UFO50</em></a></span> on PC.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a></span> was one of the best games released in 2023. It was spooky, looked great, had a wild story, and featured some of the best cutscenes we’ve seen in a horror game. So you can bet we were all hooting and hollering when we saw the first trailer for “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-dlc-night-springs-canon-1851525597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-dlc-night-springs-canon-1851525597">Night Springs,” a new DLC expansion for <em>Alan Wake 2</em></a></span> featuring three episodes starring three different characters. The best part? You don’t have to wait to play this DLC. It’s out now!</p></div><div><p>This game caught our attention when it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-star-wars-starfield-fable-gameplay-sgf-1850527405#:~:text=South%20of%20Midnight,date%20was%20given.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-star-wars-starfield-fable-gameplay-sgf-1850527405#:~:text=South%20of%20Midnight,date%20was%20given.">was announced last year</a></span> thanks to its unique setting and cool art style. Now that we’ve seen some actual gameplay of <em>South of Midnight</em>, we are even more excited to play this action-adventure game set in the bayou of the American South. I mean, come on, did you see that giant talking catfish? How can we <em>not </em>be excited to play this in 2025 when it arrives on Xbox and PC?</p></div><div><p>None of us were expecting to be blown away by a new<em> Perfect Dark</em> game in 2024. And yet, here we are! The new re-reveal of this game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-xbox-is-getting-a-new-perfect-dark-1845855765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-xbox-is-getting-a-new-perfect-dark-1845855765">which was first announced in 2020</a></span>, showcases a fast-paced, first-person espionage-focused shooter with some cool parkour and rad gadgets. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864">If the full game is even half as fun as this trailer</a></span>, Xbox might have a hit on its hands when<em> Perfect Dark</em> eventually launches.</p></div><div><p>It’s been about a decade since the last <em>Dragon Age</em> game, <em>Inquisition</em>, so there was a lot of pressure on EA and Bioware’s big reveal of the next main entry in the RPG series. And while some fans may not like some of the changes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469">including the worse name</a></span>, the overall reaction to the new RPG and its focus on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">new and returning characters and their relationships</a></span> has been positive. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is set to launch in fall 2024.</p></div><div><p>Blumhouse, the studio behind a lot of popular horror films including <em>M3gan</em> and <em>Get Out</em>, is getting into the video game business. And its not starting with just one horror game. Instead, Blumhouse arrived at Summer Game Fest with its own mini-showcase featuring <em>six</em> different spooky video games. All of them look different and interesting. </p><p>The people at <em>Kotaku </em>brave enough to play scary games are very excited to check out these Blumhouse titles in the future. The others are hiding behind us and will eventually open their eyes again.</p></div><div><p>It might be hard for some to get excited about a new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game after Ubisoft has made so damn many of them, but this latest entry—set in Japan and starring two main characters—looks like it might be shaking things up just enough to win back some players. </p><p>Something we really appreciated in the new gameplay trailer was how different the two characters played and the large focus on stealth options. You can go prone, hide in the water, and take out lights to create shadows. We don’t have to wait too long to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-trailer-ubisoft-1851530851&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-trailer-ubisoft-1851530851"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span><em> </em>as it arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 15.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Modern game remakes typically replace the cast voices for a new generation, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is bucking that trend by maintaining the original voiceover recordings, including David Hayter as Naked Snake. However, there will be a handful of new lines that were recorded for the remake according to series producer Noriaki Okamura.</p><p>"We're using all the original voice performances, but there are some lines where characters teach you the controls that really don't match anymore," said Okamura through an interpreter while appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDCppzRLwpw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase Deep Dive podcast</a>. "So we actually did get the original actors to re-record just those. Plus, back then, twenty years ago, we actually had to compress the voice acting down a lot to fill all that audio. Today, we aren't as limited. We don't have to compromise as much on formats and compression, so we can actually have those performances in even higher quality."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDCppzRLwpw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HDCppzRLwpw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>During the interview, Okamura touched upon <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-will-let-you-play-the-game-with-its-original-ancient-controls/1100-6524131/" data-ref-id="1100-6524131">the updated and classic controls for Metal Gear Solid Delta</a>, as well as Konami's decision to move forward with this remake before tackling another take on the original Metal Gear Solid. He also explained why Delta is in the title.</p><p>"Delta is a Greek letter, and the original meaning is something like change or difference," noted Okamura. "But it also means to change the quantity of something without changing the composition or character. That's the core concept for the title. Not different, but more. So we chose to represent that in the title."</p><p>Konami hasn't set a launch date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but it is expected to be released later this year on or PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-big-is-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-install-size.898500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/how-big-is-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-install-size/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-big-is-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-install-size<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="350" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Any time a new <em>Call of Duty</em> entry drops, the one question on everyone’s mind is, “How many gigs will this file need?” The franchise has been known to take up a substantial amount of space, especially with the introduction of <em>CoD </em>HQ. So, if you’re wondering about the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-directors-hope-omnimovement-will-become-a-new-standard-not-just-for-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a></em> install size, here’s what you can expect.</p> <h2 id="h-how-many-gigs-is-black-ops-6" data-injectable="false">How many gigs is Black Ops 6?</h2> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">As of now, Activision has yet to provide a definitive answer on the <em>Black Ops 6</em> storage size. However, what we do know is that the speculated 300GB file size is not a confirmed figure for the full release. The <em>Call of Duty</em> Updates page has clarified this, stating that the estimated storage space on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-pre-order-cod-black-ops-6-all-editions-and-bonuses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>BO6’s</em> pre-order</a> site is not an accurate reflection of the actual download size.</p> <figure data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📢 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a></p><p>Correction: The estimated file size currently displayed on the Black Ops 6 pre-order pages does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6.</p><p>The sizes as shown include the full installations of Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone…</p></div>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1800273804389941699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 300GB size is a cumulative figure from the full installation of previous entries, such as </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MW2</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Warzone</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MW3</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. It’s important to note that you can download </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Black Ops 6</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> as a standalone game without the necessity of having the other titles. </span></p> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">Based on the file sizes of previous games, we can try to estimate the <em>Black Ops 6</em> file size. For example, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a> </em>Multiplayer and Campaign Packs are about 58GB. On the other hand, my install size currently sits at a whopping 200GB due to other patches like <em>Warzone</em> and <em>MW2</em>. This suggests that if you want the full <em>Black Ops 6</em> experience, you may need to set aside a significant amount of storage space.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true">We can also look at past <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-call-of-duty-black-ops-game-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops</a> </em>iterations to get another rough install size for the sixth entry. While <em>BO4 </em>requires a minimum space of 42.35 GB, <em>Black Ops Cold War </em>needs at least 312 GB (shown in the PlayStation Store). Although the <em>Cold War </em>download is pretty hefty, you can lower it by removing specific modes.</p>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">By considering these numbers, I suggest having 100GB or even 200GB to play it safe. Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-the-black-ops-6-beta-early-access-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Black Ops 6</em> Beta</a> file size will be much lower than this, as these patches are roughly 27GB. Whatever the case may be, we’ll make sure to update this guide as more information becomes available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24175240/summer-game-fest-2024-best-trailers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Summer Game Fest can be hard to keep track of. The sprawling event is spread out across several days, ranging from blockbuster keynotes like SGF Live and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24173601/xbox-games-showcase-june-2024-microsoft">the Xbox Games Showcase</a> to smaller indie focused streams like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171195/devolver-digital-direct-2024-summer-game-fest-news-trailers">Devolver Direct</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171651/day-of-the-devs-showcase-summer-game-fest-2024-best">Day of the Devs</a>. Some games even have their own dedicated showcases. That means there’s a lot to see, which also means it’s tough to see it all. So we’ve combed through each event and pulled out the best trailers to give you a good overview of what went down and what the next few months of video game releases will look like.</p><p><h4><em>Alan Wake 2: Night Springs</em></h4></p><p>Not only did Remedy show off the first expansion for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a>, but the studio also launched it: so if you’re interested in the very <em>Twin Peaks</em>-inspired new storylines (which include lots of coffee), you can play them right now.</p><p><h4><em>Arranger</em></h4></p><p>A puzzle game crossed with an RPG, <em>Arranger</em> is about, well, arranging things. It also looks incredible, with visuals from<em> Braid</em> artist David Hellman.</p><p><h4><em>Avowed</em></h4></p><div><p>We might not know exactly when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175155/avowed-might-launch-on-november-12th">this fantasy RPG from Obsidian will launch</a>, but it’s certainly shaping up to be a worthy follow-up to <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>.</p></div><p><h4><em>Cairn</em></h4></p><p>Despite how stressful mountain climbing can be, <em>Cairn</em> looks almost cozy in this new trailer, in which a climber goes an adventure to be the first to reach a summit.</p><p><h4><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em></h4></p><p>The sequel to a tabletop-style cyberpunk RPG, the next <em>Citizen Sleeper</em> puts players in the role of an escaped android in a stolen ship, who also happens to have no memory. No pressure.</p><p><h4><em>Civilization 7</em></h4></p><p>As a teaser, this clip doesn’t show all that much, but it does confirm that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24173575/civilization-7-summer-game-fest-2k-firaxis-trailer"><em>Civilization 7</em> is coming next year</a>, which is more than enough.</p><p><h4><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h4></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172041/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer"><em>Doom</em> meets dark fantasy</a>, which means not only medieval-inspired weaponry but also apparently a mech suit and a dragon you can fly on. It looks as brutal as ever, though.</p><p><h4><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></h4></p><div><p>Just a few days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172872/dragon-age-the-veilguard-reveal">getting a new name</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176102/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-summer-game-fest-bioware">next <em>Dragon Age</em></a> got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176005/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-summer-game-fest-2024">its first gameplay trailer</a> that gave a deep dive into the early moments of the upcoming RPG.</p></div><p><h4><em>Fear the Spotlight</em></h4></p><p>Blumhouse Games made its debut at SGF, and one of its first games is a PSOne-inspired survival horror title that looks delightfully retro. It’s shaping up to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">a good year for old-school horror</a>.</p><p><h4><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em></h4></p><p>The best way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172052/gears-6-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer">introduce a new <em>Gears</em> game</a> is with the classic “Mad World” by Gary Jules. The next entry in the franchise will be a prequel, which makes the callback very fitting.</p><p><h4><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></h4></p><p>Sony didn’t have much of a presence at the event, but the company did reveal <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24172801/lego-horizon-adventures-ps5-trailer-summer-game-fest">a Lego version of <em>Horizon</em></a><em> </em>that makes the post-apocalypse playful.</p><p><h4><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em></h4></p><p>It’s not surprising that a new <em>Life is Strange</em> is in the works, but it’s nice to hear that <em>Double Exposure</em> will bring back <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up">original hero Max</a>.</p><p><h4><em>Lok Digital</em></h4></p><p>What makes this word game particularly unique is that it involves discovering a new language as you solve puzzles, which each have a strange effect on the world.</p><p><h4><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></h4></p><p>Developed by an all-star cast of former <em>Persona</em> creators, <em>Metaphor</em> looks like it will be taking all of the style of that RPG series and translating it directly to a new fantasy universe.</p><p><h4><em>Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind</em></h4></p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23848883/karateka-making-of-digital-eclipse-game-preservation">The retro experts at Digital Eclipse</a> are crafting a side-scrolling Power Rangers beat ‘em up that looks like a long-lost arcade classic.</p></div><p><h4><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></h4></p><div><p>It’s tough to follow-up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682599/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-preview-kaname-fujioka-interview-e3-2019">a massive, series-altering hit like <em>Monster Hunter: World</em></a>, but the next <em>MonHun</em> looks like it’ll build on its predecessor in some exciting ways.</p></div><p><h4><em>Neva</em></h4></p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137844/gris-review-nintendo-switch-pc-gaming"><em>Gris</em> is one of the prettiest games I’ve ever played</a>, and it turns out a way to make it even prettier is by adding a wolf companion in the follow-up <em>Neva</em>.</p></div><p><h4><em>Perfect Dark</em></h4></p><p>Years after it was first announced, we finally got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24174839/perfect-dark-reboot-xbox-microsoft">our first glimpse of <em>Perfect Dark</em> gameplay</a>. The futuristic spy thriller is a co-production between The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics.</p><p><h4><em>Possessor(s)</em></h4></p><p>It’s from the creators of <em>Hyper Light</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820899/solar-ash-impressions-annapurna-interactive-heart-machine"><em>Solar Ash</em></a>, so you know the action will be excellent in this 2D side-scroller about escaping a “sprawling, flooded city overrun with surreal interdimensional horror.”</p><p><h4><em>Screenbound</em></h4></p><p>I’ve watched this trailer a few times, and I still can’t wrap my head around <em>Screenbound</em>’s mixture of 2D and 3D gameplay. But it seems confusing in a good way.</p><p><h4><em>Skate</em></h4></p><p>This doesn’t show much of the game, but the Tim Robinson-led video does imply that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23207209/skate-free-to-play-developers-interview-ea">the next <em>Skate</em></a> will be a lot funnier and weirder than I anticipated.</p><p><h4><em>Slitterhead</em></h4></p><p>The bizarrely-named horror game comes straight from the mind of <em>Silent Hill</em> creator Keiichiro Toyama, which explains just how disturbing this new trailer is. </p><p><h4><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></h4></p><div><p>There was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172134/star-wars-outlaws-trailer-ubisoft-forward-2024">a lot of footage of Ubisoft’s open-world <em>Star Wars</em> game</a>, and thankfully most of it focused on the <em>GTA</em>-style gameplay.</p></div><p><h4><em>Starfield: Shattered Space</em></h4></p><p>More than a year out from launch, many <em>Starfield</em> players are looking for something new to explore — and it looks like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172097/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-xbox-bethesda-release-date-trailer-date">the game’s first major expansion</a> will deliver just that.</p><p><h4><em>Tenjutsu</em></h4></p><p>This brutal, pixelated action game calls to mind <em>Hotline Miami</em>, only you play as a “renegade yakuza.” Even more impressive: it’s the work of a one-person development studio.</p><p><h4><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em></h4></p><p>This trailer for the slapstick comedy game reveals an August 1st release date but, more importantly, confirms that Matt Berry will be featured.</p><p><h4><em>Wanderstop</em></h4></p><p>This seems like a cozy little tea shop simulator about a retired warrior, but the end of <em>Wanderstop</em>’s reveal trailer implies that there’s something more sinister at work.</p><p><h4><em>While Waiting</em></h4></p><p>If you have the patience to make it this far into this list, your reward is... a game about being patient.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="62UQpi">The Pacific Northwest is <em>creepy</em>.</p>
<p id="rsWePZ">From the dark forests of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23932094/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc"><em>Alan Wake</em></a>, to the ghostly radios of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23791491/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-release-date"><em>Oxenfree</em></a><em>,</em> to the absolute freaks who populate <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/7/8/21316347/deadly-premonition-2-review-switch"><em>Deadly Premonition</em></a><em>, </em>so many games set in the ol’ Pacific Northwest give it that <em>weird sauce</em>.</p>
<p id="6Es77m">This trend of Weird Pacific Northwest exists outside of games too — from quirky characters in <em>Portlandia</em> to the terrifyingly wet environment of <em>The Ring</em>.</p>
<p id="fykuv1">I wanted to know why that is, so I started looking.</p>
<p id="wvQMQ2">I came up with 122 games, mostly set in Washington (go Huskies). After whittling it down to 35, the themes of Pacific Northwest Bingo started to clarify.</p>

<p id="gUGiFF">Sixteen games were what I would describe as “creepy;” 22 of them have a supernatural element, and others emphasize survival and nature. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/28/21084016/coffee-talk-game-ps4-xbox-one-pc-nintendo-switch-impressions">One is set in a coffee shop</a>. And quite a few are mysteries.</p>
<p id="ABjwKq">But these trends didn’t <em>start </em>with video games.</p>
<p id="leLnny">Long before games made the Pacific Northwest weird, TV and movies were carving that trail, and the most notable is probably <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23434855/twin-peaks-november-lets-go"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a>.</p>
<p id="vFHZ5x">It’s me, the <em>Twin Peaks</em> enjoyer. I’ve logged on.</p>
<p id="phOrsZ">David Lynch’s soapy, surreal murder mystery debuted in April 1990, and became the blueprint for a lot of water-cooler shows today.</p>
<p id="noDGhs">On the surface, Twin Peaks is quaint and safe. But gradually, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23298759/twin-peaks-movie-fire-walk-with-me-anniversary-criterion">a seedy underbelly</a> of gambling, sex trafficking, and drug running is revealed — to say nothing of the actual crime that instigates the whole show. Alongside all <em>that</em>, the supernatural goes from implied, to <em>very</em> real and dangerous.</p>
<p id="D4OBis">It’s hard, if not impossible, to talk about Pacific Northwest media without talking about <em>Twin Peaks</em>. But the story runs deeper than that. Along the way I spoke with Stephen Groening, associate professor of cinema and media studies at the University of Washington, about how influential <em>Twin Peaks</em> really was — and what Washington state is like now, after decades of entrenchment from companies like Amazon and Microsoft.</p>
<p id="Lbobz1">I also spoke with Alex Dracott, creative director and studio head of Ironwood Studios, the outfit behind <em>Pacific Drive</em>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24079882/pacific-drive-review-steam-pc-playstation-5"><em>Pacific Drive</em> is a gritty, complex game</a> where the player drives a busted old sedan through the Olympic Peninsula — albeit an Olympic Peninsula besieged by strange, deadly anomalies after an experiment gone wrong.</p>

  <p id="ZSOcYw">The developers at Nightdive Studios have quickly become one of the greatest forces for game preservation by optimizing classic games for modern systems, giving them a fresh coat of paint, and updating them with modern quality-of-life features to be enjoyed by a new generation of players.</p>
<p id="bIb0px">If you’d like to see what Nightdive has accomplished in bringing some of your favorite FPS classics into the modern era, check out the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/polygon/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/fully-loaded-nightdive-fps-remasters?hmb_source=&amp;hmb_medium=product_tile&amp;hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_3_c_fullyloadednightdivefpsremasters_bundle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/___pl__p_23940205__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/fully-loaded-nightdive-fps-remasters?hmb_source=\u0026hmb_medium=product_tile\u0026hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_3_c_fullyloadednightdivefpsremasters_bundle&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:64,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;sid&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;hmb_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hmb_medium&quot;:&quot;product_tile&quot;,&quot;hmb_campaign&quot;:&quot;mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_3_c_fullyloadednightdivefpsremasters_bundle&quot;,&quot;sid&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23940205__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Nightdive FPS Remaster bundle</a> at Humble. While this $19.99 bundle doesn’t include the more recent remasters of <em>System Shock</em> and <em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em>, virtually every other FPS Nightdive has retouched is included (a $154 value).</p>

<p id="sX3xry">Some of these remastered titles, like <em>Powerslave</em>, <em>Forsaken</em>, and <em>Rise of the Triad</em>, are a bit dated and difficult to revisit, even in their remastered states. But this bundle also includes gems like <em>Blood</em>, the Turok<em> </em>trilogy, and the excellent <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/19/21183597/doom-64-eternal-impressions-history-reboot-port-nintendo-64"><em>Doom 64</em></a>. If you never got the opportunity to play these games in their heyday, Nightdive’s remastered versions are arguably the best way to experience them.</p>
<p id="7S6Fsa">As with any other Humble Bundle, a portion of each sale benefits a specific charity, in this case, <a href="https://www.activeminds.org/about-us/mission-and-impact/">Active Minds</a>, a nonprofit focused on promoting mental health awareness and education in young adults. Just note you can always change how much of your purchase goes to the developers or to Humble directly by using the “Adjust Donation” tab before you check out.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24176073/skate-4-summer-game-fest-2024-update-socks-tim-robinson</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we%E2%80%99re-finally-getting-details-on-skate-4-%E2%80%94-including-custom-socks-and-tim-robinson.898470/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176073/skate-4-summer-game-fest-2024-update-socks-tim-robinson<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="3fiTlI">The fourth game in EA’s cult skateboarding series — formerly known as <em>Skate 4</em>, now simply called <em>Skate</em> — is finally starting to come into focus, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/18/21296386/skate-4-ea-its-happening">four years after it was announced</a>... in a manner of speaking. Fittingly for a game which took an unusual route to becoming a reality, and which is quite a departure from its predecessors, EA is also tackling the marketing for the game a little bit differently.</p>
<p id="txcPiM">Instead of a flashy trailer highlighting the new game’s features, EA confused and delighted everyone by dropping a live-action sketch starring <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23737241/every-i-think-you-should-leave-sketch-ranked-best-to-worst-itysl"><em>I Think You Should Leave</em></a>’s Tim Robinson into Friday’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173215/summer-game-fest-announcements-trailers-2024">Sumer Game Fest stream</a>. In the skit, Robinson plays Richie Dandle, an executive at M-Corp, the fictional corporation that previously owned and ran the city of San Vansterdam in which <em>Skate </em>is set. Robinson denies that M-Corp is leaving San Vansterdam while employees flee, cry, and shred documents behind him. (M-Corp is probably the new iteration of the tyrannical Mongocorp, which ran the city of San Vanelona in <em>Skate 2</em>. Yes, these skating games have lore.) Anyway, the video’s pretty funny, you should watch it.</p>
<div id="NhN4gj"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCM3EfAz8FY?rel=0&amp;start=1" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="MhZzk4">This is all great fun, and backed up by an official <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-story-so-far">story so far</a> blog post as well as a gloriously dated <a href="https://themcorpwebsite.com/welcome">M-Corp website</a>. But what about the, you know, game?</p>
<p id="cEh2Q3">Fortunately, the developers at Full Circle, a remote-only game studio formed by EA specifically to make <em>Skate</em>, followed up the Robinson sketch by lifting the lid on the current state of the game in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/2024-development-update">blog post</a> and accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_877568xsPg">development update video</a>. <em>Skate</em>, as previously announced, will be a free-to-play, live-service skating MMO for PC and console. It doesn’t have a release date yet.</p>
<p id="4M3zVo">There’s quite a lot of detail in the post and video, none of it all that surprising; Full Circle is iterating on the Skate series’ signature “flick-it” control scheme using new physics and animation technologies, and going big on player customization. One of the most exciting tidbits is a “quick drop” system that gives players the freedom to customise the city itself, adding rails to a balcony to enhance its trick potential. You can do this in multiplayer in real time, and then challenge other players to try out your creations: Throwdowns are a way to instantly challenge other skaters as they roam around the deserted city turned giant skate park.</p>
<p id="i5PCLv">Elsewhere, much is made of the fact that players will now be able to customize the color of their socks (I’m guessing this is a top request among fans), and Full Circle promises that the game will constantly evolve over time, with new areas opening up, and new music being added to the soundtrack, too. The studio is actively appealing for new playtesters to help with development, and says it will be expanding from PC to console playtests later this year.</p>
<p id="HWD6LK">The Skate series seemed to have been consigned to history after <em>Skate 3</em> came out in 2010. But, starting around 2014, that game found a surprise second life on YouTube, as creators exploited its wild ragdoll physics for comedy. In 2016, it was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/11/10/13587630/skate-3-xbox-one-backward-compatibility">made playable on Xbox again</a>. A fan campaign for a sequel built up steam and was finally rewarded by the announcement of <em>Skate </em>in 2020.</p>
<p id="rftPsJ"><em>Skate </em>may not be quite the game fans were expecting, and it remains to be seen whether EA’s decision to build it back as a free-to-play live-service game is a mercenary business move, or a smart way to serve this passionate audience. But <em>Skate </em>doesn’t look like much else out there, and that’s something.</p>

On crime-hub planet Mirogana, neon signs inject bright pops of color into dark, seedy alleyways, droids cook strange foods at little stalls, and citizens enjoy some back-alley gambling.

One required Kay to escape an Imperial ship and dogfight some TIE fighters, another saw her platforming her way around a derelict High Republic ship, and the final one tasked her with infiltrating a Crimson Dawn base on snow-covered planet Kijimi.

He can attack enemies, distract them, or interact with objects. Distracting enemies is a bit simplistic—Nix will fall over dead in front of them so that Kay can sneak behind them and knock them out, but none of the other enemies ever noticed the bodies I was leaving behind as I snuck around. I also had to do a bit of hacking in this level, which takes the form of a Wordle-like minigame in which you try and guess which three symbols will crack the code. Guessing the wrong one will give you a big red X, the right one in the wrong spot will go yellow, and the correct one glows blue.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-recommend-id="image://f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vest uses her grappling hook." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay Vest uses her grappling hook." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-recommend-id="image://f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vest uses her grappling hook." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The High Republic level was all about platforming, which feels like a mix of the <em>Star Wars Jedi </em>games and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. Kay scrambles up yellow painted grates (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yellow-paint-debate-ff7-rebirth-demo-resident-evil-4-1851249608&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yellow-paint-debate-ff7-rebirth-demo-resident-evil-4-1851249608">yes, yellow paint is in this game</a></span>), times her jumps to avoid getting her fingers caught in vents that are opening and closing, and can use her grappling hook to latch onto certain things and swing to faraway platforms. I struggled with the platforming at certain points, partially because I am bad at platforming but also partially because Kay can feel a bit unwieldy during these segments, and this mechanic does seem to be a bit too reliant on <em>Tomb Raider</em>-esque vibes and <em>Uncharted</em>-style gags (platforms fall out from under Kay <em>a lot</em>).<br></p><p>The third mission is all about stealth, which is another thing I am very bad at. You can really only duck behind cover and crouch-walk around in order to remain hidden, or duck into an occasional vent if you can do so without getting caught (I couldn’t). Nix can only distract one person at a time, and in the Crimson Dawn base there were quite a few baddies patrolling about. Fortunately, as soon as I’m spotted, a shoot-out ensues, and those are very fun.<br></p><p>Kay wields a blaster that can swap between lethal and EMP rounds, the latter of which works great for droids, shields, and powering up dead batteries. She even has a one-shot knockout round that’s on a long cooldown, and a <em>Red Dead Redemption-</em>style ultimate ability that slows down time and lets you mark up to three enemies to take out with ease. The gunplay is pretty tight and satisfying, but don’t expect much <em>Division</em>-style cover—Kay can duck behind things and dodge roll, but <em>Outlaws</em> feels more like you’ll either be avoiding combat or going into a room guns blazing. </p><figure id="" data-id="3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-recommend-id="image://3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vess strolls through a snowy village." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay Vess strolls through a snowy village." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-recommend-id="image://3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vess strolls through a snowy village." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h34005"><a id=""></a><strong>A thoroughly <em>Star Wars</em> world</strong></h2><p>Though the gameplay was very structured and likely won’t represent the final, open-world product, I was able to get a great taste of <em>Outlaws</em>’ version of the <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy— and I was very impressed by the vibes Ubisoft has curated. Kay Vess is a fantastic character, voiced with a slightly scummy, plucky perfection by Humberly González. Nix is adorable and animated, and feels at times like a secondary protagonist because of how often he gets involved, how reactive he is, and how much Kay chats with him. He’s BD-1 with teeth, and I would die for him.<br></p><p>The side characters all feel like they stepped off a movie set, and getting to delve into the seedy criminal underworld we only get tastes of in things like <em>Solo</em> is a devilish delight. Deciding who Kay will align with will affect her reputation with different factions, a mechanic which was hard to get a feel for during my hands-on, but seems like a smart way to allow players to roleplay their version of a <em>Star Wars</em> scoundrel. Everyone loves Han Solo, but what would you do if you were in his boots?<br></p><p><em>Outlaws</em>’ aesthetic is beautifully retrofuturistic. It feels like you’re playing through an unreleased ‘70s <em>Star Wars</em> film, from Kay’s shaggy haircut to the retro menu design and the tactility of the gameplay. Whenever Kay plucks her data spike from her hair to unlock a door, you’ll have to complete a little rhythm minigame by pulling the trigger in time with a flashing light, your controller vibrating with each pulse. It <em>feels</em> like you’re actually cracking the lock yourself, high praise for a lockpicking mechanic considering how they can often feel like throwaway features.<br></p><p>And though I was a little bummed that a lot of the world I encountered felt like it was behind a display case (I desperately wanted to order a drink at a bar, or sit down at a random table and play sabacc, rather than just lean on a railing via a somewhat sticky animation), these are beautiful virtual spaces that are steeped in <em>Star Wars</em> lore and vibes. And I’m sure once Ubisoft launches <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and we’re free to roam these spaces without restrictions, I’ll be even more excited for what Kay’s journey has to offer.<br></p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> launches August 30 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s classic tower defense presented in a very novel way, and I have a hard time putting it down when my appointment ends.</p><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,194088,195719" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>One of several games Capcom presented at a Summer Game Fest’s adjacent Play Days event for hands-on coverage, <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess</em> is a mashup of horde mode strategy, action combat, and Japanese folklore presented dutifully but vibrantly across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, as well as the last-gen consoles. Made by the company’s Development Division 1, which includes the <em>Resident Evil </em>and <em>Devil May Cry </em>teams, <em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>is also coming to Game Pass when it launches on July 19, making it Capcom’s 2024 subscription service successor to last year’s dino shooter <em>Exoprimal.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike that one, though, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> isn’t a live-service game. Instead it’s a more traditional single-player action strategy game that revolves around cleansing a mountain of evil spirits as you, playing as the warrior Soh, guide Yoshiro across each level so she can complete a final ritual. A day-night cycle means that time is always moving when you’re not navigating menus and ordering comrades around. Players prepare for the onslaught by rescuing villagers, killing possessed animals, and collecting spirt orbs that are the game’s currency for managing recruitments, upgrades, and buildings.</p><figure id="" data-id="0b296b4eaf03b8002801b0e6c023feea" data-recommend-id="image://0b296b4eaf03b8002801b0e6c023feea" data-format="gif" data-width="836" data-height="481" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Soh fights of Yokai to cleanse a village.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When night falls monsters, called the Seethe, come out of randomly positioned gates to try to attack the Maiden and end her journey. If that happens, it’s game over. But guiding Yoshiro farther along each level requires blazing a path with your spirit orbs, expending currency that can’t be used for your defenses. The result is a clever tension between trying to get her through the level as fast as possible and trying to take your time to build up your defenses. Take too long and you might get punished for it. After each nighttime the next wave of enemies gets progressively stronger. While there’s no time limit, dawdling can cost you.<br></p><p>But protecting her isn’t just a matter of just positioning your limited number of class-based companions on each level and utilizing the terrain, traps, and other structures to your advantage, it’s also about combat. Following a “Dancing Swords” fighting style, Soh completes combos by linking together strong and weak attacks that increase the power of his attacks while also helping him move around the battlefield gracefully and efficiently. There’s a stamina system, a dodge roll to get out of the way of enemies’ attacks, a guard gauge that can be broken, and a special power that can be used upon building up a meter to unleash more deadly moves. It’s not full <em>Devil May Cry</em>, which some of the developers also worked on, but it controls crisply and feels satisfying enough that <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> doesn’t suffer the normal intermittent doldrums of some other tower defense games, especially in boss fights where you have to not just worry about surviving but also finishing the fight before  Yoshiro gets killed. </p><p>Where the complexity comes in, and what makes me excited to return to <em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>once it’s out next month, is in how varied loadouts and maps seem to get later on. As you complete levels you collect new gear that can be swapped out for certain bonuses that also come at a cost, like stronger attacks alongside taking more damage, offering the potential to give players the trade-off management of upgrades in a roguelike. You can also unlock new classes for your allies as you go, and earn resources that can be used to choose how they’re upgraded before going out into battle again. A representative from Capcom declined to comment but grinned when I asked if Soh would get to change weapon types during the game, so there might be that to look forward to as well. </p><p>As an action-strategy nerd, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> ticked all the right boxes for me. It’s impossible to know from a 30-minute demo if it can keep ramping up its complexity and challenge in an even and rewarding way across the whole game, but the slice I played showed a lot of promise. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-next-fest-june-2024-10-games-you-need-to-check-out/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Steam Next Fest for June 2024 is live now through June 17, and with it comes thousands of games to try out with new betas and demos. In addition to demos, there are also special offers on games with discounted prices to check out that you may have been waiting on for a while now.</p>



<p>From action-packed first-person shooters to being an over-the-top bike messenger to even a duck-themed survival game, there are so many options to choose from this time around. To help get you going with some new games, we’ve put together a list of games you should check out between now and June 17 during Steam Next Fest.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-steam-next-fest-games-you-should-play-in-june-2024">10 Steam Next Fest Games You Should Play In June 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-i-am-your-beast"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Am Your Beast</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>From the developer of El Paso: Elsewhere, I Am Your Beast is a first-person action game with comic book-style visuals. You play as a secret agent who’s forced to go against the Covert Operations Initiative after turning down missions because you’d rather stay retired. </p>



<p>I Am Your Beast will feature 20+ levels at launch with a fully voiced story. The game even allows you to throw your pistol as a boomerang to take out enemies. That was enough to sell me right there.</p>



<h3 id="h-striden"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2052970/STRIDEN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">STRIDEN</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>STRIDEN is the first title from 5 Fortress, a sandbox looter-shooter with some innovative – and bizarre – elements. With friends (or alone, if you’re brave), venture into a harrowing world to loot, survive, build, and ultimately escape, taking advantage of a slew of multi-generational weapons and shapeshifting abilities to dominate your enemies along the way. </p>



<p>That’s right – you can turn into a radioactive bear as the timer counts down and a toxic fog closes in around you.</p>



<h3 id="h-duckside"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2682580/DUCKSIDE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duckside</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Duckside is one of the crazier entries for this month’s Steam Next Fest, a survival PvP/PvE title where you get to play as a Duck wearing a goofy hat. The developers state that the game is reminiscent of titles like DayZ and Rust, with the only differentiating factor being that you are a duck, which seems exciting enough. </p>



<p>This game will have you waddling around a post-apocalyptic open world, taking down your feathered opponents by wielding automatic and explosive weapons, while building and crafting a base and tools to protect your precious loot.</p>



<h3 id="h-enotria-the-last-song"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102450/Enotria_The_Last_Song/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enotria: The Last Song</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>An upcoming Soulslike game inspired by Italian folklore. The game gives off an incredibly creepy vibe while still being absolutely stunning, visually. Where Enotria hopes to stand out is with its masks mechanic that will allow players to take on the role of your enemies by simply wearing their mask. Players will be able to quickly swap between loadouts and masks, each having their own benefits and weaknesses.</p>



<p>When it launches in the fall, the game will feature over 100 different enemies with a 40+ hour story.</p>



<h3 id="h-parcel-corps"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2015960/Parcel_Corps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parcel Corps</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s always nice when a studio tries something different and new, and that’s what Parcel Corps is. It’s a game where you work as a freelance bicycle messenger who is working to simply get by until a crude oil CEO comes to try and ruin everything. The game is presented as satire on the gig economy we find ourselves in, and wants you to save the world — yes, you read that right — by making your deliveries.</p>



<h3 id="h-dungeons-amp-degenerate-gamblers"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400510/Dungeons__Degenerate_Gamblers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Balatro was a smash hit and will likely win a number of awards this year. If you wanted more roguelike card games, then Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers might be right up your alley. Instead of Poker, however, you are playing Blackjack with the goal of beating the house. Each suit also offers an added bonus whether that be healing, protection, extra money, or extra damage.</p>



<h3 id="h-flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1832040/Flintlock_The_Siege_of_Dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A Souls-lite game with a unique tagline of “Kill All Gods”. The game sees you have to fight off the Gods and their armies of the dead as they attempt to end mankind. It launches in July, but you can check out the demo now on Steam.</p>



<h3 id="h-maximum-football"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691280/Maximum_Football/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maximum Football</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re looking for a football game with customization and both college and professional modes, Maximum Football aims to be that game for you. The game has a beta that only offers customization and exhibition play right now, but when it launches it’ll offer Dynasty and Franchise mode for players. It’ll also be completely free to play.</p>



<h3 id="h-g-i-joe-wrath-of-cobra"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2516170/GI_Joe_Wrath_of_Cobra/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a fan of beat ’em up games, G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra could be the next one you are looking for. The game sees you play as one of &nbsp;Duke, Scarlett, Roadblock, or Snake Eyes, among others as you fight to stop Cobra from succeeding in their destructive plans. Developer Maple Powered Games promises a game that’s “Easy to play, hard to master”. The game will support both local and online co-op.</p>



<h3 id="h-aero-gpx"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2160360/Aero_GPX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aero GPX</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’ve been wishing for a new F-Zero fix but are tired of waiting for an official game, Aero GPX could quench that zero-gravity thirst. Each races features 30 vehicles — or machines — all vying for first place, and they’ll do whatever it takes to get there. That means even using their machine to slam and spin opponents to improve their chances of winning. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest?snr=1_5_9_"></a></p>

The suits include some new designs and some that return from previous games.</p><p>Meanwhile, the update also “addresses some community feedback” and adds stability improvements to the game. This includes the ability to swap out your parry and traversal abilities from the Symbiote to Spider Arms, and vice versa.</p><p>Four new suits were created in partnership with Colm Dillane, AKA KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. Yes, even Brazilian footballers are designing Spider-Man suits these days. There’s even a comment from Real Madrid forward Vini Jr, who co-developed the Ginga Suit for Miles Morales:</p><p>“I wanted it to be a celebration of Brazil’s culture and people. I just love the overall design because it has the energy and action that I associate Spider-Man with, but it’s beautifully mixed with some Brazilian flair. Which makes this suit super special and different from others.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 KidSuper Suits Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The returning suits are from Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. These four suits are being “retrofitted” for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, including two for Peter and two for Miles, Insomniac said. One is the Into The Spider-Verse suit for Peter Parker, another Miles Morales’ Animated suit. Check them out in the slideshow of images below:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Fan-Favorite Legacy Suits Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In March, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-update-appears-to-have-accidentally-revealed-an-upcoming-dlc">a Spider-Man 2 update appeared to accidentally reveal an upcoming expansion</a>.
