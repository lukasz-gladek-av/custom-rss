<p>Meet the new boss</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo of America has a new President and COO, and during the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HNNugGXKQ0?t=3522">15th Annual New York Game Awards</a>, Devon Pritchard made her first public appearance in her new role.</p>
<p>Introduced by ex-Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé and New York Times columnist Harold Goldberg, Pritchard appeared via a pre-recorded video to celebrate the Game Awards and the nonprofit 'Playing With Purpose' writing programme, which looks to provide workshops in journalism and game narrative writing in school across New York.</p>
<p>If you're unable to watch the video right now, here's Pritchard's message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hi everyone, it is great to be here. My name is Devon, and before anything else, I want to celebrate the New York Game Awards. 15 years of supporting the games industry and in doing so lifting up the voices, stories, and dreams of so many.</p>
<p>"This show connects people who are united by a shared belief that every dream matters, and that everyone deserves a chance to do meaningful and creative work in games and storytelling. The 'Playing With Purpose' programme supports the creators, the coders, the writers, and anyone else dreaming big to join this community and bring all that makes them unique.</p>
<p>"I'm excited to meet you! To hear those stories and to learn from your journeys. And remember, like any good video game character, you're on an adventure, and every step you take matters. There's some gnarly bosses, sure, but also many good friends along the way who will support you, and powerful rewards for those who persevere.</p>
<p>"So keep believing, keep playing, and know that you truly belong in this game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pritchard took over the role of President and COO of Nintendo of America when her predecessor, Doug Bowser, stepped down at the end of 2025.</p>
<p>Pritchard will have a big task ahead of her in spearheading the next generation of Nintendo with the Switch 2. The console has gotten off to a great start, but concerns around price uncertainty and Game-Key Cards linger in the minds of fans around the world.</p>

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed series lead Marc-Alexis Côté is suing Ubisoft for damages, alleging that his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-says-leaving-ubisoft-wasnt-his-choice-instead-down-to-restructure-musical-chairs">abrupt October departure from the company</a> after 20 years wasn't a matter of personal choice, but a case of "constructive dismissal". That, in <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/dismissals/constructive-dismissal">non-legalese</a>, means that the developer believes he was left with no choice but to resign, having been offered new roles he viewed as demotions amid a round of corporate musical chairs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">CBC Radio-Canada</a>, Côté's lawsuit against Ubisoft has been filed in Quebec and seeks $1.3 million Canadian dollars  - around $935,000 in US currency - in damages on his behalf. That cash is designed to cover two years worth of the developer's salary, plus moral damages and an additional lifting of a non-compete clause which currently limits his games industry job options.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Côté learned in a summer 2025 meeting that as part the Ubisoft rearrangement which came with the company setting up a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">new Tencent-backed subsidiary called Vantage Studios</a> to oversee the running of Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, they'd be installing a "head of franchise" based in France. According to Canada-based Côté, that gig absorbed lots of his duties as Assassin's Creed series head, and he was subsequently offered roles as Assassin's Creed production head reporting to that new head of franchise or as the leader of a "creative house” overseeing another Ubisoft game series.</p>
<p>Seeing that as a demotion, Côté's lawsuit asserts that he took two weeks to think about things, then declined and asked for his severance pay. Ubisoft are cited by the suit as having responded by telling him not to show back up to work, then announcing his departure in a fashion which painted it as being your standard voluntary parting of ways.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p>
<p>When RPS reached out to the publishers for comment following Côté's initial comments about his departure back in October, we received the following response:</p>
<blockquote>Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025, Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build. We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today. His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors."</blockquote>
<p>We'll see how these legal wranglings shake out.</p>

            <guid>1409899</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You really can’t have too many USB cables, can you? And now that Apple finally in the last couple years went ahead and ditched its proprietary Lightning cable to join the rest of the world in using the USB-C standard, you have even more reason to have USB-C cables readily available in every room in your house. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6770/">UGREEN is well established brand in the field of charging accessories, and right now, Amazon has a number of their cables on sale for as much as 42% off.</a></p>
<p>The UGREEN USB-C to USB-C 100W cable comes in four different sizes and your choice of buying them individually or as a pair. Breaking down the various options, we first have the smallest 1.6ft cable which only is available in a bundle of two. That normally goes for $17, but has come down to just $13. Going a size up, we have the 3.3ft cables which you can get on for $7 (down from $12) or two for $7 (down from $13). That should be a no brainer on whether to get one or two. Doubling the length to 6.6ft, you can the single for $8 ( down from $10) or $2 for $14 (down from $17). Lastly, we have the super long 10ft option which you can either get one of for $10 (down from $14) or two of for $18 (down from $23).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6770/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>One of those long 10ft ones are great to keep in your living room. This way no matter where you or a guest is sitting on your couch, they’ll be able to charge their phone while keeping it comfortably on their person, instead of needing to return to a different corner of the room to check for messages every 15 minutes. These cables are threaded with nylon braiding too, so they’re less susceptible to fraying or splitting.</p>
<h2>Wide Compatibility</h2>
<p>As a USB-C cable, this has a broad range of compatibility for various devices. It can be used to charge laptops like the new MacBook Pros, cell phones like the iPhone 17/16/15 Series, Samsung S25/S24/S23, and Google Pixel, as well as the newly released Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The UGREEN USB-C cable is equipped with smart chip protection. It’s built with an E-marker which can intelligently match the required current while increasing charging efficiency. It’s 100W so it’s capable of ultra-fast charging with PD3.0 and QC3.0 tech. You can expect to be able to bring an iPhone 17 Pro Max from dead to 50% in just 20 minutes time.</p>
<p>As a USB-C cable, it’s also capable of data transfer. You’ll be able to send and receive files at transfer speeds of up to 480Mbps, allowing you to quickly move massive files like movies or entire photo libraries in no time flat.</p>

			<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Owlcat Games</strong> is a video game development studio that requires no introduction nowadays, as cRPGs are as popular as ever. Following the launch of the two entries in the <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/"><strong>Pathfinder</strong></a></em> series, which showed how the developer doesn't <strong>compromise in any way when adapting tabletop RPGs' rules in video game format</strong>, Owlcat launched <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader</em></a></strong>, their first foray into the world created by Games Workshop. </p>



<p>Although the game was, by all accounts, <strong>a very solid game</strong>, some of the studio's now trademark clunkiness (and pretty much required pre-battle buffing) seeped into it, resulting in a game that was <strong>considerably less accessible</strong> than the title which contributed a lot to the current popularity of cRPGs: Larian's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.</a></strong></p>



<p>Last year, Owlcat Games confirmed it was going back to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Imperium of Man</strong> with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em>, but with some twists. This time around, players would take the role of an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Inquisitor</strong>, one of the highest-ranking members of the Imperium's secret police and intelligence, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">whose authority is second only to the Emperor of Mankind himself</strong>. </p>



<p>Even those with little to no knowledge of the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> world can easily understand what playing as one means: <strong>the freedom of taking on any challenge as they see fit</strong>, backed by what is recognized as one of the highest authorities in the universe.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251222113652_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy does an excellent job making the player feel they are always right, no matter their choices</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">During last year's Gamescom</strong>, I was able to check out a live demo of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em>, which made it abundantly clear how the entire experience is centered around one fundamental concept: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the player is always right</strong>. Inquisitors, after all, can do no wrong, so if the player so desired, they could have concluded the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">investigation</strong> featured in the demo by just <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">putting the blame for some killings on the first possible culprit</strong>, without having to worry about the consequences. This, coupled with some improvements to combat and user interface, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">definitely caught my attention</strong>.</p>



<p>With the release of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">alpha version</strong> last month, I was finally able to test for myself how far this concept could be pushed and whether there are indeed <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">no wrong choices</strong>. Turns out<span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">t</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">here aren't. In the same investigation set on Scintilla,</strong> which sees the Inquisitor look into <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a series of mysterious disappearances</strong>, instead of <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">strictly adhering to the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Imperial Creed</strong> for the most part&nbsp;as I witnessed in the Gamescom demo, I took a more pragmatic approach,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">not shying away from challenging the Creed when</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> it suited my purpose</strong>.</p>



<p>Appreciating even more the <strong>environmental storytelling and the beautiful world</strong> Owlcat Games is creating for <em>Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em> as well as the new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/inquisitors-do-more-than-fight-warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-detective-system-showcased-in-new-screenshots/">investigation mechanics</a></strong> centered on adding and connecting the clues noted in the Investigation Journal in the game's Mind Map, I couldn't help but appreciate how <strong>the developer managed to create an incredible balance between truly giving player complete freedom without punishing them. </strong></p>



<p>While it's undeniable that <em>Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em> won't have the same type of <strong>world reactivity</strong> as <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, the <strong>differences between the Radical and Puritan "paths"</strong>, which replace the alignment system from Rogue Trader, will make sure <strong>role-playing will be an important part of the experience as much as combat is</strong>. Better yet, the game does an excellent job of <strong>making it clear</strong> in the writing that the <strong>Inquisitor is indeed always right</strong>, even if they go against the Imperial Creed.</p>



<p>Besides enjoying this sort of player freedom powering what could be the ultimate power fantasy in the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40K</em> universe, short of playing as the Emperor, the <em>Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em> alpha also made me <strong>appreciate the improvements to the turn-based tactical combat system introduced in Rogue Trader. </strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251222121752_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Combat in Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy has been significantly improved with new mechanics and quality-of-life features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The streamlining of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">cover system</strong>, the ability to destroy any objects that can be used as cover, the ability to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">aim specific body parts</strong> to disable enemies before defeating them, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Concentration mechanics</strong> which will allow players to prevent an enemy from using powerful attacks, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Morale system</strong> which can put the enemy in complete disarray and the ability to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">end combat as soon as it is decided the enemy will have no chance of winning</strong> are all great improvements that are set to make battles better paced and more engaging than ever.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, but understandably given the early nature of this release, the Alpha hands out <strong>characters with pre-learned abilities</strong>. While this meant I couldn’t test the limits of the progression system,<strong> the synergy between classes and skills was already evident and satisfyingly easy to leverage.</strong></p>



<p>With the entire experience having been remade from scratch over Rogue Trader, I was really curious to see how Owlcat Games would address the <strong>sometimes excessive complexity</strong> of their cRPGs, and from the Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy Alpha, it really seems like the developer is <strong>managing to strike a happy medium between complexity and accessibility. </strong></p>



<p>With a story that will be<strong> smaller in scope</strong> than Rogue Trader but more varied, and with more meaningful combat encounters, I am really looking forward to seeing how <strong>my choices will shape the experience</strong> and whether the studio's complexity will indeed have been toned down for a more enjoyable experience. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to experience all this and finally <strong>wield the power to prove that, indeed, innocence proves nothing.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘By That Argument, We Should Never Have Made Mass Effect’ – BioWare Vet Defends Making Anthem]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/bioware-veteran-defends-making-anthem/</link>
            <guid>1409881</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Exactly a week ago, <strong>Electronic Arts</strong> took down the official servers of <strong>Anthem</strong>, <strong>BioWare</strong>'s failed live service game, as the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had announced back in July</a>.</p>



<p>A few days ago, YouTuber Destin Legarie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y65eoBVF0Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted a 40-minute video interview with <strong>Mark Darrah</strong></a>, a BioWare veteran who worked on practically all of the studio's games since the first <strong>Baldur's Gate</strong> (1998) to <strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as a consultant</a>, after leaving the company), with the notable exception of the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> series.</p>



<p>This includes Anthem, on which Darrah worked as an Executive Producer. The developer <strong>acknowledged a number of shortcomings</strong>, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>The game was originally inspired by <strong>Diablo</strong>, but Darrah says the team should have realized that, as a looter shooter, it should have really taken a lot more inspiration from <strong>Destiny</strong> instead. This is partly why the loot, endgame, and retention were all failures.</li>



<li>The flight mechanics were by far the most enjoyable for players, but they also <strong>caused several issues</strong>. For example, virtually every enemy unit had to have ranged attacks, since players could just fly away otherwise. Also, Darrah says that in co-op, three experienced players could drag a new player through the story at breakneck speed, disrupting the narrative flow.</li>



<li>BioWare even tested a version of Anthem <strong>without flight</strong> before E3 2017, though the goal was always to reintroduce it as they did in the final version.</li>



<li>In the interview, Darrah wonders if the developers <strong>should have proposed a 9-month public beta</strong>, keeping the entire team working on live iterations. This would have meant shipping the game, calling it "beta," and doing what happened in the first year, but before the official launch.</li>



<li>The industry veteran also believes <strong>BioWare Austin</strong>, which had much more experience with live-service games (it made <strong>Star Wars: The Old Republic</strong>), should have been handed the reins much earlier than they were. They were working on <strong>Anthem Next</strong>, which was supposed to introduce new ways to play beyond cataclysms and missions, new events, and other content. However, the team was understaffed, and Anthem Next <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-next-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was ultimately canceled in February 2021</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Toward the end of the video interview, Darrah adds that EA was <strong>partially but not entirely to blame</strong> and also addresses one of the common refrains you might have read on forums and social media: that BioWare should never have made Anthem in the first place. On that count, he doesn't really agree.</p>



<p><em>I think it's easy to blame EA, and certainly, they deserve a bunch of blame for Anthem, but it's not all their fault. But one thing that actually is worth mentioning, I think, is that there are some people that at the time loved coming out of the woodwork and saying 'see, I told you so', and it's like, 'BioWare should have never made Anthem because they are a single player RPG studio.' But <strong>my feeling is that BioWare has always been changing. By that argument, we should never have made Neverwinter Nights because we were a 2D RPG maker. We should never have made Mass Effect, because we were a tactical RPG maker, not an action RPG maker. So, I don't know that that argument holds a lot of weight for me</strong>. To me, it's like, yeah, your studios evolve, and they try new things. And was Anthem too big of a reach? Yeah, for sure. But could you tell at the time? I don't know. I don't know that you could.</em></p>



<p>Mark Darrah did provide a bit of hope for the future of BioWare, which is even more in jeopardy after Dragon Age: The Veilguard also largely <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-was-a-high-quality-game-that-failed-due-to-lack-of-shared-world-elements-says-ea-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to meet the company's financial projections</a>. Everything hinges on the next Mass Effect game, but the developer said there's a silver lining: now <strong>BioWare is a single-project studio that is entirely focused on this title</strong>, instead of splitting itself across multiple projects, which happened with Anthem, <strong>Mass Effect: Andromeda</strong>, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard for parts of the respective development phases. Will that be enough to create a successful game? Only time will tell.</p>

            <p>Rockstar North, the Edinburgh office of GTA 6 developers Rockstar Games, has been cordoned off by emergency services following reports of an explosion in the building.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp">Edinburgh Live</a> and <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25776012.gta6-dev-rockstar-north-building-taped-off-boiler-explosion/">The Herald</a> report that local fire crews were called out to Holyrood Road at around 5AM on January 19th.</p>
<p>"We were alerted at 5.02AM on Monday, 19 January to attend an incident on Holyrood Road, Edinburgh, reads a statement given to the latter by a spokesperson for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. "Operations Control mobilised three fire appliances and specialist resources to the scene, where firefighters worked to secure structural damage at a commercial building. There were no reported casualties and crews left the scene at 9.21AM."</p>
<p>Both local outlets outline that the exact nature of what happened isn't fully clear as of yet, but cite reports suggesting an "explosion in a boiler room" was the cause of the incident.</p>
<p>That's it for details as of writing, I'll update this article or link out to a separate one as or when more information arrives.</p>
<p>This incident comes amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fired-gta-6-devs-suffer-setback-in-legal-fight-against-rockstar-as-uk-court-denies-request-for-interim-relief">legal proceedings between Rockstar Games and the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain union</a>, with the latter representing 31 former Rockstar employees which the company fired last year. Rockstar allege the staff were dismissed for sharing info about GTA 6 and other unannounced projects over Discord, while the union have accused them of union busting. As part of the initial response to the firings, Rockstar North's Edinburgh offices were the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">site of a union protest last November</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, as of right now there is no suggestion of a causal connection between this incident and the above events.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-all-in-on-its-32%e2%80%b3-odyssey-gaming-monitor-with-42-off-making-it-cheaper-than-the-27%e2%80%b3-model-2000660302</link>
            <guid>1409872</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A monitor can make or break your gaming experience. If you’re looking to enjoy consistent, high-quality visuals and snappy performance for your favorite titles, you need a solid option in your gaming setup.</p>
<p>Samsung makes some of the best out there, and we just found a way to grab one of its top-rated screens for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/">The 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G50D Series is currently going for $250 at Amazon, after the retailer generously slashed a whopping 42% off its price.</a> This is one of the lowest prices we have seen in a while, but there’s a catch. The discount ends soon, so there isn’t much time left to save. It’s best to snap it up as quickly as you can!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brighter Whites, Deeper Blacks</h2>
<p>For just $250, you’re getting a spacious 32-inch screen. Expect lifelike visuals with QHD resolution that packs in 1.7 times the pixel density of Full HD for better detail and sharper images. The fast IPS panel offers exceptional color accuracy, while the wide 178-degree viewing angle makes it easy to enjoy consistent visuals from nearly every side; you don’t have to sit exactly at the front of the screen to see what’s going on, which also makes it great for multiplayer matches with friends.</p>
<p>VESA DisplayHDR 400 support offers more contrast, helping you see all the shades better. Think brighter whites and deeper blacks, with even the shadows being visible. Translation? You will be able to spot enemies hidden in the dark easily, plus enjoy better contrast overall. The monitor also comes with an eye saver mode that actively minimizes blue light to help keep your eyes relaxed when gaming for extended periods.</p>



<p>As for the performance, the 180Hz refresh rate does an excellent job of eliminating lag, resulting in ultrasmooth action, even during those fast-paced games. A 1ms response time, on the other hand, reduces blur, making it easy to jump on enemies as soon as you spot them. Additionally, the AMD Radeon FreeSync keeps your monitor and graphics card refresh rate in sync for an even more immersive experience, whether you’re just streaming a show or teaching bad guys a lesson.</p>
<p>Samsung G50D can also be freely moved to accommodate the way you play. You can adjust the height, swivel, and tilt it to find the right viewing angle for a competitive edge. Sitting upright for an intense battle? Position it straight. Feeling tired of sitting and want to game while standing? That’s possible too.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been looking to enjoy better visuals that make you feel like a part of the action, the Samsung G50D is an excellent option to consider. It offers impressive detail, vibrant colors, and a solid refresh rate – all of which come together to deliver an immersive gaming experience. The monitor is now going for $250, down from $430, which makes today a great time to pick it up for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/">If the 32-inch version is bigger than what you’re after, there’s also a 27-inch version of the same model. It’s going for $250, too, after a 29% discount</a>. However, considering how the 32-inch version offers more in the same price, it’s definitely a better pick.</p>

              <p><span>I try not to have a backlog. I’m choosier with what I spend time on at this stage of my life than I used to be, and if I care enough to play a game, I usually see it through. But there is one white whale on my shelf that, despite multiple attempts, I’ve never been able to commit to seeing through: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-sun-and-moon-the-kotaku-review-1789134713"><i><span>Pokémon Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i></a><span>, as well as their enhanced re-release, </span><i><span>Ultra Sun</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Ultra Moon</span></i><span>. The reason why is…a lot more stupid than you’d probably expect.</span></p> <p><span>With the exception of the Alola games, I have finished every mainline </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game at least once. I played through the first three generations endlessly on loop as a kid, creating new challenges for myself and catching new monsters to make the most of the game for as long as I could. It wasn’t until Generation IV that I became a “one and done” </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>player before moving on to the next thing. This was both because I was old enough to buy more games for myself so I wasn’t constantly pulling water from the stone, and because I was starting to lose interest in the stories they were telling.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games have had cool worldbuilding but lackluster narrative, so as I was getting older and playing grander RPGs like </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>wasn’t holding my attention the way it once had. But still, I was playing these games as if out of obligation. I finished them, put them on my shelf, and didn’t think about them much beyond that. So what could have possibly happened with </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span> and their “definitive” editions that finally pushed me over the edge and made me </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> finish a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game? Let me tell you about my pancake-eating archnemesis, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>Alolan Raichu</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>readers will know that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>Raichu</span></a><span>, the evolved form of Pikachu, is my favorite Pokémon. Because his little brother is the mascot of the whole dang franchise, Raichu is often forgotten, and sometimes, in the case of the anime, actively set up for failure to make Pikachu look good.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>For many years, I grinned and bore it. To me Pikachu, Raichu, and their pre-evolution, Pichu, were all the same Pokémon anyway. If one form got love, it was like my partner in crime was getting attention at different stages of his life. But man, Game Freak was adamant about making sure everyone and their mother knew that Raichu was the red-headed stepchild of the family. Pikachu has a held item that makes it more powerful than Raichu, so there’s even a mechanical reason not to use a Thunder Stone and evolve it. Raichu’s </span><i><span>Ultra Moon</span></i><span> Pokedex entry even says, “Because so many Trainers like the way Pikachu looks, you don’t see this Pokémon very often.” Relax, Game Freak.</span></p>

 <p><span>So when </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon </span></i><span>was coming out, I was already halfway off the wagon. Then it arrived and Game Freak revealed that every Pikachu in the game would evolve into a new regional variant. The Alolan version of Raichu is…cute, I guess. It gains the psychic typing which lets it levitate and surf around on its tail, and all of this is apparently a result of Pikachu overeating Alolan pancakes, which is why it emits a sweet scent when it rubs its electric cheeks. But I saw through its facade. I don’t smell maple syrup, I smell some bullshit. I want to fistfight him in the streets.</span></p>

  <p><span>Behind this syrup-smelling surfing psychic’s cute round face is a nasty, vile truth: Game Freak and The Pokémon Company were only willing to give Raichu attention if they changed him into something else entirely. The boy cannot get respect in his own form, and that has only become more clear in the years since </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>. Pikachu gets a Gigantamax form in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>, an exclusive Z-Move in </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>, and is always the playable version in games like </span><i><span>Pokken Tournament</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite</span></i><span>. Raichu, meanwhile, gets scraps…unless it’s the Alolan variant, which is featured in games like </span><i><span>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</span></i><span> and is playable in </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>A lot of this disrespect and preferential treatment has come after </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>, but I still called Alolan Raichu for what it was. </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon </span></i><span>was already primed to push me away with its less interesting tropical setting and a Pokedex with too few standouts to keep me hunting for new favorites, so to not even be able to explore this region with my favorite electric rat? To be told to settle for an imposter that smells of hotcakes and psychic power? I just couldn’t push through. And y’all, I have tried so many times over the past 10 years. However, maybe I can finally go back after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000659337" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659337"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659337">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The latest RPG in the series finally gives Raichu his due. He has not one, but two Mega Evolutions now, after having been oddly overlooked when </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>came out and first introduced those transformations. I’m obsessed with both of these forms, though I have a preference for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>the flying, physical-attacking X form</span></a><span>. I admit, however, there is some part of me that still feels a little bit of that lingering resentment because both forms carry distinct visual similarities to Pikachu, almost as if Game Freak wanted to make a Mega Pikachu but couldn’t based on their own rules, and so my rat son finally got love. Yes, Alolan Raichu felt like a slight to us OG Raichu lovers at the time…but now that my favorite Pokémon finally isn’t being ignored, do I have it in me to forgive the dopey-ass surfer boy for his crimes?</span></p> <p><span>As the resident </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>guy around these parts, </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span> is one of the only examples I have of a backlog game that feels truly wrong to have not seen through to the end. Usually, if I don’t finish a game, there’s a less stupid and prideful reason like I just wasn’t enjoying it, so I don’t carry the baggage of games left incomplete on my shoulders as I head out to new worlds on unknown adventures. But I’m a certified champion in every other </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> region besides Alola, which I left unconquered mostly because I didn’t want to do it without my best friend by my side. I might not go back any time soon, but for the first time in over a decade, I’m starting to feel like I’m letting go of the pride that has kept me from seeing it through.</span></p>

<p>If you’ve ever used a 3D printer, you may recall the wondrous feeling when you first printed something you could have never sculpted or built yourself. Download a model file, load some plastic filament, push a button, and almost like magic, a three-dimensional object appears. But the result isn’t polished and ready for mass production, and creating a novel shape requires more skills than just pushing a button. Interestingly, today’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/">AI coding agents</a> feel much the same way.</p>
<p>Since November, I have used <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/claude-code-gets-a-web-version-but-its-the-new-sandboxing-that-really-matters/">Claude Code</a> and Claude Opus 4.5 through a personal Claude Max account to extensively experiment with AI-assisted software development (I have also used OpenAI’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/how-openai-is-using-gpt-5-codex-to-improve-the-ai-tool-itself/">Codex</a> in a similar way, though not as frequently). Fifty projects later, I’ll be frank: I have not had this much fun with a computer since I learned BASIC on my <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/440/shining-a-rotten-apple">Apple II Plus</a> when I was 9 years old. This opinion comes not as an endorsement but as personal experience: I voluntarily undertook this project, and I paid out of pocket for both OpenAI and Anthropic’s premium AI plans.</p>
<p>Throughout my life, I have dabbled in programming as a utilitarian coder, writing small tools or scripts when needed. In my web development career, I wrote some small tools from scratch, but I primarily modified other people’s code for my needs. Since 1990, I’ve programmed in BASIC, C, Visual Basic, PHP, ASP, Perl, Python, Ruby, MUSHcode, and some others. I am not an expert in any of these languages—I learned just enough to get the job done. I have developed my own hobby games over the years using BASIC, Torque Game Engine, and Godot, so I have some idea of what makes a good architecture for a modular program that can be expanded over time.</p>

<p>Claude Code, Codex, and Google’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/google-is-bringing-vibe-coding-to-your-terminal-with-gemini-cli/">Gemini CLI</a>, can seemingly perform software miracles on a small scale. They can spit out flashy prototypes of simple applications, user interfaces, and even games, but only as long as they borrow patterns from their training data. Much like a 3D printer, doing production-level work takes far more effort. Creating durable production code, managing a complex project, or crafting something truly novel still requires experience, patience, and skill beyond what today’s AI agents can provide on their own.</p>

<p>And yet these tools have opened a world of creative potential in software that was previously closed to me, and they feel personally empowering. Even with that impression, though, I know these are hobby projects, and the limitations of coding agents lead me to believe that veteran software developers probably shouldn’t fear losing their jobs to these tools any time soon. In fact, they may become busier than ever.</p>
<p>So far, I have created over 50 demo projects in the past two months, fueled in part by a bout of COVID that left me bedridden with a laptop and a generous 2x Claude usage cap that Anthropic put in place during the last few weeks of December. As I typed furiously all day, my wife kept asking me, “Who are you talking to?”</p>
<p>You can see a few of the more interesting results <a href="https://bxfoundry.com/">listed</a> on my personal website. Here are 10 interesting things I’ve learned from the process.</p>

<h2>1. People are still necessary</h2>
<p>Even with the best AI coding agents available today, humans remain essential to the software development process. Experienced human software developers bring judgment, creativity, and domain knowledge that AI models lack. They know how to architect systems for long-term maintainability, how to balance technical debt against feature velocity, and when to push back when requirements don’t make sense.</p>
<p>For hobby projects like mine, I can get away with a lot of sloppiness. But for production work, having someone who understands version control, incremental backups, testing one feature at a time, and debugging complex interactions between systems makes all the difference. Knowing something about how good software development works helps a lot when guiding an AI coding agent—the tool amplifies your existing knowledge rather than replacing it.</p>
<p>As independent AI researcher Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/">wrote</a> in a post distinguishing serious AI-assisted development from casual “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/">vibe coding</a>,” “AI tools amplify existing expertise. The more skills and experience you have as a software engineer the faster and better the results you can get from working with LLMs and coding agents.”</p>

<p>With AI assistance, you don’t have to remember <em>how</em> to do everything. You just need to know what you want to do.</p>

<p>So I like to remind myself that coding agents are software tools best used to enact human ideas, not autonomous coding employees. They are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/the-personhood-trap-how-ai-fakes-human-personality/">not people</a> (and not people replacements) no matter how the companies behind them might market them.</p>
<p>If you think about it, everything you do on a computer was once a manual process. Programming a computer like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC</a> involved literally making physical bits (connections) with wire on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plugboard">plugboard</a>. The history of programming has been one of increasing automation, so even though this AI-assisted leap is somewhat startling, one could think of these tools as an advancement similar to the advent of high-level languages, automated compilers and debugger tools, or GUI-based IDEs. They can automate many tasks, but managing the overarching project scope still falls to the person telling the tool what to do.</p>
<p>And they can have rapidly compounding benefits. I’ve now used AI tools to write better tools—such as changing the source of an emulator so a coding agent can use it directly—and those improved tools are already having ripple effects. But a human must be in the loop for the best execution of my vision. This approach has kept me very busy, and contrary to some prevailing fears about people <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/11/is-ai-dulling-our-minds/">becoming dumber</a> due to AI, I have learned many new things along the way.</p>
<h2>2. AI models are brittle beyond their training data</h2>
<p>Like all AI models based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning)">Transformer architecture</a>, the large language models (LLMs) that underpin today’s coding agents have a significant limitation: They can only reliably apply knowledge gleaned from training data, and they have a limited ability to generalize that knowledge to novel domains not represented in that data.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>What is training data? In this case, when building coding-flavored LLMs, AI companies <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22561180/github-copilot-legal-copyright-fair-use-public-code">download</a> millions of examples of software code from sources like GitHub and use them to make the AI models. Companies later specialize them for coding through fine-tuning processes.</p>

<p>The ability of AI agents to use trial and error—attempting something and then trying again—helps mitigate the brittleness of LLMs somewhat. But it’s not perfect, and it can be frustrating to see a coding agent spin its wheels trying and failing at a task repeatedly, either because it doesn’t know how to do it or because it previously learned how to solve a problem but then forgot because the context window got compacted (more on that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/">here</a>).</p>

      </figure>

<p>To get around this, it helps to have the AI model take copious notes as it goes along about how it solved certain problems so that future instances of the agent can learn from them again. You also want to set ground rules in the claude.md file that the agent reads when it begins its session.</p>
<p>This brittleness means that coding agents are almost frighteningly good at what they’ve been trained and fine-tuned on—modern programming languages, JavaScript, HTML, and similar well-represented technologies—and generally terrible at tasks on which they have not been deeply trained, such as 6502 Assembly or programming an Atari 800 game with authentic-looking character graphics.</p>
<p>It took me five minutes to make a nice HTML5 demo with Claude but a week of torturous trial and error, plus actual systematic design on my part, to make a similar demo of an Atari 800 game. To do so, I had to use Claude Code to invent several tools, like command-line emulators and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/mcp-the-new-usb-c-for-ai-thats-bringing-fierce-rivals-together/">MCP servers</a>, that allow it to peek into the operation of the Atari 800’s memory and chipset to even begin to make it happen.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<h2>3. True novelty can be an uphill battle</h2>
<p>Due to what might poetically be called “preconceived notions” baked into a coding model’s neural network (more technically, statistical semantic associations), it can be difficult to get AI agents to create truly novel things, even if you carefully spell out what you want.</p>
<p>For example, I spent four days trying to get Claude Code to create an Atari 800 version of my HTML game <a href="https://bxfoundry.com/violentcheckers/"><em>Violent Checkers</em></a>, but it had trouble because in the game’s design, the squares on the checkerboard don’t matter beyond their starting positions. No matter how many times I told the agent (and made notes in my Claude project files), it would come back to trying to center the pieces to the squares, snap them within squares, or use the squares as a logical basis of the game’s calculations when they should really just form a background image.</p>
<p>To get around this in the Atari 800 version, I started over and told Claude that I was creating a game with a UFO (instead of a circular checker piece) flying over a field of adjacent squares—never once mentioning the words “checker,” “checkerboard,” or “checkers.” With that approach, I got the results I wanted.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? Because with LLMs, context is everything, and in language, context changes meaning. Take the word “bank” and add the words “river” or “central” in front of it, and see how the meaning changes. In a way, words act as addresses that <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/large-language-models-use-surprisingly-simple-mechanism-retrieve-stored-knowledge-0325">unlock</a> the semantic relationships encoded in a neural network. So if you put “checkerboard” and “game” in the context, the model’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)">self-attention process</a> links up a massive web of semantic associations about how checkers games should work, and that semantic baggage throws things off.</p>

<p>A couple of tricks can help AI coders navigate around these limitations. First, avoid contaminating the context with irrelevant information. Second, when the agent gets stuck, try this prompt: “What information do you need that would let you implement this perfectly right now? What tools are available to you that you could use to discover that information systematically without guessing?” This forces the agent to identify (semantically link up) its own knowledge gaps, spelled out in the context window and subject to future action, instead of flailing around blindly.</p>

<h2>4. The 90 percent problem</h2>
<p>The first 90 percent of an AI coding project comes in fast and amazes you. The last 10 percent involves tediously filling in the details through back-and-forth trial-and-error conversation with the agent. Tasks that require deeper insight or understanding than what the agent can provide still require humans to make the connections and guide it in the right direction. The limitations we discussed above can also cause your project to hit a brick wall.</p>
<p>From what I have observed over the years, larger LLMs can potentially make deeper contextual connections than smaller ones. They have <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1130795/what-even-is-a-parameter/">more parameters</a> (encoded data points), and those parameters are linked in more multidimensional ways, so they tend to have a deeper map of semantic relationships. As deep as those go, it seems that human brains still have an even deeper grasp of semantic connections and can make wild semantic jumps that LLMs tend not to.</p>
<p>Creativity, in this sense, may be when you jump from, say, basketball to how bubbles form in soap film and somehow make a useful connection that leads to a breakthrough. Instead, LLMs tend to follow conventional semantic paths that are more conservative and entirely guided by mapped-out relationships from the training data. That limits their creative potential unless the prompter unlocks it by guiding the LLM to make novel semantic connections. That takes skill and creativity on the part of the operator, which once again shows the role of LLMs as tools used by humans rather than independent thinking machines.</p>
<h2>5. Feature creep becomes irresistible</h2>
<p>While creating software with AI coding tools, the joy of experiencing novelty makes you want to keep adding interesting new features rather than fixing bugs or perfecting existing systems. And Claude (or Codex) is happy to oblige, churning away at new ideas that are easy to sketch out in a quick and pleasing demo (the 90 percent problem again) rather than polishing the code.</p>

<p>Fixing bugs can also create bugs elsewhere. This is not new to coding agents—it’s a time-honored problem in software development. But agents supercharge this phenomenon because they can barrel through your code and make sweeping changes in pursuit of narrow-minded goals that affect lots of working systems. We’ve already talked about the importance of having a good architecture guided by the human mind behind the wheel above, and that comes into play here.</p>

<h2>6. AGI is not here yet</h2>
<p>Given the limitations I’ve described above, it’s very clear that an AI model with general intelligence—what people usually call <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/">artificial general intelligence</a> (AGI)—is still not here. AGI would hypothetically be able to navigate around baked-in stereotype associations and not have to rely on explicit training or fine-tuning on many examples to get things right. AI companies will probably need a different architecture in the future.</p>
<p>I’m speculating, but AGI would likely need to learn permanently on the fly—as in modify its own neural network weights—instead of relying on what is called “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00234">in-context learning</a>,” which only persists until the context fills up and gets compacted or wiped out.</p>

<p>In other words, you could teach a true AGI system how to do something by explanation or let it learn by doing, noting successes, and having those lessons permanently stick, no matter what is in the context window. Today’s coding agents can’t do that—they forget lessons from earlier in a long session or between sessions unless you manually document everything for them. My favorite trick is instructing them to write a long, detailed report on what happened when a bug is fixed. That way, you can point to the hard-earned solution the next time the amnestic AI model makes the same mistake.</p>
<h2>7. Even fast isn’t fast enough</h2>
<p>While using Claude Code for a while, it’s easy to take for granted that you suddenly have the power to create software without knowing certain programming languages. This is amazing at first, but you can quickly become frustrated that what is conventionally a very fast development process isn’t fast enough. Impatience at the coding machine sets in, and you start wanting more.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But even if you do know the programming languages being used, you don’t get a free pass. You still need to make key decisions about how the project will unfold. And when the agent gets stuck or makes a mess of things, your programming knowledge becomes essential for diagnosing what went wrong and steering it back on course.</p>
<h2>8. People may become busier than ever</h2>
<p>After guiding way too many hobby projects through Claude Code over the past two months, I’m starting to think that most people won’t become unemployed due to AI—they will become busier than ever. Power tools allow more work to be done in less time, and the economy will demand more productivity to match.</p>
<p>It’s almost too easy to make new software, in fact, and that can be exhausting. One project idea would lead to another, and I was soon spending eight hours a day during my winter vacation shepherding about 15 Claude Code projects at once. That’s too much split attention for good results, but the novelty of seeing my ideas come to life was addictive. In addition to the game ideas I’ve mentioned here, I made tools that scrape and search my past articles, a graphical MUD based on ZZT, a new type of <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/661428/text-based-vr-explore-the-pioneering-world-of-mushes/">MUSH</a> (text game) that uses AI-generated rooms, a new type of <a href="https://github.com/benj-edwards/ascii-processing-unit">Telnet display proxy</a>, and a Claude Code client for the Apple II (more on that soon). I also put two AI-enabled emulators for <a href="https://github.com/benj-edwards/bobbin">Apple II</a> and <a href="https://github.com/benj-edwards/atari800-ai">Atari 800</a>&nbsp;on GitHub. Phew.</p>
<p>Consider the advent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_shovel">steam shovel</a>, which allowed humans to dig holes faster than a team using hand shovels. It made existing projects faster and new projects possible. But think about the human operator of the steam shovel. Suddenly, we had a tireless tool that could work 24 hours a day if fueled up and maintained properly, while the human piloting it would need to eat, sleep, and rest.</p>

<p>In fact, we may end up needing new protections for human knowledge workers using these tireless information engines to implement their ideas, much as unions rose as a response to industrial production lines over 100 years ago. Humans need rest, even when machines don’t.</p>
<p>Will an AI system ever replace the human role here? Even if AI coding agents could eventually work fully autonomously, I don’t think they’ll replace humans entirely because there will still be people who want to get things done, and new AI power tools will emerge to help them do it.</p>
<h2>9. Fast is scary to people</h2>
<p>AI coding tools can turn what was once a year-long personal project into a five-minute session. I fed Claude Code a photo of a two-player Tetris game I sketched in a notebook back in 2008, and it produced a <a href="https://bxfoundry.com/tetris2p/">working prototype</a> in minutes (prompt: “create a fully-featured web game with sound effects based on this diagram”). That’s wild, and even though the results are imperfect, it’s a bit frightening to comprehend what kind of sea change in software development this might entail.</p>
<p>Since early December, I’ve been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjedwards.com/post/3ma2pvxl6ws2n">posting</a> some of my more amusing experimental AI-coded projects to Bluesky for people to try out, but I discovered I needed to deliberately slow down with updates because they came too fast for people to absorb (and too fast for me to fully test). I’ve also received comments like “I’m worried you’re using AI, you’re making games too fast” and so on.</p>

<p>Regardless of my own habits, the flow of new software will not slow down. There will soon be a seemingly endless supply of AI-augmented media (games, movies, images, books), and that’s a problem we’ll have to figure out how to deal with. These products won’t all be “AI slop,” either; some will be done very well, and the acceleration in production times due to these new power tools will balloon the quantity beyond anything we’ve seen.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Social media tends to prime people to believe that AI is all good or all bad, but that kind of black-and-white thinking may be the easy way out. You’ll have no cognitive dissonance, but you’ll miss a far richer third option: seeing these tools as imperfect and deserving of critique but also as useful and empowering when they bring your ideas to life.</p>
<p>AI agents should be considered tools, not entities or employees, and they should be amplifiers of human ideas. My game-in-progress <a href="https://bxfoundry.com/cardminer/"><em>Card Miner</em></a> is entirely my own high-level creative design work, but the AI model handled the low-level code. I am still proud of it as an expression of my personal ideas, and it would not exist without AI coding agents.</p>
<h2>10. These tools aren’t going away</h2>
<p>For now, at least, coding agents remain very much tools in the hands of people who want to build things. The question is whether humans will learn to wield these new tools effectively to empower themselves. Based on two months of intensive experimentation, I’d say the answer is a qualified yes, with plenty of caveats.</p>
<p>We also have social issues to face: Professional developers already use these tools, and with the prevailing stigma against AI tools in some online communities, many software developers and the platforms that host their work will face difficult decisions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I don’t think AI tools will make human software designers obsolete. Instead, they may well help those designers become more capable. This isn’t new, of course; tools of every kind have been serving this role since long before the dawn of recorded history. The best tools amplify human capability while keeping a person behind the wheel. The 3D printer analogy holds: amazing fast results are possible, but mastery still takes time, skill, and a lot of patience with the machine.</p>

            <guid>1409857</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How old is your home Wi-Fi router? Take this post as a notice that it might be time for an upgrade. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6769/">TP-Link is one of the best in the business, and right now Amazon happens to have its Archer AX21 Wi-Fi 6 router on sale for a hefty 35% discount.</a> The router is usually priced at $80, but has come down to just $52 for a limited time. That means you’ll be saving a cool $28 which you can go spend on V-bucks or something to grab the new Eric Cartman skin in <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>
<p>This dual-band Wi-Fi router is able to achieve super fast speeds, with greater capacity and reduced network congestion compared to its older model. You’ll be able to enjoy smoother online gaming and more stable streaming, as well as reach download speeds of up to 1.8Gbps in total bandwidth. The 5GHz band supports up to 1,200Mbps while the 2.4Ghz supports another 574 Mbps. Of course, your exact performance may vary based on a number of factors including distance between devices and obstacles such as walls.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6769/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The TP-Link router has four Ethernet LAN ports, so you can connect all your devices on which you need the best, uninterrupted internet connections. Plug in your gaming PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and your Nintendo Switch 2. That’s your four right there. Additionally, more than 40 devices can be connected over Wi-Fi at once.</p>
<h2>Build Your Own Mesh Network</h2>
<p>This is an EasyMesh compatible unit—meaning you can use this as your main router for network onboarding and management. Then combine it with either other EasyMesh compatible routers or range extenders to turn your home network into a mesh network. This can result in better coverage and fewer (hopefully no) dead spots throughout your house or apartment. Mesh networks will intelligently switch your Wi-Fi-enabled devices from one node to the next as it detects it moving throughout your home. As in, you’re going from downstairs to upstairs with your phone in your pocket, it’ll switch over which router its connected to based on proximity. Each router will also share the same Wi-Fi name so no extra confusion there.</p>



<p>The TP-Link Archer AX21 router is listed as working with Amazon Alexa. However, not much info is provided on&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;<em>exactly</em> you can do with Alexa with it. I do find it mildly amusing to be like, “Alexa, disconnect Derek’s PS5 from the Wi-Fi,” while your kid brother is about to get his very first Victory Royale<em>.</em> Again, though, not sure if that’s possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report discusses the Xbox Cloud Gaming ad-supported tier launching in 2026 and how it will work. </p>



<p>For those unaware, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-preparing-free-xbox-cloud-service-with-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from last year</a> mentioned a free Xbox Cloud Gaming platform supported by ads which doesn’t require a Game Pass subscription. It seems this tier might be released in 2026, as teaser images of the service have already started surfacing online, suggesting an ad-based playtime model. </p>











<p>For those unaware, an image surfaced last week for Xbox Cloud Gaming, which stated “1 hour of ad-supported playtime per session”. The messages shown in the image appear to be an error, and a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-cloud-gaming-will-get-an-ad-supported-tier-this-year-rumors-coalesce-after-ad-support-notices-appear-prematurely" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> report explains how this service will work. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The report stated that the ads will not apply to all Xbox Cloud Gaming tiers; instead, they will apply to a separate tier. Players who use Xbox Cloud Gaming with ads will be able to stream Xbox Games they purchased digitally, but will not have access to Game Pass titles. </p>



<p>The upcoming ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming tier will remove the requirement to have purchased at least one tier of Game Pass to access cloud gaming titles. Additionally, the exact release date for when the service drops hasn’t been revealed; however, Jez Corden has been told it is releasing “this year.” Maybe we could get an official reveal at the upcoming Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-games-confirmed-for-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Developer Direct</a></p>



<p>The amount of playtime they will receive and the duration of ads they will have to watch were not revealed. However, the report from last year stated that Microsoft was testing “a limit of one hour for sessions, with up to five hours free a month.” These details are subject to change when the service officially drops. </p>







<p>In other news, the next Xbox will reportedly feature “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-will-reportedly-feature-full-bore-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-bore Windows</a>.” Do you think the Xbox Cloud Gaming ad-supported tier will be released in 2026?

            <p>Far Cry 3: Classic Edition will be getting itself a lovely performance boost later this week.</p>
<p>As shared by Ubisoft, series fans can soon revisit the beautiful Rook Islands once again, but this time with 60fps. Ahh, doesn't the sea look so clear and inviting? Doesn't the sand look so golden? Doesn't that pirate look, errr, a little deadly and terrifying? Yeah, maybe we should run...</p>

<p>Far Cry 3's upcoming frame rate boost will arrive on 21st January, for current gen consoles. You can check out a little teaser for it above.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem that Ubisoft will be stopping with Far Cry 3, though. Last week, the studio appeared to tease that Far Cry 3: Classic Edition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-3-blood-dragon">Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon</a> Classic, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-primal">Far Cry Primal</a> would all be getting those welcome 60fps updates with a cocktail of emojis.</p><p>Then, if these emojis - which included the likes of a palm tree, a dragon and an hourglass - weren't enough to convince fans of the impending updates, when one user replied "Far Cry 3 60 FPS, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon 60 FPS, Far Cry Primal 60 FPS", Ubisoft itself <a href="https://x.com/FarCrygame/status/2012224947603570962?s=20">sent them a gif</a> awarding a gold star.</p>
<p>So, yes, it is a case of when, not if. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>If you haven't played Far Cry 3 for yourself, I would absolutely recommend it. While he is pretty awful and then some, there is no denying that the game's pirate Vaas is one of the best out there. As for the Rook Islands, yes they are hostile but my goddess they are gorgeous (she writes while looking out of her window, with the rain dripping down, the snow melting, and the sky grey).</p><p>"In the past, Far Cry's vision of a first-person shooter RPG where you explore, master and then control your environment has always been more seductive on paper than any of its developers have managed to deliver on disc. Far Cry 3 changes all that. For me, this is the new apex predator of open-world shooters," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-3-review">Eurogamer's original Far Cry 3 review</a>.</p>
<p>"Hunt it down as soon as you can."</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Ubisoft news, last week the studio added more flames to the fire that is its Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake. You see, earlier this month, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-music-upload">reuploaded a sizable selection of sea shanties from Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> over on its YouTube music channel, which many assumed was because a remake of the studio's piratical adventure is on the cards.</p>
<p>It then claimed this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">music which was reuploaded due to "technical issues"</a>, however no one really believes that.</p>

			<p>Of all the depressing studio closures of the past few years (and there have been far too many) one that hit me particularly hard was that of Piranha Bytes, the legendary pioneers of the Eurojank RPG. Famous for creating the hugely influential <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gothic">Gothic</a> series, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/risen">Risen</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elex">Elex</a>, all of their games shared a unique feel that garnered a loyal fanbase. While the settings were different, each title featured unforgiving combat and a sense of openness that made many other RPGs feel claustrophobically restrained. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/is-the-gothic-1-remake-a-gothic-revival-or-a-gothic-ruin/">A remake of the first Gothic game</a> is still in the works but there is clearly a gap in the market for RPGs that share the DNA of Piranha Bytes’ canon. Of Ash and Steel is one of the first games to aim at filling this niche, and it certainly succeeds in that aim, although this isn’t always a good thing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - Official Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Fzzd6JmXBU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In traditional RPG fashion, you begin the game in a safe tutorial zone. You are Tristan, a cartographer charged with mapping the mysterious island of Greyhaft. There is no character customisation or specific class choices to be made here but early conversations can level up different attributes such as strength or dexterity and begin to define your character. The lack of any player contribution to the character at the start is another approach borrowed from Piranha Bytes games but does feel a little dated. This isn’t helped by a common sentiment from players that Tristan has a very punchable face – although this perhaps helps to explain why he gets into so many scrapes.</p>


<p>Graphically, Of Ash and Steel is solid but isn’t exactly cutting edge. The environment is relatively detailed and character models are mostly good (Tristan’s face aside). Enemies are varied, especially as the game progresses and you get past the initial wolves and bugs. The UI is clear and menus intuitive so interacting with the game never feels awkward – that awkwardness instead exhibits itself in the controls and combat.</p>


<p>Early on Tristan is clearly not a trained fighter. Most enemies can – and will – kill you very quickly. You don’t even have access to proper combat controls until you find a way to train your skills, which requires both levelling up and gold to pay a relevant teacher. This means that the beginning of your adventure is supposed to be very linear as you follow the path and avoid straying from it. This enables the onboarding to be controlled for new players, which is welcome given the high difficulty level.</p>
<p>As you gain experience through combat and fetch quests you can develop Tristan’s abilities in usual RPG style whilst also making choices about how you want to learn new skills. Specialising is possible but it’s definitely worth spending skill points in the early ranks of all three trees – war, survival, and crafting. These different trees will allow you to make consumables and equipment from the things you forage, loot, and steal in your journey, as well as letting you swing a sword correctly.</p>

<p>The dangers of Greyhaft are soon revealed as your entire crew are slaughtered in front of you and then you are kidnapped by a gang of bandits. You then wake up in a strange bed and have to begin from scratch to complete your mission and/or take vengeance on your assailants. In true RPG fashion your first quests involve clearing all the empty bottles from your rescuer’s cabin, pulling out the weeds from his garden, and (in a touch of very Teutonic humour) finding out who has been throwing fouled trousers into his yard. These banal tasks teach you a range of basic controls before you can venture out and begin your adventure in earnest.</p>
<p>It’s also typical of the games that inspire Of Ash and Steel that the first hours of the game are potentially very frustrating. Death is rapid, combat is incredibly janky (deliberately so until you learn how to fight), and even early NPCs focus on tricking and betraying you. The usual freedom you might expect from a seemingly open-world adventure is not present here. You need to follow the narrative and take the game on its own terms for the first few hours. This is especially the case if you play on the default difficulty setting when all of the aforementioned challenges are exacerbated by hunger, thirst, and tiredness scales. While I’m not usually a fan of these kinds of survival mechanics it does mean that there is more of a reason to use the things that you are constantly foraging.</p>

<p>Obviously a core part of the Eurojank heritage is the ‘jank’. I started playing Of Ash and Steel with a pre-release build and was enjoying myself despite a litany of bugs and occasional crashes. When an update was released at launch I switched to the full build and frustratingly found my save deleted. This isn’t all that unusual, but it did push me away from the game for a few weeks. Starting fresh to complete this review, and as we approach two months since launch, the game has undergone a series of patches and improvements which make it somewhat more polished.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		It’s a bit of a cop out to say that this is a game for fans of the genre, but it is entirely appropriate with Eurojank. If you’ve ever played and enjoyed a Piranha Bytes game, then Of Ash and Steel is easy to recommend, especially given the patches and improvements since release. It's also a good entry point for newcomers to the subgenre, though you will still need to tolerate some &nbsp;teething problems. If the game gets its teeth into you then it’ll become your new obsession. For others, however, they’ll bounce off the game and go back to more polished and forgiving titles.	</p></div>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Valve have reportedly rewritten Steam’s AI disclosure form, essentially a declaration of a game’s generative AI usage that developers and publishers must complete to sell on the platform. The new form, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simoncarless_interestingly-pc-video-game-platform-steam-activity-7417944215675908096-OGNg/">shared by consultant Simon Carless</a>, now specifies that while the presence of in-game GenAI content must still be divulged, including on the game’s store page, the usage of AI-based production tools for "efficiency gains" does not require disclosure.</p>
<p>"We are aware that many modern game development environments have AI powered tools built into them," the update form reads. "Efficiency gains through the use of these tools is not focus of this section. Instead, it is concerned with the use of AI in creating content that ships with your game, and is consumed by players."</p>

<p>The changed wording makes it explicit that developers don’t need to disclose time-saving tactics like using generative AI for concept art (or, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">as Divinity developers Larian put it</a>, "concept art exploration"), nor the practice known as vibe coding: describing the intended purpose of code to an AI helper that then generates it, instead of writing that code oneself. If it's not something that players see, hear, read, or otherwise interact with during the course of the game, it's all gravy as far as Valve are concerned.</p>
<p>The rewrite makes a kind of sense, if you’re a stressed producer trying to figure out whether you should list every time a level designer used Gemini to write an email for them. Even game engines like Unreal now come with built-in AI chatbots, and it’s no secret that game development is often under top-down managerial pressure to use these tools, regardless of whether they produce tangible game assets. Or, indeed, any meaningful benefit whatsoever.</p><p>That said, I’m not sure it’s much of an overall change, let alone a positive one. Valve’s previous disclosure form never actually asked outright for information on so-called "efficiency" tool usage – just as the current form does, it only ever requested info on GenAI assets that might be found within the game.</p>
<p>In this sense, the new form also fails to address the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">biggest problem with Steam’s disclosure rules</a>: that devs and publishers can describe their game’s GenAI content in broad, vague terms, leaving ambiguity over whether what you see while playing has been crafted by a human or farted out by a bot. And while Valve evidently see a distinction between 'helping hand' AI dev tools and the more insidious fake-art stuff, the reality is that machine slop – which may well have been intended to act as a temporary production shortcut – has a nasty habit of enduring into the finished product. 2025 critical darlings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner">The Alters</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> both launched with GenAI assets left in, allegedly by accident.</p>
<p>Unintentional or otherwise, Valve permitting developers to think less about their tools sounds like a good way to let even more undisclosed GenAI slip through the cracks. It may not be a full surrender to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-ceo-wants-valve-and-steam-to-stop-requiring-devs-to-disclose-generative-ai-usage">mad CEOs</a> who want Steam’s disclosures gone entirely, but this rewrite hardly better serves the intended purpose of keeping players informed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re already more than halfway through January. What kind of changes have you been implementing to actually hit some of your 2026 goals? Perhaps you have high hopes of getting into better shape, eating healthier, maybe you’re aiming to learn a new skill. If your big plans are just to be more productive than ever before, you might want to take a look at your work setup. most of us are happy just working off a laptop, but you’re really limiting your potential by sticking with such little screen real estate. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">A portable monitor can go a long way, and this one from MNN happens to be seeing a major discount right now. Normally priced at $59, it’s come down to an even $50 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="588">Remote work has allowed many of us the flexibility to step outside our homes and get work done from anywhere we please, be it a coffee shops, library, or even a hotel room. Although, a change of environment can introduces a drawback. You’re now stuck working off just you’re laptop, instead of your elaborate multi-screen desktop home setup I’m assuming you must have. Managing emails, documents, spreadsheets, and video calls on a single laptop screen means all those windows are fighting for the same bit of space. A portable monitor addresses this issue by providing an additional display, closely mimicking the comfort and efficiency of your home setup wherever you happen to be working.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="590" data-end="1026">The MNN 15.6-inch portable monitor is built with mobile professionals in mind. Its large display makes it easier to view and manage multiple apps at once. It has an HD resolution of 1080p and render color brightly and accurately.</p>
<p data-start="1028" data-end="1318">Getting started is simple and straightforward. The monitor connects through either of its two USB-C ports, ensuring compatibility with a wide variety of devices. In addition to laptops, it can be used with smartphones, desktop PCs, PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and even a Nintendo Switch.</p>


<h2 data-start="1028" data-end="1318">Built for Travel</h2>
<p data-start="1320" data-end="1883" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With an ultra-slim profile measuring just 0.3 inches thin and 1.52 lbs., the monitor fits easily into a backpack or laptop bag without adding extra weight or bulk. It also comes with a scratch-resistant smart cover made from durable PU leather, providing extra protection while traveling. The cover doubles as a stand using a frameless magnetic design, allowing the monitor to be positioned in either landscape or portrait mode. Choose the orientation that best matches your workflow, whether you’re writing, coding, or scrolling through lengthy documents. Sometimes it’s nice to just have your Slack chats positioned vertically on the second display, while you’re getting your actual work done in front of you on your laptop screen.</p>

<p>Rockstar North, a developer of GTA 6, has been hit by reports of an explosion, with police and fire services on the scene in Edinburgh responding.</p>



<p>The offices, located in Scotland, are currently cordoned off by police following reports of an explosion at around 5 AM GMT, with early suggestions, yet to be confirmed, stating a boiler was the cause.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/police-have-cordoned-off-rockstar-north-after-explosion-reportedly-caused-by-malfunctioning-boiler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, <a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EdinburghLive stated</a> that Scottish Fire &amp; Rescue have been on the scene for over two hours since reports of the incident came in, with a statement provided to the outlet that said the team “mobilised three pumps and four of our specialist appliances.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0lx7x5d81lo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a> that firefighters were called out to deal with structural damage at the building and crews were stood down at 9:21 AM GMT.</p>



<p>No deaths or injuries have been reported, and, while the cause is yet to be publicly confirmed, local outlets have stated it was a suspected boiler explosion.</p>



<p>Rockstar North is, of course, one of the developers working on the highly-anticipated sixth instalment of the Grand Theft Auto series, and the company has not commented on the incident.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> is currently enjoying a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#1m">boost in its player numbers</a> following the long-awaited debut of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadpool-is-joining-marvel-rivals-later-this-week-and-he-can-pretty-much-do-anything-he-wants">Deadpool</a>, but some players continue to ruin the fun for everyone. Thankfully, the developers of the game are on the case and planning to ult them into oblivion soon enough.</p>
<p>On 19th January, the <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/2013176993383133552?s=20">official Marvel Rivals account</a> on X/Twitter acknowledged the annoying situation players are often running into, with some matches being disrupted by farmers who just stand still and farm the required stats to progress through the <a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Proficiency">hero proficiency</a> track fast.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hey Rivals,</p><p>Recently, we’ve noticed that some players are exploiting matches by remaining stationary and repeatedly farming stats to gain hero proficiency points. This behavior disrupts normal gameplay and seriously affects the match experience of other players.</p><p>To address…</p></div>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/2013176993383133552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The answer will be to introduce a "combat behaviour detection system" which will punish the players engaging in such activities with warnings, short-term suspensions, and even longer time-offs. The worst offenders will face "permanent account bans" which may not amount to much since the game is free-to-play, but will surely enrage anyone fully committed to maxing out heroes.</p>
<p>Though this wave of farming has been partially enabled by Marvel Rivals' slightly convoluted hero proficiency system and its approach to challenges tied to cosmetic rewards, the online shooter isn't the only one that's been affected by exploiters who'd rather mindlessly farm for hours than play the game normally. Sadly, it's the kind of negative stuff that comes with the territory, but NetEase developers have, so far, done well at acting fast on negative feedback pertaining to the game's health and game environment, so we're hoping to see this system live in the game soon.</p><p>For now, players on the game's community subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/marvel_rivals_starting_to_take_action_against_afk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">are celebrating the news</a>, with the most upvoted comment saying the banhammer "might actually help some of these lord farmers touch grass." If you're wondering what "lord farmers" are, some users are describing them as the people that engage in farming on dead regional servers in the night hours; when they queue at the same time, they face each other and just AFK as DPS, tanks, and healers do their thing taking turns. Proficiency is tied to excelling in those roles, so you can see where the boosts are coming from.</p>
<p>"Great, now do something about throwers," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/comment/o0g90ch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">another user says</a> in the same thread. This is more of a widespread competitive online game issue, but anyone who's spent enough time playing ranked Marvel Rivals matches knows it's easy to run into folks who jump ship as soon as they see things going south. That's an entirely different problem NetEase hasn't properly addressed yet, so don't get your hopes up.</p>

            <p>After almost three months of scavenging and fighting, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> players have become quite good at dealing with the extraction shooter's PvE foes. Diehards might be worried about that side of the game becoming stale soon, but don't worry: Embark could be about to unleash hell on us.</p>
<p>During a chat with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/will-this-blow-up-the-server-arc-raiders-players-are-so-good-at-killing-arc-that-embark-is-considering-how-to-escalate-pve-dev-teases-a-shredder-escape-and-the-giant-walking-ones-in-the-background/">GamesRadar</a>, Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins stated the team is "pretty happy" with the end-game loop of taking down the imposing Queens and Matriarchs.</p>
<p>The problem is that killing the same behemoths over and over again to get materials to craft better guns that excel at killing the same enemies can get pretty old, pretty quick. Of course, most players have yet to experience what Arc Raiders' later progression stages and threat levels have to offer, but online shooters typically thrive or die based on how well-fed the hardcore crowd that lives in the end-game is.</p>
<p>Instead of coming up with new "giant spidery" robots, Watkins suggests Embark Studios could look at ways to put them to good use in different scenarios and/or events: "I think it's looking toward where we take those types of experiences in the future to something else or something additional, seeing how we can escalate the experience for the player on the PvE side."</p><p>A potential buff to the Arcs or shaken-up world state wouldn't be limited to the boss robots, as drones are also becoming "much less of a threat to them" (that is, in regards to players deeper into the game). Nonetheless, some the smaller Arcs are simply meant to be annoyances we have to deal with as we rush through our favourite loot spots and (if we're feeling naughty) go after unsuspecting raiders.</p>
<p>About the titanic Arc bosses that can often be seen in the background, Embark isn't making promises due to the tech involved, but everything seems to be on the table: "We want to go wherever's practical for us, or wherever feels fun, but then you start running into the practical side of, will this blow up the server? … Our ambitions are definitely large, and I'm not going to say that you're going to meet one anytime soon, but obviously you see the giant walking ones in the background and stuff."</p>
<p>For now, I'd say <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-now-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-so-youre-all-getting-a-golden-pickaxe-as-a-reward">more than 12m copies sold</a> and the glowing player sentiment are giving the studio plenty of space and time for experimentation.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449">Dusk Golem</a>, who has had a history of accurately reporting Capcom's plans for Resident Evil, the company will be announcing a remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_code_veronica_x">Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a> in 2026 (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcoms-next-big-resident-evil-remake-will-reportedly-be-revealed-this-year/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>Code Veronica, largely regarded as a mainline entry in all but name, has been long rumoured to receive the remake treatment, and Dusk Golem seems particularly confident that this is real, stating plainly "I promise you".</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0jugtrv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>"No, there is NOT a Resident Evil 5 Remake that's going to be announced this year. Instead, later this year a RE Remake that starts with "(C)" &amp; ends "(ode Veronica)" is going to be announced, I promise you."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Questions arose around a potential remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_5">Resident Evil 5</a> after Eva La Dare, the voice actor behind Sheva Alomar in the 2009 original, stated that she's "Got a few fun things lined up for March" in relation to Resident Evil's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>Capcom <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/zombies-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-but-now-theyre-more-terrifying-than-ever">recently showcased</a> more gameplay for Resident Evil Requiem ahead of its release, highlighting the differences between protagonists Grace Ashcroft and Leon Kennedy. It's also been confirmed that those after a challenge can set the difficulty higher and thus necessitate the use of Ink Ribbons during Grace's sections.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A notable Resident Evil insider has stated that the RE5 Remake will not be announced in 2026; instead, Code Veronica Remake will be revealed.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Resident Evil 5’s voice actor made a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-5-voice-actor-hints-at-possible-30th-anniversary-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptic post</a> last week, leading the community to speculate that Resident Evil 5 Remake will be revealed on the franchise’s 30th Anniversary. However, it seems this won’t be the case, and a remake of an older title could be shown instead. The insider has also discussed reasons why this might be the case. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-code-veronica-reveal-reportedly-coming-in-2026">Resident Evil Code Veronica Reveal Reportedly Coming in 2026</h2>



<p>The latest bit of information comes from DuskGolem, who accurately leaked Resident Evil Requiem’s reveal and that Leon Kennedy would be part of the game. In the insider’s latest <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter), they debunk the community’s theories that Resident Evil 5 Remake will be announced this year and reaffirm their claim that Code Veronica Remake will be revealed. </p>



<p>Late last year, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-remakes-scheduled-for-2027-2028-respectively-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that Code Veronica and Zero Remakes were scheduled to release in 2027 and 2028, respectively, with the former being revealed in 2026.</p>



<p>Another <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012675455250235692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> by the insider also discusses the probable reasons Code Veronica and Zero Remakes took priority over others. The first reason is surveys, where fans have apparently voted for these two titles to be remade. The second reason is that several devs at Capcom worked on the original RE Zero and have ideas to improve it. The third reason is seemingly scope and scale, where RE5 and RE6 are considerably bigger titles. </p>



<p>As always, readers should take this information with a grain of salt, as the information doesn’t come from an official source. </p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> office has been cordoned off by police following an explosion. While the source is currently unconfirmed, reports suggest that a boiler is the cause.</p>
<p>The building, located on Holyrood Road in Edinburgh, has been attended by both police and city fire departments. <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25776012.gta6-dev-rockstar-north-building-taped-off-boiler-explosion/">According to the Scottish Herald</a>, around seven Scottish Fire and Rescue vehicles were sent to the scene after alarms were raised around 5am. No injuries or deaths have been announced by the authorities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp">Edinburghlive</a> has stated that Scottish Fire and Rescue have been on the scene for upwards of two hours after the call reporting the incident came in. The outlet was also provided a statement by Scottish Fire and Rescue, in which a spokesperson stated the following:</p>

<p>"I can confirm that we got a call at 5.02am this morning. We mobilised three pumps and four of our specialist appliances. It's an ongoing incident and we're still in attendance at the moment with other agencies."</p><p>

The Scottish Herald were told, again by a spokesperson from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, that firefighters worked to secure "structural damage" to the building. These crews left after three hours after the area was deemed safe.

</p><p>This piece will be updated as more information on the explosion have been confirmed.</p>

<p>A risqué <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> island aimed at 'adults only' has been deleted by Nintendo after more than five years.</p>
<p>This comes courtesy of creator <a href="https://x.com/churip_ccc/status/2011099062666477894">@churip_ccc</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-bans-infamous-japanese-adult-only-animal-crossing-island-creator-says-thanks-for-turning-a-blind-eye-all-these-years/">Automaton</a>), who posted on social media to confirm the deletion, stating "To Nintendo, I apologize from the bottom of my heart. Or rather, thank you for turning a blind eye for more than five years."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Actually, just a day before the update,<br></em><em>The Dream Address for the Adult Island was deleted by Nintendo.<br></em><em>To Nintendo, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.<br></em><em>Or rather, thank you for turning a blind eye for more than five years.<br></em><em>To everyone who visited the island,<br></em><em>And to all the streamers who showcased it in their videos,<br></em><em>Thank you so much."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The island in question contains its own Edo-inspired 'Red Light District', while certain shops sell nothing but schoolgirl-inspired cosplay and toys. <em>Yikes</em>. Looking at the video above, more subtle hints towards the island's 'adult only' theme include magazine and posters littering the floor, some labelled 'DVD' in pink font.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Blathers' museum-inspired room has an entire corner dedicated to pictures of Isabelle, with seemingly used tissues strewn about the place. Must have a runny nose, huh?</p>
<p>It's interesting that Nintendo took so long to get rid of it in this case, but alas, it's gone. No doubt we'll see similar attempts in the future, but we reckon Nintendo will be pretty vigilant if it happens again.</p>

<p>Bungie’s release date trailer for Marathon has leaked online, revealing a March 5, 2026, release. </p>



<p>After delays, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-artist-satisfied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism controversy</a>, and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">art director leaving</a> just months before the release window, it seems Bungie is finally set on the Marathon release date. As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> by Sony back in November 2025, Marathon will release this year in March, as a new leaked trailer confirms. </p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-releases-on-march-5-leaked-trailer-confirms">Marathon Releases on March 5, Leaked Trailer Confirms</h2>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qgvybm/marathon_release_date_trailer_leaked_5th_march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, Marathon’s release date trailer has leaked online, revealing new details. The trailer starts like most of their newer videos, blending gameplay and cinematics. Towards the end of the video, we finally get a release date revealed: “Coming March 5, 2026.” Pre-orders will begin when the trailer is officially dropped, and the Deluxe Edition will feature a ‘Midnight Decay Bundle’, two weapon skins, and additional content. </p>



<p>Leading up to the release, Marathon developers have provided extensive details about the upcoming Extraction Shooter. We already know about the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-pricing-battle-pass-details-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing, battle pass details, improvements</a> across the board, and more. Additionally, just last week, we received details on the archetypes, abilities, and customisations you can do with Marathon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-details-on-runner-shells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Runner Shells</a>. There is no confirmation yet on when the trailer for the release date will officially drop. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Marathon is an upcoming FPS, PvPvE survival extraction title from Bungie, which takes players to the world of Tau Ceti IV, where you get to play as bio-cybernetic Runners. The goals are to scavenge zones for valuable items while indulging in fast-paced PvPvE combat. The game also focuses heavily on customisation, allowing players to craft unique playstyles using existing runner shells. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Former Assassin’s Creed Boss is Suing Ubisoft for $1.3 Million in Damages]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-million-damages/</link>
            <guid>1409779</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Former Assassin’s Creed boss Marc-Alexis Côté has filed a claim with the Superior Court of Quebec for $1.3 million in damages against Ubisoft.</p>



<p>The file comes months after Ubisoft announced that Marc-Alexis Côté <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/head-of-assassins-creed-has-left-ubisoft-after-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left the company voluntarily</a>, a claim which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Côté later denied</a>, stating that he was “asked to step aside” from the company. </p>







<p>In a lengthy LinkedIn post, Côté said, “Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it. The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.”</p>



<p>He later continued, “But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.”</p>



<p>The new report from <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CBC Radio Canada</a> states that Côté is now taking Ubisoft to court, claiming $1.3 million in severance pay and moral damages.</p>



<p>According to the report, Côté was told during a management meeting in late summer 2025 that Ubisoft’s new subsidiary with Tencent was looking to find a “Head of Franchise”, which was a position not offered to Côté. Instead, Côté was offered the position of “Dead of Production”, which would have seen him reporting to someone else.</p>



<p>The lawsuit states that in September, the position to lead a “Creative House” with abstract outlines was offered. After lengthy negotiations, Ubisoft reportedly asked him to make a decision on the changes, to which Côté formally demanded that the company pay him severance.</p>







<p>In response, Ubisoft reportedly told him not to show up for work as planned on October 13, and to continue his reflection period until the company responds to its formal notice. The next day, Ubisoft announced via a press release and internal emails that Côté was leaving his position voluntarily to&nbsp;<q>explore new opportunities</q>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, but did not receive one prior to publication. Should one be received, we will update the article.</p>

            <p>We've been greatly enjoying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout Season 2</a> so far, and it seems that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">most fans are</a> too, but the change from binge-based season drop to a weekly release schedule has had an impact on the show's ratings. Don't worry, though: this stumble isn't in danger of disappointing the powers that be.</p>
<p>On 15th January, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/streaming-ratings-dec-15-21-2025-1236475572/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> shared the latest report from Nielsen, a leader in media valuation and data analytics. As expected, the debut of Fallout's second season was a sizable one, with the show accumulating 794 million viewing minutes through the week of December 15th through 21st. At the same time, it was well below Season 1's appeal, which earned 2.9 billion for its opening week in April 2024. That one was Amazon's best-ever premiere on the platform.</p>
<p>Those keeping track of what goes down on the TV front might've already noticed what's going on here. Since Nielsen traditionally tracks viewership in minutes watched across devices that send the needed data, the company's numbers never give us the complete picture. It only tracks TV sets, but it's always been a good way to measure the temperature and streaming habits of the populace. The more important bit of info here is that 794 million minutes for a single episode versus 2.9 billion for an entire season that could be binged on Day One is very impressive all the same.</p>
<p>Moreover, we must take into account many viewers who have grown accustomed to Netflix's binge release strategy are just waiting for the entire thing to be available. All in all, Fallout is doing remarkably well still, and nabbed the 7th spot on <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/data-center/top-ten/">Nielsen's ranking</a> for the December 15th through 21st period. During that week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stranger-things-final-battle-was-directly-influenced-by-baldurs-gate-3">Stranger Things</a> reigned supreme in the lead-up to its series finale with a massive 2.37 billion minutes watched.</p><p>As it stands, Fallout Season 3 is a go and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">already targeting a production start date for 1st May, 2026</a>. The Prime Video series is among the very few big-IP shows that are sticking to tight pre-production and filming schedules, with S2 arriving only a year and a half after S1. For comparison, we're still waiting for <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-ahsoka">Star Wars: Ahsoka</a>'s second season on Disney Plus; the first set of episodes came out during summer 2023.</p>
<p>Are you watching each episode of Fallout Season 2 weekly, or are you waiting to make your trip to New Vegas until it's all loaded up?</p>
