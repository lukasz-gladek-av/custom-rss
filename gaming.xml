            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, someone leaked what they claim to be new <em>Fallout</em>-themed merchandise that will reportedly soon be available on Target shelves around the United States. But fans think that at least one piece of leaked merch is using AI-generated imagery, aka slop.</p> <p>On September 2, a user on the <em>Fallout</em> subreddit posted a short video of them seemingly pulling out pieces of not-yet-announced <em>Fallout</em>-themed merchandise in a warehouse-like setting. The user claimed that the <em>Fallout</em> goodies would be sold at Target starting in November or December. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1n6x4fy/the_new_items_at_target/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php">The original video has since been deleted</a>, possibly because the original poster was nervous about getting in trouble with Target. But <em>Kotaku</em> viewed the video before it was deleted, and the merch seemed real. And one item, <em>Fallout</em>-themed hot sauce, appears to be shipping to stores in a box that has AI-generated imagery on the back.</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout/generative-ai-merch">As spotted by <em>PCGamesn</em>,</a> users in the comments below the leaked Target video began focusing on peculiarities in the hot sauce artwork. In the image, a couple is seen sitting at a table eating a Deathclaw’s hand. But the man can be seen using his knife and fork to cut up a napkin. The fork looks oddly shaped, too. Others pointed out that the Deathclaw hand seems to be floating oddly above the plate. The man’s right hand also seems off. All of this would lead one to believe this new <em>Fallout</em> merch is using AI-generated artwork.</p>

   <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted Bethesda about the leaked art, but didn’t receive a response before publication. It should be noted that Bethesda likely contracted this artwork out via another company and didn’t create the image.</p> <p>The use of <a href="https://kotaku.com/hearthstone-diablo-ai-art-blizzard-microsoft-1851787162">AI-generated slop</a> has become <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-xbox-ai-generated-1851128191">more and more prevalent in marketing and advertising</a> over the last two years as companies desperate to make the line go up cut corners to prove to investors they aren’t being left behind as AI-powered tech continues to grow. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-amazon-ai-art-bethesda-strike-release-date-1850772308">In fact, this isn’t even the first time an official <em>Fallout</em>-related artwork</a> has been scrutinized by fans for some strange, AI-like oddities. Will a man using a terrible fork to cut up a napkin stop collectors and fans from buying this piece of <em>Fallout</em> merch? Probably not, which is what companies are counting on.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Trump Tariffs Are Disrupting Planner Season]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/trump-tariffs-disrupt-hobonichi-planner-season</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trump-tariffs-are-disrupting-planner-season.1288227/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Planner season is not synonymous with the New Year. That’s much too late for planner people to be figuring out what systems to use in the forthcoming year. Planner season begins in late summer and culminates with the biggest event of the year for the journaling community—the day Hobonichi planners go on sale at 10 p.m. EST on August 31. I look forward to it each year, as Hobonichi generates hype around the niche holiday by unveiling its new covers and books in the lead-up to its big release. Other planner brands start to announce their lineups around this time, too. This year is different.</p><p><a href="https://www.404media.co/trump-tariffs-cause-chaos-on-ebay-having-a-hobby-is-now-a-logistical-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As 404 Media wrote in August</a>, the Trump administration’s tariff plans have made having hobbies both chaotic and expensive. That includes stationary and planners—the Hobonichi launch for U.S. customers was obscured by the dark cloud of tariffs. Stationary, like other goods produced outside the U.S., are impacted by both Trump’s sweeping tariffs and the end of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/28/nx-s1-5519361/de-minimis-rule-tariffs-consumers-imports-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a tax loophole that exempted packages $800 or less from import fees</a>. The official Hobonichi store ships its stationary goods directly from Japan to customers in the U.S.; it’s always been kind of expensive to do so, but this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/769427/trump-tariffs-online-shopping-shipping-suspended-de-minimis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the added fees tipped the scales for some people</a>—including me.</p><p>Created by Shigesato Itoi (who started the <em>Mother </em>series), Hobonichi planners are cult favorites among stationary enthusiasts; the bible-thin paper is perfect for fountain pens but keeps the robust planner fairly compact. There’s a lot of room for creativity, which is the planner’s biggest strength: People can tweak their setups to make the planner work for all sorts of scheduling and planning.</p><p>There are several different books and sizes to choose from, but each year, Hobonichi debuts a new set of accessories and covers to go alongside the planner. That’s where a lot of the excitement comes in—the covers are works of art on their own, and the limited edition nature of the release oozes FOMO. Hobonichi diehards, like me, line up in virtual queues every year for the chance to snag some prized cover that’ll perfect our planner setups for the following year. Planner season has its faults—that aforementioned FOMO leads to undeniable overconsumption of stationary goods that may even go unused—but it’s been, largely, a brief moment of joy where I can connect with fellow paper nerds to speak passionately about the superiority of Tomoe River paper, which Hobonichi uses.</p><p>I’ve ordered from Hobonichi for the past several years, but the last order I can find in my email is from 2021, where I ordered two Hobonichi planners (a Weeks planner to carry around with me, and an A6-sized book to keep at my desk) and a couple other accessories. The total was roughly $80, plus an additional $25 for shipping, which brought the total to $109. This year, I added a single A6-sized planner with an exceptionally cute Tamagotchi-themed cover to my cart. The planner, called a Techo, retails at Hobonichi for $54. The shipping—which includes “prepayment of duties and taxes”—added $44 to that total, plus an additional $8.10 for “duties and fees,” then the sales tax of $6.22, bringing the total price of a single planner to $112.32. I tried to see if things were any better with a smaller Weeks planner, which is $29 at the Hobonichi store. That brought my total to under $100, but the shipping was more than the cost of the planner itself. I just can’t justify it.</p><p>It’s hard to even tell if extra levies will be piled on when something gets into the U.S., too. The global nature of the stationary business, with products made in China, Japan, and assembled elsewhere, means that tariffs apply in complicated ways. Japan’s reciprocal tariff rate is 15%. China’s remains ever in flux, currently at 30%. There’s a lot going on.</p><p>The good news is that there are U.S. based retailers that are selling Hobonichi products. But because these retailers need to recoup the costs of the tariffs <em>they</em> spent to bring over the goods, the prices are indeed higher than at the Hobonichi store: The same Hobonichi that costs $54 at the official store <a href="https://lighthousepaper.com/products/hobonichi-techo-2026-original-book-cover-a6-tamagotchi-tamagotchi-techo-discovered-jan-mon-start?variant=50971041169540&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoqOtPYP26HbBoe92lO_PKQTaA1Fz3gKwAWiExErBGK7ITJIETyeSfU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">costs $77 elsewhere</a>.</p><p>Another side effect of the tariffs is that the removal of the de minimis exemption and additional tariffs means that importing goods is simply more complicated. There’s more paperwork and all packages have to clear customs, which is causing delays. At least two small businesses planning in-person Hobonichi events, <a href="https://www.thepapermouse.com/collections/hobonichi?srsltid=AfmBOoq2HusVo7nStMY7wyz2fCLO8tHoUbJW76KYjlKJGcLQFJRiqJxm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Paper Mouse in Massachusetts</a> and <a href="https://yosekastationery.com/blogs/news/hobonichi-pop-up-canceled?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yoseka Stationary in New York</a>, had to cancel events when their Hobonichi shipments got caught up in customs.</p><p>I ultimately decided not to purchase a Hobonichi planner for 2026. Should that decision hold, it’ll be the first time in nearly five years that I don’t plan my days, weeks, and months in the planner system. I might change my mind if I can find a reasonable price. I’m holding out for an update on another planner system I like, Take A Note, to announce its 2026 planners—<a href="https://take-a-note.store/en-us/blogs/news/2026-take-a-note-release-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something scheduled for mid to late September</a>. (Take A Note ships from Taiwan, using Japanese paper, so I’m certain it’ll be impacted by tariffs, too.)&nbsp;</p><p>For now, I’m simply not buying stationary. The thing about this hobby is that there is so much to consume, so many different colorful and shiny things that always feel absolutely necessary; I’ve collected a lot of it. I’m using this tariff chaos to dig into my already too big supply and use up the stash. I’m plucking out stickers I forgot I had to slap into half-filled notebooks; re-wetting the dried up paints I left sitting too long in my closet; and inking up the pens I’ve once dubbed too nice to use. That’s the point of it all, no? The hobby inspires in me the desire to hoard, but I’d like to change that, so when I do, indeed, get my 2026 planner, I’ll appreciate it even more.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-king-is-watching-pc-steam-review-impressions"><h3>The King Is Watching: It’s A Very Good Video Game</h3></a><p>'There's no wrong way to play this!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/another-state-of-play-is-coming-this-month-and-it-might-feature-insomniac%E2%80%99s-wolverine-%E2%80%93-rumor.1288215/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At the time of this writing, there's already been a PlayStation State of Play for September 2025. It was entirely focused on one game, though, <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">007 First Light,</a> and wasn't exactly what we had in mind when rumors of a September State of Play <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/">cropped up just weeks ago</a>. However, a new report, this time from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-trailer/">Insider-Gaming</a>, claims that there is still another presentation coming later this month that might even feature Marvel's Wolverine from Insomniac. </p>



<p>The long and short of the report is that sources Insider-Gaming spoke to claim that there's another event coming before the month is over, and that will "<em>almost certainly</em>" feature Marvel's Wolverine, which we've not seen hair-nor-adamantium-claw of since its initial <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniacs-wolverine-announced-for-playstation-5/">reveal and announcement in 2021</a>.</p>



<p>There's been plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-venom-insomniac/">leaked information</a> following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/">ransomware attack</a> that Insomniac suffered in 2023, but that information becoming public could have been the key reason for Insomniac changing its plans, so it's good to remember that nothing we saw from those leaks was set in stone.</p>



<p>And while there have been previous claims that Marvel's Wolverine would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-might-be-shown-soon-according-to-leaker/">shown in the near future</a>, which proved to be wrong, it's worth considering that beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-already-gone-gold/">Ghost of Yotei</a> this October, we don't have a strong picture of what PlayStation Studios has coming down the pipeline.</p>



<p>That's not to say that PlayStation and Insomniac have been sitting on Marvel's Wolverine for so long that it'll be ready to go before 2025 is over, just that it wouldn't be crazy to consider that Insomniac is probably getting close to finishing it, now that we're at least four years into the game's development.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this is just a rumor, so take it with an appropriate amount of salt. Hopefully, though, for Insomniac fans who would love to see the studio take on other comic book characters that don't swing from webs, we are only weeks away from hearing more about Marvel's tragic self-healing, adamantium-filled Canadian.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-james-bond-voice-actor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/who-is-james-bond-in-007-first-light-james-bond-voice-actor-explained.1288206/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The voice actor for James Bond in 007 First Light has been revealed after a long bout of speculation and fan casting.</p>



<p>With IO Interactive taking over and making a story for a James Bond just getting started in the spy business, many have been wondering who would be taking on the role with this young Bond, now set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Not only have we <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-reveal-how-hitman-has-influenced-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gotten a good look at gameplay</a>, but the voice behind the spy himself has been announced. Here is who the voice actor is for James Bond in 007 First Light.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-james-bond-in-007-first-light">Who Voices James Bond in 007 First Light?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Paramount</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The voice actor for James Bond in 007 First Light is Patrick Gibson.</strong></p>



<p>He is a 30-year-old Irish actor who was born in London. While not the most recognizable name you will hear, Gibson is probably best known for playing a younger Dexter Morgan in <em>Dexter: Original Sin</em>, which is a prequel series. Having him as a just-starting-out James Bond kind of fits in perfectly.</p>



<p>For more background on Patrick Gibson, you can check out <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2617600/?ref_=mv_close" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his IMDb page</a> to see if there are any other shows or movies you can recognize him in, but we are unaware of the other projects he’s been in. With all of that being said, 007 First Light is the first video game acting role that Gibson has had. So far, his voice acting seems to be done pretty well, and we think he sounds like he fits the part perfectly.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-007-first-light-s-james-bond-canon">Is 007 First Light’s James Bond Canon?</h2>



<p><strong>No, the James Bond in 007 First Light is not canon to the overall James Bond story.</strong></p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/technology/gaming/007-first-light-isnt-canon-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">speaking with Radio Times</a>, Jonathan Lacaille, the franchise director at IO Interactive, said that while a lot of what is included in the game, including the scar on James’ cheek, is from the novels, the things that happen here are not connected to what is currently in production with Amazon MGM, instead, it will “live alongside” those movies.</p>



<p>While Patrick Gibson’s James Bond isn’t considered canon, it’s still a really big name for him to be attached to. When you think of 007, you are usually linking some very big-time Hollywood actors to the role. Gibson can now say he stands alongside names like Daniel Craig, Pierce Brosnan, and Sean Connery, while delivering a very unique take on the character we have not seen before.</p>



<hr>



<p>Do you think Patrick Gibson is a good choice to portray a younger James Bond? Is 007 First Light doing enough to stand out in your mind as a must-play game? Let us know in the comments or on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

                <p>After being announced six years ago, multiple delays, and years of anticipation, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-and-time/1100-6534447/" data-ref-id="1100-6534447">releasing on September 4</a>. Now, on Silksong eve, a resurfaced Reddit thread about the original Hollow Knight is a great reminder of just how far the franchise and developer Team Cherry have come in the past decade.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3tj0p4/comment/cx6lr3t/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thread</a>, posted by Reddit user crazy_loop 10 years ago, includes a trailer for the original Hollow Knight prior to its release in 2017 and features a heartfelt message.</p><p dir="ltr">"Last year my best friend quit his full-time job to chase his dream and make a fully fledged video game," the post reads. "Today he just released a trailer and it looks beyond amazing."</p><p dir="ltr">In 2025, a new trailer for Hollow Knight: Silksong would have set the internet ablaze, but back in 2015, the response was more muted, to say the least. Many players seemed indifferent.</p><p dir="ltr">The most upvoted response to the post stated that the game is probably "a fine game, but the market is currently saturated with side-scrolling platformers so I feel his game may not do as good as he hopes." Another user said the game looked fun, but they "hate to be raining on a parade" and continued that Hollow Knight looked to lack the "innovation and individuality of something like Limbo." They continued: "probably not going to be huge." Yet another said the game looked "cliche."</p><p dir="ltr">What a difference a decade makes. There were definitely people in the Reddit thread who disagreed that the market was "saturated" with similar games and recognized that Hollow Knight could be something special. Some even expressed interest in buying it based on the trailer. Overall, however, the general consensus seemed to be that Hollow Knight looked fine, but might have a hard time finding an audience. Some said it might get a decent sales boost from appearing on Reddit's front page.</p><p dir="ltr">Flash forward to now, and Hollow Knight has sold more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">15 million copies</a>, is breaking its all-time <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-just-hit-an-all-time-peak-on-steam-after-silksong-release-date-reveal/1100-6534206/" data-ref-id="1100-6534206">concurrent player peak on Steam</a>, and its sequel is such a big deal that numerous other games have announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">delays in order to avoid Silksong's release</a>. Not bad for the sequel to a small indie game that, judging from this Reddit thread, many expected to just be another drop in the metroidvania bucket.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite Hollow Knight's huge success and wild anticipation from fans, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-is-cheaper-than-you-might-have-guessed/1100-6534401/" data-ref-id="1100-6534401">Hollow Knight: Silksong will only cost $20</a>, $5 more than the original. Silksong will launch on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and Switch 2 (with a free upgrade for Switch 2 owners). It will also be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-september-headlined-by-hollow-knight-silksong-and-i-am-your-beast/2900-6974/" data-ref-id="2900-6974">day one Game Pass release</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Season four of Marvel Rivals is officially known as The Heart of the Dragon, and it's introducing one character fans of the (super) hero shooter have been hoping for: Daredevil. In the cinematic reveal trailer, he faces off against Angela, the long lost sister of Thor and the other character joining the roster. You can check it out for yourself below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67FVMNGMFXU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67FVMNGMFXU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The trailer shows the two characters seemingly acting as representatives of Heaven and Hell. This is a particularly interesting take on Daredevil, as his stories, especially in the recent live-action series, traditionally focus on street-level crime with minimal super powers. In this trailer, he also seems to unleash energized punches and a powerful devil form. It's hard to tell what his canonical abilities are, versus what are stylized visuals for the animation, but Marvel Rivals sometimes provides original takes on characters and their origin stories, so it could go either way.</p><p>"The Timestream Entanglement has drawn the Seven Capitals together, forming the Heart of Heaven. After Knull’s fall, Hela is imprisoned in the An'Hay-Zhidi, where Dizang—Devil of the Eighth City—dares her to atone for her sins," the video description reads. "But Angela will not forgive her betrayal. She arrives in the Heart of Heaven demanding Hela be handed over, yet its guardian refuses to surrender someone under his protection. Justice will be served and a debt will be paid."</p><p>In a following, more detailed video, the developers at Netease confirm that Angela would be a vanguard, using her ichor to form weapons and a shield. She'll also get a team-up with Thor, who will be able to throw a thunder spear which he can jump to, dealing damage upon landing. Other team ups are adjusting as well: Magik and Black Panther are losing theirs, but Magik is getting a tether ability as a part of the team up between Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange, while Black Panther is joining the team up between Namor and Hulk.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRUcdKzw6nQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRUcdKzw6nQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Season four will also bring other, more minor new features. A new arcade hub will hold new and returning modes like big brain blast, clone rumble, conquest, conquest (annihilation), and doom match, along with free fight, which removes limits on duplicate heroes. You'll also be able to mark your preferred heroes into a favorites tab, other players can see custom ultimate effects, and, hilariously, they're adding a slow walk setting to the PC version of the game because they "heard how much you like slow walking for superhero aura farming."</p><p>Lastly, they announced that rank placement matches are coming to the game eventually, but won't be ready in time for season four. Players have expressed frustration that each season resets them so far down the competitive ladder that it's frustrating to have to fight through lower ranks with less skilled players to get back to their standard challenge, and placement matches are a possible solution to that.</p><p>Angela and the rest of Marvel Rivals season four come to the game for free a week from Friday, on September 12.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/03/marvel-rivals-season-four-adds-daredevil-and-angela-to-the-roster-launches-next-week]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-steam-console-steam-frame-trademark-rumor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-trademark-from-valve-might%E2%80%99ve-just-revealed-the-name-of-its-rumored-steam-console.1288176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Before the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Steam Deck</a>, it seemed like Valve had decided to stay out of the hardware business, settling instead for its pretty sizable chunk of the PC games market. Since the success of the Steam Deck and the rise of other handheld PCs, however, the thought of a Steam Console doesn't feel as far-fetched, and we've already heard rumors about an <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-steam-console-powered-by-rdna-4-might-be-in-the-works-at-valve/">RDNA 4-powered device</a> in the works. Now, we might've just learned what Valve will be calling it: Steam Frame.</p>



<p>That's if the recently discovered trademarks for <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/99370857">computer hardware</a> and a <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/99370861">computer game console</a> are correct indications of the device's official name. The trademarks were spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n7ojk1/steam_frame_trademarked_by_valve_computer_hardware/">Reddit</a> and were filed by Valve as of yesterday, September 2, 2025.</p>



<p>Both are trademarks for the name 'Steam Frame,' which is at least a tad bit more creative than Steam Console, or Valve's previous attempt at this, which was the Steam Machine. Though it's still worth taking with a certain amount of salt, considering the fact that there's been no official confirmation from Valve that it is working on a new console.</p>



<p>Though, it is exciting to consider what Valve's approach to making a console would look like now that the company has found major success with the Steam Deck. If it's able to strike a balance between power, pricing, and most importantly, upgradability, like being able to swap out or add components in a simple way, then Valve could have a real game-changing device on its hands.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-qa-homesteads-new-elite-specs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-q-a-on-homesteads-and-the-new-elite-specs.1288173/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Gamescom 2025, I visited ArenaNet at the NCSoft booth to preview two of the biggest features of the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-next-expansion-october-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity expansion</a>: the improvements to the Homesteads feature and the new Elite Specializations. What follows is an edited version of my chat with Sarah Davies (Senior Gameplay Engineer) and Cal Cohen (Lead Competitive Designer). As a reminder, the expansion will be released on October 28 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3845870/Guild_Wars_2_Visions_of_Eternity_Expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for PC</a>.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>We created the decoration layout system. If you go into the menu and open the save load layouts, you get the decoration layouts UI. Now we can save your decor as a layout, so that way players can just save a layout from where they were before, switch over to this map, and load it up here. Something to note is that all of these layouts are stored locally on your computer. That means they won't sync between devices, but it does let you save a lot more because we have to save all the data for all the decorations. So this will let you save more, and also because they're just files on your computer, you can share them around.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Sarah, what's coming to Homesteads with Visions of Eternity?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sarah Davies:</strong> As you know, we added customized player housing <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-expansion-is-out-august-20-adds-new-raid-player-housing-and-land-spears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the Janthir Wilds expansion</a>. That's our Homestead feature. But with Visions of Eternity, we will be adding a new map alongside some new improvements to the feature. You'll still need expansion 6 to access the new map, but if you have both expansions, you can switch to the new plot by talking to an NPC, storing your decorations, and swapping over.</p>



<p>The default house that players will start with is just like housing built into the side of the ship. But let's talk about the map first. The new Homesteads map was a private island. The main feature of the island is this ley line volcano. I don't know if it's a volcano or a mountain, because it's like magic instead of lava, but I've been calling it a volcano. We've got a ley line that can take us around the map. We've got some fishing nodes dotted around the water just because you're going to have a relaxing private island, so you want to be able to fish. We got some waterfalls and pools. This is gonna take us around the back side of the volcano through the one rock. You can see that some of the magic is seeping out of the volcano, and then if we follow the ley line all the way up, we can get to the top.</p>



<p>There's some flowing fungus and next to it a nice starry pool and some really cool crystals. I think this place is beautiful, and I'm really looking forward to decorating in here. And then we got a bubbling of water over here. It has a low gravity effect to add to that otherworldly feel. Inside the water, you see it goes down to the ocean. There's also the tail of a Leviathan going away. You can't go down to see the leviathan, but he lurks down there as a little friend.</p>



<p>Outside of the volcano, there's some more of that water with the low gravity effect. In fact, this is where the wood nodes are. Inside the volcano, you have the ore nodes, while the wood nodes are back here. This is where the Harvest Collection Box will be - that's the auto-harvesting stuff we added to the previous map; we're bringing all those boxes back into this map.</p>



<p>I'm going to change the map to nighttime. At night, you can really see the magic emanating from this volcano. I'm really happy with what our artists have done in this map. I think it's really gorgeous. But now I'm going to send it back to daytime so I can show off the house. Like I said before, this house is the default one that players will get. One piece of feedback we got from Janthir Wilds is that some players wanted to be able to completely remove the bare house, so with Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity, we made this house entirely out of decorations. If they want, they'll be able to completely remove all these walls and roofs and everything and start from scratch if they want. We've also furnished the inside a little bit more than last time, so you can see you have a dining area here. The balcony has a cool view; you see the skiff dock is back as well. On the third floor, this is your bedroom with a magnificent view.</p>



<p>Anyway, there's also a restore feature that just restores your Homestead to default. One of the exciting changes we've made is adding a new modification skill. Normally, when you edited a decoration, you'd press confirm modification, and this would move the decoration to the new spot you set it to. </p>



<p>But now we've added 'place duplicate'. If you have another such decoration in your storage and use it, it will place a new one where you've moved it. This makes making fences or walls a lot faster because you don't have to realign them. You don't have to place the position each time manually.</p>



<p>You might have noticed we had to pack up all the decorations when we moved to the map. There is an option to preview this without having to get rid of your decorations, but most players, I feel, are going to want to decorate a new map if they're into decorating. As we were developing this, we realized that by packing up the decorations and asking players to get rid of their old work to move to the new map, we were giving players this really tough decision of, do I erase all this hard work that I've done before and not go and play in the new map, or do I go to the new map and have to give up all my old work?</p>



<p>To address this, we created the decoration layout system for Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity. If you go into the menu and open the save load layouts, you get the decoration layouts UI. Now we can save your decor as a layout, so that way players can just save a layout from where they were before, switch over to this map, and load it up here. Something to note is that all of these layouts are stored locally on your computer. That means they won't sync between devices, but it does let you save a lot more because we have to save all the data for all the decorations. So this will let you save more, and also because they're just files on your computer, you can share them around. If I actually go to the folder where they exist, you can see that these layouts are just XML files; they have the position, rotation, and scale right in there. Because they're just files, you can create a new one. Really quickly, I load this, you can see I have one layout that has like a tower, a ship where I reuse some of the walls to make like dilapidated housing, and then I have another layout that is just like a bunch of plants. But because these layouts are just files on your computer, you can easily create new ones. </p>



<figure><figcaption><em>If you are uncomfortable editing your files, like some users may be, we do have an in-game method for doing it with this party layout saving. If you are the owner of a Homestead and you invite your friends in as guests and you enable this, your guests will be able to open the UI. It won't have the load button, but they'll be able to save your loadout from the Homestead to their own computer, and then they can go to their Homestead and load it.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Could advanced users directly modify these XML files? Although I guess that would just be more complicated than doing it in the game.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sarah Davies:</strong> That's right. But it does let you do things like copy-paste, so if I load this up now, you can see those two layouts are now put together, which lets you build modularly. The other nice part is they're shareable, so you can share them across the NA/EU divide. If you are uncomfortable editing your files, like some users may be, we do have an in-game method for doing it with this party layout saving. If you are the owner of a Homestead and you invite your friends in as guests and you enable this, your guests will be able to open the UI. It won't have the load button, but they'll be able to save your loadout from the Homestead to their own computer, and then they can go to their Homestead and load it.</p>



<p>If they tried to build that same layout and they don't have everything built or they don't have all the decorations, the game will let them know, and only the decorations they have are going to be placed. But they can click on this and they'll get a list of all the decorations missing. This will let them work towards having the full layout built in their Homestead, and you can load it anyway and it'll load as many of the decorations that you do have.</p>



<p><strong>You could add them later, I guess.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sarah Davies:</strong> Yes. You'll have to reload the template—we don't have a system for putting them in the missing places—but as you saw, loading the templates is really quick.</p>



<p>I think that the layout feature is going to really allow for a lot more creativity. Even if you're not sharing layouts with others, you still get to make layouts and then easily switch between them. Like, have a Halloween one, save that and then make a completely different one about Winter's Day, and just switch between them.</p>



<p>Even if you don't own Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity, you're getting the improvements coming to the Homestead feature, so you'll still get the layouts even if you don't get the new expansion.</p>



<p><strong>What kind of feedback did you incorporate from Janthir Wilds regarding the Homestead feature?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sarah Davies:</strong> Like I mentioned, one of the big things was the default house not being able to be removed, so we made sure that this time the whole structure is made out of decorations and that players will be able to use it if they want but also delete it if they don't like it. Another piece of feedback is for making new structures.</p>



<p>There were a lot of decorating pieces, but we didn't have a lot of walls or roofs for decorating, so players could decorate the inside of their house, but they had to get really creative to make structures outside on the land. The new house also addresses that by adding new wall pieces and roof pieces that players will be able to use to decorate with. We're very excited to see that and also we're very excited about the layouts being shareable because we've seen, especially on like Reddit, where people are making these incredible Homesteads, but then people are having trouble visiting them because you have to coordinate with the person. We're thinking that layouts will address a lot of these things that we're seeing where players look at the Homesteads, but then aren't able to go see them in the game or replicate them on their own.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>We have numbers on exactly how much time players are spending in their Homesteads. It's enough that we were given the green light to continue improving the feature, so that's very exciting. But hopefully, now that we're adding more ways to share Homestead creations, people will be even more excited.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>On that note, speaking about other MMOs with the housing feature, Elder Scrolls Online recently added the so-called Home Tours, a way to make it more accessible for players to visit another's house. Are you maybe thinking about adding something like that, like a list where people can put their Homestead on a list and others can just visit</strong>?</p>



<p><strong>Sarah Davies:</strong> We haven't done anything with that for Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity, but we definitely made sure when we were designing Homesteads that we're not closing the door on anything like that. I know that specifically for visiting other houses, especially if the owner is not online, you still need to make sure that we have the data available so that if we do implement something like that, we can make sure to get the data about the decoration placements to the player who would be visiting. Part of the initial design of Homesteads, even in Janthir Wilds, is making sure that we were saving the data in a place where we could access it, even if the owner was offline.</p>



<p>We do keep in mind some of the things that we may want to do moving forward and make sure that we're not putting ourselves in a hole where we can't do this now because we designed it differently.</p>



<p><strong>If you want to decorate something, you'll probably also want to show it to someone, right? Anyway, is the feature popular among Guild Wars 2 players?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sarah Davies:</strong> Yeah, it kind of depends on the players. We definitely get players who spend a lot of time in Homesteads and really like to invite people over to show it off. We definitely see people who will be in the LFG really just showing off their Homesteads.</p>



<p>We have numbers on exactly how much time players are spending in their Homesteads. It's enough that we were given the green light to continue improving the feature, so that's very exciting. But hopefully, now that we're adding more ways to share Homestead creations, people will be even more excited.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The two primary rules that we're expecting for the Luminary are the DPS build and a supportive boon healer role. That will come from the Hammer with the damage and the Staff with the support elements; you can pick and choose the utility skills. Some of the utilities of the Luminary are going to be good for that, but obviously, the core Guardian already has access to a lot of damage-dealing utility skills or supportive utility, so it should be pretty flexible. There's a trait that grants Alacrity to your allies.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cal, can you talk me through a couple of the new Elite Specs coming in Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity? Let's say the Luminary and Paragon.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> Sure. The Guardian's new Elite Specialization is the Luminary, and the idea is that it's kind of Charr-inspired. Various areas of the Tyrian Alliance inspire many of the Guild Wars 2 elite specs, so we have some Elonian inspiration, some Canthan inspiration, and other races. As I said, the Luminary is inspired by the Charr, and that shows right away with this kind of brazier of light and flame energy. It's kind of the power source of the Luminary. The idea is that this specialization is able to harness some additional weapons of both light and flame. The Radiance Shroud is kind of a take on the Necromancer's Death Shroud. This tends to be more like the Guardian's Light Shroud as a counterpoint to that.</p>



<p>There's a few different skills available. Each of these weapons you equip has an initial attack that happens and then flows into a follow-up attack. The Hammer is intended to be more of this power damage, more aggressive, crowd-controlling, damage-dealing weapon, whereas the Staff is gonna be a lot more supportive, focused on healing allies and providing them with some boons, stuff like that. You also have the Sword, which is more mobility-focused. It deals some damage but is a bit more utility-focused. Lastly, the Shield is obviously intended to be more of a personal defense build with a bit of ally support and crowd control.</p>



<p>One thing that's happening as we're equipping these weapons is we're getting this buff from one of the traits that's going to be a character-defining buff. When you equip the Hammer, you get bonus strike damage for your Luminary. When you equip the Staff, you get increased healing. You get a movement speed boon with the Sword and damage reduction with the Shield. And as you exit the Shroud, you're gonna maintain this buff for a little bit of extra time. It's almost like a stance, where you can get that bonus damage stance and then translate that into the rest of your weapons. That's really the gist of the Shroud. There's no energy-gaining resource like the Necromancer has, no life force or anything like that.</p>



<p>You can just go in when the skill is not on recharge, and then, depending on how many of these skills you use, it will set the recharge of the Shroud. If I use three different skills, that's gonna put me on a 15-second cooldown, but I could go in and use a single skill, which would trigger a much shorter cooldown.</p>



<p>So, if you know what you're doing, there are opportunities to be a bit more flexible. Some of these skills are a little bit more situational, so you could go in and just use the one that you need, and then you'll have them more readily available as opposed to a typical Shroud.</p>



<p><strong>Is the Luminary designed to allow a variety of roles (DPS, tank, support, etc.)?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> Definitely. The two primary rules that we're expecting are the DPS build and a supportive boon healer role. That will come from the Hammer with the damage and the Staff with the support elements; you can pick and choose the utility skills. Some of the utilities of the Luminary are going to be good for that, but obviously, the core Guardian already has access to a lot of damage-dealing utility skills or supportive utility, so it should be pretty flexible. There's a trait that grants Alacrity to your allies.</p>



<p><strong>Let's switch to the Paragon now.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> The Paragon is a support-focused Warrior. You still have your burst skill. I have Flurry for having a sword equipped. But then you also gain access to three new Chants, which are drawing some inspiration from the Guild Wars 1 Paragon as well. The idea is that you can have one active at any given time, and this is dependent on a mechanics called Motivation. There are some traits that give you Motivation and you also gain Motivation as you use burst skills, or when you use a Chant, and then that motivation is going to start being consumed to power these Chants. Here's Chant of Action, which is the more offensively focused one, giving out Might and Fury boons to your allies. Based off the amount of Motivation you have, that impacts how many of these boons you get per tick. With the first tier of Motivation you're getting one Might stack, the next tier up you're giving two Might and Fury at the same time, and the final tier gives three Might and Fury. Each of these also have an initial component as well. The first time I activate this, I am giving some Might and Fury.</p>



<p>Because you gain Motivation as you use all of the different Chants, you can fire off a few Chants back to back, and then the chant that you end on, you'll have the largest Motivation pool that starts pulsing the most powerful version of that effect to your allies. Obviously, this one was more offense-focused. Chant of Recuperation is more defensively focused, giving that barrier to allies initially and then pulsing a bit of healing and resistance potentially if you do get that highest threshold, and then Chant of Freedom provides Swiftness at the bottom tier, then also Resolution and Stability being added. There are a few different costs for these different Motivation levels. We're looking at the PvP balance right now because we're in the PvP lobby, but the PvE balance is a little bit different as well, where some of these costs might be a little bit lower and the boon durations will be higher just to really enable the players to kind of do what they want.</p>



<p>Obviously, Adrenaline is pretty valuable to this elite spec. You'll want to build up a big pool of Adrenaline to use a lot of these Chants back to back in order to build up that Motivation. We do see a bit of that in the utility skills as well. All of these also have an Echo component that we saw kind of fire off after an interval of time. You could trigger this effect immediately when you use a burst skill, so that's going to be relevant for some of these that are a bit more situational, whereas with the healing skill, that Echo effect heals your allies and removes conditions from them. </p>



<p><strong>Do you plan this spec to be potentially viable as a support even in Raids or Strikes? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> Yeah, that's really the goal. We will monitor the beta to ensure that the spec has all the tools to make it competitive with all the existing options. There are a lot of very powerful support builds in the games. We want to make sure that new support builds that are being added have a lot of the same tools, obviously being played in a different way, but making sure that they aren't just worse than existing options.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Something that we really focused on for this set of elite specs is looking at holes in different gameplay styles that a profession may be missing. A great example of this is the Warrior's Paragon elite spec for this expansion. The Warrior didn't have a great support-focused elite specialization before. There is now a healing build that you could play with the Berserker, but it was never really intended to do that.</em> <em>The Spellbreaker and Bladesworn were also not super support-focused. That gave us an opportunity to make Paragon much more support-focused and really flesh out that playstyle for the Warrior players who want to make more of a supported build.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>In general, did you use a different approach with the elite specializations in Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity compared to the last time you added elite specs to the game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> I think something that we really focused on for this set of elite specs is looking at holes in different gameplay styles that a profession may be missing. A great example of this is the Warrior's Paragon elite spec for this expansion. The Warrior didn't have a great support-focused elite specialization before. There is now a healing build that you could play with the Berserker, but it was never really intended to do that.</p>



<p>The Spellbreaker and Bladesworn were also not super support-focused. That gave us an opportunity to make Paragon much more support-focused and really flesh out that playstyle for the Warrior players who want to make more of a supported build. There's some other examples. I think the Luminary is a pretty good example of an elite specialization that's more true to the core profession and hits a lot of the same themes of that protector, that bruiser, almost more of a knight Guardian spec compared to a lot of the other specs, which really shift the theme. There isn't really a Guardian that's really entrenched in the core Guardian themes as much, so the Luminary is intended to be more of that for the players who really identify with the base Guardian themes.</p>



<p><strong>Did you follow any community feedback on what went right and wrong the previous time elite specializations were added to Guild Wars 2?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> Yes. A lot of the elite spec process is based on that. We get a lot of value out of running the beta events, like this one where we gave the players a full week to make sure they had enough time to play with all the different specs and received even more feedback as a result. The beta events are something that we did for the previous expansions as well, but I think having a bigger chunk of time was useful to get us a better feedback cycle to improve these elite specs ahead of launch.</p>



<p>And you know, clear community feedback does give some direction for some of the elite specs as well. I was talking about trying to make that Guardian spec that's a bit more true to the core profession. We also saw players asking for a more ranged playstyle for the Elementalist, and we see a bit of that in the new Evoker specialization. The same goes for Rangers with Galeshots, who really lean into that long-range playstyle that a lot of players have been asking for.</p>



<p><strong>Based on the feedback from the beta events, are you willing to make radical changes or mostly just balance tweaks to the elite specs?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> There's definitely room for a lot to change. Balance is one thing that we're looking at. We kind of expected that the balance would not be perfect for the beta because there's only so much internal testing that we can do versus how much live testing happens in a beta event. But we also look for feedback on the larger mechanics of the specializations, and if there are mechanics that players don't feel like they work, or skills that feel out of place where they feel like they don't play well with the other skills, we totally have the bandwidth to go back and kind of address those as new.</p>

<p><strong>There are a couple of months before the release of Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity after all.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> Yes, we still have some time to make changes. We're not hoping to make radical changes to the profession mechanics unless needed, but if the community really receives something negatively or if things are just not working, we'll see. We are definitely trying out some some interesting ideas with some of the elit specs and the expectation is that some of them might not work as well as we want and we will iterate and fix the ones that don't really work.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a favorite profession among the newly added ones? I know it's always hard to answer.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> I really think there's a lot of exciting ones. One of my favorites is definitely the Evoker for the Elementalist. Having access to the four different elemental familiars that you can choose from, whether it's the Fox, the Otter, the Hare, or the Toad. That spec is actually really flexible in that there's a lot of different roles that it could eventually fill based off that element that you're shooting to specialize in. It is a different way to play the Elementalist compared to a lot of the existing elite specs.</p>



<p><strong>What about you, Sarah?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sarah Davies:</strong> Well, I'm a big fan of the Evoker because otters are one of my favorite animals, so the fact that the water attunement is represented with the Otter is really exciting to me, but I'm also looking forward to the Paragon just as a warrior main. Having an elite spec that is more dedicated toward support will be fun to play in Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity</p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> The Paragon is a great callout. Along with the Ritualists, these are two of the elite specs that are a bit more inspired by Guild Wars one professions. We've already seen feedback from players as we've been revealing these through our preview streams that they're really excited to see the translation of those Guild Wars one professions in Guild Wars 2. We're trying to evoke the right feelings and catch the right elements of those professions and translate them into an elite spec, such that the players who are really familiar with those really enjoy playing those professions.</p>



<p><strong>The Elementalist is usually considered a hard profession to play in the game. Was that aspect among the considerations made during the design of the Evoker (and, similarly, for the other professions we'll see in Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity)?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> I think the Evoker is indeed supposed to be a little bit more accessible. It does still have access to all of the tools that make the Elementalist a little more complex, but having this specialized element that you can choose that really gives you more value into staying in that attunement. We're still expecting that players are going to be switching attunement to get full access to their kit, but if you are a player who is more interested in staying in a single attunement and really channeling the feeling of that attunement, the Evoker should be a bit better at doing that than a lot of the others. I think we've seen a lot of success in the past with the Mechanist from End of Dragons, which is a bit more accessible as well, where the Mech itself is doing a lot of the heavy lifting for that profession. We definitely want those specializations to exist for players who really love those professions, but maybe some of the core mechanics are too complicated for them. If there's a way that we can make an elite specialization that makes that profession that much better for those players, that's really great for us, too.</p>

If there's a way that we can make an elite specialization that makes that profession that much better for those players, that's really great for us, too.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>In terms of balance, do you believe the new elite specs added with Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity will be on the same power level as the previous ones?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> We're hoping they're around the same power level as what's in the game right now. We're just gonna get a lot of good data from all the players playing all the specs from the beta, and then going into launch we will have a better idea of where the balance point needs to be and what adjustments we need to make to the skills to make sure that the power level is where we want it to be.</p>



<p><strong>Will the Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity expansion include changes to the existing professions and/or elite specs?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> The primary focus will be on the new elite specializations, and if there's adjustments that we need to make to the core professions to facilitate that, like maybe there's some elements that the elite specialization needs that the part profession doesn't have, and we want to just make some adjustment there, we'll totally be looking at that between the beta and launch. Other elite specializations probably won't be getting a ton of looks between the beta and the launch of the expansion, but we still do regular balance updates so we'll continue to do that after the expansion ships where we will then have the new elite specializations as part of the live balance ecosystem and be looking at all the different things. We do continuously update older elite specializations when there are things that are either out of balance or skills or traits that aren't quite up to par, so we try to make sure that everything is good to go on this one.</p>



<p><strong>Do you think the balance is in a good place for the existing professions right now?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> We're always looking at adjustments that we can make. We're pretty happy with the diversity of different builds that can be played right now in terms of what's viable. There's definitely some builds that probably perform a little bit better, that maybe we consider overperforming a little bit that we could be wanting to bring down a little bit just bringing everything a bit more in line with each other, but we're pretty happy with like the diversity of all these builds that you can play with all these different elite specializations across all these professions. There really is just a lot of build diversity, assuming you're not trying to do absolute min-maxing to make the perfect maximum damage composition, for example, but if you're looking to do something that's going to work and clear content, then there's a ton of options and we're pretty happy with that.</p>



<p><strong>In Janthir Wilds, there were no new elite specs. Why did you decide to return to doing them again in Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> I think it's the case that elite specializations are always the most exciting of the features. Adding a new weapon type, spears, is pretty interesting, and we were able to add some new ways to play the game. Elite specializations are almost on another level in the build customization and flexibility they add to the game. So, as we were looking into what we're gonna do on the combat side for this expansion, we pitched, well, can we do elite specs? We figured out that we did have the bandwidth, so we really wanted to add another set of elite specs because we felt that that was the best combat feature that we could add to an expansion.</p>



<p><strong>I imagine it will always be on a case-by-case basis, right? Like, it won't necessarily happen again next year.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cal Cohen:</strong> It's definitely something that we have to evaluate on a case-by-case basis.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-insomniac-games%E2%80%99-wolverine-is-likely-to-be-at-playstation%E2%80%99s-next-state-of-play.1288170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming sources have revealed that Insomniac Games’ Wolverine is ready to be shown off for the first time officially since the 2021 PlayStation Showcase.</p>



<div><p>According to sources, who wished to remain anonymous as they couldn’t talk about company plans, PlayStation is currently planning its next State of Play event towards the end of September. </p><p>Other sources revealed that Insomniac Games’ Wolverine is “almost certainly” going to be at the event, as the production of its next trailer has now been completed. If the game doesn’t appear at State of Play, then the trailer will undoubtedly be released in the next few months, with The Game Awards being the next likely candidate.</p></div>



<p>Insomniac Games’ Wolverine faced <span>some issues in development following a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-games-alleged-ransomware-attack/" target="_blank">ransomware attack</a>&nbsp;in December 2023, during </span>which employee information and a substantial amount of game footage&nbsp;leaked online. The hack resulted in some changes to the game’s plans, but the extent of these changes is currently unknown.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, neither PlayStation nor Insomniac Games has revealed when Wolverine is set to be released, but fingers crossed, an answer awaits us in the coming weeks. The game is currently slated to release exclusively on the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As for what else the next State of Play event could feature remains to be seen, but it’s likely to feature Bungie’s upcoming ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-bungie-befre-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>‘, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroidvania God of War</a> (Insider Gaming has it on good authority a mainline title is also in the works), Phantom Blade 0, and possibly even Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. If the State of Play is at the end of September as intended, then we’ll likely see a deeper dive into Ghost of Yotei, too, which releases on October 2, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dreamhaven is now the latest studio to lay off employees from staff, letting go of many staff members.</p>



<p>Today, the developer/publisher, who created Wildgate and Sunderfolk, announced layoffs made to the studio. As of writing, no specific number is out, but it’s likely a good chunk. Dreamhaven, led by ex-Blizzard cofounder Michael Morhaime, is a newer studio. The team only has a few titles under it, with the latest being the multiplayer shooter Wildgate. With that said, the layoffs are rather surprising and very unfortunate to those affected.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369069584328421376/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a LinkedIn post</a> by CEO Michael Morhaime, he announced the layoffs and some reassurance. He states in the post,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We made the hard decision to reduce the size of our company, with the primary impact on our Publishing group,” says Michael in the post. “These choices are never easy — they affect talented colleagues who have played a key role in building Dreamhaven’s foundation and supporting what has been an eventful year for us.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As mentioned before, the exact number of laid-off staff has not been disclosed. Regardless, it seems like support will be available, as severance packages and connections to future jobs have been given. As for its roster of games, the studio plans to continue to be supported, like Wildgate and Sunderfolk.</p>



<p>Already, this year has been full of layoffs and closures. Just last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-holds-layoffs/">Crystal Dynamics</a> let go of staff following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reportedly-could-have-been-saved-after-cancellation/">cancellation of Perfect Dark</a>. Hopefully, with new studios on the rise, those who lost their jobs can land back on their feet soon.</p>

He’s resourceful and talented, but also cocky and reckless — a more unseasoned Bond than we’ve seen in the movies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the main mission, you’re “in pursuit of a rogue agent who’s always one step ahead.” That’s 009, who’s presumably the main villain. That pursuit sends you to lots of interesting and gorgeous locations around the world. In the trailers, we’ve seen mountainous, watery areas, as well as nightclubs, rooftops, and open-air plazas. It looks like you can drive cars and pilot boats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can play the levels stealthily, using gadgets to help get you where you need to be, or you can go in guns blazing — Bond famously has a license to kill, after all. This is no surprise, as the Hitman games famously allow players lots of freedom in how they complete the tasks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">To say MindsEye suffered from a rocky launch would be a bit of an understatement. A release plagued by a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-review"><u>poor critical reception</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-heartbroken-amid-troubled-launch-as-players-report-success-with-refunds-and-sponsored-streams-are-canceled-last-minute"><u>refunds to players who purchased it</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say"><u>subsequent layoffs</u></a>, developer Build a Rocket Boy’s debut game garnered its fair share of negative headlines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there was once a time when there was something to be excited about when it came to MindsEye, so much so that IOI Partners — the publishing arm of Hitman and 007 First Light studio IO Interactive — saw enough promise in it to distribute the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The initial talks we had with those guys were to support them”, Hakan Abrak, CEO of IOI, told IGN. “We thought they had some great ideas and a great world in the background that they were building, and hopefully they'll get the opportunity to show more of that in the future. And we just wanted to help them distribute the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At some point along the road, though, the development of MindsEye clearly did not go exactly to plan, and ultimately ended in that negativity-laced launch. For IOI Partners, it obviously isn’t what it wanted to see happen after attaching itself to the Leslie Benzies-helmed project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Well, that was definitely tough, right?”, Abrak confirmed. “It was a tough reception. It wasn't what they hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners. They're working hard on turning that around to regain the trust of the gamers out there, and they have tons of potential and content they're working on. So hopefully they'll succeed with that in the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon after MindsEye launched, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-heartbroken-amid-troubled-launch-as-players-report-success-with-refunds-and-sponsored-streams-are-canceled-last-minute"><u>BARB said it was “heartbroken” over the issues players had faced with the game</u></a>, and promised to release a series of patches to fix the significant performance problems, glitches, and AI behavior bugs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-releases-performance-improvement-hotfix-as-first-in-series-of-emergency-patches-designed-to-address-disastrous-launch"><u>Rollout of these patches has begun</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Story-driven action adventure game MindsEye was initially designed to be a part of Everywhere, the ‘Roblox for adults’ creation platform led by former Grand Theft Auto design chief Leslie Benzies. BARB eventually switched to focus on MindsEye, but it has so-far failed to do the business for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-devs-uk-workforce-of-around-300-receive-at-risk-emails-as-former-gta-lead-leslie-benzies-finally-addresses-staff">BARB sources told IGN</a> that Benzies finally addressed staff following the release of MindsEye in a brief video call. According to two people present who asked not to be named in order to protect their careers, Benzies insisted BARB would bounce back and relaunch MindsEye, blaming the studio and the game’s struggles on internal and external saboteurs, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The future of MindsEye and Build a Rocket Boy remains uncertain. But what about IOI Partners and its appetite to publish more games not made inside the Danish studio’s walls? IOI Interactive will self-publish the upcoming James Bond adventure 007 First Light, but can we expect more partnerships along the lines of the one made with MindsEye, or has this launch left a bad taste in the mouth?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, IO Interactive will publish our own games internally,” Abrak confirmed. “IOI Partners? That remains to be seen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can read about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-dev-io-interactive-put-daniel-craigs-head-on-agent-47-when-pitching-for-james-bond-game-007-first-light">how Daniel Craig’s face was put into a Hitman map in order to secure the Bond rights here</a>.

No, it wasn’t anything going down internally at the studio that led to such a change, but something entirely more global: the death of Queen Elizabeth II of England.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news was huge, but the impact on the script, not so much. It mainly revolved around instances of characters having to refer to protecting both <em>King </em>and country rather than <em>Queen</em>, and Bond being on <em>His </em>Majesty’s Secret Service rather than <em>her.</em></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/gettyimages-1394204506-1756928432882.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Queen Elizabeth II died on September 8, 2022.

It's a new world."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So new, in fact, that it’s the first time a 007 story has taken place during the reign of a male British monarch, with Ian Fleming’s original novels having been written mere months after Queen Elizabeth II’s 1952 coronation, and Daniel Craig’s final Bond film, No Time to Die, having been released a year before her passing. It’s a new world for Britain’s most famous spy, but not one that felt too daunting for IO Interactive to enter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It doesn’t feel weird”, replied Emborg. “I feel a great sense of kind of reverence for it. This is something that's been going on for way beyond our lifetimes, and it's inspired generations.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">James Bond. Indiana Jones. Lara Croft. Nathan Drake. Each of these iconic globetrotters was inspired by the one created before them. Now that pattern comes full circle, with IO Interactive's 007 First Light channeling the action movie spirit of Naughty Dog's Uncharted series. But that circle forms a coin, much like the one IOI's other iconic leading man keeps in his pocket, with two distinct sides. Agent 47's DNA runs deep in the developers' new James Bond origin story, to the point that if the charismatic British spy himself sported a barcode on the back of his head, you'd likely scan it and find out he'd been engineered on the same production line. From what I've seen of 007 First Light so far, and from talking to the team at IOI, it's set to be an exciting blend of both Hitman's signature do-it-yourself gameplay and a brand of cinematic spectacle you'd hope for from one of film's most enduring series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">First Light is all about earning that famous number: 007. But before the number, there’s a name: James Bond. And behind that name lies another: Patrick Gibson. Casting for Britain’s most famous spy is always a hot topic, but the 30-year-old Gibson instantly looks and sounds the part, stepping into the shoes of the youngest Bond ever put to screen. At just 26, this version of Ian Fleming’s iconic hero is already confident and charming, but with a dash of brashness – a wrinkle of immaturity that’s not yet been ironed out. This isn’t the experienced, steely Bond that Daniel Craig most recently gave us, but one very much at the start of his career.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">007 First Light screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think first and foremost, this is the story of a young man who steps into a new world,” cinematic and narrative director Martin Emborg tells me. “He steps into this world of shadows and of his future. So it is meeting someone who has a brighter outlook on life, who's more positive, who's a more relatable young man. As the audience, we know a lot more about what he'll have to face in his future, and so we've built up a plot and an adventure that he has to go through that will mature him and take him some of the way towards the guy that we know, the seasoned 007.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>On His Majesty’s Secret Service</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">First Light is a story made for “the times we live in”, a phrase repeated throughout my visit to the Copenhagen studio by IOI’s CEO and First Light’s game director, Hakan Abrak. Not only is it the first time an official Bond story has had James working in the service of both <em>King </em>and country, but it’s a tale that explores both the positive and negative impacts of modern technology. You’ll learn all about how this benefits his arsenal of gadgets later, but for now, let’s focus on its threat to the world IO has built.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's the zeitgeist right now, right?” says Abrak about our attempts to wrangle and understand artificial intelligence. “Thinking about ‘How is that going to impact our lives? How is that going to impact our security?’ AI is certainly a part of the story. The information. What can you trust? And when you're making a game about espionage and working in the shadows,  these things [combined with] the technological leaps we are experiencing, there's a lot of material there to work on.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>First Light’s Bond is a young man still finding his feet as an agent.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as we’re living in a world still getting to grips with the impact of artificial intelligence, First Light’s Bond is a young man still finding his feet as an agent and, indeed, ticking off many firsts of his own. IOI teased that this may well be where we see him sip his first shaken, but not stirred martini, and perhaps even the first time he’s had to take a life. But, as synonymous with alcohol and violence as he is, he’s also famed for the attention he garners from the women in his life. In terms of firsts in that department… Well, IOI confirms that such a lifestyle is well and truly underway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it would almost be kind of weirdly cool to say, well, this guy is celibate,” Emborg poses. “He is a very charming mid-to-late twenties guy. Obviously, yes, he has experience with the opposite sex, for sure. So he has this easy charm. I'm not sure he's necessarily super aware of it, though. It's not weaponised in the way that it is for an older Bond, who will use this for manipulation or to further his goals. In that way, he's more like a regular bloke.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Regular blokes don’t tend to disguise themselves as chauffeurs in order to break into chess tournaments taking place at Slovakian chateaus as part of a mission to track down rogue colleagues, though. This is the setup for a very early task that establishes Bond’s mission to bring in the traitorous 009, and follows a tutorial at an MI6 training facility and a prologue mysteriously titled “The Iceland Incident.” This demonstration level, which you can see play out in the most recent State of Play broadcast, shows us the two distinct sides to First Light’s gameplay cadence. In a story of firsts for the agent in training, some aspects, especially in this demo’s opening half, will be familiar to those experienced in IO's masterful World of Assassination. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He doesn't necessarily walk around with coins and throw them”, Abrak explains. “Bond is a lot more impulsive. It's a much more front-footed experience, so he might just grab something to use for distraction. Bond is more expressive and more charming, so maybe he can whisper something to distract the enemies to a certain place that he wants them to go to.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When denied entry to the chateau, such a possibility may present itself, as there are a number of different opportunities hidden around for you to uncover. I’m shown an example where Bond sneaks past some guards in order to steal a lighter. He uses it to set some nearby leaves on fire, creating a distraction which relocates a nearby guard, allowing James to clamber up to an open window unseen. Another way, I’m told, would be to simply pickpocket an invitation from a guest.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are several different routes to do that”, Abrak continues. “Whether you want to use your gadgetry or fisticuffs, or you want to use stealth or use your instincts and your charm to get to where you want to go. I think this combination of action and some of the elements from Hitman is probably the most complex game we've done.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, for all of its incredibly intelligent systemic and level design, Hitman has always been very silly. That tone translates directly into Bond. These two series share a love of quippy one-liners and an abundance of comical deaths, albeit with James delivering them with a much more knowing wink, seemingly always playing to an audience, rather than 47's bone-dry wit. And where IO's assassin always goes unseen, Bond can't help but draw attention. Everyone’s glance lingers a couple of seconds longer than standard as he passes. But while the two agents have differing approaches, both provide fuel for comedy. As Bond makes his way through the aforementioned Slovakian chateau, maids mutter about how they’d love to leave a second mint on his pillow, and a smarmy man comments on his appearance, misidentifying him as a famous model. James will occasionally fire back, too, using his tongue to get himself out of precarious situations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think we did that with Agent 47, obviously, but he's the Grim Reaper”, states Emborg. “He doesn't say a lot to some extent. It's refreshing to write someone like Bond after having worked on 47.” This newfound license to pun can also lead to some excruciating (yet, I concede, still funny) moments. When posing as a journalist searching for his lost camera, James utters the line, “Photography can be such a negative experience”. If he weren’t so charming, you’d roll your eyes so hard you’d sever your optic nerve.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>He may disarm through charm, and so you can avoid confrontation by bluffing guards.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This personable nature also directly feeds into gameplay and how disguises play less of an essential part in 007 First Light compared to Hitman. Bond has no problem walking up to a stranger and declaring who he is so that he may disarm through charm, and so you can avoid confrontation by bluffing guards. This costs Focus, a resource that depletes a yellow meter on the right of the screen. It’s a powerful and costly skill that should be used sparingly, but Focus can be refilled by completing certain tasks, such as containing a violent situation by taking out everyone you’ve accidentally aggravated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two other resources, battery and chemicals, can be found on the face of your Omega wristwatch, located at the bottom left of the UI. These power your gadgets, a collection of which James steadily accumulates across the campaign, as well as the compulsory Q-watch itself. The timekeeping device is so much more than just that, though, with a plethora of abilities held in its hands. These include being able to scan the environment for conversations to eavesdrop on (and the corresponding opportunities that unlock from listening to them), as well as being able to remotely hack electronics in order to cause distractions or explosions — it truly takes the watch from Watch Dogs in this regard. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there are optional gadgets, of which you can take three into the field with you. These range from standard stealth fare, such as smoke bombs that aid in a quick escape, to much more high-tech tools, like a handy laser that can help you get up to all sorts of mischief. “It can open certain obstacles, but it can also shoot chandeliers down,” explains Abrak. “It can also blind people, it can disarm people. It's a pretty cool gadget.” He also tells me that we “very well may be able to” walk around Q Branch in between missions to inspect the MI6 quartermaster’s latest inventions for ourselves — a fantasy ingrained into every Bond fan’s mind.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Next James Bonds Who Never Played 007</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Licence to Kill</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There’ll be no shortage of flexibility when it comes to the campaign’s open areas, then, with the Hitman pedigree shining through – just with the red tie swapped for a black tie aesthetic. But where front-footed combat has always felt like a fallback in the World of Assassination, here it's presented as a necessity, especially in First Light's more guided encounters. Fast-forward to the end of the demo’s chess infiltration mission, following something presumably much more explosive than a checkmate, and Bond is behind the wheel of a vintage Aston Martin. It’s a moment tailored specifically for that James Bond fantasy and, even without getting to play it myself, I found myself exhilarated by the car chase that follows (even if it does slightly outstay its welcome – it’s a <em>long</em> chase). It may not reach the breathtaking heights found in the non-stop chaos of Uncharted 4’s famed Moroccan jeep scene, but it does thrillingly move us to the chapter’s next big action moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pursuing the runaway 009, James is taken to an airfield housing a fully armed militia. As soon as he steps into the area, he’s given the crucial “Licence to Kill,” which allows him to unholster his firearm and let loose. IO doesn’t want Bond to be able to act like a killing machine in every scenario, so deadly force will only be granted when the situation calls for it. The combat itself looks slick, but packing a punch — symbolic of 007 himself, a blunt force dressed in a sharp suit. He flicks shotguns up with his feet into his hands before unloading the cartridges; charges at enemies like a linebacker, sending them to the floor with a thud; and drills bullets into any nearby gas canisters to engulf as much of the base in flames as possible. It’s an impressive sequence that further showcases a malleability in encounter design, both at deliberate and breakneck speeds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bond is more nimble than the relatively stiff Agent 47 ever has been, able to chuck empty rifles at the heads of his enemies and quickly dash between cover in one smooth movement. In a later mission in which Bond is tasked with crashing a Kensington gala, even more creativity is on display, such as pool balls being lobbed from a table and into someone’s skull, and doors being kicked in and cannoning into an unsuspecting guard behind them. This promise of being able to combine James’ raw power, nifty gadgets, and environments full of opportunity looks tremendously exciting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in Slovakia, this experimentation is perhaps best showcased once Bond boards the plane taking off from the aforementioned airfield. After fist-fighting your way across the wing and down into the hull, you’re handed the controls to the plane, allowing you to sharply bank it left or right. This throws enemies inside the aircraft off balance, but also turns the cargo into weapons. Two-tonne crates slam into soldiers, presumably breaking over half of their bones in the process. It’s these one-off mechanics that help build the cinematic whole, making individual action scenes truly feel like big moments. It’s reminiscent of the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare — its globe-trotting nature, of course, owing a debt to Bond — in the way it grants you a distinct way to play for just one level, such as controlling an AC-130 gunship. It’s moments like these that create missions that stick long in the memory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This stretch of car chase, gunfight, and sky-high stuntwork is breaking new ground for IO. A studio that has typically found joy in the quiet and methodical is having to shift gears considerably, flexing action-adventure muscles that are long rested or, in some instances, not trained at all. Even the slick action of Kane and Lynch was shrouded in a morose cloud, with smiles coming at a premium. Here, the Danish developers have had to flick through the original pulpy fiction to find an altogether more swashbuckling tone. “The [original James Bond] books were definitely kind of the touchstone for us in terms of wanting to do our own thing”, Emborg reveals. “We did not want to synthesize and go, ‘Oh, we are going to cherry-pick this from this and this from this’. It was like, who is this character, and how do we build him up to suit the story that we want to tell?”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This structure of blending the curated with the creative is reminiscent of last year's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This structure of blending the curated with the creative is reminiscent of last year's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, somewhat of an irony considering Steven Spielberg owes much of his archaeologist creation to Bond — the Raiders of the Lost Ark director even wanted to helm a 007 movie before George Lucas pitched “The Adventures of Indiana Smith” to him. Without Indy, there'd be no Tomb Raider and, in turn, no Uncharted. While the team at IO is reluctant to pinpoint specific inspirations outside of the 007 canon, it wouldn't feel a stretch to imagine Nathan Drake being subbed in for the second half of James’ Slovakian sojourn as explosive red barrels and parachuteless free-falls punctuate the sequence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitman’s level design has always been gameplay-informed. The larger narratives were never what drove its many iconic maps. With 007 First Light, IO has had to work a little differently, making sure that stories – both overarching and small-scale – are constantly being woven in and out of Bond’s actions. That necessitated a more collaborative approach from the get-go when it came to designing the content and flow of its missions. “All the levels started in a small group where we had level designers, we had art directors, and we had narrative [staff working together]”, reveals Emborg. “It was really having your big story broken into segments, which neatly fit into obvious levels. What's going on in this level? What are the themes we're dealing with? And having that character-driven approach to not only story, but to level design as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's far too early to say if that approach has been a complete success, the signs are very promising. From the glimpses of two missions we’ve seen, there seems to be a suitable mix of both spyplay and action, all of which seems to drive forward a story, and it will be intriguing to see what that balance will end up looking like across the whole of what’s described to me as a “beefy” First Light campaign. That lure of Hitman-like social stealth and Uncharted-scented set pieces is certainly exciting, but most crucially of all, it all feels very distinctly “Bond”.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>From Copenhagen with Love</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If there was anything above all else that I learned from my day in Denmark, it is that there’s a distinct reverence for the legacy of 007 at IO, and the desire to make the first truly original game in the spy’s canon as authentic, yet fresh, as possible. A decade or so ago, there was a time when a “cinematic game” was thought of as something new and exciting, but now it feels like every single-player AAA venture is steeped in incredibly detailed cutscenes and narratives that elegantly weave in and out of gameplay. Creating something unseen in this genre is getting increasingly harder to achieve. Instead of treading that path, IO is looking to the source – both novels and films – and stamping its own brand of agent action onto it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hallmarks are there, from small details like the scar Bond sports on his cheek as described in the books, to louder, much more obvious nods, such as his range of Jaguar and Aston Martin cars. Its world and characters are dripping with sartorial style, dressed in fine tailoring and expensive Omega timepieces. This level of licensing could so easily feel superficial, but these items of luxury are so ingrained in the world of Ian Fleming’s creation that it would feel even more hollow to be without them.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Of course, no Bond story is complete without a villain. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, no Bond story is complete without a villain. Very little has been revealed in regards to their identity at this point, or even how many of them we’ll be dealing with. The only clue I’ve seen at this stage is a picture of a mysterious figure wearing an emotionless Eyes Wide Shut-like golden mask. With most of James’ nemesis’ leaning towards the neurotic as opposed to the erotic, I’ll assume this is merely a passing reference, rather than a full-blown Kubrick crossover. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's the 007 sound. First Light is described as a very “music-forward” game by audio director Dominic Vega, and it certainly sounds that way. The score dips in and out in classic Bond fashion, stabbing scenes with sudden strings but also blending them with jazz swing and synthesised beats that reflect both James’ legacy and future. Composed by The Flight, who have had a hand in the soundtracks for Horizon: Forbidden West, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, and Alien: Isolation, it appears to be using those classic Barry and Arnold refrains to great effect. Oh, and then there’s the matter of a theme song, which, although not directly confirmed by IO, was very heavily hinted to exist by Abrak and the team. It simply wouldn't be a Bond adventure without one, would it? As for who has performed it? Place your bets now.</p><div id="rank-the-james-bond-movies" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank the James Bond movies</h3><h3>Rank the James Bond movies</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you can’t tell by now, I’m incredibly excited by the prospect of 007 First Light. It’s shaping up to be exactly what I thought and wanted it to be when IO first announced its partnership with the license. The Hitman DNA that I, and so many others, love so much is there — all the way down to mission briefings presented in a very World of Assassination way, just with Moneypenny taking over mic duties from Diana — but with that distinct Bond iconography that’s kept the series so beloved for over seven decades. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I'm pleased to see elements of Naughty Dog's industry-shaping series seeping in here, I'm even more glad to see that First Light isn't just “Uncharted but Bond”. IO Interactive has given us some of the most compelling, systemically engaging gameplay of the past decade, and to see that there's plenty of Hitman agency here is more than enticing. I’m left very hopeful, and while we remain in the dark as to what shape Denis Villeneuve’s upcoming Bond film will take, First Light is looking like a very bright prospect for the future of Britain’s most famous spying export. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Got any burning questions about 007 First Light? Ask them in the comments below, and I’ll do my best to answer them for you in the next few days!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>IO Interactive's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> was one of the most surprising Switch 2 reveals during the April 2025 Nintendo Direct. The Hitman developers were already giving us its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">World of Assassination</a> trilogy, but a brand new game — let alone a James Bond game? — yes please.</p>
<p>Now, courtesy of today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/pwRpK8eoLLE?si=jDvevDV5jdCcxYhh&amp;t=1053">007 First Light State of Play</a>, James Bond's origin story will be gracing the Switch 2 at the same time as other consoles, on <strong>27th March 2026</strong>. The game will cost <strong>$69.99 / €69.99 / £59.99</strong> for the Standard edition, or <strong>$79.99 / €79.99 / £69.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) for the Deluxe, with the Switch 2 version being a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>The State of Play gave us our first in-depth look at the upcoming third-person action game, showcasing two missions: one is an undercover mission during a chess tournament in Slovakia; the second is closer to home, taking place at a gala in Kensington, London.</p>
<p>While the usual espionage and sneaking are a part of First Light, Bond will have a variety of skills that will help him get right in the action if he needs to. Here's a rundown of some of those elements from IO Interactive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Spycraft</strong> ensures that stealth and observation are just as powerful as any weapon in Bond’s arsenal. From eavesdropping on key conversations and pickpocketing vital items, to inspecting the environment for hidden clues and gathering critical information, these mechanics open new pathways and opportunities in every mission.</p>
<p><strong>- Instinct</strong> is a signature gameplay feature in 007 First Light, giving players a versatile resource to turn the tide in any situation. Bond can use his instincts to lure enemies into vulnerable positions, bluff his way out of suspicion when discovered, or sharpen his focus for greater precision and power in combat. This mechanic captures Bond’s quick thinking and adaptability, allowing players to respond to changing circumstances with style and control.</p>
<p><strong>- Gadgets</strong> from Q Branch are a core part of Bond’s toolkit in <em>007 First Light</em>, woven directly into moment-to-moment gameplay. From hacking and cutting locks to creating distractions or incapacitating targets, these versatile tools open up new possibilities for stealth, misdirection, and tactical improvisation in any mission. Players will unlock new gadgets as they progress through the missions, which will expand their loadout and strategies to deal with the challenges they will have to face.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>- Combat</strong> in <em>007 First Light</em> is designed to be fast, fluid, and true to Bond’s character, blending precision ranged shooting, visceral and impactful melee encounters, and a unique escalation system that reflects his measured use of force. In close quarters, Bond can deliver dynamic takedowns, throws, and parries that feel weighty and cinematic, often using the environment to his advantage. When enemies escalate to lethal force, Bond is granted his License to Kill, unlocking his expert marksmanship with firearms that can be seamlessly integrated into the flow of action. This interplay between ranged and melee combat, which integrates Bond’s gadgets, ensures every confrontation feels personal, responsive, and grounded in the <em>007</em> fantasy.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak says "With 007 First Light, we’re building a wholly original James Bond experience from the ground up, one that blends the sharp tension of espionage with the bold spectacle the franchise is known for." Promising gameplay "rooted in our signature approach to immersive design", the aim is to make this feel like a true Bond game.</p>
<p>The voice cast has also been revealed, with Irish actor Patrick Gibson taking on the iconic role. Here's a rundown of the cast, along with some of their more well-known roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patrick Gibson (Dexter: Original Sin) — James Bond</li>
<li>Priyanga Burford (Steeltown Murders, Innocent) - M</li>
<li>Alastair Mackenzie (Andor, Unforgotten) - Q</li>
<li>Kiera Lester (Death in Paradise, Wreck) - Miss Moneypenny</li>
<li>Lennie James (The Walking Dead, Line of Duty) - John Greenway</li>
<li>Noemie Nakai (Tokyo Vice) - Miss Roth</li>
</ul>
<p>if you're extremely impressed by what you've seen so far, there <em>is</em> a rather pricey <strong>$299.99 / €299,99 / £259.99</strong> Legacy Edition — though that appears to be available on all platforms except Switch 2 — which includes a Golden Gun Figurine with a Certificate of Authenticity.</p>

			<p>IO Interactive's take on James Bond will arrive on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on March 27, 2026, the studio announced at the tail end of the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/03/watch-over-30-minutes-of-007-first-light-gameplay-launching-march-27-2026/">PlayStation State of Play</a> presentation today that delved into its gameplay.</p>



<p>Beyond the fact that we would be getting a big showcase of the game today, we got a major hint that a release date was going to be announced when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-collectors-edition-price-leak/">price for the base game and its much more expensive collector's edition leaked hours before</a> the showcase kicked off.</p>



<p>The presentation delivered on its promise of showcasing the gameplay, first with a playthrough of an early level with no commentary shown, followed by a later mission in the game shown with commentary from IO Interactive, detailing how different systems in the game work, and how players can figure out their own path forward through multiple options for completing the same objective.</p>

<p>We also got a confirmation of the full cast, with Patrick Gibson, who you might recognize most recently from the Dexter: Original Sin series, starring as James Bond. We also got a better look at what the $300 collector's edition will include, which is a copy of the game along with its deluxe edition digital upgrades, a golden gun weapon skin, and a golden gun figurine complete with a stand, secret compartment, a magnetic steel case, and a certificate of authenticity so you can prove to the people who show off the figurine to that you really did spend $300 for it.</p>

Hitman hitmakers Io Interactive have just screened some extensive footage of their James Bond adaptation, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>, during Sony's latest State of Play livestream. As you might expect, it looks and sounds a lot like Hitman, but the whole "James Bond" thing is a definite pace-changer. Catch the whole video below, plus a hasty, opinionated summary from me.

<p>
Sony and Io's Jamesplay blowout spans a couple of First Light missions, the first being a multiple-agent undercover affair during an exclusive chess tournament held in Slovakia, which begins with our hero kicking his heels in a carpark while disguised as a chauffeur. All seams peaceful. But then our hero remembers that he's Bond, <em>James</em> Bond, and has better things to do than fulfil his allotted role in a painstakingly organised MI6 operation.
</p>
<p>
The subsequent 20 minutes or so can be divided into five courses. First, a dash of infiltration that readily channels Agent 47, with Bond using environmental distractions to bamboozle security staff and steal their IDs. Always a fan of bouncers who are hopelessly baffled by leaky hosepipes.</p><p>Then, there's a dollop of social stealth, with Bond hustling a bartender for clues about a weirdo bellhop. Then, it's time for an Xbox 360-ass car chase with a femme fatale in the passenger seat. Next, James must blow up one million red gas tanks while cover-shooting through a crowded airfield to an escaping transport plane. Then, he must do a crafty QTE hack on the plane's attitude controls, so as to wrongfoot the on-board defenders and ultimately, turn the plane into a meteor shower.
</p>
<p>
If it were me, I'd still be in that carpark playing Tetris on my Q-phone. But I am not Bond, <em>James</em> Bond. Io's version of the character is as smug, quippy and basically unbearable as you'd expect from a Bond actor pre-Daniel Craig. I rate him seven Rogers out of Connery so far.
</p>
<p>
The other Jamesplay excerpt from Sony's sprawling Bondcast sees the handsome cad infiltrating a gala in Kensington, London. It may be down to the State of Play presentation, but this one feels much more like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a> mission, with Bond navigating the crowd, eavesdropping for interaction opportunities, pickpocketing the help, and generally keeping it on the down-low.
</p>
<p>
Io and Sony polish everything off with an edited section showing off the game's various supporting systems. Certain actions earn you Instinct, which can be spent to bluff your way out of confrontations, lure guards into takedowns, and slow time for headshots.</p><p>You also get gadgets, of course, such as a laser with which to drop chandeliers on those foolish enough to enjoy their crystal glow, and smoke grenades for when you can't be arsed to hide properly. Lethal force appears to depend on Bond being granted "License to Kill" by his handlers - you can't just murder somebody with a pair of scissors whenever you fancy, for you are Bond, <em>James</em> Bond, not some barcode-wearing hooligan.
</p>
<p>
All in all, I think this looks entertaining. It's either a Hitman game that has gracefully yielded to Bond's appetite for getaway shoot-outs, or a Bond game that has studied long and well under Agent 47's tutelage - take your pick. It's out March 27th 2026.

In addition to a new Vanguard hero, Angela, to help kick off the season, a number of heroes are seeing significant balance adjustments to make them more (or sometimes less) competitive.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRUcdKzw6nQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dRUcdKzw6nQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Chief among those changes is a decrease in the duration of Luna Snow's powerful ultimate, Fate of Both Worlds. NetEase hasn't released the patch notes just yet so we don't have the specific numbers involved, but it's a change that has felt like it's been a long time coming. Luna's ultimate has always been among the best in the game, capable of making teammates within it nearly invincible and able to stop an enemy push in its tracks. Its lengthy duration often brought fights to a standstill, much to the frustration of some players.</p><p dir="ltr">Her ultimate becomes extra annoying when paired with a Loki, who could copy Luna's ultimate for yet another lengthy period of invulnerability. Loki, too, is seeing some nerfs to his damage and healing in Season 4.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-vanguard-tank-heroes/2900-6103/" data-ref-id="2900-6103">Vanguard</a> heroes getting hit with nerfs include Emma Frost and Captain America, while a handful of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-duelist-dps-heroes/2900-6105/" data-ref-id="2900-6105">Duelists</a> are also being brought down a peg. Squirrel Girl is having her long-range poke reduced, Psylocke's burst-damage potential is being adjusted, and Black Panther is being hit with a reduction to his survivability.</p><p dir="ltr">On the buff front, a number of Vanguard, Strategist, and Duelist heroes are receiving some help. Blade, Moon Knight, and Scarlet Witch will be buffed to make them more viable damage-dealing picks, while Thor and Peni Parker will receive buffs to their ultimate abilities in order to give them "more playmaking material," according to NetEase. Doctor Strange, often nerfed, will receive an offensive buff.</p><p dir="ltr">As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-strategists-support-heroes/2900-6102/" data-ref-id="2900-6102">Strategists</a>, NetEase wants to give players more options and "bring more diversity in the role." That has translated to buffs to ultimate abilities for characters like Invisible Woman, Ultron, and Jeff the Land Shark. Combined with the nerf to Luna's ultimate, the Strategist field should be a little more interesting in Season 4. NetEase notes that popular heroes like Cloak and Dagger, Magneto, and Phoenix aren't receiving balance changes this time around, but that it will be keeping an eye on the meta in Season 4.</p><p dir="ltr">Balance changes are just the tip of the iceberg for Marvel Rivals Season 4, which will also add a new Vanguard hero, the Asgardian Angela, to the roster. Angela will be able to wield different weapons depending on the situation, including a spear to dive into enemy lines, dual axes for cleaving through foes, and a shield for blocking incoming damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Team-up abilities are seeing major changes, too. Thor and Angela will gain a team-up that gives Thor the ability to throw and then dive to one of Angela's spears. Existing team-up abilities are seeing some adjustments, with Dimensional Shortcut being removed. Magik instead joins the Arcane Order team up, while Black Panther will join Hulk's Gamma Charge team up, which will grant Black Panther a gamma shield when at critical health.</p><p dir="ltr">NetEase additionally confirmed a number of new features coming alongside Marvel Rivals Season 4, including the permanent addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-game-mode-trailer/2300-6465741/" data-ref-id="2300-6465741">Clone Rumble</a> and Giant-Size Brain Blast to Arcade mode, a new map, custom ultimate ability visual effects becoming visible for everyone (with an option to disable it), and another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-marvel-rivals-swimsuit-skins/2900-6764/" data-ref-id="2900-6764">wave of summer-inspired skins</a> for heroes like Mantis, Punisher, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and The Thing. NetEase also announced it's working on adding competitive-placement matches in response to feedback about the game's current seasonal rank resets, though the feature won't be coming as part of Season 4.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals Season 4 launches September 12, the same day the game arrives on PlayStation 4.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>007: First Light seems, to my mind, to be the first true origin story for James Bond that we’re seeing beamed onto a TV. Sure, there’s the Young Bond novels from the early 2000s, but even Daniel Craig’s Casino Royale is less of an origin and more of a “this is when he got his 00 promotion” kind of a story. In First Light, Bond is still an up and coming agent, he’s having to work as part of a team, taking orders for more menials roles on a mission… but would you believe he’s also a bit of a loose cannon? The kind of character to go off mission and break a few rules to get the job done?</p>
<p><iframe title="007 First Light – Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpP_WXrDArQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But as much as Bond’s reputation and character precedes him, so too does a sense of what he has to look like. Through the decades, each film actor has drawn varying degrees of controversy and appreciation, and the same is true for 007: First Light. Franchise Art Director Rasmus Poulsen told us, “You know, we looked at the IP from afar and we looked at the character from afar. That means we looked at everything from games, movies, all the way back to the books, and specifically the books, to get the real inspiration of who this guy is and what he looks like.</p>


<p>“So Fleming’s description – obviously, we have the scar here, which is amazing for us too, to get to play with – that was really the foundational inspiration for him as a character, including his looks and everything like that. One of the descriptions is about the coldness of his eyes. I’m not sure I recall [the quote] exactly, but that means to us that he shouldn’t be too pretty. There has to be some sort of dualism to his appearance. But as I said, we based it on the IP zoomed out, but the core values from books and seen through the movies.”</p>


<p>The gameplay reveal opens with an assembly of MI6 agents going up against, not an external threat, but one of their own.&nbsp;009 has gone about as rogue as an upside down Sean Bean, and he knows every trick in the MI6 playbook. Still, now’s the time to try and intercept him, as they’ve got word that he’s holding a covert meeting at a glitzy chess tournament. Bond, then… well Bond gets to be the chauffeur and cover a potential escape route, while the rest of the team sneak inside and try to get the drop on 009. He’s still quite far from being a double-oh…</p>
<p>Speaking about this characterisation, Rasmus said, “It was always our intent to do a standalone origin story for a young Bond, because it really allows us to make a Bond that we feel better aligns with the audience. So of course, we’re doing games and it’s really important for us to enjoy the unique opportunities that we have both to dive into the character, but also to give you guys gameplay that fits.</p>
<p>“ So the wonderful opportunity is that you learn on the job with Bond, right? So you two grow together throughout the story of the game. In that sense, it was it felt like the only option for us. It felt so obvious that we have to do this. ”</p>
<p>So, Bond’s maybe a bit of a dogsbody to start with, but that immediately puts him behind the wheel to provide something completely new for an IO Interactive caper: driving. Sure, it’s not the most thrilling job being directed to drop off Bond’s colleagues and then head round back to the parking lot, but once the mission goes completely off the rails, the driving gets to be much faster and more action-packed. This is a major change of pace for IO on pretty much every level.</p>

<p>“We’re not known for driving games,” Rasmus said, “So with that in mind, we had to bring on board specialist skill sets to the team to really help us do that, people with experience in that arena, and that was simply necessary for us to be able to believe that we could pull it off.</p>
<p>And with that said, the good thing about it is when the car dynamics have been set up correctly, the car becomes a toy in itself. Once you nail the handling of the vehicle, it keeps on giving. I think, once you can say that about many of the game mechanics, but in particular, the car is a physics object, if you will, that you can manipulate on the fly. That is one of those technical setups that just gives an experience instantly, even without gameplay. Even without rules, it’s a toy.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I think the integration of the car gameplay in the game has been massively challenging, massively daunting, but something we’ve approached with with great care and I’m happy to say that I think it’s in some amazing parts of the game. I’m really excited, and I love driving games, so it’s been very good.</p>
<p>It certainly looks and feels like a narrative-led car chase, with 009 always kept out of reach up until the car crash that’s conveniently close to an air strip where he can make his second escape attempt.</p>

<p>But let’s come back to the chess tournament a moment, and an evolution of the stealth action gameplay when compared to Hitman: World of Assassination. Bond’s trying to tail a suspicious bellhop, but has to skirt past security &nbsp;Bond is following a suspicious looking bellhop, ditching his station and defying orders in the process, but can’t get into the main building without accreditation. Looking around the area presents a few clear opportunities: a drainpipe to clamber up to reach an open window, plenty of other staff, press and more who you could maybe steal accreditation from, a bunch of dry leaves that could cause a distraction, if only you could find a lighter…</p>
<p>Rasmus admitted, “Obviously, there is a lot of common ground, and we enjoyed reading the internet’s opinions on that, a while back as well, and so obviously a lot of common ground in the sense that a lot of the gameplay interaction is similar to what we’ve done in the past, right? The creative approach element that we’re focussing on here, which is the primary gameplay pillar, is certainly present, which means everything from manipulation, charm, combat, all the way through driving.”</p>
<p>And then there’s the gadgets. As Bond wanders through some familiar feeling crowd, evading both colleagues and security, the Q watch helps to provide an overlay to the environment, analysing the environment and presenting opportunities that you could take advantage of to get through the mission. Here’s we see some of the partnerships and iconic branding of the films filtering through.</p>
<p>“We knew we had to do something fun with gadgets. But the cool thing about that is when designing the game, it’s not so much about the gadget as it is about the environment of the world and situation, telling you what it needs now. What would a superpower be here in this situation? And then from there, rework locations and get this together to build a fabric of opportunities and gardgets that allow those opportunities. […]
</p><p>“It’s funny to discuss both internally and with Omega clarity and readability, because if you’re doing an instrument, readability is key. Of course, our instrument is the game, and not time-telling. So that has been a really fun collaboration there, basing it on Omega design cues, but of course, customised to what the game needs, what clarity do you need as a player to understand how to manipulate the world and how to do that effectively and quickly.”</p>
<p>These brands are going to be wrapped up, in a way, by Q and all the gadgetry he builds at his lab.&nbsp;I’m hoping Q’s been working on some rocket-loaded plaster casts and booby-trapped phone boxes.</p>

<p>It was at this point that the presentation skips ahead to the car chase, things having gone a bit awry, and with Bond partnering with a foreign agency’s operative on-the-fly. Leading to the airfield, what follows is a big and explosive action set piece. Bond, per agency rules, can only shoot to kill if actively threatened, but once combat kicks off, there’s no stopping him. A plane is about to take off, and there’s plenty of big barrels and fuel containers to shoot at to battle past the gun-toting goons.</p>
<p>Haring after the plane, we get something that’s various parts The Living Daylights, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Uncharted 3 – arguably the latter two would have been inspired by the former. The fight on the plane goes wrong, Bond ends up freefalling and, funnily enough, the most pressing objective changes to trying to find a parachute…</p>
<p>Through it all, you can see IO Interactive’s experience with Hitman coming through. Just as I had expected when this licensing partnership was announced, there’s so much common ground with things like the crowd system, having open and secure areas, blending this familiar ground with more fluid movement, suave interactions and new gameplay. A bit like getting a new kitchen installed, the underlying cabinets are still built using the same materials, but there’s a fancy kitchen island for the cooker and the fridge is hiding behind a cabinet door. That’s far from a bad thing, as it plays to IO’s strengths while letting them broaden their horizons.</p>

Seems a bit odd to include such a classic Bond prop in a game that, seemingly, has nothing to do with that era of the franchise, but hey, what do I know?</p>   <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-makers-of-hitman-are-working-on-a-new-james-bond-ga-1845713628">First announced back in 2020</a>,<em> 007: First Ligh</em>t is the long-awaited next game from IO Interactive, and it tells the tale of a younger James Bond as he completes some of his first missions. It’s been a long five-year wait for fans of <em>Hitman</em> who are hoping that <em>First Light</em> will play a lot like Agent 47’s franchise. In today’s State of Play reveal, it did indeed seem like this is very much a <em>Hitman</em>-style game, with multiple options for infiltrating areas and a big focus on stealth and problem-solving. However, the gameplay in the presentation also had moments that were marred by some nasty performance dips and a lot of motion blur. Hopefully, <em>007: First Light</em> looks better and runs well when it arrives on Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 27, 2026.</p>

<p>007 First Light has been revealed in full by IO Interactive, including the game’s release date and the editions that will be available when it drops. It’s coming next March, bringing a refreshing origin story to 007 fans worldwide. Following the release of a lengthy gameplay walkthrough, the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition was uncovered, benefits and all.</p>



<p>If you pre-order the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition, here’s everything you’ll get for your money…</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-007-first-light-deluxe-edition">What’s in the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition?</h2>



<p>Those who want a little more bling for their buck with 007 First Light will want to secure the Deluxe Edition, available to pre-order on PS5, Xbox Series, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>It’s an all-digital special edition, which means the bonuses and benefits are cosmetic-based.</p>



<p>Here’s what you get:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s four exclusive outfits, a new weapon skin for Bond’s trademark handgun, and a ‘Gleaming Skin Pack’ that equips 007’s earbuds, lighter, pen, and mobile phone with a gold skin.</p>



<p>I’m particularly interested in the exclusive outfits. I want to stalk my targets while trying to maintain my cover dressed as a skeleton in a top hat. I hope there’s some kind of lore to explain why that’s a thing. Perhaps I’ve missed a trick, but I’m hardly a James Bond fan!</p>



<h3 id="h-when-is-007-first-light-coming-out">When is 007 First Light Coming Out?</h3>



<p>During the gameplay reveal, IO Interactive also dropped the 007 First Light release date. The game is set to be released worldwide on March 27, 2026. That means there’s still quite a while to wait until it launches.</p>

A golden cartridge and five bullets have their own slots as well. It looks very much like something James Bond would have tucked away in his car. Fittingly, the display stand has a hidden compartment, too.</p><p>Along with the Golden Gun, the Legacy Edition comes with an exclusive steelbook case. The 007 logo on the front cover is a removable magnet, which is a neat little twist on the average steelbook design. The collectibles, a certificate of authenticity, a physical copy of 007 First Light, and a voucher for several in-game items are packaged in an understated black collector's box. First Light's Legacy Edition is only available on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p><h2>007 First Light Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>All preorders for 007 First Light include a "free deluxe upgrade," a fancy way of saying you'll get some bonus cosmetics for Bond.
