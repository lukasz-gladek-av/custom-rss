  <p id="S5ZB5M">In classic <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars">Star Wars</a> fashion, the Jedi of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23673259/star-wars-high-republic-explained">the High Republic novels</a> — who have now made the jump to live action in the form of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171592/star-wars-acolyte-kill-jedi-mae-sith-master-no-weapon"><em>The Acolyte</em></a> — have spent much of the past few years veering toward disaster. Amid the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/21507879/star-wars-high-republic-the-great-disaster-jedi-explained">“Great Disaster,”</a> which provided an explosive opening to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2021/1/12/22221112/light-of-the-jedi-spoilers-author-charles-soule-interview">Charles Soule’s <em>The Light of the Jedi</em></a>, they were first responders. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sdcc/22591953/star-wars-high-republic-books-order-wave-3-sdcc-2021">cataclysmic events</a> of Claudia Gray’s <em>The Fallen Star </em>made them victims. Now, after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/22867009/star-wars-high-republic-books-phase-2-announcement">a prequel jaunt in The High Republic phase 2</a>, phase 3 is in full swing with the second adult novel in the sequence, Tessa Gratton’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Temptation-Force-Republic/dp/0593723090?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Temptation-Force-Republic/dp/0593723090?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23937258__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23937258__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Temptation of the Force</em></a><em>, </em>in which the Jedi finally start fighting back.</p>
<p id="7pof2s">Following up George Mann’s <em>The Eye of Darkness</em>, <em>Temptation of the Force</em> reunites the Jedi of the High Republic Era after the marauder-terrorist group known as the Nihil staged a violent takeover of a portion of the Outer Rim known as the Occlusion Zone. Focused on the reunion of star-crossed Jedi Avar Kriss and Elzar Mann, <em>Temptation of the Force</em> promises to pay off some long-simmering character work while rallying for what ought to be an explosive conclusion in next spring’s <em>Trials of the Jedi</em> by Charles Soule. </p>
<p id="eA7nhx">In this exclusive excerpt from <em>Temptation of the Force</em>, ahead of its debut on June 11, we see the beginning of the Jedi’s offensive against the Nihil — one that doesn’t involve weapons of warfare, but words of inspiration. </p>
<hr id="k2GELT">
<p id="L6Ubw1"><em><strong>While the Jedi take the fight directly to the Nihil, within the Occlusion Zone, a group of freedom fighters work to support the planets imprisoned in Nihil space, spreading a message of hope and freedom. </strong></em></p>
<h2 id="HEF0ES"><strong>RILIAS II, INSIDE THE OCCLUSION ZONE</strong></h2>
<p id="5FKYvS">Cair San Tekka had been a lot of things in his relatively short life: a spy, a musician, a secret husband, a security aide, a secretary, a punk kid, a troublemaker, a pilot, and now a smuggler and freedom fighter. He wasn’t the only one running various rebellions throughout Nihil space, and several such rebel groups had found ways to access the constantly changing anti-scav codes to allow for safer travel out here on the frontier, as well as a comm subroutine channel that made it through the Nihil comm embargo. Cair managed those things, too. But what he had that nobody else had was someone who provided him with frequently updated time-phased Path codes that could be used by the Jedi to penetrate the Stormwall. </p>
<p id="fx1oOY">And allies with ships of their own. </p>

<p id="ycRPKL">Those ships were what allowed Cair to be down in the central water garden of Rilias II, huddled in the bowl of their foris alloy funnel. The funnel had been built a few generations ago as a decorative fountain the size of a small building, out of a metal mined on one of their moons that allowed for an exact resonance with the minerals found in their perma-scatter clouds. The funnel gathered thin trickles of water all day and night from the water garden, and at sunrise and sunset most days of the year, when the light filtered through the clouds, it hit the alloy funnel. The funnel’s reverberation caused particles in the air to vibrate into little rainbow stars. </p>
<p id="tglXni">It also amplified certain audio frequencies. </p>
<p id="KLVcmd">Cair shifted the strap of his harness to better reach the small panel that was part of the controls in the base of the funnel. He balanced against the sloped, slippery wall with his feet and worked quickly to remove a datachip and replace it with his sliced frequency emitter. </p>
<p id="Lc9r7c">This would be the fifth morale drop he’d personally led, but the first that included a visual component. </p>
<p id="YaiwhU">Ever since he’d met up with Rhil Dairo last month, she’d been angling to find a way to include visuals in their drops. Symbols and smiles, she’d insisted again and again. Cair hadn’t disagreed with the sentiment, only the practicality. </p>
<p id="TP7GRB">But today they had means and opportunity. </p>
<p id="a6irLq">It was a three-pronged setup: Cair down here slicing the funnel to match the necessary frequencies, Rhil up in orbit with the <em>Brightbird</em>— or as it was known in these parts, the Nihil transport <em>Blood Vulture</em>— and Belin ready in his ship on the other side of the sparkling felsic cliffs edging the city. Rhil had dropped the refitted comm buoy with her newest broadcast, active to the frequencies Cair matched with the funnel, and Belin would fly over the city, releasing a hydro-spray to activate the clouds prematurely. Then their show would begin. </p>
<p id="GpQY8q">Cair finished his slice and hit the countdown monitor he’d brought. It synced up with the similar countdown embedded in his artificial hand. He grinned. So far, so good. </p>
<p id="q2a1jp">Climbing out of the funnel took a bit of time, but Cair hooked his legs over the edge and found a seat on a broad ruffled lily pad. He leaned back on the soft moss and tilted his head up. The teal sky was striped by thin blushing scatter clouds, and every once in a while, a personal shuttle zipped past.</p>
<p id="SIENko">Rilias II had been hard hit by the Nihil, but its central government had capitulated faster than many, giving in to demands for total surrender and allowing regular Nihil rioting missions under the cover of “tax collecting.” Neighborhoods had been razed and anybody who fought back taken into custody or killed. It was a horribly typical story of the past year in the Occlusion Zone, but thanks to quick thinking or cowardly leaders, enough of the populace and riches had been sacrificed to semi-mollify the Nihil. </p>
<p id="uluPQv">That just made Cair’s job more important. He had to remind people they needed to fight. And they could survive. There was hope. It was worth reaching out, worth trying. Everybody needed to be trying. </p>
<p id="Pu0fZC">The water garden shuddered under him as the city’s inner mechanisms opened the underground rivers. It was nearly time. </p>
<p id="HFCyyP">Cair tried not to feel too deeply about the moment of peace. Waiting was the only peace he got these days. The peace between planning and action. </p>
<p id="8b40JB">As always, he pretended he could feel the Force thrumming through everything, connecting him to the lily pad and water, to the air and atmosphere, to his allies in their positions, to the stars beyond, to his family—all of whom were in Republic space now, thank the Force. Cair wasn’t strong in the Force in the least, but he’d been raised to trust it anyway. Sometimes he pretended so well he could actually feel it in his bones. </p>
<p id="ZMq0Yf">The countdown alert notified him he had a minute, and Cair got up onto his feet. He stood at the edge of the funnel as if he didn’t have a care in the world. Security teams—the local constabulary indebted to the Nihil now and oppressed by them—could see him if they looked. If Cair was seen, he might be shot on sight. Or he might be cheered. </p>
<p id="njteCJ">But Cair felt deeply that he needed to be seen. Somebody would tell the story: A human had been here and caused this disruption. Not from space, not from the distance beyond the Stormwall. Someone here. In the flesh. Risking death and torture to bring them this message.</p>
<p id="unuiPs">Cair stood, ignoring the fear. This was worth being afraid. Worth death. It had to be. He’d spent too much of his life serving only his family’s benefit, making underhanded business deals instead of music, toying with industrial espionage instead of new wavelengths for his dulcimer. He was good at creating trouble and spycraft, and he’d never regretted prioritizing what his uncles and parents pushed him toward. Until he met somebody even better at such games, and married him. </p>
<p id="HZwSvu">Of course, with the Nihil occupation, nothing was a game anymore. Cair had done his best to lay low, help those he could, and keep himself from putting a target on his husband’s back. He hadn’t known what else <em>to </em>do. </p>
<p id="5V4sxs">Now he knew. </p>
<p id="KMRCkI">He’d seen people sacrifice everything to keep their families alive. He’d witnessed far-flung San Tekkas disregard profit and exploration and everything Cair thought made San Tekkas San Tekkas just to save a handful of people in danger. They’d been more than brave, risked everything, left it all behind, not for glory or profit but for <em>hope. </em>He’d lost his hand learning to make the same choice. </p>
<p id="BXefUs">It still wasn’t easy to do. But every time Cair chose hope, it got a little less scary. </p>
<p id="ugydwY">Warm wind brushed strands of messy black hair across his face. He made himself smile. That would be the last thing he did, if it was the last thing he did. His dramatic husband would say, <em>Running should be the last thing you do, you fool. </em></p>
<p id="Eg2yFW">Cair heard the high scream of Belin’s engine before he saw the glint of the ship out at the line of felsic cliffs. </p>
<p id="JAba7r">It was time. </p>
<p id="a1Btfd">Cair twisted a tiny red dial on his black-metal hand, and it snapped with a frequency. The funnel hummed in answer. </p>
<p id="LMkQd5">The rest was up to Rhil and Belin. </p>
<p id="LM7hmx">Suddenly Rhil’s voice blasted throughout the sky: “Greetings, free citizens of the frontier! This is your friend and ally Rhil Dairo, and today we have a message from a hero you all know!”</p>
<p id="KuTYQl">Cair laughed. Rhil’s broadcast would travel from buoy to buoy until the Nihil managed to stop it. </p>
<p id="HxI2Ap">The funnel thrummed harder, and there came Belin, streaking across the sky in his sharp-nosed shuttle. Behind him trailed a shimmer as the hydro-spray clung to the lower atmosphere, ready. </p>
<p id="An3wEZ">Cair raised a hand to Belin, who vanished over the distant horizon. </p>
<p id="6ZZyzo">The spray caught the sunlight and the funnel flared. </p>
<p id="R1ccHV">“Hello, this is Jedi Master Avar Kriss,” the Jedi’s voice rang out. </p>
<p id="a1i8t1">Everywhere in this system, and hopefully the neighboring as well, and in every Nihil ship and city with comms that could be reached, Avar Kriss spoke to those listening. </p>
<p id="MAVbZF">But here on Rilias II, held in shape by the rainbow frequencies of the alloy funnel, Avar Kriss’s face looked down like a god. </p>
<p id="Lg09qn">If Cair knew Jedi at all, he knew she’d hate the comparison. But Cair relished it. He grinned and laughed again. And before he hightailed it to his mark to be picked up in a hurry, he stood there, watching and listening. </p>
<p id="4rBwG5">“I bring a message of hope, though it is difficult to hear. But listen, please. Even I am familiar with despair. I know it. That feeling when everything is too much, when the pressure of looking for anything inside of tomorrow is overwhelming. It hurts. I know it, too. In times like that just remember who you are—who you want to be. Who you can be. Focus on that. Fight with me, if that is who you can be. But if you cannot, you do not have to fight. I won’t ask that of you. There are people already fighting for you. For all of us. All I am asking of you today is that you live. Live today, and try to find hope tomorrow. This is Jedi Master Avar Kriss. Help is on the way.”</p>

<p>A new version of Microsoft's top-end Xbox Series X will launch without a disc drive for the first time this holiday season.</p>
<p>The new "Digital Edition" console option—which sports 1 TB of storage and an Xbox Series S-like "Robot White" color scheme—will be available "in select markets" for an estimated retail price of $449 (or €499.99). That price is just $50 less than the MSRP for the current, disc-drive-equipped Xbox Series X, which is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/xbox-series-x/8wj714n3rbtl">currently on sale for $449 from the Microsoft Store</a>.</p>
<p>Word of Microsoft's plans for a disc-drive free Xbox Series X <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/ftc-v-microsoft-document-leak-outs-detailed-plans-for-mid-gen-xbox-refresh/">first leaked last September</a>, as part of the FTC's case against the Microsoft/Activision merger. But the new disc-free Series X bears little resemblance to the cylindrical "Brooklin" refresh shown in those leaked promo materials, which also touted redesigned internals and improved power usage. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/xbox-exec-says-leaked-old-emails-and-documents-have-outdated-info/">said at the time</a> that "so much has changed" from the "old emails and documents" in those leaks.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The new Digital Edition Series X will seemingly be on store shelves alongside the standard edition, meaning that Microsoft is not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/is-the-world-ready-for-a-disc-free-game-console/">moving away from disc-based games entirely</a> just yet. To the contrary, a new "Galaxy Black" Xbox Series X model with a disc drive and 2 TB of storage is also planned to launch "in limited quantities" this holiday season at a price of $600. That makes the new hardware slightly cheaper than buying a current Xbox Series X and adding on 1 TB of expansion storage <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/hard-drives/seagate-expansion-card">for about $150</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also planning a holiday launch for a version of its 1 TB edition of the Xbox Series S in Robot White, supplementing the "Carbon Black" version that launched last September. Both colors will be available for $349.</p>

<p>Alongside the weekend hardware announcements, Xbox President Sarah Bond vaguely asserted that they were "hard at work on the next generation" of Xbox hardware and will be "pushing the technical boundaries in our future hardware."</p>

                <p>Rumors have swirled about a handheld Xbox console for years, but none of them have ever quite panned out. At this year's Xbox Game Showcase, Xbox chief Phil Spencer made his feelings on the matter clear. Asked about the concept in a recent interview, Spencer simply said: "I think we should have a handheld."</p><p dir="ltr">While that statement--given in a discussion with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpMhthwnto&amp;t=1540s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>--appears to speak for itself, Spencer quickly stated that the interviewer will also have to speak to Sarah Bond, the president of Xbox, on the issue. He also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpMhthwnto">expressed positive feelings</a> about the future of Xbox hardware, calling it "pretty awesome," and that he's excited to talk about "different form factors" in that hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer's response falls short of an official announcement of an Xbox handheld, but it would certainly seem to indicate that the company is headed in that direction. However, what form it might take remains to be seen. In that same interview, Spencer addressed the closure of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">several Microsoft-owned game studios</a> earlier this year, including Tango Gameworks, calling it "a decision that is very hard on those teams" and stating that he "has to run a sustainable business inside the company."</p><p dir="ltr">The success of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/" data-ref-id="1100-6500986">Steam Deck</a> and similar devices has triggered a renaissance in portable gaming over the past few years, which may have prompted Xbox to seriously consider releasing a portable console. Sony's PlayStation Portal has also enjoyed strong sales, and it's possible that Xbox might differentiate its console by offering local play (rather than remote-only). That said, Xbox did announce <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-announces-new-all-digital-xbox-series-x/1100-6524077/" data-ref-id="1100-6524077">new hardware</a> at the showcase in the form of an all-digital Xbox Series X, which is all-white and has no disk drive. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-working-on-xbox-handheld-prototypes-report/1100-6522128/" data-ref-id="1100-6522128">report from earlier this year</a> suggested that Microsoft was working on an Xbox handheld prototype, and it's apparently similar to the Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/#3">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, check out our recap.

        <p>App store has launched with six games, including Word Jungle and Condor – A Leap of Faith</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Independent app store Aptoide has launched on iOS in Europe after the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/apple-to-allow-alternative-app-stores-in-europe">Digital Markets Act was introduced earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/03/aptoide-launches-its-alternative-ios-game-store-in-eu/">TechCrunch</a>, the store launched last Thursday with six titles including Word Jungle, Condor – A Leap of Faith, and Charades Guess the Word.</p>
<p>Over 100 developers have cited interest on Aptoide so far, in addition to a waitlist of 20,000 users. Between 500 and 1,000 access codes will be distributed daily to enable the app to control growth and receive feedback.</p>
<p>Aptoide also has an alternative in-app purchase solution for iOS, and offers a IAP software development kit for game developers and users launched in collaboration with Apple.</p>
<p>"The Aptoide iOS game store represents a significant shift in the way users and developers interact with the iOS gaming ecosystem," said company co-founder and CEO Paulo Trezentos.</p>
<p>"It marks a significant departure from the traditional iOS gaming ecosystem, which has been controlled by Apple's App Store. We thank Apple for their support thus far, knowing that there are still areas for improvement in the alternative distribution of iOS apps.</p>
<p>"We are optimistic that, with continued cooperation from Apple and regulators, the business terms and user experience will continue to be improved in the coming months."</p>
<p>Aptoide will only focus on games for now, but may expand to other services on iOS in the future as Trezentos told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/4/24171037/aptoide-ios-game-store-eu-third-party-app-dma">The Verge</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="288" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s all-new <em>The Final Shape</em> DLC is, in many ways, a showcase of everything this franchise could be at its absolute best. Some of its new systems, however, are still rather untested, with players being unsure what to make of them. Take the new Pathfinder system, for example.</p> <p data-characters="679" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">After you’ve taken down <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-defeat-the-witness-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the big bad of the DLC (for the first time)</a> and begun engaging with <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-patrols-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-campaign progression systems</a>, you will inevitably come across one of the several new Pathfinder interfaces strewn across the Director UI. Pathfinder is a one-size-fits-all Bounty replacement, providing a clear and pointed look at certain loot and currency items to prioritize. As shown in the screenshot below, it’s a neat and traditionally beautiful interface that sadly still needs work to truly come into its own. Here’s a brief rundown on why, and more of an in-depth look at how <em>The Final Shape’s Pathfinder </em>loot system works. <br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-finale-shape-s-pathfinder-loot-system-explained" data-injectable="false">The Finale Shape’s Pathfinder loot system explained</h2> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s new Pathfinder feature gives you a wide overview of how to progress through your active Season Pass, earn a fair chunk of snazzy loot, and a non-insignificant amount of currency. You do so by completing your randomized array of objectives from left to right, and depending on which Pathfinder you open up, you’ll either be looking at location-specific objectives (i.e. Pale Heart missions) or activity-based ones, instead.</p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">The good news is that Pathfinder saddles you with an impressively large number of different objectives. the Pale Heart Pathfinder specifically, for example, will send you off to take down world bosses, complete Lost Sectors, take down enemies in a particular way, help Ghosts in their plight, and a whole roster of other missions. It’s all good fun, especially when you can just complete one objective after the other without leaving the location at all.</p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">The bad news, however, is that the activity Pathfinder handles this insistence on variety in a different way, and you’ll often need to jump from one playlist to the other to clear your tasks. In effect, this means you’ll often <em>have</em> to play PvP and/or Gambit PvPvE matches to actually unlock your Pathfinder Engrams.</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">Another slight downside to the Pathfinder loot system is that it’s not immediately obvious where to find it. Each interface is located in a different spot on the UI, so the Pale Heart’s Pathfinder is found in the upper left corner of the Pale Heart’s Director map, while the activity Pathfinder is in the Vanguard Director UI.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="false">At the time of writing, only the Pale Heart and the core playlist activities have their own respective Pathfinders, but the system seems too comprehensive not to be applied to most major content releases moving forward. I recommend getting used to it, with that in mind. As outlined in the featured Reddit post, many players are still unsure how to feel about Pathfinder as a whole, but Bungie is bound to tune it up as time goes on, so improvements <em>should</em> be coming down the line.</p>

In much the same way as <em>The Final Shape</em> re-envisions tired old <em>Destiny</em> gameplay tropes, so too do Traveler’s Blessings find a new way to give you boons on the go. The bit that makes these destination mods interesting, for example, is that they’re quite powerful <em>but</em> also timed, which means you need to make good use of them while they’re active. Here’s how they work.</p>
  <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Destiny2-Final-Shape-Travelers-Blessings-Interface.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <h2 id="h-traveler-s-blessings-in-the-final-shape-dlc" data-injectable="false">Traveler’s Blessings in The Final Shape DLC</h2> <p data-characters="641" data-current-count="941" data-injectable="true">There’s a grand total of 16 unique Traveler’s Blessing mods to be found while <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-patrols-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploring the new Pale Heart location</a> in <em>Destiny 2</em>. Compared to most other destination mods we’ve seen in the past, they are often <em>extremely</em> powerful, offering effects such as the ability to spawn explosive Void seekers on Void-damage kills. Since they’re timed, of course, this has allowed Bungie to be more experimental in what it does to balance these out. Further, Traveler’s Blessings are available exclusively while exploring the Pale Heart, meaning their effects will not be relevant in the grander <em>Destiny 2</em> gameplay sandbox.</p>
 <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">You can find Traveler’s Blessings simply by interacting with the Pale Heart in as many ways as possible: complete mission objectives, open chests, collect the local resource nodes, and so on. Mods will drop at random, which means there’s no way of knowing which ones of these you may or may not get.</p> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">Traveler’s Blessings are separated into two eight-item categories: the Flickering Blessings and the Pale Blessings. Flickering mods are player-applied, in that they only come into picture if the player triggers them to cause an effect in combat. Pale mods, on the other hand, are applied by interacting with the Traveler’s Flowers strewn across the Pale Heart, and they incur various survival and ability boons.</p>
 <h3 id="h-all-flickering-blessings-in-the-pale-heart" data-injectable="false">All Flickering Blessings in the Pale Heart</h3> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li>Traveler’s Animus: Defeating a combatant has a chance to drop an Orb of Power or a random elemental Orb.</li> <li>Traveler’s Fervor: Sliding after sprinting for a short time sends out a burning line of fire in front of you, dealing Solar damage and incurring Scorched to affected enemies.</li> <li>Traveler’s Abundance: Defeating combatants with grenades has a chance to spawn Special ammo; defeating combatants with Super damage has a chance to spawn Heavy ammo.</li> <li>Traveler’s Transference: Sprinting for a short time applies Amplified; dealing melee damage to combatants while Amplified creates area-of-effect lightning bolts.</li> <li>Traveler’s Multiplicity: Finisher final blows convert your thrown grenade into an additional frag grenade.</li> <li>Traveler’s Diffraction: Defeating combatants with Void damage has a chance to spawn Void seeker rounds that seek out, damage, and Suppress other combatants.</li> <li>Traveler’s Proliferation: Defeating combatants with Strand damage spawns Threadlings; defeating Powerful combatants spawns multiple Threadlings at once.</li> <li>Traveler’s Sublimation: Rapidly defeating combatants with Stasis damage spawns a Stasis mine that damages and Freezes nearby combatants.</li> </ul> <h3 id="h-all-pale-blessings-in-the-pale-heart" data-injectable="false">All Pale Blessings in the Pale Heart</h3> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"> <li>Traveler’s Grace: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain the effect of another Traveler’s Blessing for a limited time.</li> <li>Traveler’s Insight: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased Super ability regeneration.</li> <li>Traveler’s Valor: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased Melee ability regeneration.</li> <li>Traveler’s Facet: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased class ability regeneration.</li> <li>Traveler’s Resurgence: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased Grenade ability regeneration.</li> <li>Traveler’s Aegis: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain a regenerating Overshield for a limited time.</li> <li>Traveler’s Remedy: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased health regeneration for a limited time.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">Each mod comes with its own timer, wherein some last 10 or 11 hours, while others might only stick around for 3 or 4 hours at a time. This, combined with the Traveler’s Blessings’ random drop nature is likely what has allowed Bungie to make them as potent as they are. So, make sure to use them when you’ve got ’em!</p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="false">My recommendation is to activate one of each of these mods whenever you’re going off to try and farm Pale Heart gear, as it’s bound to make the whole thing that much easier for the next couple of hours. Provided, of course, that you actually <em>lean</em> into the active Traveler’s Blessings in the first place!</p>

            <p>
Football Manager developer Sports Interactive has announced a four-year licensing partnership with The Premier League.
</p>
<p>
It means, for the first time ever, Football Manager players will be able to take their team to the top of English football, with all 20 clubs fully licensed including official logos, kits, and player photos.
</p>
<p>
The deal will begin with the 2024/25 season, due later this year.

<p>
"Since Football Manager's inception, we have always wanted to work with the Premier League, and we're delighted to announce today that at last we are", said Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson.
</p>
<p>
"The partnership isn't just about the huge in-game benefits it'll give our fans, but also the opportunities it provides us to help with the incredible things that the Premier League and their clubs do off the pitch. That includes community and charitable work, two things we're enormously passionate about, as well as the ability to work with some of their existing partners.
</p>
<p>
"We are very grateful to the Premier League and their other partners in our space for enabling us to be an officially licensed product of the world's most commercially successful football league."
</p>
<p>
Premier League chief commercial officer Will Brass added: "Football Manager has been a big part of the sporting landscape for decades, and is loved and enjoyed by millions of fans around the world. We are thrilled that the Premier League will now feature even more prominently in the game, helping to deliver a deeper, more authentic experience for anybody who takes on the challenge of managing a Premier League club."
</p>
<p>
Football Manager first released in 2005, after its previous iteration as Championship Manager that began in 1992. It's surprising, therefore, it's taken so long for The Premier League to be officially licensed.
</p>
<p>
"What should be a transitional year for Football Manager feels like a quietly revolutionary one, thanks to a handful of little changes with big impacts," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-2024-review">Eurogamer's Football Manager 2024 review</a>.

			<p>There won't be a Nintendo Direct broadcast this week, a known Brazilian Journalist has claimed.</p>
<p>Despite rumors claiming otherwise, Nintendo won't be airing a new Direct episode later this week. Luckily for Nintendo fans, however, there will be a new Nintendo Direct later this month.<br>
At least, that's what known Brazilian journalist @phluttilippe <a href="https://x.com/phluttilippe/status/1800044165394497990" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> on X earlier today. Although the journalist has claimed that the Direct will take place by the end of the month, the exact date for the broadcast isn't certain at this point. "There is no Nintendo Direct this week", the journalist wrote on X (Google translated). "End of the month, and as far as I know, the exact date isn't even certain yet."</p>
<p>Last month, Nintendo President Furukawa confirmed that there will be a Direct broadcast this month. During this event, Nintendo won't be talking about the Switch 2. "We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation", Furukawa said last month.</p>
<p>While this isn't a confirmation that there indeed won't be a Direct this week, the journalist has correctly revealed Nintendo-related details before official announcements in the past. Also, @phluttilippe was among the first to say that the Switch successor is slated for a release in March 2025, instead of this year. Of course, Nintendo has yet to officially unveil the Switch successor, but Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Furukawa recently confirmed that the Switch 2 will be announced before April 2025</a> (before the end of Nintendo's current fiscal year, which runs through March 2025).</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about Nintendo's plans for this month. Stay tuned.</p>

Harm to Snake’s body, including bruises and bullet wounds, as well as damage to his clothes, will be reflected in real time. “Any injuries to his actual body will leave their mark permanently,” reads the blurb, “telling a story of each player’s unique journey through the game.”</p><p>Despite the jokes about how messed up you will be able to make Snake look by the end of the game, players are genuinely excited about the feature, and especially how it feels so fitting to the franchise’s odd choices. <em>MGS</em> games are known for their weird design flourishes that seemingly have no real purpose beyond complexity. In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-dog-tags-aiming-mgs2-1851474122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-dog-tags-aiming-mgs2-1851474122"><em>MGS2</em></a></span> you can watch a cup of ice melt in real-time, and in the original <em>MGS3</em> you could win a fight against an aging sniper, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-boss-battle-solid-3-1849527921&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-boss-battle-solid-3-1849527921">The End</a></span>, by simply waiting seven real-world days for him to die of old age. As absurd as these features may sometimes seem, they always add to the depth and immersion of the world. The upgraded damage system of <em>MGS Delta</em> feels like a logical next step for the series, and many see it as a truly Kojima-level choice.</p><p>As for how far the new damage system will go, Konami hasn’t given details on what to expect beyond what’s explained in the short blurb on the website. My best guess is that all damage taken by Snake will be able to be healed (this is a video game after all) but will leave a lasting scar, eventually creating a tapestry of mistakes or close calls with death unique to you. Maybe death will leave an exceptionally deep scar on Snake to remind you of when and why you failed. In any case, it’s a fascinating tease of what’s to come in <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/industry-veterans-announce-copa-city-a-football-tycoon-title-and-the-first-from-new-studio-triple-espresso.896787/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/copa-city-a-football-tycoon-title-from-new-studio-triple-espresso/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=copa-city-a-football-tycoon-title-from-new-studio-triple-espresso<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Triple Espresso, a brand new game development studio consisting of industry veterans, has announced its first title: <em>Copa City</em>. This game takes football management in a new direction, having you control everything about the city hosting the biggest clubs and matches in the world. </p> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true"><em>Copa City</em> combines the strategic elements of a tycoon simulator with the electric themes of football to create something that feels altogether new and interesting, much like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-football-manager-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager</a></em> did when the very first entry was released. Just to be clear, this is soccer for you US folks, meaning you’ll be looking after all the hosting requirements and city management that come with major Premier League games and much from the same sport. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Triple Espresso</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><em>Copa City</em> is currently slated for a 2025 release window and is being developed for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. During the campaign, you’ll manage real-world cities and six fully licensed football clubs playing in them. The clubs include Arsenal FC, FC Bayern Munchen, and CR Flamengo, so definitely some of the bigger names out there. </p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">Your overarching goal with every match is to help the city gear up for the event and even get excited about it. This includes organizing how roadblocks must be set up, advertising, where fans can sit, and more. It reminds me a lot of the final match Leicester had to play in the Premier League in the 2015/16 season. </p> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true">The team was going to win the league regardless of the outcome, but more people watched it and were excited about it and the ensuring victory parade that occurred after than I’ve ever seen before. Everyone was talking about it, but the amount of management that must have gone into organizing every aspect of the match and everything that followed must have been monumental. </p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">I believe that’s the goal of <em>Copa City</em>: to put you in the shoes of the people working to facilitate that excitement in the best ways possible. You have all the responsibilities that come with keeping people and businesses in the city safe without all the team management, but you’re also rooting for one particular outcome so you can put on a fantastic show. </p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">The game is being developed by veterans from across the industry who have worked on titles such as <em>Watch Dogs</em>, <em>Dying Light 2</em>, and <em>Pure Farming 2018</em>, as well as football experts who have a wealth of knowledge to make the experience feel great for fans of football and strategy games alike. </p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://copacity.club/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Copa City</a></em> is entering a space that the <em>Football Manager</em> and, to a degree, <em>EA Sports FC</em> have owned for over a decade. It’ll be interesting to see if it resonates with fans and can make a dent where fans love stats and want more management options at their fingertips. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-new-stalker-2-trailer-is-really-selling-the-game-for-me/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-new-stalker-2-trailer-is-really-selling-the-game-for-me<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="306" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been following along with the development of <em>Stalker 2</em>, you’ll be well aware of the turmoil the studio has had to endure. With GSC Game World having to flee to Prague to escape the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the future of the long-awaited horror FPS remained uncertain at one point.</p> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">We know it had to be delayed for fairly obvious reasons, pushing the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-to-september-5-2024/">release date back to September 5</a>. Now, the latest trailer has been released, and it’s really whetting my appetite for <em>Heart of Chornobyl</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Серце Чорнобиля — Трейлер «Час Можливостей»" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6HH5kKLAlw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">The gloomy backdrop of the Exclusion Zone has never looked prettier than in the “Time of Opportunities” teaser the developer put out yesterday. While many of us strongly suspect <em>Stalker 2</em> is going to be quite something, I now cannot wait for it to finally arrive.</p> <h2 id="h-heart-and-soul" data-injectable="false">Heart and soul</h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">That’s not to say I was ignorant of the game until now. Though I admit, I haven’t really played any of the other entries in the series, aside from a brief stint of the first game. But that doesn’t mean it hasn’t intrigued me, largely because it’s been fifteen years since GSC released the last installment, <em>Call of Pripyat</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">At any rate, the new trailer really shows off what’s almost certainly going to be a pretty solid horror FPS. I know I’m not alone in saying that it gives me mad <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016800/Chernobylite_Complete_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chernobylite</a></em> vibes, which I have played and did enjoy.</p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="false">It has, indeed, been a long and worrisome road for the development team, but whatever tribulations have come their way, they’ve remained steadfast in their completion of <em>Stalker 2</em>. I truly hope it pays off for them, because it looks fantastic. Look, just go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wishlist the game on Steam</a> already.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-it-worth-pulling-stringmaster-without-yinlin-in-wuthering-waves.896781/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/is-it-worth-pulling-stringmaster-without-yinlin-wuthering-waves/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-it-worth-pulling-stringmaster-without-yinlin-wuthering-waves<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="343" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With Yinlin’s release in <em>Wuthering Waves, </em>came her signature weapon, Stringmaster, a 5-Star Rectifier with a lot of power behind it. If you’re curious about pulling Stringmaster without getting Yinlin, or if you’re wondering if you should even pull the weapon at all, then I’ve got all that you need to know right here.</p> <h2 id="h-is-it-worth-rolling-for-stringmaster-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Is it worth rolling for Stringmaster in <em>Wuthering Waves?</em></h2> <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">The short and sweet answer is a resounding <strong>yes</strong>. Stringmaster is an insanely powerful 5-Star Rectifier that completely dwarfs its standard counterpart, Cosmic Ripples, in all aspects except for raw ATK%. It makes up for its lack of ATK% main stat with a CRIT RATE main stat instead, and that makes it absurdly universal for any characters that use Rectifiers for damage. To put that statement into a reasonable perspective,<strong> </strong>Stringmaster is <strong>Encore’s BiS (Best in Slot) </strong>weapon as of Yinlin’s release, and it’s not even close.</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">As a stat stick, Stringmaster is already a pretty insane weapon, coming with a CRIT RATE stat that scales higher than any other CRIT RATE weapon in the game. However, Stringmaster’s passive ability also provides a significant damage boost to any character that makes use of their Resonance Skill as a primary aspect for dishing out damage. This, again, is why characters like Encore want Stringmaster so badly.</p>

There’s also an equally high chance that his new theoretical Rectifier will be just as strong or stronger than Stringmaster. However, looking at Stringmaster as a whole, its high innate CRIT RATE always gives it a potent niche for characters to abuse. Even if it’s knocked down a peg or two, this weapon will never be outright useless in my opinion. </p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">Even if Stringmaster is eventually outclassed by another 5-Star Rectifier, it will likely remain the second-best choice for a long time for most DPS-focused Rectifier characters. Stringmaster’s mixture of universal useful stats and powerful passive ability that all characters can make use of make it a very safe pick for players looking to pick up an additional 5-Star Rectifier for their arsenals.</p>
 <p data-characters="640" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="false">In <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, thanks to the weapon banner being a guaranteed pick of your choice, weapons actually have a slightly higher value than characters from an account overview standpoint in terms of account progression. The reason is that 4-Star weapons, in general, are far weaker than practically any 5-Star weapon you can obtain. This intrinsically boosts the value of pulling Stringmaster from Yinlin’s banner, as the more 5-Star weapons you have on your account, the better off your characters will be, especially since you can freely swap around weapons and gear during <em>Wuthering Wave’s </em>endgame content, Tower of Adversity.</p>

		<p>Football Manager 2025 will have the official license for the Premier League for the first time, as the Premier League and Sports Interactive have penned a four-year licensing partnership.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official Premier League Licence coming to Football Manager" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rircYvbkhk0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting with the 2024/25 season, Football Manager will have all 20 Premier League clubs included with fully licensed logos, kits and player photos for the real sporting figures throughout.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson said, “Since Football Manager’s inception, we have always wanted to work with the Premier League, and we’re delighted to announce today that at last we are.”</p>
<p>This will add a further layer of authenticity to the game, though it already has numerous leagues, teams and competitions licensed – in England, for example, the Premier League is the cherry on the top of having the EFL and National League structures in <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-2024-licences">FM24</a>, and there’s several of the major European leagues and the UEFA club competitions already featured as well.</p>

<p>Jacobson continued:</p>
<p>“The partnership isn’t just about the huge in-game benefits it’ll give our fans, but also the opportunities it provides us to help with the incredible things that the Premier League and their clubs do off the pitch. That includes community and charitable work, two things we’re enormously passionate about, as well as the ability to work with some of their existing partners.”</p>
<p>More details on how the Premier League will be integrated into Football Manager will be revealed later this year, as and when Sports Interactive start to talk about this year’s entry.</p>
<p>However, we do know that this year’s game is going to be a massive shift for Sports Interactive. The studio confirmed last year that they would be switching game engines to Unity, which will allow for a whole new UI, better optimised graphics per platform – from mobile to console and PC – and a completely overhauled matchday experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/football-manager-2024-review/">FM24</a> was the first time that you were able to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/30/football-manager-2024-will-support-football-manager-23-saves/">import a previous year’s save</a> and continue on with the new enhancements and systems, and we expect that this will also be possible with FM25. It’s also been a few years since Sports Interactive announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/23/womens-football-is-coming-to-football-manager-not-for-2022/">their intention to bring women’s football into Football Manager</a> with a number of specific and bespoke touches to try to accurately simulate the women’s game and the different challenges it can present when compared to the men’s game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-premier-league-licensing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>developer Sports Interactive has announced that it's secured a four-year licensing deal with the Premier League, the biggest league in English football.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the football (if you're expecting me to call it "soccer", you're out of luck) management sim will include all 20 Premier League clubs starting from the 2024/25 season.</p>
<p>Those clubs will come complete with their official logos, player lineups, and kits, and you'll also see authentic player photos for each player, bringing you that much closer to your dream of being a Premier League manager.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-premier-league-deal-menu.jpg?itok=HPr8PJQS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-premier-league-deal-menu.jpg?itok=INUTjCh9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Premier League is officially coming to&nbsp;<em>Football Manager </em>for the first time.</figcaption></figure><p>While individual teams such as Brighton &amp; Hove Albion or Manchester City have featured as licenses in&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>games, they were usually included as part of other leagues or tournaments.</p>
<p>This deal marks the first time the full Premier League has been available in a&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>game, and given that many of the series' players likely hail from the UK, this is a pretty big deal.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson says it's always been his studio's dream to work with the Premier League, and he's "delighted" that the deal has finally come to pass.</p>
<p>Premier League CCO Will Brass, for his part, says&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>represents a "big part of the sporting landscape", and that the inclusion of the Premier League in the game will help to "deliver a deeper, more authentic experience".</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's a football management sim series that's been running since 1992 in one form or another.</p>
<p>The series debuted as&nbsp;<em>Championship Manager</em>, but became&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>after the controversial release of 2003's&nbsp;<em>Championship Manager 4</em>, which saw developer Sports Interactive switch to Sega for future series installments (as well as the name change).</p>
<p><em>Championship Manager&nbsp;</em>continued in various forms for a number of years, but no new games have been released in that franchise for a while, leaving&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>at the top of its rather lonely league table.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-preview-and-qa-wide-linear-soulslite-with-20-hours-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a>, the next game from New Zealand developer Aurora44 (the same studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ashen-not-dark-but-soul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashen</a>), finally got its release date announcement during yesterday's Xbox Game Showcase: the game is slated to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on July 18.</p>
<p>With only a month and a week left before the release date, we were able to get our hands on a demo of the game that goes live today on Steam Next Fest. Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn definitely shares quite a few similarities with the studio's previous work, being a Souls-lite action RPG with adventure elements.</p>
<p>However, the setting is certainly unique. This is a fantasy world where magic and the gods are very much real; in fact, the so-called Gods of the Great Below assault the living world with their armies of undead. This is when the demo and, indeed, the whole game begins.</p>
<p>Protagonist Nor Vanek (played by Olive Gray) is an orphan adopted into the Coalition Army, the defensive force that fights desperately against the invasion of the Gods. She was trained as a Sapper from a young age under the tutelage of Baz, a grizzled war veteran who is essentially her adoptive father. At the very beginning of the game, Baz (played by Elias Toufexis of Deus Ex fame) goes with a couple of squad members on a nearly suicidal mission to try and bomb the gate of the dead once and for all. Nor is initially left behind but quickly joins the group when she learns of their arduous task. A big creature eventually ambushes the party and, in the hectic fight, Nor does something to the gate that actually makes things worse for everyone.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/14_Game_Screen_Combat_Traveller_Boss-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>However, shortly afterward, she gains a companion in Enki, a fox-like creature who turns out to be a minor god himself. Enki (played by Alistair Petrie) warns Nor of the dire situation the whole world is in and offers his help in defeating the other gods. Enki's powers include the ability to curse enemies, for instance to fill the priming gauge with successful melee attacks to trigger an instant takedown of an unarmored enemy, and the Witherings, powerful attacks that consume the Withering gauge, which gets filled by defeating enemies). Enki (who's not nearly as chatty as Forspoken's Cuff, in case you were worried) can also help with rift-based magic traversal that allows Nor to reach otherwise inaccessible paths.</p>
<p>This is often where you'll find secondary content, such as Enki's feathers, which can be collected to augment the companion's power level, or even hamlets that need to be freed from the enemy's yoke. In this case, you can head directly to the enemy leader - once defeated, all the other enemies will disappear, restoring the original population to unlock a reward, a secondary quest, and the ability to play the mini-game called Sebo.</p>
<p>Speaking of combat, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is a relatively fast-paced soulslite that feels fun but not overly complex to play. As suggested by the title, there's a fairly strong emphasis on firearms. With your gamepad's right trigger, you can use black power charges (recharged by landing successful melee attacks) to deal damage and stop certain enemy attacks. These can be woven into melee combo chains. Players can also equip up to two secondary firearms to be aimed and reloaded with their own ammunition. There's even a Gears of War-like active reload system that rewards a properly timed reload with increased damage on the next shot. Grenades are also available when you need to deal area of effect damage.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FLINTLOCK_Gameplay_SCREENSHOT_UHD_003-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, much of the game still involves melee attacks, blocks, and parries. Holding the left shoulder button enters a blocking stance, but only pressing the block button right after being hit will parry the attack, allowing players to execute a melee counter-attack. There's also a double dodge for when you really need to get out of the way of an unblockable attack. Each combat action builds Reputation, which is the game's primary currency.</p>
<p>In an intriguing twist, you can either 'bank it' right away or grow up your Reputation multiplier; do note that being hit automatically resets the multiplier and banks the Reputation. Of course, if you are defeated, the Reputation is lost and you'll have one chance to get it back, just like in a proper Soulslike game. You'll respawn at the nearest Lodestone, the equivalent of a bonfire in a Souls game. You can rest here (which respawns enemies, of course), as well as check your inventory and skills. Players must spend Reputation to unlock new skills in the three available trees (Powder, which increases ranged damage; Magic, which augments magic damage; and Steel, which bolsters melee damage).</p>
<p>Visually, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn features some of New Zealand's native plants and trees. The developers said some of the game's fauna is a tribute to the Moa bird. Moreover, the Three Peaks area is heavily inspired by New Zealand's South Island regions. The landscape of this region is modeled after the Southern Alps. The game (powered by Unreal Engine 4) looks good without being spectacular. On PC, it already supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution (with a slider to tweak the sharpness) and Frame Generation, as well as Intel XeSS. AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution is strangely missing from this build, although XeSS is available cross-vendor, so that wouldn't be too much of an issue. However, there's quite a bit of stuttering that I certainly hope will be fixed or at least lessened before the full launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn PC Preview 4K Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_YU-9QS-mN8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Overall, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn feels like a competent and fun soulslite that is, however, unlikely to stand out from the crowd for its quality. Still, the budget pricing ($40, with a 10% discount currently available ahead of launch) and the day-one availability on Game Pass make it an enticing title for anyone interested in the genre and setting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24173133/an-extremely-goofy-movie-tiktok-maxley-ship-beret-girl<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="yG2wxz"><em>One of the best parts of the human experience is having a </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22929389/best-anime-crushes"><em>big ol’ crush</em></a><em> — the pitter-patter of your heartbeat, the swell of euphoria when you see the object of your affections, the desire to just squeal with joy! At Polygon, though, we’re very flexible about how we interpret “crush.” Brief-yet-intense infatuations </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2019/11/6/20944180/69-biggest-movies-tv-games-crushes-decade"><em>don’t necessarily have to be on real people</em></a><em> (or even on people!), or even romantic. Since I have many many (many) crushes, I’ve decided to share the energy of writing their names over and over again in sparkly gel pen in a journal.</em></p>

<p id="sVZj4q">The 2000 animated Disney direct-to-video comedy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/3/28/18261900/best-disney-sequels-movies-animation"><em>An Extremely Goofy Movie</em></a> is back in the zeitgeist at the moment. There’s been a sudden wave of fan-created <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shibah_art/video/7371104206431784198">animatics</a> of Goofy’s son <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@d00dlesp00dle/photo/7369081209130896656">Max and his rival</a>, the skateboarding frat boy Bradley Uppercrust III, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@d00dlesp00dle/video/7370868918186937616">flooding</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@d00dlesp00dle/video/7367711589648157968">TikTok</a>. Their relationship even clocked in at No. 6 on last week’s <a href="https://fandom.tumblr.com/post/752293738864361472/movies">Tumblr Fandometric ranking for movies</a>, with the tag full of <a href="https://silkoodles.tumblr.com/post/752056220985311232/from-this-gif-set-i-just-love-when-a-decades-old">romantic fan art</a>. Most of the resurgence is focused on the “Maxley” ship between Max and Bradley, and it’s clear what’s driving that: There’s an enduring appeal in an enemies-to-lovers pairing. And some of these edits also toss in some queer longing to really drive up the drama. </p>
<p id="bCqNux">But personally, when I think of <em>An Extremely Goofy Movie</em>, the first thing that comes to mind is Beret Girl. </p>
<div id="YwhFJR"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K8u8Y1j1zf8?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="IUdOhJ">Goofy’s son Max and his pals first meet the mysterious, never named beret-clad gal when she performs a slam poem at some hip café. But that isn’t her most awesome moment. After Bradley gets aggressive with Max at her show, she swoops in to put Bradley in his place, getting the entire café to aggressively snap at him until he and his cronies leave. She’s striking and creative and has a killer sense of fashion, with her commitment to the all-black look and that sultry purple eyeliner. </p>
<p id="SlX84n">Since Beret Girl isn’t credited with an actual name, many <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dawn.kirkland/video/7293214379510680874">Disney fans</a> have decided her name is Mocha Chino, since Bradley calls her “little Miss Mochaccino” to dismiss her. But that does make for a pretty sick name, so we’re reclaiming it from Bradley! </p>
<p id="0symRn">When I first watched this movie as a kid in the early 2000s, it gave me completely unrealistic expectations for how cool college would be. Namely that there would be artsy spoken-word poetry events in underground cafés, campus librarians would be into disco, and everyone would be <em>really</em> invested in skateboarding. (Maybe this was true in the year 2000, but it wasn’t true a decade later.) But Beret Girl gave me <em>the</em> most unrealistic expectation: that there would be beautiful, rhyming black-clad girls around to chew out all the douchey frat boys.</p>

<p id="LAq3pM">Rewatching <em>An Extremely Goofy Movie</em> today is a fun nostalgia trip, and the current wave of TikToks and Tumblr art has reminded me that there definitely is a lot of homoerotic tension going on with Max and Bradley. I love that people are rewatching or discovering the film, and finding joy in giving Bradley and Max’s antagonistic relationship a flirtatious and romantic edge. </p>
<p id="IqbLuH">But personally, I’m still out here replaying Beret Girl’s two minutes of screen time over and over and over again. Suddenly, I’m back in third grade, watching <em>An Extremely Goofy Movie </em>in class, because we had a substitute teacher without a lesson plan. And this super cool, confident, artsy girl takes center stage, commanding a room with her presence. She makes an impression! I latched on to how cool she was at age 8, and I never fully let go, even if that kinda evolved from wanting to hang out with her to wanting to be her to wanting to hold her hand and have her defend me from Bradley Uppercrust III. </p>
<p id="t6iuon">Once again, I am doomed to love a background character this week. Maybe next time I’ll find a worthy crush in a main character. Hopefully you’re having a better time of it than I am. Let me know who you’re crushing on!</p>

<p>The dates for the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Beta may have been leaked thanks to a GAME UK store listing card. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1800153990354837582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">store listing card</a>, the Black Ops 6 closed pre-order Beta will run from August 28 – September 3. In the United States, that happens to fall during the Labor Day holiday weekend.</p>



<p>The beta also follows the Call of Duty NEXT event that’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-call-of-duty-next-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled for August 28</a>. That event will showcase the game in full, including multiplayer and zombies. Both of those modes are seeing major new changes compared to Modern Warfare 2 and 3, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-omnidirectional-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">omnidirectional sliding, diving, and sprinting</a>.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-modern-warfare-2-and-3-content-won-t-carry-forward-to-black-ops-6">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-2-and-3-content-wont-carry-forward-to-black-ops-6/">Modern Warfare 2 and 3 Content Won’t Carry Forward To Black Ops 6</a></h6>



<p>If last year’s Modern Warfare 3 Beta is any indication, this year’s should also give players a look into the game’s multiplayer with access to limited modes, maps, and more.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision and Microsoft about the potential beta dates. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is the Starfield Creation Kit Free? – Answered]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-creation-kit-free-answered/</link>

<p>One of the most significant announcements for Starfield fans, second only to the reveal of Shattered Space, was the shadow drop for the Starfield Creation Kit. It’s the tool necessary to create unique mods, like additional ship modules, quests, and creatures. It’ll enhance the gameplay and significantly improve Starfield’s longevity. But is the Starfield Creation Kit free?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-download-the-starfield-creation-kit-for-free">Can You Download the Starfield Creation Kit for Free?</h2>



<p>It’s relatively easy to confuse the Starfield Creation Club with the Creation Kit. The former is a paid mod service with creations approved by Bethesda and sold for top dollar. The latter, however, is a free-to-use toolset that allows savvy users to create game modifications to enhance Starfield’s gameplay tenfold. It’s one of the most requested features we’ve all been waiting for, and it’s finally here!</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can download the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Starfield Creation Kit on Steam</a> and share your game modifications with other users. There are options. You can share them via Starfield Creation Club, attempt to partner with Bethesda to release a paid mod with their approval, or use the tried-and-true method of launching a mod on Nexus. Your prospective fans will prefer the latter.</p>







<h2 id="h-are-starfield-mods-free">Are Starfield Mods Free?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are two varieties of game mods available for Starfield: unofficial user-made mods, typically found on Nexus, or the Bethesda-approved variety, found in the Creation Club. The latter costs money. You can buy Starfield Creation Credits to purchase these mods for:</p>



<ul>
<li>500 Creation Credits – $4.99</li>



<li>1000 Creation Credits – $9.99</li>



<li>2700 Creation Credits – $24.99</li>



<li>5500 Creation Credits – $49.99</li>
</ul>



<p>Alternatively, if you’d rather not pay for mods, which is a stance most will likely take, you can visit Nexus to download user-made mods entirely free. Some mod authors charge for their work, but they usually host them separately from Nexus, like on Discord or Patreon, and they’re upfront about the cost.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you’re a fan of RPGs, then you’ll want to keep an eye out for the Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred release date, too! While we patiently await the slew of new games launching this year, now’s a good time to sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Microsoft touched on the future of Gears, insisting “this isn’t the end of other ongoing stories in the Gears series.”</p><p>“The team is content with the stories told in Gears 4 and Gears 5 and is by no means abandoning them, but the collective passion for such an iconic origin story was simply too great to ignore,” Microsoft said. ”The story of E-Day and the origins of Marcus and Dom are such powerful, pivotal events that The Coalition couldn’t wait to tell it.”</p><p><em><strong>Warning:</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Gears 5 follow.</em></p><p>2019’s Gears 5 ends on something of a cliffhanger, with Kait telling Marcus Fenix she’s off to hunt down Queen Reyna. Beforehand, the player, aka Kait, decides to save either JD Fenix or Del, leaving Reyna to kill the other.</p><p>Gears of War: E-Day, however, is set 14 years before the events of Gears of War 1, and tells the story of Emergence Day (the day the Locust burst out from under the earth to attack Sera).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Gears of War: E-Day Trailer Screenshots - Xbox Games Showcase 2024</h3></div></output><p>In the Xbox Wire post, The Coalition creative director Matt Searcy and brand director Nicole Fawcette discussed the decision to make a prequel next, rather than the perhaps expected Gears 6. “We’re super proud about Gears 4 and Gears 5 and the stories that were told,” Fawcette said. “We’re not retreating from that storyline in any way. But in [this] moment, we had an opportunity to write our next step, and this one just felt too good to miss.”</p><p>In a follow-up interview with IGN, Searcy expanded on the decision. “For us, there is a story here for our studio of how we found our way to E-Day that was about reflection,” Searcy explained. “And part of it is just the energy that rolls up about, this was the story we wanted to tell at this time. So it wasn't really about picking between these things, it was just a snowball of the stuff that was on the table and this is the one we wanted to do right now.</p><p>“We love those characters. It's really nice to have a franchise where we can tell stories in different places. For us, this is just the one we wanted to work on now, this is the one that felt right.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The decision to go with a prequel was a topic of discussion when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-phil-spencer-ign-live-interview-on-the-health-of-xbox-handhelds-and-more">IGN interviewed Xbox boss Phil Spencer at IGN Live</a>. Spencer said doing a prequel instead of Gears 6 is “a nice opportunity for that team to establish their Gears.”</p><p>“Following on Gears 5 just because of the numerical thing, I think it would just… this was an opportunity for them to take it back to an origin story that has a lot of real depth to it in terms of Emergence Day and tell that story through The Coalition as it is today,” Spencer said. “I thought, what a great opportunity. I was excited.”</p><p>The question, of course, is with Gears of War: E-Day in active development at The Coalition, it may be some time before Microsoft continues the overarching Gears storyline with a potential Gears 6. Some fans have suggested another team be handed the responsibility of continuing the story in partnership with The Coalition, but Microsoft has yet to indicate a willingness to do so.</p><p>Gears of War: E-Day is currently without a release window.

In already released promotional material for the game, we can see Rook as a Human. According to tweets from Bioware’s Mike Gamble, who is leading the next Mass Effect at the studio, you can also have your Rook be an Elf, Dwarf, or Qunari.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Of course</p>— Michael Gamble (@GambleMike) <a href="https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1799933097271771365?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Of course</p>— Michael Gamble (@GambleMike) <a href="https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1799939933395923427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Another snippet of info from Gamble is confirmation that companion armor can be changed out, which is an important feature for fans.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">Yes</p>— Michael Gamble (@GambleMike) <a href="https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1799932740768600438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>BioWare’s Dragon Age: The Veilguard reveal leans heavily on the cast of seven companions who join Rook on their adventure. Indeed Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s first trailer, shown off during Microsoft’s Xbox Games Showcase, introduces all seven companions. Here's the list, per publisher EA:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Bellara, a creative and romantic Veil Jumper obsessed with uncovering ancient secrets.</li><li>Davrin, a bold and charming Grey Warden who has made a name for himself as a monster hunter.</li><li>Emmrich, a necromancer of Nevarra's Mourn Watch who comes complete with a skeletal assistant, Manfred.</li><li>Harding, the dwarven scout, returns to the fray as a companion with her big heart, a positive outlook, and a ready bow – as well as unexpected magical powers.</li><li>Lucanis, a poised &amp; pragmatic assassin who descends from the bloodline of the House of Crows, a criminal organization renowned throughout Thedas.</li><li>Neve, a cynic fighting for a better future, both as a private detective and a member of Tevinter's rebellious Shadow Dragons.</li><li>Taash, a dragon hunter allied with the Lords of Fortune who lives for adventure and doesn't mind taking risks.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>BioWare previously confirmed that Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be centered around these companions, prompting the name change from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay"><u>In an exclusive interview with IGN</u></a>, BioWare general manager Gary McKay revealed some more details on what to expect from The Veilguard, as well as explaining some of the logic behind the name change.</p><p>“One thing that’s important to remind fans is that every Dragon Age game is a new and different experience and this game, more so than ever, is about you and your companions – a group that you must rally to fight by your side,” McKay told IGN at the time. “...“In the end, it was most important for us to have a title that was authentic to the companions that are the heart of this adventure we’ve created."</p><p>The Veilguard has a fall 2024 release window, with a gameplay reveal set for June 11.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        <p>Offbrand Game's first title is the sequel to 2017's platform fighter Rivals of Aether</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Content studio Offbrand has branched out into games, having launched its publishing division Offbrand Games.</p>
<p>Announced at <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ludwig-announces-new-video-game-publisher-offbrand-games-ign-live-2024">IGN Live</a>, content creator Ludwig Ahgren shared that he was partnering with Jason "Thor" Hall, founder of independent studio Pirate Software.</p>
<p>Offbrand Games' first title is the sequel to Aether Studio's fighting platformer Rivals of Aether, which initially launched in 2017.</p>
<p>"I've seen many other creators wanting to create publishing houses, but what always gets me is seeing indie studios getting crushed by these publishers," said Hall.</p>
<p>"I don't want this to happen anymore. So I'm excited to do this and lead Offbrand Games in a direction where that doesn't happen."</p>
<p>Ahgren added: "The dream is for developers to focus on making the best game possible with all the time and resources, then I can hopefully show as many people as possible what the cool game they made is and have people play it."</p>
<p>Offbrand was founded in 2022 by Ahgren and Mogul Moves president Nick Allen.</p>
<p>"From the beginning, our goal was to deepen creator ties to game developers and create mutually beneficial partnerships for all involved," Allen wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rnickallen_big-day-of-announcements-at-offbrand-as-we-ugcPost-7205023119013519360-CtPb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android">LinkedIn</a>. "Over a year in the making, we're bringing that vision to life."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/10/cod-black-ops-6-is-always-online-even-for-campaign/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In the tiniest of small print tucked away on a support page for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, Activision has revealed that their latest COD will require an active internet connection to play any and all game modes, including the single player campaign.</p>
<p>Per Activision’s support page, this is for texture streaming, in an effort to keep install sizes down:</p>


<blockquote><p>To deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game’s overall storage space on your hard drive, <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</i> will use texture streaming across all game modes. This means you’ll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign. If you’re on a console, Campaign can be played without a premium subscription service such as Game Pass Core or PlayStation Plus.</p></blockquote>
<p>Smaller game installs might sound great, but… how small will it make the game? Well, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-cross-gen-bundle/9p5hv0hvztsk">the Xbox store page</a> for Black Ops 6 puts it at a still eye-watering 309.85GB – a figure that is certainly subject to change.</p>
<p>It’s certainly a… unique reason for a game to be always online, though we have seen this technology used in the past. Microsoft Flight Simulator used streaming in of world assets to keep the initial game install size manageable with basic assets and then dynamically bring in regional terrain, landmarks and building types. These can also be loaded in in advance by users, and the dynamic cache size managed in the settings.</p>
<p>In recent years, Call of Duty has ballooned in size as more and more components are brought into the melting pot of game content. Campaign, multiplayer, Zombies and the standalone Warzone can all draw upon a shared pool of assets, and there’s also core assets shared between Black Ops Cold War, Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3. However, users have had control over installing and uninstalling additional data that each mode uses, potentially saving tens of GB from the total install size.</p>

<p>However, it’s still complete and utter bobbins that Black Ops 6 will require an online connection and cannot have a fallback mode for offline play. We’ll see if Activision can provide clarity on what happens here, as an internet outage could stop you from enjoying the game’s campaign. Will there be a provision for those with large enough storage to download the full package? It also means that, as with other online-only games, Black Ops 6’s campaign will now be beholden to Activision and Microsoft keeping the content servers online.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming out for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One and PC on 25th October, with a day one launch into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-10-new-biome-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Pugstorm and publisher Fireshine Games have revealed what's coming as part of the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0 update.</p>
<p>It looks like this update, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-release-date">set to arrive in August</a> alongside the game's console release, is going to be a very big one indeed, so even seasoned&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>players should have something new to look forward to.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/4177730768830262249">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>Steam page, the 1.0 update is set to bring a new biome, the conclusion to the game's ongoing story arc, and a player-versus-player system, plus lots more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-1.0-new-stuff-pvp.jpg?itok=E5kY9VD0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-1.0-new-stuff-pvp.jpg?itok=y6LT6P-U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to challenge your fellow&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>players to glorious combat? You'll soon be able to do just that.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, you can look forward to a new world generation system that will not only let you customize your world's parameters, but also allow you to share world seeds with other players.</p>
<p>This being the full&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>experience, you can also expect the conclusion of the game's main story arc in the 1.0 release, as well as a new endgame biome called The Passage, which will be "full of hazardous flora and otherworldly fauna".</p>
<p>If you're looking to settle some grievances old-school-style in&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>, you'll also be pleased to know that a PvP system is being introduced in 1.0. You'll be able to toggle whether you want your world to be PvP-enabled or not.</p>
<p>New combat styles, Mage and Warlock, are also coming. The Mage style has you slinging spells from a distance, while the Warlock style is all about summoning minions and getting them to do your bidding.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn't everything that's coming in&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0. You can also look forward to new bosses, new equipment, new enemies, and plenty more, as well as tons of bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>To put it simply, it sounds like even if you feel like you've gotten everything that you possibly can from&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>, this update could well make you change your mind.</p>
<p><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0 launches on August 27th across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009534" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/core-keeper-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

It does not, usually, have anything to do with an internet connection.</p><p>The claim appears to be that they intend to stream textures across your internet in order to reduce the game’s already enormous install size on your hard drive. <em>CodBlops 6</em> is reported to take up almost 310 GB on an Xbox, which is already ludicrous—and this, it seems, is <em>without</em> its high-res textures.</p><p>Over a decade ago, various publishers—most especially Activision Blizzard and Ubisoft at the time—experimented with demanding always-on internet connections to be able to play a large range of single-player games. It was widely condemned, clearly put in place as some sort of anti-piracy measure, but utterly useless since pirated versions of the games would have the online checks removed. In other words, it was a feature that only achieved making official versions of games less functional than illegitimate downloads. The only people it negatively affected were those with unreliable internet connections.<br></p><p>The same is true today. <em>Call of Duty</em> has been pulling this  on PC players for a few years worth of releases now, despite PC HDDs and SSDs likely being <em>far </em>more vast than those on consoles. (The PC I’m writing this on has a total storage space across multiple drives of over 18 terabytes. My Xbox Series S has one terabyte.) This becomes even more starkly strange when you learn that the PC install size for <em>Blops 6</em> is 149 GB (or as low as 78 GB if you already have <em>COD HQ </em>and <em>Warzone</em> installed from previous games). But this year marks the first time the same online demands are being hoisted&nbsp;on console owners.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Activision to ask them how much install space is being saved by this scheme, and indeed for more details on how an internet connection is going to support the same streaming speeds for high-resolution textures that can be achieved between components inside the same machine. We’ve also asked how this might affect those with slow or unreliable connections (as is the case for the vast majority of the developing world, as well as rural areas of developed nations), and whether they will as a consequence not be able to play, or experience terrible texture pop-in.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ManaGame/status/1800090583861690566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, the official Visions of Mana account announced that a launch date trailer is finally coming June 12, 2024.</p>



<p>According to today’s post, the trailer will premiere at 11:45 BST / 03:45 PDT. The YouTube premiere feature results in leaks now and then, but Square Enix only has some plot details in its description. </p>



<p>The trailer description doesn’t reveal anything new. It simply reiterates that “Val, the protagonist, and his childhood friend Hinna, the newly appointed Alm of Fire, set off on a journey to the Mana Tree.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Previously, Square Enix announced during the latest Xbox Developer Direct that Visions of Mana will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch in Summer 2024</a>. The new trailer for Visions of Mana will finally give fans a concrete date.</p>



<p>Many hoped that Visions of Mana was coming to Game Pass at launch, partly due to the Xbox site itself. Unfortunately, Square Enix revealed last January that Visions of Mana <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-not-releasing-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t coming to Game Pass</a>. A Microsoft spokesperson explained there are also no plans to do so.</p>



<p>Visions of Mana will mark the first mainline entry in over a decade, and centers on a festival in Tianeea, the Fire Village.</p>



<p>Square Enix first announced Visions of Mana during The Game Awards 2023. It will be available on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, including both current and last-gen consoles. </p>

In the rush to get the coveted Worlds First win, several teams streaming the raid began to mute their mics or took their stream offline entirely so that other teams couldn't copy their methods for clearing parts of the activity. Destiny legend Datto resorted to streaming just his face as the game went onto an audience of tens of thousands--and several fans complained about how these measures took some of the thrill out of watching teams complete what is arguably the most important raid in Destiny's history.</p><p>Fortunately, the unlocked Excision mission didn't disappoint, as this was open to all players following Team Parabellum's successful completion of Salvation's Edge. Excision, which plays like the climatic last stand of Avengers: Endgame, is a massive throwdown involving 12 players, the Vanguard, coalition forces, and even the Witch Queen herself, Savathun, in a last-ditch effort to take down the Witness.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4316429-destiny2-2024_06_08-15_27_31.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316429" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4316429-destiny2-2024_06_08-15_27_31.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316429"></a><figcaption>All hands on deck.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4316429-destiny2-2024_06_08-15_27_31.png"></figure><p>Once that fight was over, players were treated to the true conclusion to The Final Shape and the last 10 years of Destiny, as well as a few subtle hints at where the franchise will head next now that the Witness is out of the picture.</p><p>Overall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">The Final Shape has been well received</a> since it launched last week, with the game's community commending the expansion for delivering a worthy finale after a decade of storytelling, expansions, and foreshadowing.</p><p>The rest of the year will see Bungie focus on Episodes, a trilogy of post-launch content that will unfold over the next year. <a href="https://x.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1799426502766796903" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bungie also plans to provide further details</a> on the next year of Destiny 2 in a livestream, kicking off at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/no-more-logo-packs-all-20-premier-league-teams-are-coming-to-football-manager/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=no-more-logo-packs-all-20-premier-league-teams-are-coming-to-football-manager<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="255" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">All 20 of England’s Premier League clubs are officially coming to <em>Football Manager</em>, with Sports Interactive announcing a multi-year agreement with the world’s most popular league to bring the clubs, logos, kits, and player photos to the game. </p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">Starting with the 2024/25 season, the entire league will be officially represented in the game, meaning you no longer have to download logo packs to get their badges and kits added to your database. The move means that the top six divisions in the English football pyramid will be officially in the game, from the top flight all the way down to the Vanarama National League North and South. </p> <figure data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Official Premier League Licence coming to Football Manager" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rircYvbkhk0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">In the official blog post, Sports Interactive described the Premier League as “the pinnacle of domestic football,” stating that it’s “defined by iconic on-pitch events and memories spanning more than three decades,” with a manager behind each memorable moment, much like “every great <em>Football Manager</em> story.”</p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true">“Whether you’re attempting to mastermind the futures of Liverpool or Arsenal, chase European football with Crystal Palace, or maximize Ipswich Town’s return to the big time, you’ll be immersed in English top-flight action like never before.”</p>
 <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">The studio says that further information on the integration of the Premier League in <em>Football Manager</em> will come later in the year, suggesting that there’s more to this partnership than officially licensed clubs. </p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true">As a long-time fan of the series, I am delighted to see this partnership, especially as my beloved Manchester United will no longer be called the horrific “Man UFC.” This happened in 2021 when United took legal action against Sports Interactive over complaints that the game infringed their trademark by using the club’s name without a license.</p>
 <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="false">Of course, if you’ve been playing the game, you’ll have seen licensed Premier League teams in there already, after Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Manchester City agreed deals with the company. In the past, we’ve had to download logo packs created by fans of <em>Football Manager</em> and essentially mod the game to get our favorite Premier League teams in the game. Thankfully that will be a thing of the past from next season.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-always-online-including-campaign.896700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-always-online<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>will require an internet connection at all times, even if you're just playing the game's single-player campaign, Activision has revealed.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://support.activision.com/black-ops-6/articles/black-ops-6-editions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official support page</a> for the game (<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1799908841175281856" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via Wario64</a>), Activision says that in order to "deliver the highest-quality visuals" for&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>, the game uses texture streaming, which is effectively a system by which textures are downloaded and streamed as required rather than loaded all at once.</p>
<p>As you've probably already spotted, however, texture streaming requires a constant internet connection, and so even if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s campaign mode or you're playing local multiplayer, you're going to need a stable online connection in order to play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-always-online-motorbike.jpg?itok=Ak_IKIC2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-always-online-motorbike.jpg?itok=Hp00um9s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't have a stable internet connection? Get outta here, says&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, needing an internet connection to play online with other players is understandable, but needing one for the campaign does feel a little off, even for the reason given.</p>
<p>Activision does, however, point out that you won't need an Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus subscription to play&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>'s campaign. You will need a subscription if you're playing multiplayer, though (unless you're on PC, of course).</p>
<p>On the same support page, Activision also clarifies its position on split-screen play in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>. Essentially, it'll be available on current-gen consoles but won't be on PS4 or Xbox One in order to "ensure performance integrity".</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is the next game in both the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>series and the&nbsp;<em>Black Ops&nbsp;</em>sub-series. As we <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">learned during yesterday's Xbox showcase</a>, it'll launch on October 25th across PC and consoles.</p>

<p>It'll be the first&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1">available on Xbox Game Pass</a> on the day of its release, although depending on your Game Pass subscription, you may or may not be able to access certain elements of the game.</p>
<p>In essence, Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can enjoy all of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>on their PC or console, as can Game Pass PC subscribers. Game Pass Console subscribers will only get access to the campaign, and Game Pass Core subscribers won't be able to access&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>via their subscriptions.</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>launches on October 25th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933620/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-cross-gen-bundle/9p5hv0hvztsk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171601/best-yard-games-lawn-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission.

  <p id="2pU5cQ">Whether you’re out in the backyard grillin’ brats, at the local park flippin’ burgers, or floatin’ on a pontoon boat with a lovely vintage from Michigan’s wine country, there’s nothing quite like a good yard game. So who wants to play another round of bags? I mean... I do. That sounds great, actually.</p>
<p id="DCcg0m">But when I’m done playing bags, and before we wander off to wherever Dale saw that one dilapidated old Frisbee golf course, I’d like to try some new yard games. So I asked around the Polygon Slack for recommendations. Here’s what came back.</p>
<h2 id="unPX41"><strong>Ladderball</strong></h2>
<p id="ubsfox">Want to enjoy an easy tossing game with your friends and family that <em>doesn’t</em> require good aim? I got you. Ladderball is a simple and silly tossing game, but rather than individual balls or bean bags, it’s two balls connected with about six inches of rope between them. As such, when you toss the ball, it cartwheels through the air in a semi-unpredictable way (at least that’s what happens when I throw it, because I am terrible at throwing things in the direction I want to throw them).</p>
<p id="Wi7wcQ">To play the game, you set up the vertical ladders several feet apart, then split into two teams. My family usually plays one-on-one for fast games that allow plenty of time for snacks between rounds. One person from each team stands by one ladder as the teams alternate tossing their three balls at the other ladder, aiming for the highest rung. The string between the balls often wraps around one rung, but the game gets fun when you realize how easy it is to knock your pieces (or your opponent’s pieces) off the rungs. When that round is over, switch to the other ladder.</p>
<p id="G2PaqE">The top rung is worth three points, the middle is worth two, and the bottom is worth one. Most people play ladderball by seeing who can get to 10 points fastest. In addition to family-friendly fun, I also love this game because the balls are relatively soft, so it’s easy to play barefoot by the pool without worrying about getting lobbed. It’s also drunk-people-friendly, if that’s your thing. —<em>Zoë Hannah</em></p>

<p id="fWIycU">Kubb’s nickname, “Viking chess,” doubles as an elevator pitch. The lawn game — in which players stand on opposing sides of a rectangle, hurling batons at wooden pylons — mixes the strategy (if not quite the depth) of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafl_games">heady board game peers</a> with the Scandinavian pleasure of smashing hard things together. As with many great yard games, the rules are tedious to explain, yet easy to grok by simply <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZisjpAlarhM">watching folks play</a>.</p>
<p id="3nh84L">With that in mind, think of kicking off a match of kubb like starting a dance party: The toughest part is getting the first person to join in. But once a couple of people start playing, expect friends and neighbors to ask for their turn to toss one stick at another one. As these newcomers munch on snacks and sink into the game, they’ll discover tactics, like where to position skulls on the field. Or whether to gamble on long shots or take easier short-distance targets. Matches can last minutes or hours, with power shifting within a few tosses of the baton.</p>
<p id="EX0DlA">There’s one other detail that helps kubb earn its Viking chess shorthand. It can be played entirely with one hand, perfect for those adults who enjoy a game best when carrying some mead. —<em>Chris Plante</em></p>

<p id="78mVJ2">While the history of some beloved yard games goes back hundreds if not thousands of years, there’s one that sprang to life much more recently — circa 1989, in fact. I’m not talking about pickleball. In fact, I’m never talking about pickleball. Instead, I’m talking about Spikeball, also known as Roundnet.</p>
<p id="zkdYZR">Jeff Knurek is credited with creating Roundnet in 1989. In it, players gather near a round, trampoline-style net and spike a ball back and forth between two teams. The game is usually played 2v2 or 3v3. Either way, the action is fast and furious. Could you play the game seated with beer in hand? Sure, but it’s a lot more fun to tear it up barefoot on the beach and get a little silly as you’re able.</p>
<p id="a9s0y3">The entrepreneurs at Spikeball ran with the idea in the 2000s, leading to a successful appearance in 2015 on <em>Shark Tank</em>. (That’s when Daymond John got all excited and asked for 50% of the company. The deal ultimately fell apart.) Regardless, the marketing boost indirectly helped spur on interest in a professional circuit, and this summer you’ll likely see a few games played <a href="https://spikeball.com/pages/espn">on ESPN</a>. —<em>Charlie Hall</em></p>

<p id="448jJB">Wham-O, the same brand that first marketed the Hula-Hoop, cracked off another winner in <a href="https://vault.si.com/vault/1976/12/06/here-comes-tracball-direct-from-the-people-that-gave-us-hula-hoops">1976</a> with Trac-Ball, my personal favorite backyard game. The thing is... it’s not really a game. Technically it’s just a toy, but through trial and error I’ve turned it into a game — a game that I’m going to type out the rules of for the very first time today.</p>
<p id="7YOGe2">Trac-Ball is loosely based on jai alai, a sport where players use scoop-like cesta to hurl balls at speeds approaching 200 miles per hour on an indoor court. Trac-Ball uses similar biomechanics, but the wicker cesta is replaced with a light plastic racket with a toothed track inside. The ball is also much lighter and hollow. Get the arm motion just right and you can create an absolutely amazing amount of rotation on that little ball, lofting and curving its flight as you see fit.</p>
<p id="BafST2">My version of semi-organized Trac-Ball is a lot like Great Catch, a game that should be familiar to anyone who has ever played youth baseball. Basically, two players line up across from each other and try to make each other look as cool as possible catching the ball. Maybe you’re lofting the ball over your opponent’s head <em>just far enough away</em> that they can barely reach it before it hits the ground. Or maybe you’re curving it to such a degree that they must run headlong to the right or left to intercept it before it passes them. Or maybe you’re chucking it right at their chest, forcing them to post up and intercept the missile like a laser blast aimed at a Jedi. Matches go to 15, like a short game of volleyball, but with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24140585/challengers-post-credits-scene-rules-of-tennis">tennis-like scoring</a>. That keeps the tension on until the very final few throws.</p>
<p id="R074ur">The only trick is that scoring is all based on the honor system. It’s up to you and your opponent to call out a bad toss and score it accordingly, or to note when you missed a catch that you should have had — no matter how graceful you thought you looked while attempting it. —<em>CH</em></p>

<p>With Xbox’s recent stance on launching its titles elsewhere, like on PlayStation 5, many fans hoped to see additional upcoming titles coming to Sony’s console. More specifically, they want Avowed on PS5. So, is it happening?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-avowed-releasing-on-playstation-5">Is Avowed Releasing on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Avowed isn’t coming to PS5—at least not initially. That could change in the future, as we saw titles such as Grounded and Sea of Thieves launch post-release on PlayStation 5, and they did exceptionally well with the console’s community. Plus, we know that Doom: The Dark Ages, an upcoming first-person shooter from the long-running franchise, is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-doom-the-dark-ages-releasing-on-ps5-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to PS5 simultaneously</a>. It leaves room for other exciting titles!</p>







<h2 id="h-will-avowed-release-on-xbox-game-pass">Will Avowed Release on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p>I know that if you play on PlayStation 5, you’re likely upset at the news that Avowed isn’t coming to your favorite system. However, you’re in luck if you play video games on a PC or know someone with an Xbox Series X|S. Avowed launches on Xbox Game Pass simultaneously with the full release, meaning you can enjoy the upcoming RPG for a few bucks per month!</p>



<p>Of course, there’s nothing quite like owning your game. Perhaps one day, Obsidian’s RPG will come to PlayStation consoles!</p>



<hr>



<p>While we wait for Avowed, there are plenty of upcoming RPGs, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/world-of-warcraft-war-within-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft: The War Within</a>!
