			<p><strong>NetEase Games</strong> is getting set to launch <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-deadpool-joins-roster-season-6-the-game-awards-2025/">Season 6: Night at the Museum</a></strong> of <strong>Marvel Rivals</strong> this coming <strong>Friday, January 16, 2026</strong>, which includes the introduction of the game's latest duelist, everyone's favourite merc with a mouth, <strong>Deadpool</strong>.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-adds-rogue-gambit-new-game-mode-new-map-and-more/">Season 5 introduced Rogue and Gambit</a>, Season 6 will start with Deadpool, with Elsa Bloodstone to follow at the halfway point. As NetEase does with every new season, ahead of its launch, the studio has debuted a gameplay trailer showing off the new hero's skills, with today's trailer showcasing Deadpool's lethal arsenal and the various ways in which players can take advantage of his skills.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>More than just a Duelist, Deadpool is actually a triple-threat hero. He's a Duelist, a Strategist, and a Vanguard. You can also unlock upgrades for his skills mid-game to make him even more deadly. With all of that built into one character, it's not surprising that in Quick mode games and Competitive mode games, there can only be one Deadpool on either side.</p>



<p>Along with Deadpool entering as the new character for the first half of Season 6, NetEase is introducing a significant update to the Hero Proficiency system. "<em>The cap will be raised for each hero and new rewards added such as Units, Unstable Molecules, Nameplates, Titles, Nameplate Frames, Badges, Dynamic Avatars, and more</em>," writes NetEase in a press release. </p>



<p>Season 6 also introduces a photo mode to Times Square, and Times Square will also be getting a new area called the Clobberin' Club, where you can challenge other players to duels. Then, on January 29, the Museum of Contemplation map will be introduced.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>And as always, there are plenty of bug fixes and balance changes that are coming with the new season, though those will be <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/">revealed in the full patch notes</a>.</p>



<p>This is the season that is kicking off 2026 for NetEase Games and Marvel Rivals, and if NetEase is to be believed, 2026 will be the year that the studio really shows how much it can grow its third-person hero shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-producer-calls-2025-a-warm-up-wants-to-make-it-the-biggest-game-possible/">after calling 2025 a "<em>warm-up</em>."</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Is CODE VEIN II a Numbered Sequel in a Different World? Bandai Namco Explains Time Travel and the Rebuilt Partner System]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-interview-time-travel-partner-system/</link>
            <guid>1405123</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>More than six years after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the release of the first game</a>, <strong>Bandai Namco Studios</strong> returns with <strong>CODE VEIN II</strong>, the sequel to the Soulslike action RPG that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-shipped-over-3-million-copies-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over three million copies</a></strong> across all platforms. While not a smashing success, the game undoubtedly garnered a sizable following. However, the developers are still making changes to several aspects in this new iteration; for instance, it is set in a completely different world with new characters. The first CODE VEIN also allowed co-op multiplayer, whereas this new entry focuses on expanding the Partner System that powers AI companions.</p>



<p>Following a recent press event <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where we went hands-on with the game</a> ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled <strong>January 30</strong> launch</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, we sent a few questions to Bandai Namco Studios to uncover more details about CODE VEIN II. The answers were provided by CODE VEIN II producer <strong>Keita Iizuka</strong>-san and game director <strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura</strong>-san. As a reminder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-character-creator-demo-release-date-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Character Creator demo will be released on January 23</a>, one week before the full game's debut.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>What were some of the challenges your team faced when it came to overhauling the combat and giving it more impact in CODE VEIN II?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> In the previous game, players opted to play without a partner to focus solely on combat. To give players the option to explore alongside a partner while focusing on enemy encounters, <strong>we’ve introduced a new “Assimilation” mechanic to the partner system in this installment</strong>.</p>



<p>We rebuilt the partner system from scratch to ensure players can choose between the traditional “Summoning” mechanic and the newly added “Assimilation” mechanic, while also incorporating cooperative elements such as the Restorative Offering mechanic.</p>



<p><strong>If Code Vein II is in a separate universe with no connections to the first title, why go with a numbered sequel rather than calling it something different?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura: </strong>This second installment in the series continues the core concept of CODE VEIN: challenging, exploration-focused action alongside a partner character. By introducing time travel and the idea of intervening in a character's past, we felt that we could powerfully depict the drama of two species—humans and Revenants—living in different timelines.</p>



<p><strong>However, we also considered that if players experience returning to the past and altering it, and then ultimately encounter the continuation point of the previous game, they might feel the urge to intervene in that world as well. We felt that if we allowed this, it would negate the lives of the characters from the previous game, and the stories players experienced themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Considering these points, we ultimately decided to create a new story in a world distinct from the previous one. For these reasons, while this is the second installment in the series, it depicts a story set in a different world.</p>



<p><strong>What was the design philosophy your team had in mind when it came to creating the levels and encounters in CODE VEIN II? Is this intended to be more difficult than the original title?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> We've taken care to prevent unreasonable melee encounters from occurring, allowing players to stay focused on combat. Even when group battles do occur, this game features an enemy group-behavior control system that maintains a satisfying level of challenge while letting players enjoy the back-and-forth combat against enemies.</p>



<p><strong>How much player agency will there be when it comes to the time travel? Can players choose not to change events in the past?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura:</strong> Travel between the present and past worlds is relatively unrestricted. Even while progressing the story in the past, you can return to the present world and explore it. <strong>As the story advances, you will encounter several major turning points where you must choose whether to return to the past.</strong> At these points, it is possible to advance the story without intervening in the past more than necessary.</p>



<p><strong>How many routes/endings will there be in CODE VEIN II?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> While we can’t share specific numbers, we can say that <strong>the game includes multiple scenario branches and endings</strong> that reflect the choices and changes players make throughout their journey.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Year In Review Finally Released For 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-year-in-review-finally-released-for-2025/</link>
            <guid>1405108</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two weeks into 2026, and Nintendo has finally released its Year In Review for Switch and Switch 2 players. </p>



<p>To access your Nintendo 2025 Year In Review, simply go to the <a href="https://year-in-review.nintendo.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recap’s landing page</a> and sign in with your Nintendo Account. From there, you’ll see stats such as the number of games you played, and the amount of time spent on the system.</p>







<p>In addition, you’ll find out the games you played the most, the types of games you favored, and a month-by-month breakdown of how much you played. </p>



<p><strong>“Your Nintendo Switch 2025 Year in Review has arrived,” </strong>Nintendo said on social media. <strong>“Check out not only your 2025 adventures, but memories from past years with your Nintendo Switch as well.”</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo joins other platforms like Steam and PlayStation with their “wrapped” or year in review features. The only one of the major platforms that didn’t release one for 2025 was Xbox. Microsoft skipped this year, reportedly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbbox-wrapped-not-coming-budget-constraints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to budget constraints</a>. </p>



<p>As far as why Nintendo waited so long to release this time around, that hasn’t been mentioned. Past versions came in the weeks leading up to Christmas, making 2025’s the latest one yet. </p>







<p>What did your Nintendo Year In Review reveal about your playtime on the Switch and/or Switch 2? Leave your recap details down in the comments, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

While Nintendo (and most companies and services) traditionally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-year-in-review-for-2024-is-available-now-get-a-free-2025-calendar/1100-6528550/" data-ref-id="1100-6528550">releases these summaries in December</a> of each year, it pushed back its Switch wrap-up to January for reasons unstated.</p><p>While it missed the usual <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-2025-wrap-up-see-how-much-you-played-this-year/1100-6536799/" data-ref-id="1100-6536799">wave of yearly wrap-ups</a>, the plus side is that Nintendo's 2025 summary includes your December play time, so your many hours of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond just might eke out on your list of most-played games.</p><p>The personalized wrap-up sums up how many games you played on Switch and Switch 2 and how many hours you played, showing a month-by-month breakdown and evaluating your favorite game genres. Additionally, you can choose a favorite game you played this year and share a graphic that summarizes the data, and you can download a free 2026 calendar at the end to print out.</p><p>If you want to go further down the rabbit hole, Nintendo's website also pulls Switch data going back to the console's launch in 2017. If you're patient enough to scroll all the way to the bottom, you can download a video that displays this data.</p><p>2025 was an important year for Nintendo, with the Switch 2 launching in June to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">massive sales success</a>. Nintendo-published highlights in the Switch 2's first months on the market included Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Kirby Air Riders, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Indie hits like Hollow Knight: Silksong and Hades 2, along with third-party games previously released on other platforms like Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws, also graced the Switch 2's early software lineup.</p><p>In the coming year, Switch 2 owners may return to the timesink known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-is-nintendos-cheapest-paid-upgrade-yet/1100-6537334/" data-ref-id="1100-6537334">Animal Crossing: New Horizons with a cheap upgrade</a>. Other upcoming Nintendo titles include Mario Tennis Fever, The Duskbloods, and Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, with third-party offerings including Resident Evil Requiem and 007 First Light.</p>

                <p>Deadpool is coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a> alongside Season 6 on January 16, and in a first for the hero shooter, he will be able to play any role he chooses--Duelist, Vanguard, or Strategist.</p><p dir="ltr">As explained by Deadpool himself in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmU6RtypJ3w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel Rivals Dev Vision video</a>, he's heard the community's "non-stop complaining online about how the game needs more Vanguards and Strategists," so he decided to do the NetEase development team a favor and just be all three roles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmU6RtypJ3w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rmU6RtypJ3w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's far from the only unique part of Deadpool. In another meta move, Deadpool actually earns XP over the course of the match based on how "stylish" his actions are. That XP can then be used to upgrade his abilities via a comic book depending on what role he's playing until he's a self-described "server admin."</p><p dir="ltr">When he's a Duelist, Deadpool uses his dual pistols and katanas to shoot and slice his way through the enemy team. While playing as a Strategist, those same weapons can target friendly teammates to heal them. If he's taking on the role of a frontlining Vanguard, Deadpool can throw out unicorn plushies that deploy shields to protect teammates and block incoming damage.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y1sQPyhz5s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Y1sQPyhz5s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Judging from his gameplay trailer, Deadpool looks to be a true menace, not only dashing around the battlefield and bashing his foes but also pummeling them with a variety of visual effects, whether it's a chibi Deadpool bonking an opponent with a hammer or a screenful of little Deadpools that make it difficult to tell what's going on. True to his nickname as the Merc with a Mouth, he also never stops talking, which will probably get old before long but is definitely in line with his character.</p><p dir="ltr">Deadpool will launch alongside Season 6 on January 16. In addition to Deadpool, Season 6 will also add a new map set in the Collector's museum and introduce a photo mode. It will also add a dueling arena, bring big changes to hero proficiency rewards, and make a number of major hero and team-up balance changes. Halfway through the season another hero, Elsa Bloodstone, will join the game's roster, keeping true to the team's goal of releasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-shortening-seasons-releasing-a-new-hero-every-month/1100-6530612/" data-ref-id="1100-6530612">new hero every month</a>.</p>

This includes a nerf for the akimbo variant of the Velox 5.7 pistol in Warzone, and the Maddox RFB assault rifle now has decreased damage ranges in multiplayer and Zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">For multiplayer and Zombies, the patch notes detail major adjustments for the Maddox RFB assault rifle. This includes a reduction to movement speed, added recoil, and significant decreases to the gun's damage range. The developer says the Maddox RFB has been very strong because of its quick time-to-kill in close quarters, but the controllable recoil let it stretch its effectiveness out to longer ranges than intended.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"We'd like to keep the close-range damage high, as that was core to the weapon's identity in Black Ops 4," Treyarch says. "It has received significant range and recoil nerfs to reduce its versatility."</p><p dir="ltr">Several adjustments are made to the AK-27 assault rifle Battle-Scar conversion to make the weapon more viable to use. The conversion kit previously turned the AK-27 into a slow-firing hybrid between an assault rifle and marksman rifle, but the developer says the conversion made the fire rate too punishing. The new buffs include a reduction to the weapon's fire-rate penalty, removed movement penalties, and fast aim-down-sight speed.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Season's new Sturmwolf 45 now has increased damage range and less recoil, making the gun more powerful and easier to handle.</p><p dir="ltr">A few adjustments are made to guns in Warzone. Previously, the akimbo variant of the Velox 5.7 pistol was dominating the close-range meta for battle royale in Season 1. The developer has now nerfed with a 50% damage reduction when using the akimbo attachment.</p><p dir="ltr">The AK-27 assault rifle's Battle-Scar conversion also received an adjustment here, but this buff is limited to just removing the movement penalties previously associated with the gun's conversion kit.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/12/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 7</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2026/01/call-of-duty-bo7-warzone-season-01-reloaded-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's Season 1 Reloaded update released last week, bringing new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fallout-themed-cod-collab-lets-you-wield-power-armor-or-be-a-vault-dweller/2900-7390/">game modes and events</a> themed around the Fallout TV show. Maximus and The Ghoul characters can be unlocked in the current <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-fallout-event-how-to-unlock-all-skins-new-smg-and-rewards/2900-7393/">Fallout event passes</a>.</p><h2>BLACK OPS 7 GLOBAL</h2><h3>Weapon Tuning: MP &amp; ZM</h3><p>Today’s weapon update includes Maddox RFB adjustments, improvements to the Sturmwolf 45 and AK-27 Battle-Scar Conversion based on early feedback, and adjustments to the M15 MOD 0 and Dravec 45. There are several changes to Prestige Attachments as well, which we will continue to make sure are offering a compelling choice for all weapons.</p><h4>General</h4><ul><li>Base Sprint to Sprint Fire Time (used with Gung Ho perk) now matches base Sprint to Fire Time for all weapons.</li></ul><h4>Assault Rifles</h4><h3>Maddox RFB</h3><p>The Maddox RFB has been very strong because of its quick TTK in close quarters and controllable recoil that lets it stretch its effectiveness out to long ranges. We’d like to keep the close-range damage high, as that was core to the weapon’s identity in Black Ops 4. It has received significant range and recoil nerfs to reduce its versatility.</p><p>Additional Maddox RFB Adjustments</p><ul><li>Recoil increased.</li><li>All movement speeds reduced by 0.05m/s.</li></ul><p>Additional 13" MFS Echo-Fire Barrel Adjustments</p><ul><li>Recoil increased.</li></ul><h3>M15 MOD 0</h3><p>The M15 MOD 0 continues to be stronger than we’d like in its versatility, mainly when it comes to the mid-range. The most significant changes here are to the Max Damage Range and the damage in the Mid Damage range, which removes the ability to reduce TTK with a single headshot mixed in. The weapon will continue to be effective at these ranges thanks to its low recoil, but there is a smaller window now where that ease of control also pairs with a better TTK than other ARs.</p><p>Additional M15 MOD 0 Adjustments</p><ul><li>Slide to Fire Time increased from 420ms to 430ms.</li><li>All Hip Spread values increased by 0.1 degrees.</li><li>All movement speeds reduced by 0.05m/s.</li></ul><p>16" Reticulated Barrel Adjustment</p><ul><li>Headshot multiplier improved from 1.55x to 1.6x.</li></ul><h3>AK-27</h3><p>The Battle-Scar Conversion for the AK-27 was designed as a slow-firing, heavy-hitting hybrid between an Assault Rifle and Marksman Rifle. The reliance on headshots for a competitive TTK made it too punishing at its original Fire Rate, and the penalties pushing it towards Marksman Rifle mobility and handling were steep as well. We’ve improved all these attributes to bring it back closer to an Assault Rifle, but still with a uniquely slow Fire Rate that requires good accuracy and rewards headshots.</p><p>AK-27 Battle-Scar Conversion Adjustments</p><ul><li>Fire Rate penalty reduced from 100% to 70%.</li><li>Removed movement penalties.</li><li>Aim Down Sight Time penalty reduced from 60ms to 30ms.</li><li>Sprint To Fire Time penalty reduced from 60ms to 30ms.</li><li>Addressed an issue where the Comb attachments used by the Battle-Scar Conversion could remain on the weapon after removing the Conversion attachment.</li></ul><h3>X9 Maverick</h3><p>14.6" MFS Pulse Load+ Barrel Adjustment</p><ul><li>Damage Range penalty reduced from 25% to 13%.</li><li>Aim Down Sight Time improvement increased from 20ms to 30ms.</li><li>Sprint To Fire Time improvement increased from 15ms to 25ms.</li><li>Movement Speed improvement increased by 0.03m/s.</li></ul><h3>DS20 Mirage</h3><p>Mirage Tandem Launcher Adjustments</p><ul><li>Burst Fire Delay improved from 350ms to 300ms.</li><li>Swap Time to and from Prestige launcher improved from 550ms to 420ms.</li></ul><h4><b>SMGs</b></h4><h3>Sturmwolf 45</h3><p>The Sturmwolf 45 is designed around low recoil and favorable headshot damage compared to the other SMGs. We want it to be a bit more effective than where it’s currently sitting, but wary of making it too versatile by pairing the recoil with range, mobility, or handling improvements. We’re opting to double down on the headshot characteristics across the base weapon, the Damage Barrel, and the Prestige Attachment. The Prestige magazine will also have less recoil than it’s first iteration.</p><p>Additional Sturmwolf 45 Adjustments</p><ul><li>Headshot multiplier increased from 1.2x to 1.26x.</li><li>15" Regnant Barrel</li><li>Headshot multiplier increased from 1.25x to 1.35x.</li><li>Vertical Recoil penalty reduced from 45% to 30%.</li><li>Horizontal Recoil penalty reduced from 20% to 15%.</li></ul><p>MFS Tigris .40 Cal Mag Adjustments</p><p>Additional Sturmwolf 45 + MFS Tigris .40 Cal Mag Adjustments</p><ul><li>Headshot multiplier increased from 1.2x to 1.26x.</li><li>Vertical Recoil penalty reduced from 80% to 65%.</li><li>Horizontal Recoil penalty reduced from 40% to 30%.</li><li>Recoil Deviation penalty reduced from 50% to 35%.</li></ul><h3>Kogot-7</h3><p>This is a minor adjustment, but prevents the Kogot-7 from further reducing its TTK at long range with headshots.</p><h3>Ryden 45K</h3><p>Ryden 45K Adjustment</p><ul><li>Adjusted Gun Kick and View Kick to reduce harshness of recoil pattern.</li></ul><h3>Razor 9mm</h3><p>12" MFS Sidewinder Barrel Adjustments</p><ul><li>Horizontal and Vertical Recoil improvement increased from 10% to 25%.</li><li>Recoil Stabilization improvement increased from 15% to 25%.</li><li>Aim Down Sight Time penalty increased from 15ms to 20ms.</li><li>Sprint to Fire Time penalty increased from 15ms to 20ms.</li></ul><h3>Dravec 45</h3><p>The Dravec 45 is receiving a substantial range reduction across the board. The combination of great range and extremely low recoil continued to make this weapon too versatile, even with slower mobility and handling. We still want to keep the recoil for the same reason we’ve mentioned in the past, which is keeping each weapon in a class feeling unique. By reducing the range, the base Dravec 45 trades away more power for its consistency.</p><h4>Dravec 45 Damage Adjustments</h4><p>Dravec 45 Adjustments</p><ul><li>Aim Down Sight Time increased from 230ms to 235ms.</li></ul><h3>Carbon 57</h3><p>The Carbon 57 is on the low end of SMG usage, so we’re making some sizeable changes. In a lot of ways, the Carbon 57 will now fill the space previously occupied by the Dravec 45 as a mid-to-long range SMG with some Assault Rifle DNA. It has higher recoil, though, which gives us a valuable tuning knob to help keep the weapon in check without losing its core identity (high ammo, mid-rangey, and slower AR hybrid).</p><p>Additional Carbon 57 Adjustments</p><ul><li>Aim Down Sight Time increased from 240ms to 245ms.</li><li>Sprint to Fire Time increased from 170ms to 180ms.</li><li>Tactical Sprint to Fire Time increased from 290ms to 300ms.</li><li>Slide to Fire Time increased from 360ms to 380ms.</li><li>Dive to Fire Time increased from 440ms to 460ms.</li><li>Addressed an issue that caused ironsights to be misaligned in ADS.</li></ul><h3>MPC-25</h3><p>Aside from a slight recoil improvement, we are pre-emptively making some adjustments to a couple of hip spread attachments for the upcoming release of the new ContraBloom Laser. The Prestige barrel also receives some nice range improvements to further counteract the loss of raw TTK.</p><p>MPC-25 Adjustment</p><ul><li>Reduced random deviation in Gun Kick and View Kick.</li></ul><p>Kühn Ported Comp Adjustment</p><ul><li>Sprint Fire Hip Spread improvement reduced from 25% to 15%.</li></ul><p>8.6" MFS Stratus-X Barrel Adjustments</p><p>VAS Tactical Scale Stock Adjustment</p><ul><li>Sprint Fire Hip Spread improvement reduced from 15% to 10%</li></ul><h4>LMGs</h4><h3>Sokol 545</h3><p>Some recoil changes come to the Sokol 545, both to give the weapon a small lift in general and especially help the slower fire mode feel significantly more accurate than the faster one.</p><p>Sokol 545 Adjustments</p><ul><li>Reduced recoil of default fire mode.</li><li>Reduced View Kick strength and deviation experienced later into the recoil pattern of the fast fire mode.</li></ul><h4>Marksman Rifles</h4><h3>M8A1</h3><p>The Prestige Attachment for the M8A1 revolves around Tac Stance, and we have a couple of changes to improve that build path.</p><p>MFS Striker Tactical Stock Adjustments</p><ul><li>Tac Stance Spread improvement increased from 63% to 66%.</li><li>Flinch penalty reduced from 40% to 18%.</li></ul><p>2mw Adaptive Tactical Laser Adjustment</p><ul><li>Tactical Stance Aim Walking Speed improvement increased from 0.4m/s to 0.9m/s.</li></ul><h4>Sniper Rifles</h4><h3>XR-3 Ion</h3><p>XR-3 Ion Adjustments</p><ul><li>Improved shot queuing window to prevent accidental follow-up bursts.</li></ul><h4>Pistols</h4><h3>Velox 5.7</h3><p>The Prestige barrel on the Velox 5.7 is all about close quarters agility and aggressive movement. There was an issue with the Swap Speed improvement that we’ve fixed. We’re also juicing up some of the accuracy and weapon motion improvements, since it goes up against Damage Range in its node (which is especially valuable for pistols).</p><p>4" MFS Celeste Barrel Adjustments</p><ul><li>Now also improves regular Hip Spread by 15%.</li><li>Jumping and Landing stability improvement increased from 40% to 60%.</li><li>Addressed an issue that prevented the Swap Speed benefits from applying.</li></ul><h3>CODA 9</h3><p>The new Adaptive Discharge Mod and the Prestige attachment for the Coda 9 interact in a way that is detrimental to its ADS fire. We always try to design new attachments to be compatible with a weapon’s Prestige attachment and ideally have them synergize, too. In this case, we’ve looked at some options to make these two attachments work together, but due to the implementation we would have to compromise the current design or tuning of one of the two. And since we like how the two currently sit on their own, we’ve decided to just block players from equipping both and accidentally bricking the weapon. If we end up making changes to either of these attachments down the line, we’ll take the opportunity to reevaluate.</p><p>General Adjustments</p><ul><li>The Coda 9 Adaptive Discharge Mod and MFS DeltaCell Bulk Mag can no longer be equipped together.</li></ul><h4>Launchers</h4><h3>A.R.C. M1</h3><p>General Adjustments</p><ul><li>Shots no longer queue during the overheat cooldown, to prevent accidental fire.</li></ul><h4>Special Weapon</h4><h3>NX Ravager</h3><p>General Adjustments</p><ul><li>Addressed an issue that caused the NX Ravager from having a slightly slower velocity and greater arc than intended.</li></ul><h4>Melees</h4><h3>Ballistic Knife</h3><p>Getting swapped off the Ballistic Knife after firing the last blade felt bad. It will now stay in the player’s hand so they can go for a melee attack or retrieve a blade.</p><p>General Adjustments</p><ul><li>The Ballistic Knife will no longer automatically stow itself when it runs out of ammo.</li></ul><h2>MULTIPLAYER</h2><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li><b>Fringe</b><ul><li>Added collision to areas where players could get out of the map.</li></ul></li><li><b>Yakei</b><ul><li>Added collision to an area where players could get out of the map.

(Added Jan. 9)</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Equipment</h3><ul><li><b>Stim Shot</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue preventing XP Progression on the Stim Shot Overclock. Stim Shot will now also gain progress when healing at least 10HP.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><ul><li>Reduced the frequency of Announcer voice lines in The Ghouls.</li></ul><h3>Stability</h3><ul><li>Addressed stability issues when using the Rhino Scorestreak. (Added Jan. 9)</li><li>Added various stability fixes.</li></ul><h2>ZOMBIES</h2><h3>UI</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the After Action Report could show an Armory unlock for the NX Ravager after the player had already unlocked it.</li></ul><h3>Stability</h3><ul><li>Added various stability fixes.</li></ul><h2>ENDGAME</h2><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where party members could be pulled out of the Endgame cinematic early and lose their loadout after defeating Faulkner when in a party.</li><li>Addressed an issue where calling in a Rhino or Power Armor while holding a melee weapon would cause the player to lose their Exotic weapon and melee weapon rarity.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Supply Crates could be opened more than once.</li></ul><h2>WARZONE WEAPONS</h2><h4><u>Weapon Adjustments</u></h4><p>We’ve taken several targeted adjustments in today's update from our partners at Treyarch in Black Ops 7 Multiplayer. The Velox 5.7 Akimbo has also been adjusted, which had been dominating the close-range meta.</p><h3>AK-27</h3><p>Attachment Adjustments</p><ul><li><b>Battle-Scar Conversion</b><ul><li>Removed Movement Penalties</li></ul></li></ul><h3>DS20 MIRAGE</h3><p>Attachment Adjustments</p><ul><li><b>Mirage Tandem Launcher</b><ul><li>Burst Fire Delay improved from 350ms to 300ms.</li><li>Swap Time to and from Prestige launcher improved from 550ms to 420ms.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>X9 MAVERICK</h3><p>Attachment Adjustments</p><ul><li><b>14.6" MFS Pulse Load+ Barrel</b><ul><li>Reduced Range Penalty by 10%</li><li>Sprint to Fire speed improved from 8% to 13%</li><li>Aim Down Sight speed improved from 8% to 12%</li></ul></li></ul><h4>SMG Adjustments</h4><p>WeaponAdjustments</p><h3>CARBON 57</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue that caused ironsights to be misaligned in ADS.</li></ul><h3>RAZOR 9MM</h3><p>Attachment Adjustments</p><ul><li><b>12" MFS Sidewinder Barrel</b><ul><li>Vertical Recoil benefit improved by 15%</li><li>Horizontal Recoil benefit improved by 15%</li><li>Recoil Stabilization improved by 10%</li><li>Sprint to Fire speed slowed from 9% to 17%</li><li>Aim Down sight speed slowed from 8% to 11%</li></ul></li></ul><h3>RYDEN 45K</h3><ul><li>Adjusted Gun Kick and View Kick to reduce harshness of recoil pattern.</li></ul><h3>M8A1</h3><p>Attachment Adjustments</p><ul><li><b>MFS Striker Tactical Stock</b><ul><li>Tac Stance Spread improvement increased from 63% to 66%</li><li>Flinch penalty reduced from 40% to 18%</li></ul></li><li><b>2mw Adaptive Tactical Laser</b><ul><li>Tactical Stance Aim Walking Speed improvement increased from 0.4m/s to 0.9m/s</li></ul></li></ul><h3>XR-3 ION</h3><ul><li>Improved shot queuing window to prevent accidental follow-up bursts.</li></ul><h3>VELOX 5.7</h3><p>Attachment Adjustments</p><ul><li><b>Akimbo Velox 5.7</b><ul><li>Now has a 50% Damage Reduction</li></ul></li></ul><p>We recognize this may seem like an extreme nerf but the intention of this change is to bring it more in line with what we expect of close range weapons and akimbo attachments.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/13/theres-a-styx-blades-of-greed-demo-for-the-first-hour-of-the-game-on-steam/</link>
            <guid>1405072</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ahead of its release in February, Nacon and Cyanide Studio have dropped <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">a demo for Styx: Blades of Greed onto Steam</a>, letting players check out the first hour of the game. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> is launching across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 19th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Styx: Blades of Greed - Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OwliU5XsytQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is a time-limited demo, which will be pulled from availability at some point, but if you do slink in to check it out on PC and buy the game on that platform, then your save will carry across to the full game.</p>
<p>The demo kicks off from the very start of the game, where you’ll get to experience Styx infiltrating a golem and destroying it from the inside out, and then take on his first real mission to steal a zeppelin right out from under the Inquisition and break through their blockade of The Wall.</p>
<p>This is just a taster of what the full game has to offer, with Styx and his crew visiting three open environments to sneak through, and picking up new tricks, powers and tools to let him explore further and further. There’s things like a grappling hook and glider, there’s new Quartz powers for mind control and time shifting, and a story that weaves together the human Inquisitors, Orcs and Elves in variously nefarious ways.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/">I previewed Styx: Blades of Greed back at Gamescom</a>, and it was this opening section of the game that I had the chance to play back then. After a lenghty hiatus between games, I said,&nbsp;“It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.”</p>

		<p>Daedalic Entertainment and developer gameXcite have announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/20/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-lets-you-rewrite-the-worst-90s-star-trek/">Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown</a> will let you re-experience and retell the tale of Star Trek: Voyager on 18th February 2026. Additionally, the game will launch on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> alongside PC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Now, try as I might, I couldn’t get a sensible Stardate calculation for that headline – Stardates all started in reference to the 24th century, so trying to figure one out for the 21st century just gives some ludicrous negative number like -296868.49 – but 18th February will line up with Stardate 48315.6, when Voyager is whipped across the Galaxy by the Caretaker.</p>


<p>That’s your starting point in the game, after which you need to navigate the perilous path back to the Alpha Quadrant, encountering the Kazon, the Borg and much more.</p>
<p>You can check this out for yourself with the free demo now available across PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. This is an updated demo compared to last year, which will also come to Switch 2 and PC soon. This updated demo brings an improved UI, better ship controls, refined combat and notifications for when you reach key decision moments.</p>

<p>Somewhat disappointing is the reveal of a Deluxe Edition of the game. This features more missions, more heroes and more technologies that you can tap into from aliens across the Delta content. I don’t know how I feel about gatekeeping that kind of content in this instance.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Infamous Peter Molyneux Parody Account Calls It Quits After 16 Years]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/peter-molyneux-molydeux-parody-masters-albion-trailer-release-date-2000659410</link>
            <guid>1405057</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Peter Molyneux is a veteran game designer who’s been pushing the boundaries of what players expect from the medium for over 30 years. Peter Molydeux is a Twitter account created back in 2009 to parody the <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-man-who-promised-too-much-1537352493">famous developer’s often absurd-sounding promises</a>. With the real Molyneux’s seemingly final game, <em>Masters of Albion</em>, releasing later this year, the creator of Molydeux says it’s time to hang up the fake persona.</p> <p dir="auto">“Games evolved to the point where the ideas I was parodying were no longer outside the box,” wrote the account’s author, 3D environment artist Adam Capone, in a retirement announcement <a href="https://telegra.ph/The-last-message-01-13">posted on January 13</a>. “I never thought I’d cut ties with this account. But after reading Peter Molyneux recently saying his upcoming game would be his last, it does feel like the right moment. It’s still surreal to remember being invited to a photoshoot with the very person I was spoofing.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You play a hole, you must move around an environment making certain elements fall into correct targets at the right time.</p> <p>— petermolydeux (@PeterMolydeux) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMolydeux/status/154802887241908224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2012</a></p></blockquote>  <p dir="auto">In the early 2010s, back when Twitter still felt (mostly) new and fun and wasn’t a factory for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486">AI-powered bots removing women’s clothing</a>, Peter Molydeux was one of the many spoof accounts cropping up in the gaming space, among other well-known ones like <a href="https://x.com/kazhiraiceo">CEO Kaz Hirai</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/porygonnews">Porygon News</a>. The Molydeux account would tweet outrageous video game concepts like, “Online side scrolling co-op 8 player game where each person controls a leg of an octopus. Each leg can attach guns which the player can fire.”</p>

 <p dir="auto">They were funny because of how they played off of Molyneux’s own penchant for expressing grandiose ideas that never quite come together, but they were also very clever in their own right. Each concept had the kernel of something that did actually sound very cool in it, just like the Lionhead Studios cofounder’s ideas. Here’s a great 2012<em> Wired</em> article about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130208085301/https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/10/ff-peter-molyneux/all/">symbiotic relationship between the two</a>.</p>

  <p dir="auto">For anyone unfamiliar with the <em>Fable</em> designer’s reputation for ambitious overpromises, <i>Project Milo</i><em>&nbsp;</em>is a good example. It was supposed to be a Kinect game for Xbox 360 in which players interacted with a child. Molyneux demonstrated the game at a 2010 TEDGlobal talk where he boasted that his team had managed to “create a real, living being in a computer.” Microsoft, more than a decade away from going all in on AI, was unimpressed and canceled the game. In some ways, <i>Project Milo</i> became the platonic ideal of a Molyneux game: one that lived in the imagination of what might be rather than the disappointment of what actually shipped.</p>

 <p dir="auto">Now back to the fake Twitter account:</p> <blockquote> <p dir="auto">I remember pulling up in a taxi to see him casually smoking outside the studio. He welcomed me in, excitedly showing <em>Curiosity</em> but also sharing excitement about another random small indie game he was playing and giving me his ipad to play it. Then later in a pub he was hinting at his ambition for Curiosity. That enthusiasm for the player experience, regardless if they land or not is at the heart of this industry.</p> <p dir="auto">I think the industry lost something when Molyneux vowed never to speak on stage again. Over time, that kind of unfiltered excitement has been replaced by carefully rehearsed pitches and bullet points. Fewer people go off-cue. Fewer let passion drive the conversation rather than marketing.</p> <p dir="auto">I hope every generation creates its own Molyneuxs. Joseph Fares at Hazelight reminds me [of] an early Molyneux, i.e developers who get carried away talking about their “baby” instead of selling a product. I’ll always be grateful for Molyneux and what he gave to the industry.</p> <p dir="auto">I promise this is 100% not actually Peter Molyneux writing this.</p> </blockquote> <p dir="auto">Capone, who was just laid off as part of Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752">shuttering of its recently unionized Halifax studio</a>, used Molydeux’s final sign-off to call for game developers to prioritize creative risk-taking over chasing metrics. “As the industry inevitably rebuilds, I’m convinced it’ll be the small, weird games from over-excited enthusiastic designers in control of their games as they continue creating new experiences and nudging us forward, step by (baby?) step,” he wrote.</p>

 <h2 dir="auto"><em>Masters of Albion</em> offers a last shot at redemption</h2> <p dir="auto">Will one of those be Molyneux’s own <em>Masters of Albion</em>? The pitch is an open-world “god game” that borrows elements from across his past work, which includes the early, influential god game <em>Populous</em>. A new trailer for <em>MoA </em>dropped this week and a release date of April 22 was revealed. “<em>Masters of Albion</em> is the culmination of my life’s work, a game that owes so much to titles like <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>, <em>Black &amp; White</em>, and<em> Fable</em>,” the veteran director said in a statement. “It’s a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map.”</p>

 <p dir="auto">While some take inspiration from Molyneux’s romanticism, others have called him out for what sometimes seem essentially like lies. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneux-interview-godus-reputation-kickstarter">In 2015 he rejected those accusations</a>. Last year he told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-about-redemption-peter-molyneux-says-masters-of-albion-will-make-up-for-decades-of-overpromising-on-things/"><em>Edge</em> magazine</a>, “I admit now that I did overpromise on things, and said things that I shouldn’t have said about <em>Curiosity</em>. But I only ever did that because I thought it was the right thing to do at the time.”</p> <p dir="auto">He called <em>Masters of Albion</em> a” redemption title.” One thing helping give players more confidence in this one than they had in his last project, <a href="https://kotaku.com/peter-molyneuxs-next-game-is-a-blockchain-business-sim-1848201920">a blockchain business sim that went nowhere</a>, is who else is on board. <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> director Mark Healey, <em>Black &amp; White 2</em> designer Iain Wright, and other game development veterans are all involved, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/media-molecule-co-founder-and-bullfrog-veterans-on-board-for-peter-molyneuxs-final-god-game-masters-of-albion/">according to <em>VGC</em></a>. Hopefully it’s a good game, or at least a fitting send off for Peter Molydeux.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Isn’t Hytale Email Verification Working? Hytale Email Not Sending Issue, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-email-verification-issue-explained/</link>
            <guid>1405054</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re here because you haven’t gotten a verification email for Hytale, you’re not alone in this regard. This is a widespread problem preventing many users from buying the sandbox title.</p>



<p>It’s one problem after another, isn’t it? If it’s not servers, it’s something else. In this case, it’s a pesky verification email not sending as intended. Many aspiring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-controller-support-playstation-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytalers</a> have found themselves unable to even buy the game and start it up, so let’s go through what we know so far.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-am-i-not-getting-hytale-verification-email">Why Am I Not Getting Hytale Verification Email?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Could be a long wait. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The accepted reason for Hytale email verification not working as intended is due to the Hytale servers being overloaded, causing a huge backlog of emails and applications.</strong></p>



<p>If you check the official Hytale Discord Server, Reddit, or search for “Hytale email” on X, you will find you’re most definitely not the only one suffering from this issue.</p>



<p>Quite simply, Hytale is proving to be EXTREMELY popular. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-expects-one-million-players-at-early-access-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was expecting one million players for the early access launch</a>, and one would suspect that it’s comfortably surpassed this. A wall is being hit, though, as thousands of potential buyers aren’t getting the email verification notice.</p>



<p>It was recommended that all interested parties buy the game and install the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/download-hytale-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale Launcher</a> before the official early access release day on January 13. If you have left it until its debut, you are likely one of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of players, all trying to verify purchases and access the game simultaneously, which is presumably more than the current server capacity can handle.</p>



<p>To be clear, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-server-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale servers</a> are working on launch day, and the email verification is a separate issue.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-i-get-my-hytale-email-verification">When Will I Get My Hytale Email Verification?</h2>



<p><strong>The fact is, you will receive the email verification notice for Hytale, but it will take time to come through. If it does, and it’s past the time limit cutoff, try again.</strong></p>



<p>The system will catch up, and the developer is likely working on increasing capacity or manually addressing the problem. The team hasn’t officially acknowledged the issue (as of writing), but rest assured that the issue won’t fall on deaf ears. Keep checking for emails, request a new one if you have to, and be patient as it all works itself out.</p>



<p>Conversely, if you’ve found a workaround that guarantees you get the email verification and proceed, let other players and those in the community know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, so the message can be shared far and wide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Anime, like wrestling, harbors a treasure trove of tropes with hidden meaning and references that can be traced back to a point of origin beyond the show you’re watching, should you be savvy and old-head enough to spot them. I’ve been able to spot and identify a few common ones: the crying mole/freckle beauty marks under a character’s left eye (illustrative shorthand for a character harboring a tragic past); closing one eye (the character doubts something they’re saying or is being said to them); and the most common and annoying trope, getting nosebleeds when seeing a pretty girl, as visual shorthand for being incredulously aroused. But one specific trope has eluded me until today.&nbsp;</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><i><em>Ranma 1/2</em></i><span> (Image: Netflix/Mappa)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>That visual trope is famed author and illustrator of <em>Urusei Yatsura </em>Rumiko Takahashi’s signature rock-out hand sign pose. Pinky, index, and thumb extended. Ring and middle fingers curled. After years of wondering what the hell this hand sign means, I finally decided to roll up my sleeves and do the legwork to find out.</p><p>First, let’s run down what Takahashi’s hand sign doesn’t mean. Upon first blush, Takahashi’s hand sign looks an awful lot like a cross between the “<a href="https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2021/05/corna.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>corna</u></a>” (devil horns) or “<a href="https://www.colum.edu/news-and-events/announcements/2024/learn-5-asl-signs-to-spread-the-love-at-columbia-college-chicago?ref=aftermath.site"><u>I Love You</u></a>” in American Sign Language. However, the context for the gesture is neither one that screams shonen protagonist defiantly yelling “rock on!” nor is it something an idol would flash to her adoring fans on stage, so the jury is out on that one. Takahashi’s hand sign is used in reaction to something stunning or comedic happening to a character. Things like falling out of a window or walking in on someone in their pajamas.</p><figure><figcaption><p><i><em>Macross Frontier</em></i><span> and </span><i><em>Fire Force</em></i><span> (Image: Studio Nue/David Production)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Another educated guess is that the hand sign could be the <a href="https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2021/05/fox-sign.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>kitsune</u></a> (fox) gesture. This symbol, which has too many meanings to the point of being rendered meaningless, from kissing to a sock-puppet gag, is also off the mark because the thumbs aren't extended.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><i><em>Chainsaw Man</em></i><span> (Image: Mappa)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now that the wrong answers are out of the way, let’s get to the rabbit hole this educational endeavour has led me from, obvious, overthinking, and the hilarious true meaning behind Takahashi’s signature pose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who has read or seen a Takahashi work, with a functioning, wrinkled brain and the power of context clues, can readily deduce the meaning of the hand pose. The hand sign is a pantomime for a character being shocked. Usually, a character will throw out this pose if their person is harmed, be it by a falling object like an anvil, Looney Tunes style, or if someone says something shocking to them. Takahashi has used this particular visual trope in practically every series she has created. Key among them are her star-crossed rom-com <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urusei_Yatsura?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Urusei Yatsura</u></em></a>, her gender-bender martial arts romance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranma_%C2%BD?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ranma ½</u></em></a>, and her demon-slaying isekai romance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuyasha?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Inuyasha</u></em></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><p><i><em>Nichijou</em></i><span> and </span><i><em>Tojima Wants To Be A Kamen Rider</em></i><span> (Images: Kyoto Animation/Liden Films/Toei)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>This particular visual gag serves as a full-body exclamation point for the shock a character experiences in a funny or surprising moment in a comedy series. In fact, it’s a bit that fellow throwback feeling comedy series like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichijou?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Nichijou </u></em></a>have implemented as a kind of visual punchline to a wisecrack. While knowing its context is half the battle to dissecting the hand sign, that still doesn’t explain why Takahashi opted to specifically use a hand sign that can otherwise be misconstrued for the gesture to “rock on, my dude?” Here’s where the otaku ancestors got too deep into overthinking territory to explain the articulation of the pose and its “spiritual meaning.”&nbsp;</p><p>Like <a href="https://evangelion.fandom.com/wiki/SEELE?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Seele </u></a>from <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, the otaku ancestors (who dubbed Takahashi’s hand sign the “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uruseiyatsura/comments/10xyicm/what_is_that_hand_gesture_everyone_makes/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Rumic Sign</u></a>,” referencing her collection of short stories, <em>Rumic World</em>) went full armchair anthropologist, hypothesizing that the gesture had Buddhist roots. More specifically, they posited that the hand sign’s origins lie in the <a href="https://www.originalbuddhas.com/about-buddha-statues/hand-positions/karana-mudra?srsltid=AfmBOooylYbsB2dWbR702rOMPLN_-VXq7zoK9L9rP2NPqWy-BySSE9jU&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Karana Mudra</u></a>—a gesture intended to ward off obstacles and negativity and to counter the pose with positive energy.&nbsp;</p><p>When I first came across this widely accepted double meaning, I was a second away from nodding along, eyes shut, with a grunt like, “Shit, I’d believe it.” After all, <em>Ranma ½</em> is all about spirituality, and most of Takahashi’s works feature her heroes warding off demons and the like. Appropriating the pose as a comedic bit would be a smart way to address its mystery. But if my years of coming up with concise questions to ask creators why they do the things they do when they make art have taught me anything, more often than not, anime fans put creators on a pedestal, treating them with the same reverence as <a href="https://aftermath.site/kendrick-lamar-drake-anime-naruto-bleach-one-piece/"><u>Kendrick Lamar</u></a> or <a href="https://aftermath.site/taylor-swift-britney-spears-poptimism/"><u>Taylor Swift</u></a>, assuming layers of double meaning behind their art, when, in reality, that couldn’t be further from the truth. This doubt finally led me to the real meaning of the pose.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The first instance of Takahashi using the pose in </span><i><em>Urusei Yatsura</em></i><span> chapter 22. (Image: Viz Media)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While everyone in the states has been debating the hand sign’s meaning in forum posts and blogs, an interviewer from the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-worked-on-this-story-for-a-year?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Japanese publication <em>Natalie </em>just flat-out asked Takahashi about it</u></a>. In a <a href="https://natalie.mu/comic/pp/rumic35?ref=aftermath.site"><u>2013 interview celebrating Takashi’s 35th anniversary as a mangaka</u></a>, interviewer Kozue Awo asked her about the pose. After all this deliberating, Takashi’s nonchalant answer, is so fucking funny I damn near did the pose myself reading it. I’ll just leave their exchange here:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><strong>Awo: </strong>Speaking of comedy scenes, there's something I really wanted to ask you about today... There's a pose that often appears in comical scenes, where the middle and ring fingers on both hands are bent. I think that's an expression that only Takahashi-sensei would draw, but does it have any special meaning?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Takahashi:</strong> This one (she says, actually striking a pose). I drew it without thinking too much about it, but... how about, for example, if you get punched in a slapstick scene, right? If you get blown away like that, you might get the impression that it hurts or is cruel, but with this hand, strangely, it doesn't seem serious at all (laughs). I drew it thinking that it would be clear that he has the composure and that it's okay</blockquote><blockquote><br><strong>Awo: What was the first thing you drew?<p>Takahashi: </p></strong>In <em>Urusei Yatsura</em>" I think. By the way, I later received a letter from a reader telling me that this hand position means "I love you." I had no idea about that. I didn't think it was such a good pose.</blockquote><figure><figcaption><span>Photo: Gen Karaki </span></figcaption></figure><p>Incredible. Now the only mystery I’m left with from this whole ordeal is why Takahashi was fitted out in a Def Jam recordings T-shirt. Should I ever get the chance to speak with her myself, I’ll be sure to ask.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Reports are emerging about a wave of layoffs hitting Meta’s VR-centric divisions, hitting their gaming studios hard by shutting down Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games.</p>
<p>The news comes a day after the New York Times reported that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html">Meta would be cutting around 10% of the staff from the Reality Labs</a> portion of the company, which includes the Oculus Studios division. A day later and those affects are speaking on social medial.</p>


<p>Via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meta-closes-multiple-studios-lays-off-staff/">Insider Gaming</a>, Twisted Pixel designer <a href="https://xcancel.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519">Andy Gentile said</a> “I’ve just been laid off. It appears the entire [Twisted Pixel Games studio has been shut down. [Sanzaru Games] too.” This was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4">corroborated by Sanzaru senior level designer Ray West</a>, who suggests that there could be more casualties of Meta and the tech industry’s asinine over-expenditure in pursuit of generative AI.</p>
<p>Twisted Pixel was founded 20 years ago, cutting their teeth in the early Xbox Live Arcade era of gaming with ‘Splosion Man, leading to a four year stay as part of Microsoft Games. They went independent again in 2015, latching onto the nascent virtual reality gaming scene with Wilson’s Heart in 2017, and a clutch of other titles of Oculus Rift. This led to Meta acquiring the studio in 2021, and the development of Deadpool VR for Meta Quest 3 last summer.</p>
<p>Sanzaru Games, meanwhile, got their big break in partnership with Sony and PlayStation. Their second game was Secret Agent Clank, and they went on to remaster the Sly Cooper trilogy for PS3 and develop a fourth game in the series a few years later. Work with PlayStation petered out after this – they ported the God of War Collection and Sly Collection to Vita – and they too were early to the VR party with Ripcoil and VR Sports Challenge in 2016. They were acquired by Meta in 2020 off the back of the popular action RPG Asgard’s Wrath for Oculus Rift, and had released a sequel, Asgard’s Wrath 2 for Quest 2 and 3 in 2023.</p>

<p>This sucks, and we hope those affected at Twisted Pixel, Sanzaru and across the rest of Meta’s business are able to land on their feet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In early 2009, shortly before the launch of <a href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-gotham-knights-suicide-squad-assassins-cr-1848911270"><em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em></a> and a year after Christopher Nolan’s <em>The Dark Knight,</em> developers at Monolith were working on a <em>Batman</em> game that would be connected to Nolan’s films. Gameplay footage of the game, titled Project Apollo, leaked in 2024. But now, even more footage has been uncovered showing off what could have been.</p> <p>On January 12, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrtalida.bsky.social/post/3mcba4da5xk2x">retro game archivist MrTalida uploaded</a> once-deleted-but-now-recovered Project Apollo files that were found on an old hard drive. Included in the files, which were created between April 2009 and January 2010, are video clips of early gameplay and in-engine tests of Project Apollo, with many focused on how sound and music would work in the third-person <em>Batman</em> action game. It’s interesting to see how much progress the team at Monolith made on the game over those 10 months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/project-apollo-documents-and-videos">You can find all of them on the Internet Archive.</a></p>

 <p>Perhaps the biggest and coolest new information gleaned from these leaked files is gameplay footage of the Tumbler, aka Batman’s tank-like Batmobile from the <em>Dark Knight</em> trilogy. In the leaked footage, you can see the Tumbler driving through what appears to be a large train yard while escaping police and destroying various objects and explosive barrels. In other words, a pretty standard-looking 2010-era vehicle section, the kind that would often appear in single-player AAA games around that time.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/app.bsky.feed.post/3mcbatx32gk2v" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidyqklm2io4hbu6dko46a2ktvnrmmlkewy32vzgkfrg6ndcpx2yxa"> <p lang="en">Lastly, here's a series of videos showing the progress Monolith had made on the tumbler batmobile sections.  AFAIK, the previous leak didn't show any tumbler footage, so this may be our first peek.</p> <p>You can see how the feature progressed from Oct 2009, to Nov 2009, to Jan 2010.</p> <p>Enjoy the files!<br> 9/9</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf?ref_src=embed">MrTalida (@mrtalida.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/post/3mcbatx32gk2v?ref_src=embed">2026-01-13T00:02:07.387Z</a></p></blockquote></div>   <h2>Why the Nolan <em>Batman</em> game was canned</h2> <p>As mentioned, <a href="https://kotaku.com/canceled-nolan-batman-game-leak-1851387503">we saw footage from a later build of this canned <em>Batman</em> game in 2024,</a> showing off combat, traversal, and more. But even before that, in 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0lRkQd9skU&amp;list=PLO9mxFELVbbHM1dR6VumpP60zBENfQr0b">Liam Robertson extensively covered this canceled project</a>, reporting various details about the title, including the fact that the game had been in development for approximately 18 months before it was killed.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The open world of Gotham could be traversed by either gliding and utilizing the grappling hook (as established in the Arkham games) or by operating the Tumbler/Batmobile. <a href="https://t.co/VZKXJBFsgP">pic.twitter.com/VZKXJBFsgP</a></p> <p>— SpideyRanger 🇬🇭 (@Dageekydude) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dageekydude/status/1775572473330672034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It was also planned to be an open-world game and would have featured a system by which randomly generated Gotham City thugs would appear to fight Batman and return, stronger and angrier, later. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Monolith would take this idea and build it into the famous Nemesis System found in 2014’s <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> and its 2017 sequel, <em>Shadow of War</em>.</p>

 <p>As for why it was canceled, Robertson reported that publisher WB Games made it clear to Monolith that the only way the project could move forward was if the studio could get Nolan to approve it. The game was to be set in his version of the <em>Batman</em> universe, after all, and the studio wanted to make sure he was involved. Sadly, Nolan seemed uninterested in the game, and Monolith eventually gave up and pivoted to making <em>Lord of the Rings</em> games. More recently, the studio was working on a <em>Wonder Woman</em> project that would have utilized the Nemesis System, <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">but sadly Monolith was shuttered by WB in February 2025.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov fans have been left bewildered by the latest string of social media posts from Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games. He recently unveiled a social profile created in 2024 linked to a website for a fictional entity named ‘CORE Corp’, and heading to that website uncovers a wealth of information.</p>



<p>At first blush, it appears to be an entirely new game, rooted in a sci-fi, interplanetary universe where Earth has been left partially destroyed by some unseen cataclysm and rendered <strong>radioactive</strong>. There are daily challenges to resolve, modules to unlock, AI characters to talk to, and stacks of mysteries to unravel.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-cor3-gg">What is COR3.GG?</h2>



<p><a href="https://os.cor3.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">COR3.gg</a> is the webpage that Escape from Tarkov lead, Nikita Buyanov, linked his followers to earlier today. It’s mocked up to look like a retro-futuristic computer interface, like something you’d find in Fallout or ARC Raiders.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Once you’ve completed the very basic login puzzle (by entering your email and getting an OTP), you’ll be given a unique identifier that you’ll need to hold on to. This will get you into the system if you happen to log out inadvertently.</p>



<p>The ‘CORIE’ operating system you’re exposed to will now present you with a string of options. You can check messages, interact with a virtual (but locked-down) browser, see that the weather is apocalyptic, and listen to a gravelly radio. There’s a notepad, an updater module, and a series of daily challenges that involve probing strings of files and attempting to figure out what the errors in them are.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>CORIE appears to be set in 2251, or thereabouts. There are ‘logs’ from the player character that serve as a little backstory to CORIE, or COR3, whatever it’s called:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today is my first day as a private investigator for “History Unfolded”.</p>



<p>The contract has been signed and all the terms agreed for. But I am still shocked about how smooth that went. Those people … the “handler” – they didn’t even ask that many questions. It seemed like they knew me for quite some time. And that Aurana chick … stunning but dangerous. She gives me chills.</p>



<p>How did I even get here … have been asking that myself for several days now. Guess wanting something new and mysterious can sometimes lead to such adventures.</p>



<p>The main goal of that “contract” is to uncover some old mysteries it seems. But I wonder if those are truly a secret for the people who hired me, because they seem to be very well informed. Like having deep knowledge on most events.</p>



<p>Maybe they are looking for an alternative opinion, or maybe they found something interesting in my personality and skill set … Honestly, I am not sure I would even like to know.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>An on-site ’employment contract’ reveals that you’ve been hired by Aurana Strogova, and that you’re tasked with ‘uncovering the files related to experiments that took place on -redacted- from 2170 to present time.’</p>



<p>The entire thing is quite bizarre.</p>



<p>The top screen for CORIE looks to be set in some kind of underground bunker. You can interact with the environment, studying various items that are described from a first-person perspective. There’s a junk box full of scrap, a ventilation system, and various pieces of armor, including a mining helmet.</p>



<p>One of the item descriptions reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Darkhound ‘Oppressor’ Modular Plate Carrier</p>



<p>A universal plate carrier from a legendary company known throughout the solar system. I’ve taken it everywhere, wherever it’s weapon-based environment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It smacks of ARC Raiders crossed with Fallout, as I mentioned before, but it’s interplanetary. There’s talk of space elevators, cargo ships adrift in the great beyond around nearby planets like Venus, and talk of immense death-ray-sounding weapons built to intimidate and deter <strong>space pirates</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s a full-fledged space council, a navy equipped with battle cruisers, and the back stories of several characters are explored at length.</p>



<p>In one section, a faction called Alternative Future can be uncovered, but it’s said that to find out more information, you’ll need to ‘visit any one of (their) outposts.’</p>



<p>This is all very confusing, and fans of Escape from Tarkov and Battlestate Games have been left bewildered. While more information is dug up, it’s worth heading over to COR3.gg and seeing what you can uncover.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's no surprise that Deadpool is coming to Marvel Rivals. Even before his <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/deadpool-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e812bb87-8a14-4388-8593-2fab410b2edf" data-entity-substitution="canonical">official reveal at the Game Awards this year</a>, it was only a matter of time before one of Marvel's most popular characters made his way to massive hero shooter. The question lied in how the developers at NetEase would adapt the character's signature swords, pistols, and meta humor into a game setting. And once that's done, which of the game's three roles the developers they assign him? According to today's reveal trailer, it'll actually be all of them.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y1sQPyhz5s?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y1sQPyhz5s?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>That's right – Deadpool can be a Duelist, Strategist, or Vanguard depending on the player's choice. His appearance remains unchanged, but his max health and moveset will fit the role. Duelist Deadpool can throw his sword to rotate like a razor blade, Vanguard Deadpool gets a deployable, spherical shield, and Strategist Deadpool heals allies by shooting them or slashing them with his katanas. It wouldn't make sense for any other character, but for Deadpool, it just feels right.</p><p>Even outside of the role-swapping, the merc with a mouth's abilities are unique, to say the least. As he fights his foes, he'll be able to level up his skills, opening up an in-game book-like menu to select what to unlock. He also has a move that deal damage to enemy players when they miss shots, as well as the ability to take photos with people he defeats. In the reveal trailer, we even see Deadpool using that photo mode to become invincible, absorbing Magneto's Ultimate Ability with his butt.</p>

      <p>Deadpool's level up screen in Marvel Rivals</p>
  
</article>

<p>As per usual, season six also brings other improvements to Marvel Rivals. A new map, Museum of Contemplation, frops January 29. Times Square, the combat-free lobby, is adding a photo mode and The Clobberin' Club, where players can duel and broadcast their match on one of the street's giant screens. Hero proficiency is also getting an overhaul. The small handful of tiers has been fully revamped to include more hero-specific rewards, including in-game currency and animated character avatars.</p><p>Finally, more team-ups are coming, while others are phased out. Peni will lose her team-up with Rocket, and Spider-Man will lose his team-up with Human Torch. However, Peni and Spider-Man are getting a new team-up (which grants Spider-Man a web bomb), and Jeff is getting a team-up with Deadpool, which creates a spinning toy that heals allies and covers enemies' screens with animated Deadpools. You can see the full list of updates in the video below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmU6RtypJ3w?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmU6RtypJ3w?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For more Marvel Rivals, check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/30/gender-swapped-lady-loki-skin-comes-to-marvel-rivals-for-the-month-of-january">the limited-time Lady Loki skin</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/marvel-rivals/a-super-shooter">our review from last year</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/13/deadpool-officially-joins-marvel-rivals-season-6-as-a-duelist-and-a-strategist-and-a]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Oh My God, Am I A Genius At Irish Language Wordle]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/irish-wordle-foclach/</link>
            <guid>1404997</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Wordle</em> fever has largely come and gone, as has the frantic explosion of spinoff games. But the game itself lives on under the <a href="https://aftermath.site/new-york-times-wordle-connections-puzzmo-games/" rel="noreferrer">ownership of The New York Times</a>, and many of the games inspired by it are still thriving. So I wasn't exactly surprised to come across an Irish language version this morning, but I <em>was </em>surprised to see that it was still updating with daily puzzles. And I was even more surprised to win today's game, a clear sign that I am an Irish language genius.</p><p><a href="https://www.foclach.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><em>Foclach</em></a> is <em>Wordle</em>, but in Irish. ("<a href="https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/foclach?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Foclach</a>" means "wordy" or "verbose," and is a word I didn't know before; thanks, game!) It was created in 2022 by Linda Keating, who told the <a href="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/its-filling-people-with-joy-irish-woman-creates-foclach-the-irish-version-of-wordle/41309366.html?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Irish Independent</a> that "part of the pure joy [of it] is pulling together this community of Irish language speakers" around the game, which had over 10,000 players in 2022. A fan of word games, Keating built the game using a <em>Wordle</em> clone and drew from several lists of five-letter Irish words. Unlike <em>Wordle</em>, <em>Foclach</em> has a practice mode, and Keating told the Irish Independent that adding the mode was when the game "really took off." She said she has no plans to monetize it--"I’ll never put it behind a paywall or I’ll never put ads on the website"--and that its simplicity is part of its charm, saying "it’s the kind of thing you would have seen on the web going back to the 1990s."</p><p>I've been <a href="https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking/" rel="noreferrer">learning Irish</a> since the spring from a combination of books, in-person and online classes, and the <a href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-ai/" rel="noreferrer">horrors</a> of Duolingo. It's been tough--it's a complicated language, and there also aren't as many opportunities to encounter it in daily life as there are with other languages that are more widespread. (On Friday I went to a play at New York's <a href="https://irishartscenter.org/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Irish Arts Center</a>, and I was so smitten with the fact that the building has signage in Irish <em>and</em> that I could read that signage that I trespassed up several floors before I realized it.) All of this is to say that <em>Foclach</em> presented me with a unique challenge: unlike <em>Wordle</em>, I just don't know that many Irish words to guess.</p><p>So I was shocked when I got Tuesday's daily puzzle on my fifth of six tries, relying solely on my own knowledge of Irish. <strong>(Spoilers ahead if you're going to play it yourself.)</strong> I feel like it's key to start off with a good first guess in games like this, so I decided to go with "rudaí" ("things") because it contains a variety of vowels, including a fada, or accent mark. (Fada add another complication to <em>Foclach</em>; there are some words that are spelled the same but mean <a href="https://www.bitesize.irish/blog/our-fada/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">different things</a> depending on the fada.) I definitely wasn't as economical with my guesses as I am in English, using letters I knew weren't in the answer because they were in words I knew. But I managed to get close enough to make an educated guess at the last letter, and was pumped when I got it right.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Scrín means "shrine." Another new word!</span></figcaption></figure><p>Things didn't go as well when I picked a practice puzzle at random. "Rudaí" only got me an "a," and from there I floundered for appropriate words. My vocabulary was lacking, but there were a few guideposts to help me: vowels in Irish are divided into "broad" (a, o, u) and "slender" (e, i) and have to stick together in certain ways, which helped me pin down the order of a bunch of vowels. But then I was stuck with one missing letter. I went to the dictionary, but without the first letter, it was hard to search. I even looked up some of the word lists <em>Foclach</em> is based on, but they didn't help much either. Eventually, much like in <em>Wordle</em>, I just went through each remaining letter to see if they'd form a word--but unlike in <em>Wordle</em>, I didn't really <em>know</em> if my results were actually words at all. I managed to get the practice puzzle's answer of "mnaoi" (an unusual form of "bean," or "woman") by being familiar with the cluster of "mna" as a plausible run of letters  ("mná" is "women," the plural of "bean.").</p><figure><figcaption><span>My guess of "gnaoi" is also a word, meaning "beauty" or "comeliness," but I didn't know that when I guessed it; I only guessed it because I knew "g" could come before "n" based on a phrase I already know, "de gnáth" for something like "typically"</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's really fun for me about <em>Foclach</em> is how it asks me to use my language skills in a totally different way than <em>Wordle</em>. In the English game, I'm guessing <em>words</em>, drawing on my vocabulary knowledge in a way that makes the game's primary pleasure being proficient with English. I felt <em>smart</em> when I used to get the <em>Wordle</em> in a few tries (I <a href="https://writersagainstthewarongaza.com/boycott-nyt?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">don't play it</a> anymore). But with <em>Foclach</em>, my key strategy can't really be vocabulary, because my Irish vocabulary is so small. So I have to pull on the related skills I employed above, like spelling rules and other words I know. It feels like a totally different way to think about both word games and Irish, and instead of feeling clever when I got the answers, I felt like I'd climbed a mountain. It's a really cool way to engage with a language I'm learning, and I love how it forces me to explore the dictionary and learn new words.</p><p>Thanks to the practice mode, I have years of <em>Foclach</em> to go through, and I'm so excited to play more of it. It's definitely going into my daily rotation alongside my other Irish game, <a href="https://www.teanglann.ie/en/spelling-game/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">dictionary website Teanglann's spelling game</a>, which I'll say I'm pretty good at as long as I limit the dialects it draws from. Obviously I won't be able to maintain my 100% win rate forever, but I'll relish in it while I can.</p>
