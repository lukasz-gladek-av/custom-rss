			<p>The Nioh 3 PC system requirements have been confirmed today, detailing the system configurations that can run the game at 1080p resolution, 30 and 60 frames per second.</p>



<p>The requirements, which can be found in full below, aren't particularly demanding for 1080p gameplay, although upscaling will be required to reach the listed targets. The system requirements listed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/">Steam</a> also confirm the game will support Frame Generation without providing additional information.</p>

<p>Although the Nioh 3 system requirements aren't particularly demanding, previous Team NINJA games released on PC, such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/">Wo-Long Fallen Dynasty</a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/rise-of-the-ronin-is-yet-another-disappointing-pc-port-from-koei-tecmo/">Rise of the Ronin</a>, essentially required much better system configurations than suggested to deal with their significant launch performance issues. Hopefully, this won't be the case in the game.</p>



<p>While I can't say how Nioh 3 will run on PC when it launches on February 6 worldwide, I can safely say the third entry in the series is setting out to be a great action RPG, and the culmination of all the most recent games released by Team NINJA. You can learn more about the game's new exploration mechanics and more by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/">checking out my hands-on preview.</a></p>

            <p>If Ubisoft's rumoured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a> remake were an actual ghost ship, we'd be long past the point of snatching brief glimpses of the vessel through unnaturally dense fog at two bells during the morning watch. We'd be long past the point of spotting a spectral Jolly Roger between stormy crests, its deathshead wreathed in St. Elmo's Fire. The damn ghost ship is square abreast of us now, the hollow-cheeked revenant of Edward Kenway dangling from the rigging.
</p>
<p>People keep pointing at the ghost ship and screaming, but Captain Ubisoft has his eyes firmly on the horizon. "Steady as she goes, lads!" he trills, as hordes of translucent pirates pour over the rail. "Steady as she goes till some hypothetical future time when we might announce a thing, maybe!"
</p><!--more-->
<p>All of which is to say that the Black Flag remake has been subject to so much insider reporting that it surely has no choice but to be real. The project has more leaks than the Cutty Sark after a voyage through the legendary Sea of Cheesegraters. It was first teased back in July 2023, when Kotaku alleged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">that it was being made with help from Ubisoft Singapore</a>, creators of Skull &amp; Bones. Makes sense. Then a voice actor made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">fleeting mention of it at an expo</a>, only for Ubisoft's lawyers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-claims-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-over-remake-tease">to rap his knuckles</a>.</p>
<p>This September, a French publication <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-will-release-early-2026-and-swaps-modern-day-sections-for-more-piracy-claims-report">claimed</a> that Ubisoft Bordeaux and Ubisoft Belgrade are also involved with the project. They alleged that the remake will launch next year, and that it will dispense with the original's modern-day Abstergo segments in favour of cut content featuring Mary Read, while bringing the inventory and combat systems in line with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and Valhalla. Again, makes sense.
</p><p>Now, we hear from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/">Insider Gaming</a> that the Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake will launch in the week of March 23rd 2026. They're claiming that the "unannounced" project mentioned in Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-assassins-creed-franchise-exceeded-expectations-driving-positive-financial-results-but-while-mirage-gets-a-sales-update-shadows-does-not">latest, slightly delayed financials</a> is Black Flag's second coming.</p>
<p>In the same earnings report, Ubisoft noted that the Assassin's Creed series had "exceeded expectations", with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> hitting 10 million sales, though they didn't disclose figures for the more recent Assassin's Creed Shadows. The publishers continue to bet big on the series, having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">restructured around a new Tencent-funded subsidiary</a> dedicated to AC, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> and Rainbow Six. There's a second major Assassin's Creed Shadows expansion in the offing; beyond that, Ubisoft are working on another multiplayer Assassin's Creed and a purportedly Blair Witchy instalment, code-named <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-is-finally-heading-to-feudal-japan-plus-one-with-blair-witch-vibes">Assassin's Creed Hexe</a>, with development led by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-2">Far Cry 2</a> dude Clint Hocking.</p>
<p>I feel that ghost ships and witches complement each other well. All eyes on the good Captain, who is now whistling a jovial shanty while Ghost Kenway stabs him repeatedly in the leg with a phantom cutlass.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-shows-hidden-price-on-ps-vr2-bundle-sony-blocks-public-display-of-black-friday-deal-2000646100</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-shows-%E2%80%9Chidden-price%E2%80%9D-on-ps-vr2-bundle-sony-blocks-public-display-of-black-friday-deal.1360654/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon shows a <em>“hidden price”</em> on the PS VR2 bundle, rather than the standard retail price because Sony’s contracts with retailers limit how certain deals can be advertised. But the real <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/">list price is $299, down from the usual $399, which makes this Black Friday deal an all-time low</a> for the <strong>headset bundled with Horizon Call of the Mountain</strong>. This pricing has propelled the bundle to <strong>#1 best-seller</strong> status in its category, and if you already own a PS5, this is the perfect entry point into serious VR gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Eye Tracking and Sense Technology Redefine VR Immersion</h2>
<p>Because the eye-tracking system monitors where you look in real time, it allows games to <strong>render details precisely where your gaze focuses</strong>. That advantage brought about foveated rendering, a technique whereby PS VR2 delivers sharper visuals in the direct line of sight while doing less processing on peripheral areas. Characters in games can respond to eye contact. This enables <strong>a lot more natural interaction</strong> that simply wasn’t possible with previous systems.</p>
<p><strong>Headset feedback</strong> adds another sensory layer through subtle vibrations that sync with in-game actions. You feel the rush of air as something flies by your head or the impact when objects collide near you. The 3D audio creates a complete sound environment where you can pinpoint exactly where sounds originate, whether that’s footsteps behind you or wind coming from a specific direction.</p>



<p>The <strong>4K HDR visuals boast 2000 x 2040 pixels per eye</strong>, and drastically reduces the screen door effect that plagued earlier VR headsets. Text comes out crisp and readable, distant objects retain detail, and overall image quality approaches what you would get from a high-end monitor. The HDR capability means brighter highlights and deeper blacks give scenes more depth and realism.</p>
<p>The <strong>110-degree FOV offers wide peripheral vision</strong> that aids in keeping the feeling of immersion intact since more of your visual space is filled. You don’t feel like you’re looking through binoculars, which was one of the complaints of headsets with narrower FOV. These lenses also reduce distortion at the edges to keep the image clear across the full field of view.</p>



<p>The Sense controllers introduce haptic feedback similar to the DualSense gamepad, allowing you to feel textures and impacts through your hands. Adaptive triggers create resistance that changes based on what you’re doing, whether that’s drawing a bow or squeezing a trigger. Finger touch detection tracks where your fingers rest on the controller without requiring you to press buttons, enabling more natural hand gestures and interactions. These controllers are a significant upgrade from previous VR input methods that have relied on simple button presses.</p>
<p>It comes with <strong>Horizon Call of the Mountain</strong>, a game that shows what PS VR2 can do: it was built for this hardware, taking advantage of eye tracking, haptic feedback, and visuals. You climb mountains with natural hand movements, manipulate the environment with gesture controls, and experience the Horizon universe in a completely new way. The bundle gives you immediate access to premium VR content without needing to buy games separately.</p>
<p>At $299, you’re getting Sony’s latest VR technology bundled with a full game for $100 less than the standard price. Eye tracking, haptic feedback, and 4K HDR visuals put this headset above most competitors that cost significantly more. This is the most accessible pricing the PS VR2 has received, and including Horizon Call of the Mountain adds immediate value.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem’s producer has recently stated that we will see “some characters from the past series come in.”</p>



<p>Capcom’s next big title is Resident Evil Requiem, and they are going all in with the title. Recently, the developers revealed that they expect the upcoming title to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-expected-to-sell-better-than-re-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell better</a> than Resident Evil Village, and that its development began ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-says-resident-evil-requiem-development-started-way-before-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">way before</a>‘ Village. Now, we have been informed that Requiem’s returning characters and some additional details about the stalker enemy were revealed. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-will-have-returning-characters-but-don-t-over-expect-or-hype-it">Resident Evil Requiem Will Have Returning Characters, But “Don’t Over-Expect or Hype It”</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.well-played.com.au/chatting-the-return-to-raccoon-city-and-designing-resident-evil-requiem-with-the-games-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Well Played</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-over-expect-or-hype-it-resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-teases-but-wont-say-who" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Resident Evil Requiem’s producer, Masato Kumazawa, was asked whether the title will have returning characters from Outbreak, as Grace is the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft. Kumazawa replied, stating that yes, “there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don’t over-expect or hype it.” They can’t promise anything right now, and the only thing that can be said is that “there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game.”</p>



<p>Regarding the stalker enemy, Masato Kumazawa revealed that it will be just a small part of the game, and that they have learned from the past how to balance the system. The producer added that the game is new, and the focus is more on how they can scare the player in many different ways. The developers are “trying to cover a whole lot of scenarios to make sure the players can get scared and experience the horror.</p>

Additionally, here’s why the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-reveals-why-multiplayer-was-ditched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ditched the multiplayer aspect</a> of the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve gone hands-on with Nioh 3 on three separate occasions at this point: The first was with the limited-time demo which was all about me just getting my bearings back and remembering how to play Nioh after five or so years away. The second was a preview event that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-looks-set-to-level-up-from-nioh-1-and-2-ign-first">part of our IGN First coverage</a>, where I was able to dig deeper into the new Ninja Mode and talk about some of the evolutions made in the Nioh formula. For this third, and presumably final time ahead of release, I told myself, “I’m just gonna have fun with it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, when my time began, I adjusted my build to my liking, asked the Team Ninja Community Lead – who appropriately goes by “Master,” – to teach me all of the sick tech that he knew, and I was off to the races to go up against the biggest challenge I’d faced thus far pre-release: A Crucible. It’s a new type of level that features extra tough enemies that chunk bits of your max life every time they hit you until you hit them back. Suffice it to say, if my goal was to have fun, well then, mission accomplished.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo didn’t begin in the Crucible, so I was able to work my way up to meet its challenge by first making my way through a warped Red Light District that had seemingly been transformed and twisted with evil Yokai power. Team Ninja was very generous with our builds, giving me a healthy collection of high-level gear with any weapon type of my choosing. Wanting to try something new, I decided on going with the Caestus as my main Samurai weapon and the single katana for my Ninja loadout.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s just something so incredibly cathartic about draining an enemy’s stamina, and then when you go in for the execution it's just aggressive blunt force trauma on a demon’s face with a level of bloodsplatter that could rival a Mortal Kombat brutality.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I immediately fell in love with the caestus. There’s just something so incredibly cathartic about draining an enemy’s stamina, and then when you go in for the execution it's just aggressive blunt force trauma on a demon’s face with a level of bloodsplatter that could rival a Mortal Kombat brutality. Not only that, but I also had a skill that allowed me to sit there and channel all of my stamina into a single Falcon Punch-like strike that would just obliterate whatever enemy happened to be standing in front of me. The bone-crunching sound effects and the usual Team Ninja animation smoothness only enhanced the satisfaction.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other side of the coin was the single katana in Ninja Mode, and if you’re a Ninja Gaiden fan, this is probably going to be the one you’re going to want to check out. The big star of the weapon in my eyes was a move called the Swallow Slash, and if you <em>are</em> a big Ninja Gaiden fan, you probably already know what that’s going to look like. It’s a super fast dashing attack that goes through enemies, and can even be upgraded to allow you to quickly move back and forth multiple times through the same enemy, just like Ryu’s Flying Swallow. It’s a bit riskier in a game with limited stamina and treacherous terrain that could lead to instant death if one were to Swallow Slash themselves off a cliff, but it is nonetheless an incredibly satisfying technique and a great way to start off a fight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Red Light District itself was classic Nioh level design: Lots of barred-off paths that funnel you through largely linear design, with a handful of optional forks that lead to some extra loot, with a healthy dose of traps and enemy ambushes lying around every corner. Side note: Team Ninja President Fumihiko Yasuda sat down to watch me play for a bit and got a kick out of how slowly and carefully I entered each room, and even more so when even despite all of my caution, I’d still fall for one of the many traps laid throughout the level. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The boss of the level was Takasugi Shinsaku, a Samurai armed with a Guardian Spirit, a gun, and a sword – and he made liberal use of all three. Like most human-sized Nioh 3 boss fights, it was a tense and fast-paced battle that finds that sweet spot of being just predictable enough to be able to identify patterns, with enough variation in those patterns to make the act of identifying them satisfyingly challenging. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Entering the Crucible takes you to a hellish landscape where Yokai are all buffed to deal increased damage.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After defeating Shinsaku, the next area was one of the new open-field levels that I talked about in my last preview. This time, though, we were allowed to challenge the Crucible, which is basically the ultimate challenge of each open field in Nioh 3. Entering the Crucible takes you to a hellish landscape where Yokai are all buffed to deal increased damage. In addition to that, if damage is taken while inside a Crucible, the player will be inflicted with Life Corrosion, which will temporarily reduce their max health until they’re able to deal damage or defeat enemies. Dying is another way to remove the effects of Life Corrosion, but obviously, not ideal. On the plus side, while inside a Crucible, you’ll be able to use your Living Artifact transformation more frequently, since the Amrita Gauge fills faster. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The main impression of the Crucible that I got to play through was basically that it was like another standard linear Nioh level, only meaner. Hugely damaging spike traps were everywhere, lightning fast spinning blade demons made running across certain paths feel like trying to weave through traffic on a busy street, and powerful foes waited in ambush in precarious areas where one errant dodge could lead to you falling to your death. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like every other time I’ve gotten to play Nioh 3, after my time was up, I was left wanting more. Nioh 3 is shaping up to be my favorite of the series to date, not only through its substantial improvements to combat thanks to the split of Samurai and Ninja Modes, but also with the massive addition of the open-field levels – each of which will include its own separate Crucible. It’s a challenge I eagerly anticipate taking on with my own personal build and progression, and one that I won’t have to wait terribly long for, as Nioh 3 releases on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on February 6, 2026.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is rushing to remove user-made designs shared within <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> that feature fan-favorite character Chef Kawasaki dressed in a micro bikini.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders allows players to create and customize their own in-game rides using basic shapes and stickers, something that has quickly led to all manner of user creativity — and several designs that feature the beloved chef in beach attire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chef Kawasaki has been a fan-favorite among the Kirby community for years, and there's a running joke that, underneath his apron, Chef Kawasaki is otherwise naked. Alternatively, fans have suggested, the character could just about be hiding a micro bikini underneath the straps of his cooking attire — something now depicted in mounds of fanart that we will not embed on this website.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">エアライダーのオレマシン市場にあるコックカワサキのマイクロビキニ柄、すぐ消されるだろうって皆思ってるからか値上がりも早くておもろい 初日の朝にしては高いだろ <a href="https://t.co/DjMbKGcO91" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/DjMbKGcO91</a></p>— モリソバ (@Sobatake397) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sobatake397/status/1991283379707556153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Is Nintendo a fan of all this? Seemingly not. As if to make its position clear, Nintendo has now removed several Chef Kawasaki micro bikini designs from Kirby Air Riders, as they began topping the game's list of most popular fan-made rides. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chef-kawasaki-micro-bikini-ride-deleted-from-kirby-air-riders-machine-market-immediately-replaced-by-succubus-chef-kawasaki/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a> reports that two widely-downloaded Chef Kawasaki micro bikini riders have already been made unavailable by Nintendo, while a third — with a slightly larger bikini and succubus wings — rises in popularity and looks set to test Nintendo's limits for what it will allow.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time that Nintendo has acted to shut down the spread of Chef Kawasaki bikini artwork. In 2022, it swiftly stopped the proliferation of a fanmade card game, Chef Kawasaki’s Microbikini Karuta, which featured numerous fan-drawn images of an eyebrow-raising nature. (The game's creators had also begun selling the game for profit — another big Nintendo no-no.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest game from Super Smash Bros. series boss Masahiro Sakurai, Kirby Air Riders launched this week exclusively for Switch 2. A spin-off of the Kirby series where players race around circuit-based tracks on glider-like machines, it is a long-awaited sequel to 2003's Kirby Air Ride on GameCube. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Kirby Air Riders' unconventional controls can get in its own way sometimes, but they don't stop it from being a fun, frantic action racing game with an almost unreal amount of stuff to do," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review">Kirby Air Riders review</a>, awarding the game 8/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

    <p><span>Durin joins the fray and the story of Nod-Krai continues.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The Version <a title="Platforms > Luna [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">Luna</a> III update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [129 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Song of the Welkin Moon: Interlude – A <a title="Games > Nocturne [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/nocturne">Nocturne</a> of the Far North,” will launch on December 3, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [213 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1008674"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>The story of Nod-Krai continues as the region prepares for “Moon-Prayer Night,” a grand festival that also marks the Dameselette’s final night before her journey to the moon. Besides the celebration, Durin, the newborn dragon, makes his debut as a playable character, displaying his dual forms in battle. Players can also unlock new abilities for Durin and other “Hexerei characters” by completing special quests related to the Hexenzirkel.</p><p>After the defeat of Rächer of Solnari, Nasha Town comes back alive with the lively atmosphere of Moon-Prayer Night. Players are invited to enjoy the celebration, explore various game stalls, and record their memories in a souvenir stamp book, savoring precious moments before the Dameselette returns to the moon. During the celebration, unexpected guests show up—the Hexenzirkel has arrived. Alice, Klee’s mother, and Nicole Reeyn, who previously guided the player in understanding Fontaine’s prophecy, finally reveal themselves with alarming news: Teyvat’s borders are becoming unstable, and strange “phantoms” are appearing across Nod-Krai. Players will join Albedo, Durin, and the Wanderer in uncovering the mystery behind them. Completing this latest Archon Quest will also grant Primogems ×500 for a limited time.</p><p>Another highlight is Durin, a 5-star Pyro Sword wielder who possesses two distinctly different combat forms, and can be served either as a team support or a strong damage dealer. Once a dragon from the fairytale world of Simulanka, Durin was later granted a human body through Albedo’s alchemy and the transfer of the dragon Durin’s heart energy. This unique origin grants Durin dual powers: One reflects the pure soul of Simulanka, supporting the team by reducing enemies’ Elemental Resistance and dealing AoE Pyro DMG. The other is imbued with Abyssal energy, excelling at unleashing devastating attacks on single targets and boosting his own Vaporize and Melt reaction DMG. Completing Durin’s Story Quest will reveal more secrets about the dragon and Hexenzirkel, and gain a special reward for Durin.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1008675"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Version Luna III also introduces a major update featuring “Hexerei characters,” enhancing certain characters closely connected to the Hexenzirkel. By completing Alice’s “Witch’s Homework,” Durin, Venti, Klee, Albedo, Mona, Razor, Fischl, and Sucrose can become Hexerei characters. Each quest unfolds a unique story for the respective character, granting them special abilities and changing their Constellation effects. Additionally, if the party has at least two Hexerei characters, “Hexerei: Secret Rite” effect will be unlocked, significantly boosting the party’s combat capabilities. For example, Venti, the Anemo Archon with a deep connection to the Hexenzirkel, will regain his once-hidden power after completing the quest. When his Stormeye is active, his Normal Attack will be transformed into powerful “Windsunder Arrows” that can pierce enemies and have a chance to further extend the Duration of his Stormeye. Players can view the full enhancement details in the new gadget “The Little Witch’s Dictionary.” After completing the prerequisite quest, players can freely invite Razor, Fischl, or Sucrose to their party.</p><p>Jahoda, the new 4-star Anemo Bow wielder, joins the adventure as well, showcasing her exceptional talents in team-healing and absorbing Elements to deal corresponding DMG. For Event Wishes in Version Luna III, the first phase will feature the debut of Durin and Jahoda and Venti’s return, and the second phase will bring back Varesa and Xilonen.</p><p>More activities and events will be available in Version Luna III. The event “Soulblazers’ Snowbound Journey” will bring players back to Dragonspine, where they can experience with winter-themed minigames and earn rewards, including an exclusive 4-star weapon “Rainbow Serpent’s Rain Bow,” Primogems, and more. Back in Nod-Krai, more stories and interactions with the Dameselette await players in Silvermoon Hall. Additionally, the Envisage Echoes challenges will be updated, adding Klee’s and Albedo’s echoes as rewards.</p><p>The UGC gameplay module Miliastra Wonderland will also receive brand-new updates in Version Luna III. The new “Wonderland Resource Center” allows Craftspeople to freely share and obtain resources and creative content via the editing tool. More rewards can be unlocked in this version, including fun actions, expressions, and free pulls. In addition, a winter-themed Main Hall will also be available to players during this version.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,899 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,326 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,540 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,845 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

            <p>
It's hard to believe it's been over five years since Ubisoft unveiled its troubled - and much-delayed - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake, but we're now one step closer to an actual release date, with Ubisoft's latest financial results narrowing its launch down to "Q4" of its current financial year.
</p>
<p>
For those that haven't been following the whole Sands of Time remake saga, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">initially unveiled in September 2020</a>, when it was expected to arrive in January 2021. However, the less-than-positive response to its announcement trailer led Ubisoft to make the first of what would be many delays. Three years later, the embattled project was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-price-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-has-switched-developer">shifted from Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal,</a> where it was seemingly rebooted from scratch, and last year brought some promising updates. We learned the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-five-tumultuous-years-ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-now-deep-in-development">remake was "deep" in development</a>, and that it was definitely still targeting a 2026 release.

<p>
Which brings us to Ubisoft's latest (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-issues-a-rare-last-minute-delay-to-its-earnings-release-15-minutes-before-scheduled-call-with-investors">briefly delayed</a>) <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/52w2Cas6xfQjegpCgP1SZC/b38c338a1bf6f365849a50d2f182d061/Ubisoft_FY26_H1_Earnings_PR_EN_vF.pdf">earnings report</a>, featuring a couple of updates for the company's release slate. Beyond <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a>'s imminent From the Ashes expansion (due 19th December), the publisher has four titles scheduled to release in the fourth quarter of its current 2025-2026 financial year. Those games are Rainbow Six Mobile, The Division Resurgence, an unnamed title (widely believed to be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">heavily rumoured Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake</a>), and, yes, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.
</p><p>
All of which is to say that, five years after its original announcement, the Sands of Time remake has the closest thing to a release date yet. Barring any further delays, it'll be launching sometime between the 1st January and 31st March next year. That, then, isn't too far off, but we've yet to see a single second of footage since development switched to Ubisoft Montreal. Could the publisher be holding back for a big end-of-year reveal during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">December's Game Awards</a>? Time will tell, no pun intended, but hopefully the big unveiling will be more exciting than the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-now-targeting-2026-gets-briefest-of-trailers">30 seconds of candle we got last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
In other Ubisoft news, CEO Yves Guillemot has announced the company is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-believes-generative-ai-is-as-big-a-revolution-for-games-as-the-shift-to-3d-as-tech-is-embraced-company-wide">going all-in on its use of controversial generative AI technology</a>, calling it as big a "revolution" for games as the shift from 2D to 3D. The company was, of course, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-admits-ai-generated-loading-screen-slipped-through-into-final-build-of-anno-117-pax-romana">caught slipping AI-generated artwork into Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>. The results were a mess, featuring characters with disfigured or out-of-scale facial features, missing limbs, and strange set-dressing - leading the publisher to insist the artwork was only intended to be used as a placeholder, before replacing it with touched-up alternatives.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The relationship between siblings can be fraught enough when it’s your younger brother always trying to copy your dinner choices at a restaurant, and you can imagine how Tokugawa Takechiyo feels when his brother (who just so happens to be his parents’ favourite anyway) decides to usurp his rule and transform the country into a yokai-infested hellscape? And now, in Nioh 3, he’s got to travel through time and fix it all? Ugh. Little brothers are so annoying!</p>
<p><iframe title="Nioh 3 Preview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvpJk-mcR5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s been a great deal of evolution throughout the Nioh series, this PlayStation console exclusive being one of the first to embrace Asian and specifically Japanese culture and mythology within the Soulsbourne style. Nioh 3 brings two significant new changes to the table, first with the addition of a Ninja playstyle alongside the traditional Samurai style, and second with a more open world structure –&nbsp;Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo refer to this more as Open Field, a term borrowed from their musou games.</p>


<p>I absolutely love the switch to Ninja style combat. Samurai style remains and it is as structured and technical as ever, encouraging you to use fighting stances for low, medium and high weapon positioning, to always time your Ki burst to trigger stamina regen, and to block and counter, whittling away at your opponent’s Ki to leave them in a weakened state. A new addition is the Arts Gauge, giving you a powered up Arts Proficiency state to dish out much greater damage and Martial Arts consecutively.</p>


<p>Ninja, though, plays to my generally preferred approach of excessive dodging. There’s still plenty of technical play here, but it’s much more intentionally hit and run. You strike, and then dodge away or try to time a Mist in order to evade an enemy attack, leaving a shadowy figure as your Ninjutsu and Arts Gauges are quickly replenished. Instead of stances, you have Ninjutsu techniques, such as a throwable shuriken, while there’s also a Footstool Jump that you can perform to leap over an enemy, stagger them and strike from behind.</p>
<p>I’ve no doubt that people will prefer one style of play or the other, but here’s the thing: you can use both! Style shifting lets you effortlessly swap back and forth between Samurai and Ninja forms, loadouts and even visuals in a flash, and do so in the middle of battle. This can be great for using the Samurai to drain an enemy’s Ki and then the Ninja to deal a rapid flurry of follow up attacks. You’re actively encouraged and forced to do so by the otherwise unblockable Burst Attacks that some enemies will unleash. As they glow red to signal the attack, you can shift style with the right timing to perform a Burst Break and cancel their attack, dish out retaliatory damage and switch your form to the other.</p>
<p>Once you layer the Guardian Spirit skills from returning and new spirits to this series, there’s a ton of depths to the combat system to master in the moment. There’s common controls throughout, of course, but you’ll need to be switching approaches from moment-to-moment as you switch, and the need to use the style shift to counter Burst Attacks required manual thought during my hands on time. I’m sure it will become more natural and instinctive over time.</p>

<p>These shifting sands also apply to the layered approach to how this world is now constructed and the challenges that you’ll face off against. The open field approach gives broader levels to explore, taking you to multiple time periods and different regions. The ruined, transformed realm of Kyoto in the Bakumatsu period was less of a “go anywhere, do anything” world, and more a wide maze of paths to follow and routes to unlock. That still compares favourable to the more rigid structure of the previous games, and means that there’s more secrets to uncover here and things to do, and you do get a sense of freedom from traversing rooftops and seeking out the various collectable and cute Yokai, or zipping along the Spirit Veins that are magical streams to leap from one area to the next.</p>
<p>I rather enjoyed finding enemy bases here to capture, tackling the seven or eight idling enemies with a stealthy approach –&nbsp;in one instance reaching a cannon that let me blast a few chumps hanging around by a fire –&nbsp;and there’s also tougher enemies at key Crucible Spikes that are blocking paths and want clearing.</p>

<p>The goal in each open field is really to reach the Crucible at its centre, whisking you away to an even more twisted realm to battle through to the final boss and purify the region. The challenge here is ramped up, the yokai that you face having been buffed to deal increased damage, and you’re afflicted by Life Corrosion that you need to dispel by defeating enemies. Oh, and during battle (and especially within the Crucible), some yokai can be temporarily empowered by the Dark Realm, surrounded by red flowers and made even more dangerous for a period of time. The one real positive is that your Guardian Spirits are also buffed, letting you activate Living Artifacts more often to combine your powers with theirs.</p>
<p>There’s a ton of customisation options that we didn’t really get to dig into a great deal. The character creator returns, now with both Samurai and Ninja looks for you to define, but delving into the skill trees, you now have separate trees for the two styles. Creating your loadouts and having that fast switching means you effectively have four weapon sets to swap back and forth between, and that makes picking where to apply your points when levelling up a bit more crucial. Thankfully, this screen clearly indicates which traits affect which weapons. Beyond that, you’re able to swap moves in and out of the Samurai stances’ different attack weights and the Ninja more generally, and truly create a blended fighting style of your own. Oh, and the Onmyo box now has a Yin and Yang position, where you can create summoning seals in addition to Onmyo magic items from Soul Cores.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I really enjoyed my time with Nioh 3 –&nbsp;OK, so we were definitely overpowered for this preview event, and that helped when it was a morning gaming session, but even so! I think that fans will need to understand what Team Ninja means by open field, as opposed to this being open world, but I could happily have explored in different directions and found more corners of the map, if I weren’t pushing to reach the finish line in good time. I also think that there’s a risk of overcomplicating the layered concepts and controls to the point that they might lose a little meaning, but it’s undeniably fun to switch back and forth between Samurai and Ninja, or just stick with the faster, nippier Ninja in general. No doubt, this is one for fans of the series and the wider genre to pay attention to when it launches in February 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Nioh series has long been considered as one of the best Soulslike around, but the franchise created by Team NINJA couldn't be much different from the vast majority of games inspired by FromSoftware's Souls series. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-review-a-samurai-epic-with-souls/">With a bigger focus on mechanical complexity and action gameplay features</a>, the two entries in the series played more like pure action games, with a loot system reminiscent of the Diablo series sprinkled on top to deliver a very engaging experience for those willing to put in the time and effort to understand the franchise's many interwoven mechanics.</p>



<p>Although the second entry in the series improved on pretty much every element of its predecessor, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/">Nioh 2 felt more like an expansion of the original</a>, rather than a proper sequel. At a glance, the differences between the two games were minimal, and overall, the experiences they offered were somewhat similar. Only the most advanced players would notice, and appreciate, the many mechanical improvements made to the original's framework.</p>



<p>This is definitely not what will happen with Nioh 3 when it launches in a few months on PC and PlayStation 5. Though the third entry in the series retains many of the franchise's familiar features, it spices them up considerably with some significant tweaks that have the potential of making it not only the best entry in the series, but also one of the best "masocore" action role-playing games developed by Team NINJA.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 open-field map design sets the game apart the most from its predecessors</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The most significant change Nioh 3 will feature over its predecessors is a different level design philosophy, which is evident right from the get-go. Instead of featuring self-contained missions which can be selected from a main map, the new entry in the series introduces the concept of open fields - much bigger maps which offer plenty of rewards for those willing to explore them fully. As highlighted during a presentation I attended last week in Paris, Nioh 3 isn't an open-world game: although the maps are bigger than ever before, their size is small, compared to the maps of modern open-world games, and don't offer the same amount of side activities such games may offer.</p>



<p>To be honest, I wasn't too thrilled to learn that Nioh 3 would be moving away from its predecessors' progression system. I always felt the older setup of picking missions from a map, though dated,  was more immediate and worked great in the context of the game, allowing the player to focus more on understanding and utilizing the combat, skills, and loot mechanics to their full potential to take down the most powerful of enemies. However, after spending around 4 hours exploring a never-before-seen map set in the Bakumatsu era (1853-1867), I couldn't help but appreciate how the open-field design of the new maps presents the main and sub-missions in a more immersive way, which remain the core of the experience.</p>



<p>While the general design felt standard fare for a game developed by Team NINJA, many of the new mechanics related to the open-field maps make exploration feel fun and rewarding. As players explore every corner of the map, collecting items, completing the Myths sidequests given by various NPCs, conquering Enemy Bases, and defeating the powerful Crucible Wraiths, the region's Exploration Level will increase, providing a variety of permanent buffs, including base stats increases and an enhanced map showing the entire area and markers for exploration spots and collectibles. </p>



<p>As the rewards for engaging with these new exploration mechanics also include items and gear, of which there's a lot in true Nioh tradition, skill points required to unlock weapon-specific and general skills via the game's different skill trees, and buffs offered by friendly Yokai and the new Jizo Statues which can provide a variety of blessings exploring maps in Nioh 3 is set to be as much as a big part of the experience as combat is.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Bakumatsu map offers plenty of exploration opportunities in Nioh 3</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The presence of open-field maps, however, doesn't mean that Nioh 3 lacks the closed-off areas featured in past entries in the series. Each of the maps will also feature a Crucible level where players must defeat a powerful boss to purify the area, a task made more difficult by the Life Corrosion mechanics, which temporarily reduce maximum life while inside a Crucible. To offset this, the Amrita Gauge fills up faster, giving players faster access to the powerful Living Artifact form, which makes a return from past entries in the series. </p>



<p>The design of these Crucible levels is reminiscent of the design of the main missions in the past entries in the series, featuring somewhat intricate layouts which are made more dynamic by some new mechanics, such as the ability to jump, reminiscent of <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/">Wo-Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>, which give locations better verticality and the Spirit Veins, which can be used with a corresponding Guardian Spirit to explore locations further.</p>



<p>Although exploration and traversal are seeing the biggest improvement in Nioh 3 over its predecessors, combat has also undergone some rather significant changes, which players were already able to appreciate a few months back with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-visual-performance-improvements/">a PlayStation 5-exclusive timed demo</a>. </p>



<p>The addition of the Ninja fighting style, on paper, may have felt like a needless complication, but in reality, it adds up a lot of effective combat options, the ability to use Ninjustsu more freely than in past entries in the series, and use a total of four weapons, two per fighting style. With a major focus on agility and "trickier" weapons like the Tonfa and Kusarigama, the Ninja fighting stance essentially works as another Stance that can be as effective as the Samurai fighting style.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 new combat mechanics up the game's complexity and fun-factor considerably</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With its three stances and focus on hard-hitting weapons like hammers and the Odachi, the Samurai fighting style will instantly feel familiar to anyone who played the previous entries in the series. However, significant changes have been implemented in this fighting style as well. For starters, the High Stance attacks are slightly slower than in Nioh 2, and generally riskier to use. </p>



<p>Although I didn't have the time for thorough testing, I replayed Nioh 2 extensively again before this hands-on opportunity, and the difference was immediately noticeable. Deflection mechanics, which essentially involve a well-timed block, are also a significant focus of this fighting style. With the visual better highlighting when one has been performed, a reactive playstyle definitely seems viable.</p>



<p>Besides the two fighting styles, the biggest change Nioh 3 brings to the combat experience is the introduction of Martial Arts mechanics. These special techniques performed with different button combinations or at the end of combo strings which were already present in the previous entries in the series, can be chained one after the other once the new Arts Gauge has been filled and the Arts Proficiency mode enabled by using a Strong Attack or Martial Arts to create devastating combos that can keep even bosses stunlocked for their duration. </p>



<p>Don't expect this to be a free-win mechanic, however, as Martial Arts still use Ki, and players need to manage it to keep their combo going. This system is heavily reminiscent of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</a>'s combat mechanics, and are a welcome addition that will make it easier for players of all skill levels to unleash the complex combos advanced players have discovered in Nioh 2.</p>



<p>As I wasn't used to these new mechanics, it took me a few minutes to move beyond what the muscle memory developed in Nioh 2 was making me do, but once I started getting used to them, they made combat more engaging, and taking on both returning and new Yokai was exhilarating. Particularly interesting was the final boss battle of the build against Takasugi Shinsaku, a real samurai who contributed heavily to the Meiji Restoration. Armed with a not exactly historically accurate gun, the samurai's fighting style is rather peculiar, which forced me to put the new mechanics to good use quickly. In true series tradition, the battle was challenging, but after a few tries, and a little bit of luck, I was able to take him down.</p>

<p>Weaving together the core Nioh series mechanics with features inspired by Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, Wo-Long: Fallen Dynasty and even <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/">Rise of the Ronin</a>, Nioh 3 feels like the culmination of all the masocore action RPGs developed by Team NINJA. How the exploration mechanics will hold up for dozen hours remains to be seen, but the first proper taste of the experience has undoubtedly made me even more excited about the game, and I cannot wait for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-trailer-provides-new-quick-look-at-story-and-gameplay-confirms-release-date/">February 6, 2026 when Nioh 3 launches on PC and PlayStation 5</a> to appreciate better the depth of the combat mechanics, which promise to outdo anything Team NINJA has done to date.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-pixel-10-pro-goes-cheaper-than-last-years-9-pro-amazon-crushes-google-on-black-friday-deals-2000646123</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-pixel-10-pro-goes-cheaper-than-last-year%E2%80%99s-9-pro-amazon-crushes-google-on-black-friday-deals.1360600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Google announced the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro only weeks ago, but Amazon has already chopped prices significantly for Black Friday. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5783/">Pixel 10 Pro 128GB slides to $749 from its debut price of $999</a>, while the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5784/">more affordable Pixel 10 (128BG) reaches $599 from $799</a>. Those are record-low prices and puts some serious pressure on competitors, particularly Apple’s suddenly less competitive iPhone 17 lineup. The Pixel 10 Pro brings true flagship specs with Google’s <strong>computational photography advantages and Gemini AI integration</strong> at a price that beats its premium competitors by hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gemini AI Assistant Changes Daily Smartphone Use</h2>
<p>The<strong> integrated Gemini AI assistant</strong> can do a lot more than simple voice-based requests to perform complex tasks across apps and contexts. You can ask it to summarize long email threads, write messages in your personal style, or provide information in depth by looking at pictures through the camera. For sensitive tasks, the AI processes requests locally on the <strong>Tensor G5 chip</strong> to maintain your data private while delivering fast responses. It feels far more organic than bolt-on AI features since it’s integrated into the core Android experience.</p>
<p>It learns your patterns and proactively provides information relevant to you without explicit commands. It suggests responses to messages based on context, reminds you about tasks mentioned in emails, and provides traffic updates for your regular routes at the right times. The AI automatically handles photo organization, creating event- and people-centric albums while making search phenomenally accurate with natural language queries.</p>



<p>The <strong>triple rear camera array features a combination of a 50MP main sensor, 48MP ultra-wide, and 48MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom</strong>. In typical Google style, computational photography processes several frames for each single shot, combining them to suppress noise, increase dynamic range, and capture finer detail than is visible in a single exposure. <strong>Night Sight mode delivers great photos</strong> in near darkness without flash, while retaining natural colors and revealing detail that’s completely invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>The <em>Super Res Zoom</em> extends beyond the 5x optical range through computational techniques that <strong>maintain image quality up to 30x digital zoom</strong>. Real-world results show surprisingly sharp details at 10-15x zoom levels that typically look pixelated on competing phones. Video recording reaches 4K at 60fps with advanced stabilization that smooths out walking motion and sudden movements. The <strong>Magic Eraser feature removes unwanted objects from photos</strong> convincingly and uses AI to fill in backgrounds naturally.</p>



<p>The <strong>6.3-inch Super Actua display leverages excellent brightness of as high as 2000 nits</strong>&nbsp;and it’s even readable in direct sunlight where other phones wash out. An adaptive 120Hz refresh rate dynamically changes based on the content: high refresh for scrolling and gaming, lower for static content, to save battery. Color accuracy and contrast are as good as standalone monitors, deep blacks thanks to the <strong>OLED panel</strong>&nbsp;and vibrant colors that do not look oversaturated.</p>
<p>The Tensor G5 chip handles everyday tasks smoothly while excelling at AI workloads that other processors struggle with. Apps launch quickly, multitasking stays responsive, and gaming performance matches what you’d expect from a flagship device. Efficiency from this chip combines with the <strong>5,060mAh battery to deliver genuine all-day usage</strong>&nbsp;with screen-on time exceeding 7 hours for most users. <strong>Fast charging reaches 50% in about 30 minutes</strong> and wireless charging offers convenient overnight top-ups.</p>
<p>For $749, you’re getting a flagship for $250 less than its launch price, hundreds below what Apple and Samsung charge for comparable specs. The Pixel 10 Pro matches or slightly outperforms the camera capabilities of an iPhone 17 Pro for thousands of dollars less, and the Gemini AI integration offers capabilities the competition can’t.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/playstation-drops-major-black-friday-deal-on-dualsense-now-selling-it-cheaper-than-no-name-controllers-2000646090</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-drops-major-black-friday-deal-on-dualsense-now-selling-it-cheaper-than-no-name-controllers.1360597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When it launched, the Playstation <em>DualSense</em> changed the way controllers felt in your hand and it remains the <strong>best way to experience PS5 games with its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers</strong>. Generic controllers will get the job done but they miss out on the immersive details that make modern games feel alive. The great news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5777/">Amazon just dropped the DualSense to $54 for Black Friday down from its usual $74 price</a>, with every color option seeing the same discount. That’s an all-time low, since these controllers never see any discount throughout the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5777/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Haptic Feedback Changes Everything</h2>
<p>The haptic feedback system replaces traditional rumble with <strong>precise vibrations that simulate different textures and actions</strong>. You feel the difference between walking on metal, grass, or sand through subtle vibrations that match the surface. When you pull a bowstring in a game, the adaptive triggers create actual resistance that increases as you draw back. This L2 and R2 trigger tension changes dynamically based on what you’re doing, whether that’s pressing a gas pedal, pulling a trigger, or drawing a weapon.</p>
<p>These <strong>features work across hundreds of PS5 titles now</strong>, and developers continue to find innovative ways to utilize them. Racing games can make you feel the road surface and brake pressure. Shooters give each weapon a distinct trigger feel. Even menu navigation gets enhanced with subtle haptic clicks that confirm your selections. The technology doesn’t just add novelty; it provides actual feedback that improves your control and connection to the game.</p>



<p>The <strong>onboard microphone lets you chat without needing a headset</strong>&nbsp;which is great for quick online sessions. The mic quality handles voice chat clearly enough for team coordination, though serious streamers will want a dedicated microphone. You can plug any headset directly into the 3.5mm jack when you need better audio or more privacy. The <em>Create</em> button replaces the old <em>Share</em> button and gives you quick access to screenshots, video clips, and broadcast features without interrupting gameplay.</p>
<p>The speaker built into the controller adds another audio layer in supported games: You hear environmental sounds, character voices, and sound effects emanating from the controller itself, which creates a much more three-dimensional audio experience. Some games use it for subtle details like radio chatter or reloading sounds. Others make it central to the experience, with sounds moving between your TV and controller based on where they originate in the game world.</p>



<p>The design retains the classic Playstation layout while <strong>refining the ergonomics and improving the analog sticks</strong>. The grips fit comfortably into medium to large hands, and the textured surface prevents slipping during intense gaming sessions. The analog sticks offer better precision compared to the previous generation, with improved resistance and dead zones that make aiming feel way more responsive. <strong>Battery life runs about 12 hours on a full charge</strong>&nbsp;which gets you through multiple gaming sessions before needing to plug in.</p>
<p>The <strong>addition of USB Type-C charging</strong> means faster power delivery along with a reversible cable that plugs in either way. Placing the port at the top of the controller gives easy access while playing. <strong>Bluetooth</strong> connectivity extends functionality to play with PS5 consoles, Windows PCs, and Mac computers, all from one controller. PC gaming support has significantly expanded, as more titles now have haptic feedback and adaptive triggers support on Windows. This cross-platform compatibility makes the DualSense useful beyond just your Playstation console.</p>
<p>The midnight black color option provides you with a stealthy alternative to the standard white and shows less wear over time. <strong>Other colors like cosmic red, starlight blue, and galactic purple all hit the same $54 price point</strong> during this sale – you can pick up multiple controllers in different colors and still manage to spend less than buying two at their regular price.</p>
<p>You’re getting here Sony’s flagship controller, complete with its advanced features, for less than the price of many third-party options at $54. The haptic feedback and adaptive triggers alone are worth this price, but you also get multi-device support, built-in audio options, and refined ergonomics. That’s genuine value since these controllers almost never drop below $60, and the Black Friday pricing makes it the right time to buy a backup or upgrade from older controllers.</p>

                <p>The Xbox Partner Preview showed off a bunch of cool and interesting projects coming to Xbox consoles and PC in the future, including Armatus, The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu, and Raji: Kaliyuga. However, the event itself bucked an annoying trend that other trailer showcases continue to follow, as each trailer that aired during the event showed the logos for <em>every</em> console the game will launch on, not just Xbox.</p><p>Traditionally, when a game makes an appearance during one of these events, the final shot confirms the game for the host company's consoles--PlayStation consoles for Sony, the Switch or Switch 2 for Nintendo, and so on.

The three exceptions were Echo Generation 2, Roadside Research, and Cloverpit, but all three of them are, as of this writing, only coming to Xbox consoles.</p><p>This small detail seems to be another nod toward Xbox's strategy of catering to as many platforms as possible through its "This is an Xbox" campaign and Xbox Play Anywhere, where players purchase a game on one platform and have access to it on Xbox, PC, and mobile devices. The Partner Preview yesterday, in fact, began with the confirmation that every game shown during the event would have Xbox Play Anywhere capabilities.</p><p>The Xbox Partner Preview brought 16 game updates and new reveals, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/im-making-this-for-me-not-to-make-everyone-happy-vampire-survivors-creator-on-his-next-game/1100-6536362/" data-ref-id="1100-6536362">Vampire Crawlers from poncle</a>, the previously-mentioned Armatus from Godfall developer Counterplay Games, and Tides of Annihilation from Chinese studio Eclipse Glow Games.</p>

            <p>It looks like we could be seeing Ubisoft's long-rumoured Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Remake set sail really rather soon.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-116bn-tencent-investment-into-assassins-creed-maker-is-on-track-following-last-weeks-surprise-delay-to-financial-report">Ubisoft released its delayed financials</a>. Here, the company laid out its slate of upcoming games, all of which are set to arrive before the end of its current financial year. That means, by 31st March, 2026.</p>
<p>The company mentions an "unannounced title", which is planned for a release in the fourth quarter of its 2025-2026 fiscal year. Many now suspect this is indeed the remake of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag. </p>

<p> "Anno 117: Pax Romana launched on November 13 with a Metacritic rating of 85.  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> Valley of Memory update launched on November 18. Avatar Frontiers of  Pandora From the Ashes expansion will release on December 19, coinciding with the new movie. Prince  of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, Rainbow Six Mobile, The Division Resurgence and an unannounced title are planned for Q4," the financials read.</p>
<p>This unannounced title also cropped up in <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/33qBiRpCj1Z9Ib5bbfbg5r/d4ab539ca9edd1fa28ebc0aec5b1af27/Ubisoft_H1_FY26_Slideshow_vFinal.pdf">Ubisoft's investor's presentation</a>, with the mysterious game replaced with a blank box (see below).</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Black Flag actor Matt Ryan again suggested Ubisoft was set to release a remake of its piratical Assassin's Creed entry. Ryan - who played Edward Kenway in Black Flag - hinted not very subtly to one fan they should perhaps get ready to replay the game, implying with a bit of a 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' that the remake was indeed real. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">Ubisoft then threatened the actor with legal action</a> following his remake slip-up.</p>
<p>More recently in September, French outlet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qngrBQnukFc">Jeuxvideo</a> reported Black Flag's modern day sections have been removed from Ubisoft's upcoming remake.</p>
<p>So, should all this lead to a potentially imminent release of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag's remake, will you be jumping back aboard with Edward and co?</p>

<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">Assassin's Creed's then-boss Marc-Alexis Côté left Ubisoft</a>, following the formation of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-funded subsidiary. Soon after his departure from Ubisoft, Côté clarified that while he was offered another role within the company, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">did not "carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work [he] had been entrusted with"</a>.</p>

            <p>Resident Evil Requiem will feature characters from previous games in the series, the game's producer has confirmed, but he won't confirm who.</p>
<p>Capcom's forthcoming ninth mainline game in the series stars Grace Ashcroft as the protagonist, daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft who features in spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-outbreak">Resident Evil Outbreak</a>.</p>
<p>As such, <a href="https://www.well-played.com.au/chatting-the-return-to-raccoon-city-and-designing-resident-evil-requiem-with-the-games-producer/">Well Played</a> asked producer Masato Kumazawa if other characters from Outbreak will make an appearance.</p>

<p>"I would say that yes, there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don’t over-expect or hype it," said Kumazawa.</p>
<p>"We can't promise you anything about that, but the only thing I can say is that there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game."</p>
<p>Of course, the subtext of this line of questioning was probably to uncover further if fan-favourite Leon Kennedy will feature in the game. Rumours have been swirling that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> and 4 protagonist will be included somewhere in Requiem.</p>
<p>Yet back in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">Requiem's director Koshi Nakanishi stated Leon</a> isn't the sort of person to "jump at something like a bucket falling", which is why he's "actually quite a bad match for horror".</p>
<p>Instead, Grace was chosen as a "relatable" protagonist more suited to the genre.</p>
<p>Still, no doubt Kumazawa's comment will get tongues waggling. Leon, as well as Claire Redfield, would certainly fit the bill as being "involved in the Raccoon City incident", but they would certainly warrant more hype than Kumazawa is teasing.</p>
<p>Perhaps more likely will be one of the other playable characters from Outbreak besides Alyssa, such as Kevin Ryman or Yoko Suzuki.</p>
<p>In another interview recently, Kumazawa confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-fans-resident-evil-requiem-wont-be-getting-a-public-demo-as-capcom-focuses-on-creating-the-best-quality-game">Resident Evil Requiem won't be getting a public demo</a>, unlike other recent series entries.</p>
<p>Further, prior knowledge of Resident Evil Outbreak won't be required - so even if previous characters do reappear, they should be well-integrated into the story.</p>

            <p>It's fair to say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s anniversary update's earned some stick due to effect it had on PC mods, just like the RPG's next-gen update did before it. Lots of works needed updating, and while that happened <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4s-script-extender-has-already-gotten-its-anniversary-update-as-bethesda-battle-creation-issues">pretty quickly in a number of cases</a>, there was still disruption for some additions that generally feel a lot more necessary over on console.</p>
<p>Enter modding platform Nexus Mods, who've decided to follow-up the update by putting together their own "anniversary collection" of Fallout 4 mods from the works they host, with hopes it'll serve as a free alternative aimed at celebrating ten years of the RPG being modded.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Last week Fallout 4 turned ten," reads <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15406">the announcement</a> of this mod collection penned by Nexus Mods content team member ModularCocoon. "A whole decade since we stepped out into the Commonwealth for the first time and while Bethesda marked the occasion with an Anniversary Update, let’s be honest, it didn’t quite land with the impact many hoped for. So we've decided to mark the milestone our own way!"</p>
<p>Hence what's currently a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/fallout4/collections/lepwiy/mods">56-strong list of mods</a> designed to serve as "a fully curated, fully compatible, and completely free celebration of ten years of modding creativity". It's a mix of already popular stuff, including quest mods like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/75767?tab=description">America Rising 2 - Legacy of the Enclave</a> by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-4-best-enclave-quest-mod-creator-reveals-how-it-came-to-be">Otellino</a>, gear like the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/77496">anti-material rifle</a> by Nostoso, and world tweaks such as SabutaiKhan's mod which adds <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/51945">Talon Company mercenaries</a> to The Commonwealth. There are also some settlement additions and a new location in the form of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/84449">Boon Island</a> by Tenhats and Shreddah4, with the latter having recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4s-latest-modder-made-expansion-takes-you-to-some-misery-islands-with-a-history-of-corruption-decay-and-loneliness">gotten a sequel</a>.</p><p>"We’ll be maintaining this collection for the remainder of this year while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/maybe-hold-off-a-bit-longer-on-reinstalling-your-fallout-4-mods-as-bethesda-have-two-anniversary-update-patches-planned">things settle</a> surrounding the Fallout 4 Anniversary Update," Nexus Mods explained. "However, if you or anyone else you know would love to take over maintaining the collection, do reach out to any of us on the content or community teams."</p>
<p>The collection's curators have drawn a bit of ire in some comments on the mod list and its announcement from folks who reckon it doesn't include all the requirements needed for all of its works and some mods that may not work with the game's anniversary update version. A response from Nexus Mods content team member Modsetti says some instances of this are either being looked into or have been sorted already.</p>
<p>As ever with mods, it's worth checking each one you install yourself if you're keen to make sure you avoid any unexpected hiccups. It also feels like it might be physically impossible at this stage for anything with 'Fallout 4 anniversary' in the name to go off totally hitch-free.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-4-pack-of-govee-smart-light-bulbs-is-nearly-free-amazon-prices-them-like-regular-budget-bulbs-2000646086</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-4-pack-of-govee-smart-light-bulbs-is-nearly-free-amazon-prices-them-like-regular-budget-bulbs.1360567/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smart lighting changes a room, and these bulbs yield that change in minutes. You screw them into any standard socket, open an app and you’ll suddenly be in full control of your home’s atmosphere. The Govee smart light bulbs are one of those extremely rare smart home products that actually lives up to the <em>“easy”</em> promise while genuinely changing your daily experience. And the good news is that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5776/">just dropped the 4-pack to an all-time low of $23 for Black Friday, down from the usual $39 price tag</a> (40% off).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5776/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See offer</a></p>

<h2>16 Million Colors Makes a Difference</h2>
<p>That color range here isn’t just some marketing number: these bulbs <strong>pack 16 million color options along with 54 preset scenes</strong> that cover everything from movie night to dinner party vibes. You can dial in the exact shade you want for any situation, whether that’s a warm amber for evening reading or a cool blue for focus work. The RGBWW setup means you get proper white light too, not some washed-out white that cheaper RGB bulbs produce. <strong>Each bulb pumps out 800 lumens</strong>&nbsp;which gives you plenty of brightness for standard rooms without needing multiple bulbs per fixture.</p>
<p>The music sync feature converts any space into a reactive environment. Your phone’s microphone picks up the audio, and the bulbs shift colors and brightness to match the beats. This works great for parties or just making your regular music listening more immersive. You do need to make sure no other app is using your microphone, but once that’s clear, the sync happens in real time with minimal lag.</p>



<p>Voice control via <strong>Alexa or Google Assistant</strong> means you can change lighting without having to touch your phone. Simple commands, such as <em>“dim the living room”</em> or <em>“set bedroom to warm white,”</em> work exactly as you’d expect. The Govee Home app gives you more granular control when you want it, letting you fine-tune brightness percentages, save custom scenes, and switch between modes. The app connects via both WiFi and Bluetooth, though you’ll want that WiFi connection for remote control when you’re away from home.</p>



<p>Group control makes it easier to operate several bulbs over different rooms: You create a scheme in the app, add whatever bulbs you want in that group, then control them all at the same time. This saves time when you’re setting up lighting for the whole house or just want to turn everything off at once. The bulbs require a stable 2.4GHz WiFi connection for this to function well, so bear in mind this if you have a dual-band router set to auto-switch frequencies.</p>
<p>Lighting seamlessly fits into your routines through the timer and scheduling functions. You can also make bulbs gradually brighten at the time your alarm goes off, simulating a natural sunrise that makes waking up less jarring. At night, sunset mode slowly dims your lights as bedtime approaches. These scheduled changes happen automatically once you set them up, and you can adjust the timing whenever your schedule shifts.</p>
<p>Installation takes roughly two minutes per bulb, as <strong>they fit standard A19 sockets</strong> and don’t require any special fixtures or complicated wiring. The bulbs draw their power from standard AC 120V outlets and connect to your network during an initial setup process. One limitation to know upfront is that these won’t work with smart switches, since the bulbs need constant power to maintain their connection and respond to commands.</p>
<p>This 4-pack at $23 gets you four rooms worth of smart lighting for less than some brands charge for a single premium bulb. Easy setup combines with generally reliable app control and genuine functionality to make this one of the better entry points into smart home lighting. You’re getting music sync, voice control, and millions of color <strong>options for about $6 per bulb</strong>, which is what basic LED bulbs cost just a few years ago.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytales-modding-strategy-makes-it-easier-for-players-to-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hytale%E2%80%99s-modding-strategy-makes-it-easier-for-players-to-access.1360564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The modding strategy for Hytale has been outlined by Hypixel Studios, and it will be easier for everyone to access servers with mods enabled.</p>



<p>Hytale is back on the agenda after being scrapped by Riot Games earlier this year, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hypixel Studios’ original founders re-purchasing the rights to the game</a> and all development, and a playable experience is right around the corner, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announcement-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date for early access set to be shared next week</a>.</p>



<p>Modding will be core to the Hytale experience, unsurprisingly given that Hypixel began as a Minecraft mod, and details have been shared that will make it easy for players to enjoy modded content.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-modding-will-be-server-side">Hytale Modding Will Be Server-Side</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to offer. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-modding-strategy-and-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed blog post</a> about modding in Hytale, it was announced that all modding in the game is “based on the host of the server or host of the game,” and that players should be able to join any modded server “without downloading external mods or juggling client packs.”</p>



<p>Players will be able to download mods directly for customisation in single-player servers, and, crucially, Hytale is not planning to support any client mods, restricting the need for additional downloads further.</p>



<p>The modding ambitions for Hytale are huge and will be open access, with Blocks, Items, NPCs, World Generation, UIs, systems, and behaviors “all driven by data and code that you can influence.”</p>



<p>However, it’s also detailed that modders will experience limitations when early access goes live due to the current stage of development, and Hypixel Studios has made no secret of the fact it will be a long process for full release, and early access players and modders will encounter issues.</p>



<p>Modders have been told there will be “limitations due to missing editing capabilities,” that “certain aspects of client behaviour are not yet exposed,” and “moddering maturity is wildly uneven.” Additionally, some tools and systems are described as “rough, inconsistent, or painful to work with.”</p>



<p>Hypixel Studios will not hide valuable features from modders, however, and, “if something is useful,” they will “try to make it available and iterate it.” Modders and players throughout early access are urged to hold Hypixel Studios “responsible,” with a commitment to “being transparent and telling you the truth.”</p>

            <p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has stated generative AI has been integrated across the entire company, expressing his belief that generative AI is as big a "revolution" for video games as the shift from 2D to 3D.</p>
<p>Guillemot (<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-delayed-results">via Game File</a>) spent a short but explosive minute near the start of a recent earnings call to speak on generative AI in particular, which appears to be taking a larger role in Ubisoft's works moving forward.</p>
<p>Guillemot stated: "We are making great strides in applying Gen AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams...It's as big [of] a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D. And we have everything to lead on this front."</p>

<p>Guillemot continued: "On the player experience side, we are continuing to make progress on groundbreaking player-facing generative AI applications, building on our neo NPC announcements in 2024. We have already advanced from prototyping to player reality, and we are looking forward to sharing more before the end of the year."</p><p>Finally, Guillemot stated Ubisoft's embrace of AI goes beyond dedicated AI projects, and that AI-use has already been integrated into every development team across all of Ubisoft's offices. He explained: "On the production side, we now have teams in all our studios and offices embracing this new technology and constantly exploring new use cases in programming, art and overall game quality."</p>
<p>So far the publicly shown results of Ubisoft's venture into the wild world of generative AI resulted in a prototype version of the aforementioned Neo NPCs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-unveils-generative-ai-neo-npcs-and-the-spirit-of-peter-molyneuxs-milo-lives-on">which Eurogamer's own Chris Tapsell experienced firsthand</a>.  He described the tech as "a tool that's been built first - on the notion that if we build it, someone clever will surely come along and make use of it. There's an argument to say that's somewhat back-to-front: the best tools are solutions to problems those clever people already have." Perhaps we'll see how this tech is actually used soon.</p>
<p>Guillemot previously stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-generative-ai-is-just-another-new-technology-to-be-tested">generative AI was "just another technology to be tested"</a>, but fast forward to this current era of AI bullishness, it appears he's gripped this AI tech with both hands. Even so, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-admits-ai-generated-loading-screen-slipped-through-into-final-build-of-anno-117-pax-romana">Ubisoft recently apologised to Anno 117: Pax Romana players for the "accidental" inclusion of an AI loading screen</a> in the release version of that game. Perhaps the AI-focused Ubisoft has some hurdles to overcome as it adopts this new technology.</p>
<p>This earnings call came shortly after the cessation of trading for Ubisoft, which sent the entire industry into mass speculation. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-116bn-tencent-investment-into-assassins-creed-maker-is-on-track-following-last-weeks-surprise-delay-to-financial-report">Ubisoft confirmed that this was due to an issue with new auditors</a>, despite broad speculation of a grander acquisition.</p>

It's all go in the foggy world of Silent Hill. Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-brilliant-remake-surprise-launches-on-xbox-series-xs-with-a-massive-discount-ahead-of-tonights-showcase">yesterday's surprise Australian launch</a>, last year's stupendous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake is finally available on Xbox Series X/S worldwide - and Christophe Gans' upcoming movie adaptation has received a new trailer too.
</p>
<p>
Starting with that Xbox Series X/S release, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s Silent Hill 2 remake - which we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">gave five stars to</a> last year - is available now via the Xbox/Microsoft Store with a whopping 50 percent off, meaning you can currently <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/silent-hill-2/9PNVDQKPJRQV/0010">pick up the standard edition for £27.49 in the UK</a>, rather than the usual £54.98. The Deluxe Edition - which throws in a digital art book, digital soundtrack, and Pyramid Head mask - is similarly discounted to £34.99. This limited-time 50 percent discount should also be reflected across PlayStation and PC digital storefronts sometime today.

<p>
There're actually two additional purchase options launching today across all platforms: a Silent Hill 2 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> bundle is available in both standard and deluxe forms. This will supposedly be discounted by 20 percent starting on 25th November but it's not entirely clear how - or if - that'll stack with the current Silent Hill 2 discount. Silent Hill f, incidentally, is bloomin' marvellous, successfully managing to capture the essence of the long-running survival horror series despite some massive changes. It'll be discounted by 30 percent on PlayStation from today and everywhere else from 25th November - and you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-is-the-first-game-in-four-decades-to-convince-me-new-game-plus-is-worth-my-time">some of my thoughts on its brilliance elsewhere on Eurogamer</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of capturing the essence of Silent Hill, we now have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_oNLLln8aE">another trailer</a> for director Christophe Gans' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-will-be-faithful-adaptation-of-silent-hill-2-distributor-promises">"faithful"</a> upcoming movie adaptation of Silent Hill 2, Return to Silent Hill - and, well, I remain skeptical.

<p>
It's certainly plundering the series' familiar iconography - you've got your foggy streets, your wonky nurses, your Pyramid Head, and Akira Yamaoka's score - but the trailer's brash editing and in-your-face style is a million miles from the subdued melancholy of its source material. Hopefully, this is just the usual bums-on-seats marketing tactic, and the finished thing is closer to the good bits of Gans' atmospheric but wildly uneven original Silent Hill movie - but we'll know for sure when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/christophe-gans-faithful-silent-hill-2-movie-adaptation-gets-a-2026-release-date">hits cinemas on 23rd January 2026</a>. And honestly, I'm prepared to forgive everything - even Mary's apparently chopped "In my restless dreams..." line - if they've gone with the dog ending.

Because of course..!</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chef-kawasaki-micro-bikini-ride-deleted-from-kirby-air-riders-machine-market-immediately-replaced-by-succubus-chef-kawasaki/">Automaton</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-starts-removing-player-made-bikini-chef-kirby-air-riders-designs-as-they-top-the-in-game-marketplace/">VGC</a>), player-created machines have been flooding the game's Machine Marketplace, which lets users purchase new vehicles in exchange for coins earned in races. The more popular a vehicle is, the more its price will increase.</p>
<p>Machines depicting Chef Kawasaki in a micro bikini appear to be based on a <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/79941849">meme</a> that circulated in 2020, with the first showing up just shortly after Air Riders' launch. It quickly shot up the ranks in the Marketplace, but Nintendo is seemingly not keen on its presence, with the design now completely unavailable for purchase.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adqijhvk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Now that players are aware of Nintendo's intentions to remove such depictions of Chef Kawasaki, similar designs are quickly gaining value in the marketplace, with players seemingly scared of their impending removals. The design below showcases the same micro bikini, but with matching wings, tail, and shoes.</p>

<p>VGC has since confirmed that this design, too, has been removed after it became the most expensive machine on the marketplace. However, a third is supposedly rising up the ranks rapidly, this time featuring bikini Kawasaki holding two pans.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how long this one will last.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-drops-airpods-max-to-new-all-time-low-on-amazon-rivals-sony-and-bose-are-freaking-out.1360540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The premium active noise canceling headphone market is filled to the brim with offerings from Sony, Bose, Sonos, and many more all vying for your attention. Apple is still Apple, however, and the AirPods Max is one of the best-selling products in the category despite the crowded competition and higher price tag.</p>
<p>This r<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/">ecord low of $429 at Amazon, down from the usual $549</a>, puts extreme pressure on every competitor in the space. A great sound, professional-level noise cancellation, and that Apple integration make for value that justifies the investment, especially at this Black Friday pricing which undercuts rivals.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Noise Cancellation Silences the World</h2>
<p>Computational audio combined with advanced algorithms allows the <strong>active noise-cancellation system to block outside sound</strong> with phenomenal effectiveness. Each ear cup has three outward-facing microphones that detect ambient noise, while one inward-facing microphone monitors sound that reaches your ear. This audio is <strong>processed 200 times per second</strong> by the system to create anti-noise that cancels out unwanted sounds before they reach your ears.</p>
<p>The effectiveness goes beyond what most of the competition achieves and creates a level of isolation that allows for focused work or pure enjoyment of music anywhere. You immediately notice the difference it makes on flights, in busy offices, or while you’re walking down crowded streets where background noise simply disappears. The <strong>system continuously adjusts to your environment and head movements</strong>, and keeps consistent cancellation even as conditions change around you.</p>



<p><strong>Transparency mode opens external microphones</strong> to allow outside sound to pass through naturally when you need awareness of your surroundings. Because of the audio processing, it makes external sounds feel natural, not artificial or amplified, allowing you to hear conversations, traffic, or announcements while still wearing the headphones.</p>
<p>Personalized spatial audio provides a kind of theatre-like experience, and <strong>allows audio sources to appear in three-dimensional space around you</strong>. The system uses head tracking to keep sound anchored to your device even as you turn your head, maintaining the illusion that audio comes from fixed positions in space. It works best with movies and spatial audio music, where instruments and voices occupy distinct positions in the sound stage. The personalization uses the <em>TrueDepth</em> camera found in compatible iPhones to map your ear geometry and then adjusts the audio profile to fit your specific anatomy.</p>



<p>Computational audio and the <strong>Apple-designed H1 chip make for sound quality that is on par with a set of dedicated audiophile headphones</strong> that cost significantly more. Bass response stays tight and controlled, not bleeding into midrange frequencies. Vocals sound clear and forward with very good detail, showcasing subtle textures in recordings. High-frequency response extends smoothly without harshness, making these comfortable during extended listening sessions.</p>
<p><strong>This aluminum and stainless steel construction</strong> imbues these headphones with significant heft and a truly premium feel that few competitors can match. The mesh canopy and memory foam ear cushions spread weight out for comfortable wear, but the overall heft still makes its presence felt during long listening sessions. USB-C charging brings the AirPods Max in line with modern standards, making it more convenient to charge them using the same cables as you do your phones and laptops. <strong>Battery life reaches about 20 hours</strong> with active noise cancellation turned on, which should easily get you through several days of typical use.</p>
<p>With the H1 chip, seamless integration with Apple devices happens automatically: instant pairing, switching between your iPhone, iPad, and Mac is a breeze. It also allows for hands-free Siri activation through voice commands. Automatic switching detects which device you’re actively using and routes audio to it appropriately. These integrations work exclusively within the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p>At $429, they’re $120 below standard pricing while offering audio quality and features comparable or better than competitors at similar or higher prices. Sony’s WH-1000XM5 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra sell around $500 so the AirPods Max are competitive on price while offering superior build quality and the advantages of being part of the Apple ecosystem.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/blueair-drops-black-friday-deal-on-air-purifier-now-selling-for-pocket-change-for-healthier-sleep-2000646110</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blueair-drops-black-friday-deal-on-air-purifier-now-selling-for-pocket-change-for-healthier-sleep.1360537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You spend roughly a third of your life sleeping so the air quality in your bedroom is crucial in terms of health and quality of rest. The same can be said for living rooms, home offices, and other places where you will be spending plenty of time. Good-quality air purifiers aren’t cheap with premium models from reputable brands coming in well above the $200 threshold. However, Blueair breaks that pattern this Black Friday by offering an all-time low on Amazon – <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5781/">dropping the Blue Pure 211i Max down to $199 from its usual $349 price (42% off)</a>. This is the <strong>best pricing ever seen</strong> on one of the most effective air purification systems on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5781/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>HEPASilent Technology Cleans Faster and Quieter</h2>
<p>The HEPASilent dual-filtration system combines mechanical and electrostatic filtration to achieve better performance than standard HEPA filters alone. This technology cleans the air up to 83% faster while generating 50% less noise than traditional HEPA systems. The <strong>purifier can process enough air to clean a 3,048 square foot</strong> space in one hour, a 1,524 square foot room in 30 minutes, or the typical 635 square foot bedroom in about 12 minutes on high speed.</p>
<p>The filtration captures <strong>99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.1 microns, going smaller than what standard HEPA filters catch</strong>. This means the system removes viruses, smoke particles, pet dander, pollen, mold spores, and dust with exceptional efficiency. Light household odors from cooking, pets, and smoke are handled by the layer in the carbon filter, but it does much better with fresher odors than deeply embedded ones.</p>



<p><em>Quiet Mark</em> certification confirms this is a <strong>purifier that runs at 23 to 53 decibels</strong> depending on the fan speed. The lowest setting is quieter than a whisper and thus can be applied in bedrooms during sleep with no disturbance. Even the highest speed remains below regular conversation levels, so you can easily run this device during the day without its interfering with your work calls or TV watching. Impressively, it keeps the noise level low, considering how much air this unit is actually capable of moving.</p>
<p>Smart app integration allows remote control of the purifier, programming operation times, and air quality monitoring from your phone. The Welcome Home geofencing feature automatically turns the purifier on when you approach home so the air is clean by the time you arrive. Clean Air ETA lets you know how much time until a room reaches your target level of air quality.</p>



<p>The onboard pollution sensor measures particles PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 in real time and displays results through a 5-color air quality index. If air quality changes-whether from cooking, opening windows, or other activities that introduce particles-you see immediate feedback. In auto mode, the fan speeds ramp up as pollution builds and ramp down as the air cleans up. This automation means you do not need to constantly adjust settings yourself.</p>
<p>The advanced functionalities are <strong>kept simple with the two-button design and LED display</strong>. You control fan speeds from 1 to 4, engage night mode for minimal noise and lighting, adjust the brightness of the display, and utilize child lock to avoid accidental changes. Alexa voice control provides another layer of convenience in the form of hands-free adjustments.</p>
<p>You’re getting the top-performing Blueair purifier for 43% off at $199 and brings premium air cleaning into budget territory. Meanwhile, combining fast cleaning speeds with quiet operation and smart features usually means paying $300 or more from competing brands.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The early access release date for Hytale will be announced by the end of next week, Hypixel Studios has revealed, with anticipation for the title continuing to rise.</p>



<p>Hytale was scrapped by Riot Games but has been revived by the original founders of the title, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchase announced earlier this month</a>, and it’s unlikely to be long until players get their hands on the game.</p>



<p>While the official 1.0 release is likely to be a ways off, early access could be right around the corner, and an official announcement on the release date is coming next week.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-early-access-announcement-next-week">Hytale Early Access Announcement Next Week</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big news imminent. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Hypixel Studios founder Simon Collins-Laflamme continued a slew of news updates regarding Hytale by confirming that plans for the early access release date will be revealed before the end of next week.</p>



<p>It’s set to be a week full of info, as the post states that Hytale will be tested across different hardware “to determine the minimum specs,” with major crashes being fixed, launcher tests, and finishing up the legal work to prepare the game for early access.</p>



<p>The post states that a “precise release date” will be announced next week, with a follow up post confirming this is for the early access release, and not for the full version.</p>



<p>Anticipation for Hytale is high, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-coming-soonand-shows-off-16-minutes-of-minecraft-like-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">16-minute gameplay video</a> attracting over one million views in a matter of days, and the long wait for a playable version of the game to be available is coming to an end.</p>



<p>Development for Hytale began in 2015, with Riot Games purchasing Hypixel Studios five years later in 2020. However, Riot cancelled the title in June this year, but the game has been saved by the original developer, and players are set to be a major part of ongoing development.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Publisher says Tencent deal closure still "imminent."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has celebrated a fresh set of financial results that it says has been driven by a "strong performance" for its Assassin's Creed franchise. But while there's an update on sales figures for 2023's Mirage, there's no new figure for how this year's Shadows has sold. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The French publisher's latest earnings report, published this morning, covers the company's performance over the first half of the current year: April through September. Last week, Ubisoft delayed the publication of these results at the last minute, prompting speculation that something had gone wrong with the company's big Tencent deal — though there's no suggestion of that today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has framed the results in a positive light, with net bookings for the past quarter "above expectations" and up 39% year-on-year. "The outperformance was driven by stronger-than-expected partnerships," Ubisoft noted, "and was supported by a robust back-catalog, both highlighting the strength of the Group's brands."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One back catalogue game seemingly doing very well is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, the series' return to a smaller, city-based adventure that launched a couple of years ago. Today, Ubisoft announced a new 10 million sales milestone for the title, and said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirages-saudi-backed-valley-of-memory-expansion-looks-a-generous-free-side-quest-though-not-one-many-fans-would-have-asked-for">its recent Saudi Arabia-funded free update</a> had received "very positive" feedback from fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But on the sales performance of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the franchise's blockbuster feudal Japan entry launched in March, Ubisoft was less clear. Without providing a new sales total, Ubisoft simply said the game had "benefited" from the launch of its New Game+ mode and recent Claws of Awaji expansion, which seems obvious. The company then pointed to the game's upcoming Switch 2 launch as an oppurtunity for it to "reach a broader audience." Back in July, Ubisoft said Shadows had surpassed 5 million players, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-suffers-mixed-results-as-assassins-creed-shadows-hits-5-million-players-while-rainbow-six-siege-x-struggles">that its performance had been in line with expectations</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of Assassin's Creed, Ubisoft noted that Rainbow Six Siege's cheating issues were continuing to temporarily impact "activity and player spending versus expectations," following the game's previous move to an essentially free-to-play model.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft still expects to finalize its $1.16 billion deal with Chinese conglomerate Tencent in the near future, company boss Yves Guillemot said, noting that "all conditions precedent have been satisfied." The transaction will secure funding for Vantage Studios, Ubisoft's new self-contained subsidiary in charge of its biggest brands, including Assassin's Creed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Guillemot revealed that more of these companies, termed Creative Houses, will be detailed in January — a point at which the Tencent deal should presumably be sorted. After this, the future shape of the company should become clear, following years of internal turmoil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These Creative Houses will be autonomous, efficient, focused and accountable business units, each with its own leadership, creative vision and strategic roadmap," Guillemot concluded. "This Group-wide transformation reflects our ambition to renew how we create and operate in order to deliver great games for our players and lasting value for our partners and shareholders."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
