            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-biggest-update-to-date-is-out-now-adding-new-npcs-animal-companions-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the release of Enshrouded, Keen Games has been nonstop on adding quality-of-life changes to the game and major content updates for the title to keep it fresh in the Early Access period. When it comes to value for money, Enshrouded is undoubtedly it. Today, the fourth content update, Souls of the Frozen Frontier, is out and available. This is their biggest update yet and adds a ton of new content to explore, as well as bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements. The full 1.0 launch of Enshrouded is edging ever closer, as the full release is planned for 2025 on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. This title has been in Early Access since <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-hits-30-million-players-since-january/">January 2024</a>, and Keen Games is showing no signs of slowing down. If you are getting stuck into the latest update, there is a lot to look forward to.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of the new update, Keen Games has released two videos to show off the features, with one being a general trailer and the other being a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpK-BZdngOc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature spotlight</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enshrouded - Souls of the Frozen Frontier | Official Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PogZ1u9mGSM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First and foremost, there is now a new region to explore named the Albaneve Summits. Here, you'll get to experience the brand-new dynamic weather system, which will be featured throughout the entirety of Embervale and will take you through snowy tundras, ice plains, and plenty of new quests. The Summit is home to a lot of new monsters and creatures, as well as materials that you can bring back to your base and use for crafting.</p>
<p>For some, the most important things that are being added to Enshrouded are pets and farm animals. You can now have furry friends to keep you company at base. Anything non-aggressive can be tamed, and you can then help escort them back to your base. To make sure they're safe and happy, you can provide them with a home and some treats to keep them happy. If you are keeping farm animals, they will also drop resources that you can use every once in a while.</p>
<p>That's not all, as there are also new NPCs that you can find throughout Embervale, which can now be asked to return with you to your base to assist with crafting recipes and other tasks. Along with this comes new armor sets that you can equip to remain fashionable as you explore the expansive world of Enshrouded, with the player level cap now being increased to level 35 in the new update. This will allow you to access new spells, skills, and additional perks to help you survive the frozen areas of Embervale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-reckons-the-idea-of-an-exclusive-is-disappearing-altogether/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Final Fantasy XVI producer and Final Fantasy XIV director Naoki Yoshida was recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/811/G081112/20241010055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by the Japanese website 4Gamer alongside series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi to discuss the upcoming game <a href="https://wccftech.com/fantasian-neo-dimension-launches-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FANTASIAN Neo Dimension</a>, which will be available next month on PC and consoles after an exclusive debut on Apple Arcade.</span></p>
<p>When asked whether he'd ever want to make a game for Apple's platform, Yoshida-san replied that in his mind, the idea of a platform exclusive is disappearing altogether.</p>
<p><em>Now the biggest gaming platform is the PC, and with the streaming boom, PC-based gamers are becoming mainstream. But on the other hand, smart devices are becoming a platform that everyone has for the younger generation. Given that, if possible, it would be better to make it playable on any platform rather than making it for a specific platform in order to reach a much larger audience. With that as a basic idea, I decide whether the game I'm trying to make will run properly on smart devices.</em><br>
<em>If the parts that can't be run are equal to the fun of the game, I'll give up on smart devices and make it fun. On the other hand, if it fits within the specs and can be played without the device getting too hot to touch, it's definitely better to make it for smart devices as well. In my mind, the idea of ​​a platform exclusive is disappearing altogether.</em></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI certainly suffered from that. It was only available on PlayStation 5 for over a year, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-fell-short-high-end-sales-goal-slow-ps5-adoption-blamed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led</a> to weak sales, similar to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Now, Square Enix has largely <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-unveils-new-business-plan-with-aggressive-multiplatform-strategy-and-quality-over-quantity-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched</a> to a multiplatform strategy that will take Xbox into much greater account. Yoshida reiterates the shift later in the aforementioned interview:</p>
<p><em>This time, we will also release the Xbox Series X|S version (of FANTASIAN: Neo Dimension) at the same time. In the future, Square Enix titles will be released simultaneously on each platform more and more, but since this is close to the first release, we would like Xbox users to play it as well.</em></p>
<p>Xbox fans are hoping Square Enix will eventually bring Final Fantasy XVI to their favorite platform, too, after the recent debut on PC.</p>

<p>As Planet Coaster 2 launches simultaneously on PC and PlayStation 5, along with the Xbox Series X|S, it does indeed have a platinum trophy to unlock. It’s called “Heir to the Throne,” and of course, requires you to unlock all other trophies in the game to acquire.</p>



<p>It’s quite the challenge, but savvy fans with experience in previous “Planet” titles should have no issue meeting the unlock requirements for each of the above-mentioned Planet Coaster 2 achievements and trophies!</p>

            <p>As part of celebrations for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-2">Halo 2</a>'s 20th anniversary this November, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a> Studios is releasing a recreation of that lost E3 demo from 2003, via a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshopsubmitinfo/">Steam Workshop</a> mod for the Master Chief Collection.</p>
<p>"The buzz and hype going into that event was off the charts and the stakes were higher than ever," reflected Halo's community director Brian Jarrard, in an anniversary blog post.</p>
<p>"I have fond memories of so much playtesting and practising, internal challenges to see who could take out every single enemy in a flawless playthrough."</p>

<p>Jarred spoke about the "electric" response to Halo 2's E3 demo. "None of us ever would have expected that 20+ years later, a group of passionate community modders would bring this demo to life as a full-fledged mission," he continued.</p><p>As for why it has taken so long for the demo to be playable to the wider Halo community, this was due to 'snags with technology'. Thankfully, the original files and assets have now been recovered, although work still needed to be done to make the demo playable today. This was because the 2003 demo was built in a version of the Halo engine that doesn't actually exist any more, and assets weren't compatible with other existing versions of Halo 2.</p>
<p>"This put us in a bit of a quandary," Halo senior franchise writer Kenneth Peters explained. "Even the original executable is difficult to work with, as you need an Xbox developer kit to get it to boot, which is in increasingly short supply even within the studio. But now, in 2024, we have the Digsite-developed tools to analyse and automate up-porting old assets, and the unearthed knowledge to know why Bungie built things the way they did in the demo."</p>
<p>The free Halo 2 E3 demo mod will be released on 9th November, via Steam Workshop, and include gameplay that didn't make it into the final release.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> players will be able to revisit recreations of Halo 2 multiplayer maps and gameplay in Halo Infinite's Delta Arena Playlist from today, 5th November. Further details can be found via <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/04/20-years-of-halo-2-new-maps-e3-demo/">Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>For more, last month a former member of Texas-based support studio Certain Affinity confirmed reports the team was working on a battle royale mode for Halo Infinite, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-halo-infinite-dev-confirms-cancelled-battle-royale-mode-says-it-could-have-been-a-game-changer">calling the cancelled project a potential "game changer"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Legend of Heroes series has quickly become a household name in JRPG since the release of the Trails in the Sky games, which offered not only extremely engaging stories but a level of worldbuilding that is hardly found in Japanese role-playing games. Despite some tweaks and changes to the formula originally introduced in the game starring Estelle and Joshua, the Trails series formula has seen its first major shakeup with Trails Through Daybreak, especially in regard to combat, introducing a field combat option that expanded the experience considerably and truly set the game apart from all its predecessors. Building upon the new features introduced in its predecessor, The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II may not seem to be as innovative, but this isn't going to make it a worse game. If anything, the refinement of features and mechanics, such as field combat, will possibly make the experience even more engaging.</p>
<p>During a press event hosted last week by NISA, I was able to check out the Western version of the latest entry in the Trails series ahead of its launch this coming February. Set three months after the events of Trails Through Daybreak, Van Arkride is informed by his old friend Elaine Auclair about the mysterious Crimson Grendel terrorizing Edith, who seems to be related to him in some way. At the same time, Swin and Nadia are in the capital of Calvard to find a certain someone, an apparently unrelated issue that will eventually link up with the other during the course of the game.</p>
<p>Bringing back the full team from the Arkride Solutions Office, Trails Through Daybreak II also sees the introduction of new characters and the return of others from previous entries in the series, including some fan favorites that haven't appeared in the series for a while. To give all of these characters their time to shine, the game takes a page from the Trails through Reverie's book, offering different viewpoint characters between chapters, which will also allow for an interesting combination of characters. Storytelling is further evolved by the introduction of a time factor which will see players travel back in time to explore different outcomes of different events. This, however, is only a storytelling twist and has no real impact on gameplay, so the narrative and gameplay flow of Trails Through Daybreak II won't be all that different from what we have seen in the past entries in the series.</p>

<p>Combat, on the other hand, has been enhanced significantly in Trails Through Daybreak II. In the previous game, field combat was a little on the simple side, but in the new entry in the series, characters are able to cast magic, do a Cross Charge attack with the proper timing and more. Generally, field combat feels snappier, more varied, and definitely more fun, further bridging the gap with Falcom's other mainstay series, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">Ys series</a>. Command battle plays mostly the same as in the previous game, with player and enemy taking turns unleashing a variety of special attacks, but there have been improvements here as well, with an improved interface and better customization options with way more Drivers with different Arts layouts and New Holo Cores. Additionally, it will be possible to unleash flashy Dual Arts special attacks involving multiple characters that are as powerful as they look spectacular.</p>
<p>With the return of the Gourmet and LGC Alignment systems from the previous game thrown into the mix, Trails Through Daybreak II promises to feel like a familiar experience right from the beginning for those who completed the previous game. With returning characters from the Trails series as a whole, the upcoming game will also be better connected to the narrative at large, so it is definitely setting out to be a game that no fan of the Trials series who has played through most of them, if not all, should skip. Being the second entry of a new chapter in the bigger story, however, Trails Through Daybreak II won't be a good way to start exploring the Falcom franchise, as, while the game attempts to bring players up to speed regarding past events with an in-game glossary and a recap, it can never make up for the story and characters introduced in the past 11 games.</p>

<p>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II launches on February 14th on PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-slug-tactics-review-turn-based-tedium.1027860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/metal-slug-tactics-review-turn-based-tedium<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like some sort of elusive cryptid, we've been given bits and pieces of gameplay and screenshots of <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> throughout the years. With fans chomping at the bit to see more, it was a surprise to see this highly-anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/turn-based-tactics">turn-based tactics</a> game launching in 2024. Finally, <em>Metal Slug </em>and strategy fans alike can get their hands on this title.</p>

<p>I went into <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> very excited -- after all, its superb pixel art style and retro-inspired soundtrack really speaks to the care <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/leikir-studio">Leikir Studio</a> put into crafting this game. And indeed, while it looks and sounds great, I'm a bit more lukewarm on the gameplay. There's a solid tactics game mechanics-wise, but well... the rest of it feels like a slog.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-gameplay.jpg?itok=xlemNZ1P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-gameplay.jpg?itok=mMmvlSf0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This minigun guy has got to go.</figcaption></figure><h2>Going the Distance in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em></h2>

<p>As a veteran of turn-based tactics titles, I tend to play on the defensive with my units. Let enemies come to me, and I'll pick them off as they clash against my hardy frontline and have the backline of ranged units pick them off. I'll tell you right now, slow and steady is <em>not</em> going to fly in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, and the gameplay is designed to rewire the way you think of this genre.</p>

<p>In this regard, <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> stands out among other turn-based tactics titles, as it incentivizes speed. Leikir Studio makes a valiant effort in attempting to replicate the running and gunning that's so iconic to the series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-city.jpg?itok=XjptimU5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-city.jpg?itok=TjPH-JPZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Settin' up a sync with my boy Tarma.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's the rundown: players gain dodge the more they move, and gain even more damage mitigation if they position units behind cover. Ordering units to stay still will very likely end with their doom, since they're out in the open with no protection whatsoever. I'm constantly on the move in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, since your units only have 10 HP.</p>

<p>This is a fresh concept and introduces challenges in a natural way. Constantly being on the move means you'll come across more enemies within range, so positioning is vital. So yes, maximizing your dodge and cover is essential, but so is the proximity of your own units to each other.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactucs-vehicle.jpg?itok=PY9SxUdv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactucs-vehicle.jpg?itok=cLGUwytM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can drive a Metal Slug!</figcaption></figure><p>There are sync attacks that allow your units to attack units in unison, allowing you to deal more damage. This is something that <em>needs</em> to be used throughout or, even on the lowest difficulty, you'll run into trouble. So when we combine the damage mitigation mechanics (dodge and cover) with sync attacks, combat flows pretty well and is very fast-paced.</p>

<p>The more you move, the more adrenaline you get, as well. That's your primary resource to activate abilities unique to your character. Fio, for example, excels at buffing allies with shields, or she can even move enemy or friendly units around the battlefield to gain an advantage. Ally units definitely have their niche, so there's a range of support, DPS, and tank-like archetypes.</p>

<p>Units also stand out with a set of different loadouts, featuring different primary and secondary weapons, as well as abilities. So as you progress and unlock more and more with currency gained from missions, you can tune your team to a decent degree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-ui.jpg?itok=kPmz93m2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-ui.jpg?itok=hRJIqpDh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This UI realllly isn't helping.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> Gets Lost in the Sauce</h2>

<p>I tried my best to explain the mechanics in a concise way, but <em>Metal Slug Tactics </em>is actually quite overwhelming, even for someone like me who is used to the genre. The intro frontloads all the mechanics in a short, five-minute or so tutorial. It's far too much information in such a short time, so the first few hours can feel like a struggle.</p>

<p>There are dozens of too-similar terms like "special action", "bonus action", "bonus move" and... <em>so</em> much more. The developers added a way to read more about highlighted terms, but these tutorials branch out into even more tutorials. It's truly a case of information overload.</p>

<p>It doesn't help that the user interface is exceedingly messy and disorganized. <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> doesn't really help you learn to navigate through various menus to upgrade and unlock new gear, and it's displayed in a generally unpleasant and disjointed way -- this is both during and outside of combat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-stages.jpg?itok=41bEtT8p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-stages.jpg?itok=_AdxHwvv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Conquer up to three different zones, then make it to the final boss in the final area.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>: Part Strategy, Part Roguelite</h2>

<p>Let's address the elephant in the room: <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> is a roguelite. At least, it incorporates roguelite elements into its gameplay, but it feels needlessly tacked on. This leads to a repetitive, RNG-fueled gameplay loop. I can't help but think that a linear campaign would have been a <em>much</em> better choice.</p>

<p>Here's how the roguelite elements come into play: <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>' overworld is split into four separate regions, and you must complete at minimum one of three to move onto the final area. Within these regions are missions that grant a random pair of awards by completing a random set of objectives, up until the boss level spawns.</p>

<p>Levels are hand-crafted and not generated, so there's some decent level design that'll challenge players. Levels are generally compact in size, but those are usually exclusively for missions that task you with wiping out all enemies or eliminating certain targets. Those are the best missions, by the way.</p>

Escort missions suck, and that's no different in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>. Rumi's AI is not great and enemies will kill her in no time, meaning you fail your entire run instantly.</p>

<p>There isn't a great deal of variety in objectives and maps are used over and over again, so you'll come across the same scenarios each and every run you make in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>. This creates a very repetitive gameplay loop that grows stale quite fast.</p>

<p>Adding even more repetition are bosses. There are only four bosses in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, and no matter what difficulty you play on, they're basically the same fight. I'd get this impending feeling of dread knowing I would have to fight them at the end of the zone since these are easily the least enjoyable enemies to fight.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-stages-1.jpg?itok=01bcsI64 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-stages-1.jpg?itok=NP2p91iX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Choose your path wisely, as your rewards depend on it.</figcaption></figure><p>Throughout your run, you're able to gain mods to your weapons and level up your characters for new abilities, which makes things only a tad more engaging. There is an overabundance of passive abilities that all seem to be the same exact thing, perhaps because of how confusing the jargon is. As a result, abilities feel the same, and mods only slightly change the behavior of your weapons.</p>

<p>You're given a currency that can be used after each run to unlock more character abilities, weapon loadouts, and more, and that's <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>' way of adding metaprogression. There's nothing super exciting about unlocking these since, again, most abilities and even weapons feel similar to one another. Unlocking new characters is fun, sure, but there is a limited roster.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-story.jpg?itok=Mcvec5_z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-story.jpg?itok=tKm6DxM0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There <em>is</em> a story in <em>Metal Slug Tactics, </em>but it is very much an afterthought.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I also came across a surprising number of bugs during my time with <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>. The most annoying was one that made me unable to use buttons on my controller for certain actions. Calling in a Metal Slug you can hop in and drive around is cool and all, but it sucks when doing so means I can't use my Xbox controller to fire or select abilities for the rest of the battle.</p>

<p>At one point during dialogue, I had to completely exit my game because, for whatever reason, it wouldn't let me progress. A funny glitch that was pretty consistent throughout my entire time playing was that reviving characters brings them back without their arms. It doesn't affect the gameplay, it just looks goofy.</p>

<p>While I'm critical of <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, it's still a fun game. Once you understand the obtuse mechanics and make your way into higher difficulties, there's some real strategy and planning required to succeed. Unfortunately, it doesn't change things up enough to stay consistently enjoyable, and the roguelite elements and the same four bosses are the chief offenders of this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-nintendo-financials<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial figures for the second quarter of the fiscal year, and they give us some interesting insights into how the company's games and hardware are doing as Switch 2 speculation ramps up.</p>

<p>According to Nintendo's financial report, net sales are down 34.3% this quarter compared to the same period last year, while operating profit is down a whopping 56.6%. In general, Nintendo's numbers aren't looking too great this quarter, but there's arguably a good reason for that.</p>

<p>Last year, Nintendo was riding high on the release of a new tentpole&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game in&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which was a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-shipped-13246-million-units-tears-of-kingdom-sold-almost-20-million">phenomenal sales success</a> for the company. We're also getting closer to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">news of the Switch 2</a>, and so many gamers are probably being cautious with regards to buying new hardware.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-financials-combat.jpg?itok=8IwiAy2g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-financials-combat.jpg?itok=dU4Sp25p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>&nbsp;has done pretty well for Nintendo.</figcaption></figure><p>It could be argued that a new&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game was also released within the operating period for this report, which ends on September 30th, but&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>isn't on the same budget and marketing scale as&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom&nbsp;</em>was.</p>

<p>Even still,&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>did pretty well for Nintendo, it seems. The financial report confirms that the game had sold 2.58 million units by the end of the operating period, which means it achieved that milestone within just four days.</p>

<p>Elsewhere,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>sold 2.31 million units within the operating period, the&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&nbsp;</em>remake sold 1.94 million, and the&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2&nbsp;</em>remaster sold 1.57 million.</p>

<p>Hardware sales dropped 31% year-on-year, although sales of the base Switch and its Lite model were actually slightly up. In general, it's probably not a surprise that Nintendo's numbers are down given its position in the market right now, although things are perhaps slightly more gloomy than the company expected.</p>

Nintendo attributes this quarterly increase to a&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-themed Switch Lite bundle, as well as "releases of hardware bundled with software titles".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket mobile title has a few different packs to choose from at different stages of the game. If you’ve just started Pokémon Pocket, or you’re deeper in and seeking wisdom on which to rip open, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<p>I find opening packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket as addictive as doing it in real life. The hope of pulling an Ultra Rare or Full Illustration card is too tempting, even though I know it’s going to be another duplicate Psyduck or Slowpoke. Still, the feeling is there, and if you don’t want to splash out your hard-earned money on physical packs, Pokémon TCG Pocket is the perfect fix for this itch.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s early days feature three distinct packs (and starter packs) and it’s understandable if you want advice on opening the best packs.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-starter-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Starter Pack in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So many amazing cards to pull. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>I recommend opening the Charizard Pack</strong> when you first start Pokémon TCG Pocket as the Exeguttor EX in it is an extremely strong card and can be a consistent menace in online PvP. Additionally, I also think the <strong>Charmander Full Art card is the best-looking card</strong> of the six from a purely aesthetic standpoint—but each to their own.</p>



<p>The Charizard, Mewtwo, and Pikachu packs you’re offered aren’t for decoration—each one comes with a special set of two cards guaranteed to drop.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at each pack and what they offer you.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pack Type</th><th data-align="center">Pack Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Charizard Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Exeguttor EX</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Charizard Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Charmander Full Art</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mewtwo Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Marowak EX</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mewtwo Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Bulbasaur Full Art</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Arcanine EX</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Squirtle Full Art</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-pack-to-open-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Pack to Open in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p><strong>The Mewtwo Packs</strong> are the best to open in Pokémon TCG Pocket as they are the gateway to some of the most powerful cards in Pokémon Pocket—including Mewtwo itself. </p>



<p>In Pokémon TCG Pocket’s early weeks, <strong>Mewtwo EX</strong> is considered one of the strongest—if not the strongest—cards in the whole game. The Mewtwo pack also has other dominant cards including <strong>Venusaur EX</strong> and <strong>Dragonite</strong>. You only need to take a cursory glance at the bubble that pops up over each of the packs to see certain cards are exclusive to those packs.</p>



<p>Charizard packs also feature quite a few special EX cards: <strong>Charizard</strong>, <strong>Moltres</strong>, and <strong>Starmie</strong>. Outside of these, don’t sleep on Vileplume’s Soothing Scent attack which does high damage and puts opponents to sleep, or Alakazam’s Psychic move. On the other hand, the Pikachu pack-specific cards are decent, but won’t get you meta-decks like Charizard and Mewtwo do.</p>



<p>I highly recommend switching up the packs you open as it’s essential to get every card in the set without having to spend Card Points and buying them individually. Not only this, but when the meta does change, you have more cards to choose from, and you can also build diverse decks needed for unique challenges in Pokémon Pocket.</p>

In fact, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe sold almost as many copies as the brand new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> so far this financial year, and more than either <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door">Pario Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/luigis-mansion-2-hd">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/05/screenshot-2024-11-05-110303-1730808759816.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to sell incredibly well. Image credit: Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is comfortably the best-selling Nintendo Switch game, ahead of Animal Crossing: New Horizons (46.45 million) in second place. And its enduring popularity is easy to understand; not only is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe superb in its own right, but it’s an almost essential buy for any new Switch owner looking for a fun game to play with family and friends pretty much out of the box. Speaking of which, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe looks set to continue to sell well with Nintendo pushing the Switch ahead of the crucial holiday sales period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, will Nintendo release a sequel, presumably Mario Kart 9, for the upcoming Switch 2, or continue Mario Kart 8 Deluxe’s dominance via backwards compatibility and a beefy next-gen update?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has so far kept its cards close to its chest when it comes to Switch 2 information. All it’s said on the record is that an announcement will be made at some point during this financial year, which ends March 2025. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analysts-say-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-now-unlikely-before-end-of-2024">Analysts are now saying it's unlikely Nintendo will announce Switch 2 this year</a>.

"However, with his death at the end of Assassin's Creed 3, we faced a creative crossroads. Ending Desmond's arc was a difficult decision, and afterward, the modern storyline struggled to find its footing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed 3 arrived in 2012, however, so Coté had admitted the franchise has struggled to find a strong modern day story in more than a decade. This has certainly been a point of frustration for fans over the years, some of whom have complained the modern day storyline has no real direction and only detracts from the main game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mainline Assassin's Creed Games in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed Shadows looks to return some direction to the franchise though. "As we move forward, our goal is to put history back at the centre of the players' experience," Coté said. "The modern day narrative will serve to enhance, rather than overshadow, the historical journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"By drawing meaningful contrast between past and present, we aim to restore the balance that was once the hallmark of the franchise. The modern day storyline will explore deeper themes of memory, identity and autonomy, how the past shapes who we are, and how controlling this past can impact our future. These themes will allow us to reflect on contemporary issues: freedom versus control, the power of knowledge and the tension between individuality and conformity, all through the lens of history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will lay the foundation for this narrative evolution that will grow in the years to come."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will likely be welcome news for fans and is perhaps the first bit of positivity to emerge around Shadows in a while. Issues began as some fans expressed frustration with inaccuracies in the game's depiction of Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">leading the development team to issue an apology</a> and say the game is not intended to be a factual representation of history but instead "a compelling, historical fiction." This despite art director Thierry Dansereau telling IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Ubisoft looked to make Shadows as "authentic as possible to match historical events"</a> just two months prior.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Concern was also raised when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission. Ubisoft apologized for doing so but refused to remove the artwork from the aforementioned and presumably already printed artbook available in the Collector's Edition. The historical re-enactment group said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says">this was not good enough</a>, but Ubisoft hasn't publicly acknowledged it since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes as fans are already frustrated by the delay to the game, which puts Assassin's Creed Shadows in more direct competition with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">PlayStation's Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei</a>. This is also expected in 2025 and is another open-world action adventure game set in Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained confidence</a>, however. "There's a lot of space for very high-quality games, and those two games can sell very well," he said in the company's latest earnings call. "The focus is to really make sure that we deliver a fantastic experience with this dual protagonist approach and two different and complimentary gameplays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassins Creed Shadows indeed features two protagonists, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-brings-back-double-assassinations">stealthy assassin Naoe</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained">savage samurai Yasuke</a>.

The Lapras event introduces Chance Rewards, essentially giving players more incentive to repeat battles again and again, as these can drop after each win against a Lapras deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players then have just a one-in-five chance of pulling the Lapras ex in the booster pack, though those looking to collect 'em all will be eager to pick up all five cards anyway. Grinding through the Lapras decks will be necessary to do so, but the Auto Battle feature is still available to speed things up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lapras ex itself is a Basic Pokémon with 140 hit points and an 80 damage attack at the cost of three energy: two water and one colorless.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/metal-slug-tactics-is-an-odd-mix-of-arcade-shooter-and-grid-strategy-that-works/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p><em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> pushes hard on the boundaries of the vaunted run-and-gun arcade series. You can run when it's your character's turn, but it's a certain number of tiles. You can gun, but not rapidly, and only after considering the most optimal target and tools.</p>
<p>Is this just <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/into-the-breach-game-review-a-must-play-fusion-of-tactics-chaos-and-triumph/"><em>Into the Breach</em></a> with classic-era SNK artwork and aesthetics? Kind of, and you're welcome.</p>


<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/01/6557/">a true fan once wrote</a>,&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug</em> games are about "crazy vehicles, amusing enemies and levels, and some of the best sprite art you'll ever see in gaming." To my eyes, you're getting a whole bunch of that in&nbsp;<em>Tactics</em>. Turn-based, grid-mapped tactics have a natural tendency to feel slow and to strip characters down to chess pieces that can do two or three things. Here, the characters and villains cannot stop rocking their bodies, the guns and explosions and scimitars go off big, and the exaggerated-just-enough artwork keeps everything locked into an action-movie mood.</p>

      Gameplay preview for <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, featuring the Ikari Warriors.

          </p>

<p>You typically have three characters in your squad, each with a couple weapons (including, of course, a pistol with unlimited ammo). You're facing a whole isometric level of baddies, and you can see their attack range. Your missions are typically to kill 'em all, kill a number of them, kill a certain few of them, kill the leader, or, for a treat, rescue somebody. You're fighting in vague but stylized locales around the world to stop an evil general from blowing up the world with his secret army.</p>
<p>Your squad wants to&nbsp;<em>move</em>, because the farther they dash each turn, the more "Adrenaline" they build up to power their special abilities and the more damage they can dodge. If they end up next to cover, even better. At the same time, you want to place your fighter and pick a target that one of your other fighters can target, too, scoring a "Sync" where you can both fire at once. This game despises turtling and will actually pop up a "tip" from your comms manager telling you that moving more makes you tougher.</p>

The studio said this N7 Day specifically will be "quieter" due to the launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard less than a week ago. That being said, BioWare teased that it has "a little fun" to share for N7 Day.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/bioware/status/1853552873138720920?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We hope everyone is enjoying their time in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragonAge?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DragonAge</a>: The Veilguard. It’s only a few days until <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/N7Day?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#N7Day</a> and this year will be quieter because of launch. Be sure to check back then for a little fun, though!</p>  — BioWare (@bioware) <a href="https://twitter.com/bioware/status/1853552873138720920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In 2023, BioWare marked N7 Day by releasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-is-teasing-the-next-mass-effect-with-cryptic-videos-for-n7-day/1100-6518975/" data-ref-id="1100-6518975">series of cryptic teasers for the next Mass Effect game</a>, but they didn't amount to much. In 2022, BioWare released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-with-mysterious-concept-art/1100-6508956/" data-ref-id="1100-6508956">cryptic piece of concept art</a>. A year before that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-mass-effect-game-gets-teaser-art-on-n7-day/1100-6497781/" data-ref-id="1100-6497781">another mysterious art piece suggested the Geth will return.</a></p><p>BioWare is not making any expansions for The Veilguard and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">turning its attention to the next Mass Effect.</a> Not much is known about the game, but it's been confirmed that the game's executive producer, art director, creative director, and game director are all veterans of the original Mass Effect trilogy.</p><p>The next Mass Effect game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-mass-effect-officially-in-development-with-veteran-team/1100-6484192/" data-ref-id="1100-6484192">announced in 2020</a>, so it's been in development for years.</p><p>The Mass Effect series debuted in 2007 and saw two main sequels, Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. Mass Effect: Andromeda followed in 2017. It wasn't as well-received as the earlier games, with criticism directed at its story, character animations, and quest design.</p><p>After Andromeda, BioWare's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anthem/" data-ref-id="5000-465528">Anthem</a>, didn't resonate with fans either. The Mass Effect series highlight is generally considered to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect-2/" data-ref-id="5000-34111">Mass Effect 2</a>, which received a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mass-effect-2-review/1900-6246931/" data-ref-id="1900-6246931">GameSpot's review</a>.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It feels like only yesterday we were in the thick of the fall release calendar being bombarded every other day by a new blockbuster or sleeper indie hit. November is slowing things down a bit, but it’s not quite backlog month just yet. A new <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em>, <em>Flight Simulator</em>, and Lego game headline a month of stuff hitting just before the holiday rush. </p><p>We were originally getting <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> in November, one last big RPG for fans to sink into before the end-of-year slump. Instead, Ubisoft pushed that to the February gauntlet, giving <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em>, and people who somehow still haven’t finished <em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em> (that’s me!) a much needed reprieve. </p><p>Instead, this month is shifting gears firmly into family game mode. In addition to a light <em>Mario Bros. </em>adventure and Microsoft’s “sorry, dad’s in the middle of a transatlantic flight out in the garage” simulator, we’re also getting a <em>Lego Horizon</em> <em>Zero Dawn </em>adaptation and<em> TMNT </em>brawler just in time to occupy all those cousins after the Thanksgiving buffet. Here are 19 games we’re paying attention to this November. </p></div></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Creature collector RPG</p><p>  <em>Farmagia</em> is a monster farming action RPG revealed back during the June Nintendo showcase. It’s from the company behind <em>Story of Seasons</em>, <em>Rune Factory</em>, and other RPG sims, though this one looks more anime-flavored with <em>Pikmin</em>-sized armies helping you defeat bosses. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Mystery deduction </p><p>An online social deduction game that channels <em>Death Note</em>? Time will tell if <em>Death Note: Killer Within</em> can translate <em>Among Us</em>-like murder mystery into the mood and language of the hit anime. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, PC</p><p>  <strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based tactics </p><p><em>Metal Slug</em> is back and trading its iconic side-scrolling run-and-gun action for <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> gameplay in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>. The slick pixel art is a nice sweetener on-top of a solid genre mashup. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Construction sim<br></p><p>Managed roller coaster chaos is back with <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>. The sequel is adding new systems, including an entire water park section. The developers promise more robust tools will let you craft more complex theme parks than ever before. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p><p><strong>Genre: </strong>Action roguelike</p><p>For a time there were no <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>. Now there’s a new one every year. <em>Splintered Fate</em> technically came out last year, but the Apple Arcade exclusive is just now arriving on every other platform in case you’ve already exhausted <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em> and are hungry for more Foot Clan butt kicking. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Strategy role-playing game</p><p>Tactical RPG <em>Phantom Brave</em> began life as a PS2 game in 2004. It’s first remake was for Wii in 2009. Even more content was added in the PSP version a year later. Now it’s getting an HD remaster ahead of the full-blown sequel, <em>The Lost Hero</em>, due out next year. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Animal sim</p><p>2014 is officially retro now. That year’s comedic open-world chaos simulator is now getting updated 10 year later. <em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em> includes updated graphics, all previous DLC, and other updates including quality-of-life improvements. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Switch</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Role-playing game</p><p>Long resigned to Nintendo’s secondary handhelds, <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> brings the RPG-lite formula to the company’s home console hybrid. The Switch may be almost eight years old at this point, but the<em> Brothership</em> glow-up is still the best this spiritual spin-off to <em>Paper Mario</em> has looked yet, even if early reviews <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch-review-roundup-1851688609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch-review-roundup-1851688609">are more divided</a></span> on the depth and fun of the underlying gameplay. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Horror action-adventure </p><p><em>Silent Hill </em>creator Keiichiro Toyama has returned with a mashup of his lesser-known survival horror classic,<em> Siren</em>, and the breezy, colorful action game <em>Gravity Rush</em>. It sounds bold, if maybe a little under-polished for his new studio’s debut project. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, PC, mobile</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Word clue adventure </p><p><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em> takes the acclaimed first game’s devilishly clever investigative adventure game formula to the 1970s for an exploration of the criminal underworld and human depravity. I can’t wait. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based strategy </p><p>Already out on PC, Songs of Conquest is getting a surprise console port this month. Channeling <em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em>, you explore an overworld like a strategy sim while unleashing your armies in turn-based combat across tile-based battlefields. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Puzzle</p><p><em>Tetris Forever</em> is the latest in Digital Eclipse’s high-quality anthology of interactive documentaries. It includes the original game and several iterations of it across platforms and creators, as well as the brand-new four-player <em>Tetris Time Warp </em>that lets you compete across the game’s history in real-time. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS4, Xbox One, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Sci-fi open world crafting sim</p><p><em>Astroneer: Glitchwalkers</em> is a paid expansion, but it’s a big one. The eight-year-old planetary colony sim is getting a new map to explore, more story, and plenty of additional things to craft. Players will use new gear and tech trees to protect themselves against the titular glitched storms that threaten to hack them. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Bullet hell action-RPG roguelike </p><p><em>Temtem</em> is a Pokémon style MMO, and <em>Temtem: Swarm</em> takes the creatures from that multiplayer RPG and turns them into fodder for a <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style bullet hell adventure. I’m not sure how many more <em>Survivors</em>-likes we can have at this point, but <em>Swarm </em>sure looks pretty. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p><p><strong>Genre: </strong>Role-playing game</p><p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> looks like the overhaul every Square Enix fan wishes their favorite old-school RPG could get. The old systems and designs remain, down to the pixel art sprites, but the rest of the world has a HD2D update that looks gorgeous. We’ll see if the rest of the decades-old game holds up. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Co-op brawler </p><p><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> is the first Lego gaming adaptation of another video game. It’s more of a kids’ abridged version of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn </em>than a one-to-one, brick-by-brick remake of sci-fi dino hunting game. It does sport couch co-op and that familiar Lego charm. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Sim</p><p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> returns with a sequel four years after the current-gen reboot. It includes a ton of new missions, vehicles, and terrain details. The company has promised that almost all of the previous game’s add-ons will work with and carry over to <em>Flight Sim 2024</em>. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Survival horror shooter</p><p>It’s hard to believe <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> is actually coming out. The first Stalker game in 15 years, announced back in 2018 and developed through an invasion of GSC Game World’s home country of Ukraine, the survival shooter takes players back to the open-world Exclusion Zone for more harrowing ammo scavenging and surreal mysteries. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Metroidvania soulslike</p><p>  Red Candle Games’ horror adventure game <em>Devotion </em>was a 2019 GOTY contender. The studio decided to follow it up with a cute platformer that combines metroidvania exploration with punishing soulslike combat. <em>Nine Sols</em> came to PC in May and is tough as nails. This month, players can finally take on that challenge on console.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-asg-89-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-and-equipment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has some great close-range options for smaller maps like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-24-7-playlist-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown</a> and Stakeout, but none are quite as powerful as Shotguns. The ASG-89 is the fastest-firing Shotgun in the game, but you’ll need the best attachments for it to experience its true power.</p>



<p>With that said, here’s the best loadout for the ASG-89 in Black Ops 6.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-asg-89-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-asg-89">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-asg-89">Best Secondary for ASG-89</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock ASG-89</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-asg-89-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the ASG-89 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-asg-89-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best ASG-89 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Fast Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: CQB Grip</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Balanced Stock</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Kicking off our best ASG-89 loadout in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> is the <strong>Long Barrel</strong>, which improves the Shotgun’s damage range, which is pretty poor otherwise. Then, the <strong>Fast Mag I</strong> provides a quicker reload at the expense of some bullets, while the <strong>CQB Grip</strong> gives you some dive, slide, and sprint to fire speed to get your shots off faster while being mobile.</p>



<p>The <strong>Balanced Stock</strong> further boosts mobility, improving strafing, hipfire, movement, and aim walking movement speeds. Lastly, to ensure you’re finishing enemies as quickly as possible, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> attachment is essential for increasing the Shotgun’s fire rate.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-asg-89">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for ASG-89</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>We’re focussing on mobility with the ASG-89 so that you can get up close and personal effortlessly and put enemies to bed. <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> improves movement speed while reloading and using Equipment, while <strong>Assassin</strong> lets you track enemies on a KIllstreak for more intel on the opposition’s position. </p>



<p><strong>Double Time </strong>boosts Tac-Sprint so you can reach top speed for longer, and thanks to the <strong>Perk Greed</strong> Wild Card, we’ve gone with <strong>Dexterity</strong> for our fourth Perk, which reduces weapon motion when jumping, sliding, and diving, as well as decreasing fall damage.</p>



<p>As for Equipment, we like a <strong>Semtex</strong> for the quick throw and detention time, while the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> keeps you topped up on health to stay in the fight. Finally, the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> is a top choice for a Shotgun loadout, as you’ll want to protect your flank while behind enemy lines.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-asg-89">Best Secondary for ASG-89</h2>



<p>The <strong>Grekhova</strong> is the best Secondary for the ASG-89 in Black Ops 6, as it’s fully automatic, so when you need to hit the target and finish a kill off, the fast fire rate gives you plenty of leeway to do so.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock ASG-89 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>To unlock the ASG-89 you’ll need to hit <strong>Level 31</strong> in Black Ops 6. This can be done in Multiplayer or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-guided-zombies-come-out-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a>, and using our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best tips to level up fast</a>, you should make it there fairly quickly.</p>



<p>Be sure to take advantage of Double XP weekends and playlists like Nuketown 24/7, as those will help net you a load of XP.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-asg-89-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the ASG-89 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The ASG-89 is <strong>very good for small maps</strong>, but it isn’t so great outside of close quarters. So, we recommend either running it as a secondary with an Overkill class or only using it when you play a small map like the ones found on Face Off Moshpit.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the ASG-89 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>As the only other Shotgun in Black Ops 6, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-marine-sp-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marine SP</a> is a great alternative to use while you wait to unlock the ASG-89. Another great close-range weapon is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-kompakt-92-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kompakt 92</a>, an extremely fast-firing SMG that can shred enemies with a rapid TTK.</p>

Now, just under a month since its release, someone has put a playable version of Doom on Alarmo, along with video proof of the accomplishment.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IOVYvSMAoU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5IOVYvSMAoU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The hacker in question is GaryOderNichts, who previously worked out a way to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-alarmo-has-already-been-hacked-to-include-cat-pictures/1100-6527509/" data-ref-id="1100-6527509">put cat pictures on Alarmo</a>. GaryOderNichts also laid out <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how to remove the firmware file from Alarmo</a>, which allows users to get it to accept customized code via a USB. For the new hack, he credited X user <a href="https://twitter.com/_spinda" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spinda</a> for "figuring out the Alarmo SWD pads," before adding that Spinda was also "the first to dump the eMMC contents."</p><p>Although Doom is now playable through the latest hack, there are drawbacks. Alarmo's clock buttons aren't designed to be an easily used game controller, nor is there any sound support from the current Doom hack. Regardless, it's now been proven that the Alarmo can be made to play games, and that could open the floodgates for similar hacks unless Nintendo finds a way to prevent this from happening.</p><p>Alarmo is currently available through Nintendo stores and for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. A wide release of Alarmo won't arrive until some time in 2025.</p>

                <p>Just over a month ago, Konami and developer Bloober Team released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/" data-ref-id="1900-6418296">Silent Hill 2</a>, a remake of the classic survival-horror title that debuted in 2001. One of the new touches included by Bloober Team was a series of enigmatic photographs that can be found throughout the remake. Now, a player has come forward with the solution to the photo puzzle, and it's a callback to the history of the game itself.</p><p>Dale Robinson unveiled his findings on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gine5k/comment/lvcy9t2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, and he appears to be the first player to figure it out. There are 26 of these photos that can be found within the game, and they all include a short phrase. For example, the first photograph is captioned "So many people here." Robinson examined the photos and realized that the visual clue for the code was the amount of certain objects in each image.</p><p>After identifying and counting those objects, Robinson noted the corresponding letter in each message. When the letters are placed in chronological order, the message to players reads "You've been here for two decades."</p><p>"I thought I was gonna get something cool, but instead the game reminded me that I am an old man now," wrote Robinson on <a href="https://twitter.com/dale_robinson/status/1853167390013493723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1853167390013493723%7Ctwgr%5E9d40cf2f10ad4654695e723f873ce7ce54d81fd3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Ffan-cracks-mysterious-silent-hill-2-remake-photo-puzzle-revealing-secret-message-hidden-by-bloober-team" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>. His solution was subsequently confirmed by Bloober Team creative director Mateusz Lenart.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1853189523745730675" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🤭 I knew it wouldn’t stay hidden for long! (There was a theory in our company that the puzzle might be too hard 😜) I really wanted to make it subtle when I was painting those photos... <br>I think the timing couldn’t be better for you to solve it.<br> Congratulations!… <a href="https://t.co/EiIyg35Caj" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/EiIyg35Caj</a></p>  — Mateusz Lenart (@Mateusz_Lenart_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1853189523745730675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Silent Hill 2 is out now for PS5 and PC.</p>
