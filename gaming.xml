            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/interview-how-delta-force-is-looking-to-blow-up-mobile-shooter-market<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta Force made its return with a launch on PC last year, reigniting interest in the legendary tactical shooter franchise. Now, it is bringing its definitive free-to-play, modern, team-based tactical action to a whole new audience on mobile. Anticipation for the mobile release has been huge, with over 20 million players pre-registering across Android and iOS platforms ahead of launch on April 21st. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke to Leo Yao, Head of Studio and Shadow Guo, Game Director at Team Jade about the development of Delta Force Mobile, the game’s content , graphics and optimization along with technical ambitions, and its play-to-win, not pay-to-win, philosophy.   </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Capturing epic battles on the small screen</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta Force features realistic battlegrounds, class-based Operators, a deep weapons arsenal and multiple game modes; all designed to blend nostalgia from the original series with modern gameplay elements. Game modes cater to both solo-player and team-up experiences, including the world’s first 24v24 battlefield with vehicles and an extraction-based PvPvE mode. Parity of experience was a central part of the design ethos for this title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our goal was to build a truly uncompromised AAA shooter experience for mobile players which feels just as thrilling and immersive as its PC counterpart,” said Guo. “We wanted to provide players with the opportunity to experience an array of modes and maps which they haven't ever experienced before, promising tons of action and fun. That’s why we’re especially proud of introducing groundbreaking features like our world-first 24v24 large-scale battlefield, which pushes the boundaries of what mobile shooters can achieve.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Keep the fight going, wherever you are</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta Force Mobile was designed to both introduce the game to new, mobile-first audiences, while also giving PC players a way to bring the game anywhere. Integral to this is Delta Force’s cross progression with PC which includes support of Google Play Games on PC, allowing players to progress and play across both platforms. Synced content between PC and mobile currently includes 7 maps for Warfare, 4 maps for Operations, 10 Operators, 12 vehicles and 55 weapons sets, with more to come. Player’s individual progression, including their inventory will also be synced.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/new-operator-nox-1744894241204.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><em>Image credit: Team Jade</em></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted to make sure that Delta Force provided players with exciting cross-platform experiences”, said Yao. “Whether players are jumping into a quick match on their phones during a commute or settling in for a longer session with friends on PC, we wanted to ensure the game is both accessible and fun for everyone. That’s why we focused on offering a wide range of engaging content across all platforms for the mobile launch.” </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>“No One Gets Left Behind” </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Delta Force motto rings true in their approach to device optimisation as well. The developers worked hard to make sure that its launch on mobile is optimal for players across the world with system requirements that are accessible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted to make sure players wouldn't have to worry about whether their phones could handle game play, so we have made sure system requirements are as accessible as possible. For example, an iPhone 7, which is around 10 years old, will be sufficient for players to experience everything Delta Force has to offer,” said Yao. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta Force brings its high-resolution visuals to mobile, complete with global illumination systems, so players  feel truly immersed in the world that has been created. Central to its design are lifelike operators, detailed weapon cosmetics, vast and detailed maps, and distinctive in-game effects.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/mobile-spec-requirement-1744894280092.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><em><strong>Image credit: Team Jade</strong></em></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of shooters demand high frames per second (FPS) for a great experience, which is why it was vital for the developers to ensure 120 native FPS through cutting edge technology like Vulkan and Metal when building the mobile version. The team has achieved around 50% higher efficiency than most industry leading mobile shooters, making Delta Force an industry leader in terms of performance. Coupled with low input-latency, the game has been built from the ground up to be one of the smoothest mobile shooters on the market.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Play To Win </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta Force’s progression is based on a play-to-win system which allows new and ongoing players to earn exclusive rewards. On launch, mobile players are eligible for several different rewards by signing in and playing the game. There will be $500 worth of rewards to obtain across PC &amp; mobile, including 148 weapon appearances, 21 vehicle appearances and 270+ other rewards. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/delta-force-freebies-1744894309901.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><em><strong>Image credit: Team Jade</strong></em></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are truly committed to a no-pay-to-win system, with the development of our game driven by our passionate players. We value giving back, and that's why we provide in-game rewards. We want our players to enjoy progressing and getting rewarded for doing so. Delta Force will always be a community first game.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Delta Force Mobile is available on </strong></em><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6451399876" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><em><strong>IOS</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> and </strong></em><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.proxima.dfm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><em><strong>Android</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> now.</strong></em><strong>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Man, It’s great to have Fatal Fury back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The OG SNK fighting game series, and the one that went toe-to-toe with Street Fighter 2 back in the 90s, Fatal Fury has been dormant for more than 25 years. SNK has been quite active in that time with the King of Fighters series and even a Samurai Shodown revival, but those offer two very different styles of fighting game, leaving Street Fighter without its most comparable SNK competition for far too long. And that’s what Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves brings to the table: A more direct alternative to Street Fighter 6 — one that is similar in its gameplay structure, but without neutral skipping system mechanics, Drive Impacts, and throw loops. It’s missing a few modern-day fighting game features that should be standard at this point and its UI is lacking to say the least, but in all of the areas that matter most, City of the Wolves hits like a Buster Wolf to the face.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its 90s predecessors, City of the Wolves is a four-button fighter that gives you a light punch, heavy punch, light kick, and heavy kick. There’s also a close and far version of each of these buttons, with the close versions typically leading to bigger damage and better situations, while the far versions are used more for pokes and whiff punishes. One big thing that separates City of the Wolves from Street Fighter 6 and several other modern fighting games is that there are no universal ways to easily get in on an opponent. There are no shared high speed dash-ups that let you keep your turn even if they’re blocked, no universal vanishing teleports, and no projectile-invulnerable quick steps. Characters still have plenty of options to approach, but none that are shared among the whole cast, and all of which carry significant risk.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are no shared high speed dash-ups that let you keep your turn even if they're blocked.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While I personally don’t mind a good neutral skip, I still greatly enjoy that larger focus on the mental chess game of each of us trying to get a feel for how the other will try and approach, and reacting accordingly. It also makes the characters that do have the ability to cover ground very quickly and safely feel a lot more unique among the rest of the cast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New to City of the Wolves is the Rev Meter, which works very similarly to how the Drive Meter functions in Street Fighter 6, only you’re actually building this meter up instead of depleting it. You begin every round at 0%, and you’ll increase that percentage by blocking enemy attacks or using special Rev techniques – those include EX special moves, a Rev Guard that adds substantial pushback to your guard and avoids chip damage, and armored attacks called Rev Blows. Once you hit 100%, you’ll overheat and the meter will slowly start to deplete, but until it gets back to zero (which takes a <em>really </em>long time) you can’t use any Rev techniques, and your guard gauge will deplete every time you block an attack. Once that’s gone, your guard will be broken and you’ll be open to a free combo from your foe.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Fighting Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a great system that has me making very important meter management decisions on the fly. Since you can chain EX Special moves into each other in order to squeeze out more damage from a combo, that gauge can rise very high very quickly over the course of just a single combo. That pushed me to ask myself whether it was worth fully cashing out on a big combo and risk either overheating or being close to overheating, or whether I should end the combo early and save some of the gauge for the rest of the round. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rev Blows are the only part of the equation I'm not fully on board with.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rev Blows are the only part of the equation that I’m not fully on board with. These armored attacks may initially bring to mind Drive Impacts from Street Fighter 6, but there are some very important distinctions. Like Drive Impacts, they can be used to power through an enemy flurry to deliver a big attack of your own, but unlike Drive Impacts, they only result in a full combo if they hit as a counter, not just if they absorb an attack. Still, even without countering, they do a sizable chunk of damage, are safe on block, and only cost 17% of your Rev Meter, meaning they can be used pretty liberally without much consequence – that’s especially true if the other player doesn’t know how to deal with them, which would be understandable as City of the Wolves doesn’t tell you that in any of the in-game tutorials.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, these hits are not unbeatable. Like Drive Impacts, the best way to counter them is with a Rev Blow of your own, which will turn the tide and give you a free combo opportunity. Unlike Drive Impacts, though, Rev Blows can only be used during SPG (Selective Potential Gear), which is a special buff that is only active while in your choice of either the start, middle, or end portion of your health bar. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You decide where you want your SPG buff to kick in before each fight, and there are advantages to each position – but if someone starts a match with their SPG at the beginning of their health bar, and I have it set anywhere else, I just straight up don’t have my best defense against this technique until I lose either half or the majority of my life. There are other defenses, like throws, supers, and dodge attacks, but none that really match the ease and reward of the attacker just throwing a Rev Blow out there. At higher levels, you’ll see people canceling their dodge attack with a feint and getting full combos off that, but the timing window for this is very tight, and it feels like there’s no good answer for this move at low-to-mid level play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of that one relatively small issue, however, the actual fighting in City of the Wolves is excellent. There’s a great flexibility in the combo design that lets you go for either reliable and easy damage just by stringing a couple of EX special moves together, with the option to end with a super, or a more execution heavy combo that incorporates techniques like special move braking and feints, both of which require fast fingers and much greater precision. That lets you weigh the potential of an increased reward against a much higher chance of dropping the combo however you want.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a great balance of both offensive and defensive options.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a great balance of both offensive and defensive options as well that make it hard to just fall into a rhythm of doing the same things over and over again. On wake up you can roll forward and backwards, there are a couple of frames of throw invulnerability to prevent throw loops, and well-timed just defenses or hyper defenses are rewarded with an opportunity to guard cancel and punish attacks that aren’t normally heavily punishable. It all just feels really good. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Between a Rock and a Bogard Place</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The City of the Wolves roster is a respectable 17 strong at launch, and it is a mechanically diverse cast that covers most of the original Mark of the Wolves roster along with four newcomers. Two of those newcomers, Preecha and Vox Reaper, are excellent without any caveats. Preecha is an easy to pick-up-and-play Muay Thai scientist with flashy and satisfying combos and a well-rounded skill set; while Vox Reaper is just rushdown personified. He’s one of the few characters on the roster without a projectile, but he more than makes up for it with lightning fast speed, tricky divekicks, and by being one of the few characters with one of those aforementioned plus-on-block neutral skipping dashing attacks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have been spending the most time with Terry and Hokutomaru. Terry because of the familiarity I have with him from other games, and Hokutomaru for the sheer variety of approach options he has. He can double jump, teleport while in the air, and use Akuma-like air projectiles to both threaten from afar and alter his jump arc to bait out anti-airs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there are the guest characters: Real-world soccer pro Cristiano Ronaldo and real-world DJ Salvatore Ganacci. To get the good out of the way first, they are at least cool characters mechanically. Ronaldo’s main gimmick is that all of his normal attacks are soccer techniques that can not only damage the opponent on their own, but also be used to hit a soccer ball that can be summoned with one of his special moves. This can lead to some truly wild set ups that force you to block the ball and then guess or predict where Ronaldo is going to hit you from. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ronaldo and Ganacci are at least cool characters mechanically.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Salvatore on the other hand is largely a gag character, with moves taken directly from his music videos and performances as a DJ, but at least they’re very entertaining to look at. I still find myself chuckling when he looks dead into the camera as he pounds an enemy’s face to the beat, and while many of his moves are slow and awkward, he surprisingly hits extremely hard even without having to spend a ton of meter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But here’s the thing: Very little was done to make these characters feel like they belong in Fatal Fury, especially Ronaldo. Salvatore at least has his own story in the Arcade and Episodes of South Town single-player modes, but Ronaldo is completely absent from both. Not to mention, their visual designs are boring and too ordinary to match the flash and flair of someone like B. Jenet or Kain. It’s hard not to feel like these characters would have been better suited as optional DLC like most guest characters tend to be, which would’ve freed up more spots for characters that actually belong in South Town. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Greetings From South Town</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as the rest of the package goes, the single-player options in City of the Wolves are pretty fun, even if they are pretty basic. The first is the classic Arcade mode that works as you’d expect: Each character has an intro establishing who they are and what their goal is, a rival battle, and an ending. As far as Arcade modes go, it’s actually pretty solid, even if it is very ordinary. I’ve only beaten a handful of them, but each one has had some really nice character building moments and long awaited pay offs for anyone who’s been following Fatal Fury lore for a while. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves B. Jenet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The marquee single-player option is Episodes of South Town, which is an RPG-inspired mode that lets you play through a more substantial version of a character’s story by selecting battles on a map screen. You’ll gain experience with each battle that then lets you level up and become stronger, increasing your stats and giving you access to new skills and abilities as you progress. It’s a solid diversion that adds some very welcome light progression and RPG elements while giving each character’s story a more satisfying beginning, middle, and end than what Arcade mode offers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the battles in this mode have unique conditions too, such as having to fight multiple enemies in a gauntlet, enemies always being in SPG mode, or (in one of the more frustrating conditions) your opponent being immune to every attack with the exception of a 1/66 chance that you’ll land a one-hit kill. Outside of that last one, which is a miserable time, the additional conditions do a pretty good job of adding some variety to each match without overcomplicating them or taking away from what’s fun about the combat in the first place. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One area City of the Wolves could have used some extra attention is in its teaching tools. There is a passable tutorial that covers all of the mechanics, but it doesn’t do a great job of explaining the context or usage of many of its more advanced techniques. Defending against the aforementioned Rev Blow is one example, but it also doesn’t do a great job of explaining the uses of things like Feints or Brakes. In fact, the tutorial section for Brakes basically just tells you how to do them, explains that they can be used in combos, then says that it’s a lesson for another time – but it doesn’t actually have another lesson for it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the online side of things, the most important question to ask when it comes to a modern fighting game is “does it have rollback netcode?” The second most important question is then “is it <em>good </em>rollback netcode.” For City of the Wolves the answer to those two questions are “yes!” and “ehhhh.” For the most part, during my experience with both the betas and a handful of matches on the full game’s pre-launch servers, online felt pretty good. That said, the best netcodes are able to make a bad connection still feel playable, and that definitely wasn’t the case during the worst of what I saw. I had one match with eight frames of delay that felt like I was moving through sludge, and another where my button inputs just occasionally wouldn’t go through.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For the most part, online play felt pretty good. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the usual suite of options are otherwise here and accounted for. There are ranked matches, casual matches, room matches, and a replay theater to watch both your own replays and public ones (though there’s no way to filter or search for replays featuring a specific character). Unfortunately, the UI to navigate through these menus is some of the worst I’ve seen in a fighting game, with the biggest offender being the room match menu that for some reason needs to be controlled with a slow moving mouse cursor and has the look of an excel document or powerpoint presentation. In the grand scheme of things, it’s not a huge deal, and the lobby itself is functional in all of the ways I’d expect – but still, it’s surprising to see in a game that otherwise drips with style once you’re in a match. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>When SNK was bought by the Saudi Arabian Electronic Gaming Development Company back in 2022, they reassured the general public that this would not affect the content of their games at all. It happened during a pretty tumultuous period of foreign investment funds and corporations buying their way into several gaming companies, so people were rightfully pretty concerned about how it would affect the legendary fighting game developer. After playing Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, it feels like that promise from 2022 has been broken, draining away any chance of this game having a cohesive aesthetic or style. Beyond some interesting combat mechanics and a handful of promising new character designs, there isn’t a whole lot to this game that would make it feel like a standout hit, anyway.</p>
<p><iframe title="FATAL FURY: CotW｜RONALDO vs. GANACCI ｜Round 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmLzs2kkz94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The most memorable fighting games are often tied together not just by their tight gameplay or number of characters, but by a cohesive vibe that flows through every level of the game. The striking style of games like Skullgirls or Tekken speak volumes, but there’s very little of that in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. Instead, each piece of the package feels plucked from an entirely different source. Some menus are sleek and stylish, while others are barebones and basic. Characters occupy such a wide spread of tropes and styles that there’s no way to understand what or where or when this game is unless you’re knee-deep in SNK universe lore. Plus, two of these characters are real life dudes – soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo, who currently playing in the Saudi Pro League and with a cloud of controversies that still hang over him, and DJ Salvatore Ganacci, whose links to the country can be seen with him being tied in with another of Saudi Arabia’s big sporting ventures, LIV Golf.</p>


<p>Fighting games have thrived on wild guest characters for ages now, but I can’t understand any of the reasoning behind these two picks. You would generally see a guest character dip into a fanbase or piece of media that is either tied closely to the game they’re cameo-ing in, or appeals to a fanbase that would be likely to pick up a new fighting game just for that character, but I can’t imagine that the fandom of these two men correlates at all to the competitive, nostalgia-driven fanbase of gamers who would care about a new Fatal Fury game. Even the soundtrack for the game is questionably convoluted – every stage song has been created by a variety of English and European DJs, but almost every song falls into an identical snooze-worthy beat that not only fails to match the vibe of their stages, but fails to sound good whatsoever.</p>


<p>There’s so much of this sort of uninspired or cameo-fueled content sprinkled throughout Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves that it’s hard to appreciate the game on its own merits. Which is a shame, because there is some interesting stuff here. Much like the original game that this is a decades-in-the-waiting sequel to, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is a intricate fighter made exclusively for the freaks. The biggest example of that is the new REV system, giving each fighter an additional meter that fills and empties throughout battles depending on how offensive or defensive you behave. Rather than spending the meter to perform stronger actions, you can perform a variety of techniques like Rev Arts, Rev Blow, Rev Accel, and Rev Guard freely. The catch is that they all increase your Rev meter when you perform them and going over 100% into Overheat disables Rev actions entirely and makes you susceptible to guard breaks.</p>
<p>The REV system is arguably the one universally approachable element of combat in this game – it’s easy to wrap your head around managing the meter, and it adds an extra layer of push-and-pull to combat that plays out like a way less convoluted version of the Grind Grid from Under Night-in Birth.</p>

<p>The unfortunate thing about Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, though, is that it relies so much on these advanced techniques and systems that casual players and newcomers will likely struggle to tap into. Even with the Smart controls system that gives you auto-combos and easy one-button presses for a few techniques, there are so many other minute systems like feinting and braking and the numerous defence mechanics that will remain out of reach. The game thrives when it’s played at it’s highest skill ceiling, but when it’s being played at it’s lowest, it doesn’t spark nearly as much joy compared to flashier and more approachable contemporaries like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/23/tekken-8-review/">Tekken 8</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/30/street-fighter-6-review/">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>There are some single-player modes in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves that help add some casually-approachable content to the game. Arcade mode is a pretty simple piece of the pie, but Episodes of South Town is a much meatier single-player campaign experience. Each character gets their own story that plays out through textbox dialogue and a variety of fights you pick from via a map of the city. It’s nothing special in terms of writing, and a lot of the fights are against random non-playable mob characters. Still, it’s enough of a consistent loop that it does give you a more engaging reason to do a bunch of casual battling in the game beyond just endlessly hopping into online play.</p>

		Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves struggles not only to understand what it wants to be, but which audience it wants to be for. While the game can be a sweat-inducing treat at its highest level of play, casual gamers might not get a lot out of it and the bevy of distracting guest characters and stage song composers in the game make it hard to see the title for its own merits.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fatal-fury-city-of-wolves-review-nothing-but-hands-and-feet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was two years old when the last mainline <em>Fatal Fury</em> game came out. So, needless to say, I missed the train on that one altogether. When I heard that <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> was coming out, I was extremely curious because I now had an excuse to dive into the series. Thankfully, the game doesn't disappoint, with a rich cast of fighters, a unique art style, and engaging music. There's something for everyone, no matter your skill level in the genre. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Before getting into what the game does right, I want to highlight some of the game's weaker points. One of the first weak points lies within the campaign mode. Throughout recent years, many games that take place in space have created compelling stories that get you attached to the fighters in one way or another. But sadly, that wasn't the case for Episodes of South Town, which serves as the main story within <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Roughly 90 percent of it consists of you moving a cursor through a map layout and clicking on who you want to fight next. This led to me feeling a lack of excitement for the gameplay and more like I was going through a checklist, hoping to come across something that would regain my interest. In addition to that, most of the cutscenes in it are pure text, and it can become extremely easy to skip all of the dialogue and move on to the next fight, which I've found myself doing most of the time.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unknown-2025_04_18-21_28_56-1-1.jpg?itok=-EQ_1fcG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unknown-2025_04_18-21_28_56-1-1.jpg?itok=AROL6BHx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here is a city of the map</figcaption></figure><p><br>
Since this is the game's story mode, there is somewhat of a progressive system, but often it falls flat. Throughout the story, you'll level up, and fighting other people is the only way to do this. As you level up, your character will unlock more HP, abilities, and more. But it does feel a bit odd because a lot of the features you unlock are basic core mechanics of the game, and the power-ups you do get are nothing less than slight buffs that can help you in the next fight.</p>

<p>Another key issue with <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> was the inclusion of its star guest fighter, Cristiano Ronaldo. In the past, Ronaldo has been the center of sexual assault allegations, and providing a platform for him to have a face in the gaming community incites unjust tolerance for the negative and harmful behavior that is tied to his name and reputation.</p>

<p>Even though <em>City of the Wolves</em> does shoot itself in the foot with some of its issues, the game still excels in other places that are worth highlighting. The first aspect of the game that caught my eye was its art style. Rather than taking a realist approach like other games in space, it leans heavily into the comic book and anime aesthetic. Whenever players are performing power moves, it's hard not to be impressed by how colorful they are and to see the drastic change in</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unknown-2025_04_18-21_36_50-1.jpg?itok=ppQkuuFS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unknown-2025_04_18-21_36_50-1.jpg?itok=Q-eCmXha 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He really has that fit on</figcaption></figure><p>On top of that, the music absolutely slaps. Right off the bat, players are greeted with smooth jazz on the main menu, and each battle arena is complemented by a fantastic score. It's hard not to get a little dance going in real life as you're watching your character throw hands with someone else. But in addition to having great music, it also serves as a nice centerpiece to the fights, too, because, at times, it'll add that level of intensity that's needed when you're on the verge of winning/losing a fight.</p>

<p>Another pleasant surprise was the customization that's possible with the Color Edit menu. Now, it's not like other games in the space that essentially allow you to turn someone into Goku or Leon from the <em>Resident Evil</em> series. But it was still enough to allow me to express myself uniquely. Even though the only things I was able to change were their clothes and items, it was still enough for me to make some of my mains pop out in a special way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unknown-2025_04_17-21_00_23.jpg?itok=FV-gaiTY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unknown-2025_04_17-21_00_23.jpg?itok=PFl0ZB4q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He's just like me</figcaption></figure><p>One of the ways <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves </em>separates itself from its competitors is how it deals with its power-up system. In most fighting games, there's always some kind of X-Factor that players can enable, and once it's started, it'll give them some sort of buff for a brief moment. But oftentimes, it's enough to turn the tide of that battle. <em>City of the Wolves</em> is no different in that regard, but how it goes about it is what separates it from others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here, that feature is called S.P.G. This allows players to perform stronger attacks and encourages them to be on the offensive. At the beginning of each game, players have the option to select where they want the S.P.G. to activate; this can range from starting right off the bat when they're at full, half, or a quarter of HP.</p>

<p>There's another twist to this. The S.P.G. will be active as long as your HP matches the bar, so theoretically, a player can have it the whole game from the beginning. This creates a fun dynamic on how aggressive one should be. On top of that, whenever the S.P.G., you'll have access to a hidden move that does significant damage.&nbsp; So, knowing where to place the S.P.G. can make all the difference.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/4a3i8-i9pt2.jpg?itok=5I5N_PZ5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/4a3i8-i9pt2.jpg?itok=WLarCFOR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look at that S.P.G.!</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fatal Fury</em>'s Rev system truly separates it from other fighting games because of how many layers there are to it. The power moves in <em>City of the Wolves </em>are called Rev actions, and these can be used as much as I want as long as I don't fill up the Rev Meter. Rev actions are beneficial because they allow you to perform power chain combos and make stronger moves overall. But if I allowed the meter to reach 100 percent, this would come back and bite me because I'll begin to overheat. This will prevent me from doing any Rev actions and reduce my blocking gauge.</p>

<p>Of course, I could prevent my character from overheating by performing successful blocks or landing hits on my opponent. This is just another added layer to the game's intricate combat system.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/akw6u-xoyu7-1.jpg?itok=LEsFtemR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/akw6u-xoyu7-1.jpg?itok=SlJpWc9J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He did indeed win that match too.</figcaption></figure><p>On the flip side, players are also rewarded for playing more defensively. Whenever a perfectly timed block is performed, not only does it cool down my Rev, but it also gives me just a little bit of lost health, which was nice because often, the HP was something that I desperately needed. This, paired with the sheer number of counterattacks I could do, really shook things up for each fight. Because I wasn't always going in with the mindset of sending a flurry of blows, sometimes I opted for being more conservative in the fight and waiting for an opening that I could use that would almost guarantee me the game.</p>

<p>Even if all of this sounds a bit complicated, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves has a great tutorial system that explains a lot of the core mechanics. Although this isn't new, it's nice to see more games include a Smart control scheme that makes it significantly easier for players to perform various combos and attacks.</p>

<p><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> does many great things right. It's been a game that I was looking forward to. The combat system is a well-oiled machine with many layers. On top of that, it's gorgeous and has a fantastic soundtrack. But it does shoot itself in the foot with a story mode that isn't worth your time, and the addition of Cristiano Ronaldo handicaps it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-2-tv-show-vs-game-comparison.1169205/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-2-tv-show-vs-game-comparison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The following article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for The Last of Us season 2, episode 2. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the first episode of The Last of Us season 2 was the scene setter, then episode 2 is the catalyst for everything that comes next. It features – SPOILERS! – the death of Joel Miller, and it takes place in pretty much the exact same way as it did in the game. The devil is in the details, though, and not everything about that scene is a 1:1 recreation. That’s where our TV show vs game comparison comes in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve taken the major scenes of episode 2 that are taken from the game and compared them against the original source material, analysing what’s changed and what’s stayed the same. You can see both versions in the video above, or read on below for our written explanations. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Joel’s Death</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/21/death-1745206149352.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the instigating incident of the game and the big main event of the season’s second episode, Joel’s death was naturally going to be a meticulously recreated sequence. Both the broad strokes and many of the small details are all here; Abby blasts his leg with a shotgun and then proceeds to lay into him with a golf club. Kaityn Dever delivers the “You don’t get to rush this” line exactly as her game counterpart did. When Ellie arrives on the scene, the direction largely follows in the footsteps of the original cutscene, using the same floor-level camera angles and high-pitched sound break as Abby deals the final blow. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lurking between the many game-accurate details are several changes, though. First and foremost is that Joel is with Dina for this scene, not Tommy. Furthermore, Dina is drugged for the whole event, which means Ellie is the only Jackson resident to witness Joel’s murder. Abby’s behaviour is also slightly different; in the show she reveals to Joel who she is and why she’s about to kill him. In the game there’s no such scene, and we’re left to believe that Joel died without truly knowing why Abby hated him so much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and then there’s the matter of Abby’s hole in… well, not quite one. The game depicts the blow that finally kills Joel as a horrible bit of blunt force trauma to the skull, using the actual head of the golf club. In the show, the club is broken in Abby’s assault, and so all that’s left is the sharp broken end. Abby uses this as a shiv, stabbing it into Joel’s neck.     </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Abby’s Flashback</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/21/hospital-1745206166977.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Episode two features a sequence in which a young Abby searches the Fireflies’ hospital for her dad. It’s a recreation of the end of Tracking Lessons, the chapter of the game where the perspective shifts from Ellie to Abby. While the setting of this scene remains the same – the hospital corridor bathed in red emergency lighting – the actual events are rather different. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the show, older Abby confronts her younger self, cementing that this is a dream sequence rather than a flashback. Abby tells herself not to look inside the operating room, as she’ll have to see her dead father. Younger Abby does go into the operating room, but the camera does not follow, and so we’re left with just the older Abby’s restrained tears to relay the horror found inside. In the game, since you are in control of Abby, you get to see the inside of the room and Abby’s reaction to finding her father.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This reframing of the scene is likely due to its shifted position; in the game, this is the moment you learn that Abby’s father was killed in Joel’s attack on the Fireflies, and so the raw emotion of seeing Abby cry on the operating room flaw is necessary to humanise a character who has been portrayed as a villain for the prior 10 or so hours. The show reveals Abby’s motive from the very start and moves this sequence to much earlier in the story, and so it serves a different purpose.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ellie’s Awkward Morning</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/21/jesse-1745206188367.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The most faithful scene recreation of episode two arrives when Jesse comes knocking at Ellie’s door to go out on patrol. What follows is an awkward exchange regarding Ellie and Dina’s kiss the previous night at the barn dance – Dina, of course, had only recently split up with Jesse. The dialogue here is a 95% match to the game’s script, and the camera work also does its best to recreate the conversation in exact detail. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main difference here is context. In the game, the barn dance isn’t shown until right near the end of the campaign, and so when playing this sequence you’re using the information provided by the characters to piece together an event you’ve not witnessed. In the show, you know exactly what Jesse and Ellie are talking about, as you watched it happen in the previous episode.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bigot Sandwiches</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/21/sandwich-1745206205850.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to Ellie’s conversation with Jesse, her encounter with Seth the morning after the dance is largely a 1:1 replication of the same scene in the game. Seth has once again prepared steak sandwiches as an apology, and much of the dialogue around this awkward exchange is taken straight from the game’s script. The main difference here is that Jesse is now part of the scene, and he thanks Seth for the sandwiches rather than Maria. Additionally, the building itself is visually very different to that in the game, looking more like a canteen than a timber-constructed bar.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Eugene’s Weed Farm</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/21/eugene-1745206220638.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The show sees Jesse and Ellie head out on a patrol that recreates the middle section of the game’s first chapter. Fans of the game will instantly notice a key difference, as Ellie’s discovery of Eugene’s weed farm actually takes place during the same patrol depicted in episode one where Ellie and Dina explore the supermarket. These events have been split up and changed, as it’s now Jesse, not Dina who accompanies Ellie. That means the show removes the sequence in which Ellie and Dina smoke weed and are implied to have sex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, there are still several key elements of the sequence that are kept intact. Ellie still discovers Eugene’s Firefly pendant, as well as his once-impressive marijuana operation (which is far less well hidden in the show.) Among the belongings scattered about, Ellie finds Eugene’s bong gas mask, which can also be found in the game. Jesse, however, is much less impressed with Eugene’s ingenuity than Dina was. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Abby’s Escape</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/21/fence-1745206236829.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Abby’s fateful encounter with the infected horde plays out much like it does in the game’s first chapter. A chase sequence results in Abby becoming trapped behind a chainlink fence that begins to collapse under the weight of the clawing runners. If anything, this sequence is even nastier than it was in the game thanks to a shot of a hand being pushed through the fence, the wire cutting through the flesh. Aside from that, the broad direction of this scene is very close to the framing of the game, right up to the way Joel’s revolver appears from the side of the shot to blast the infected that pins Abby to the ground. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from The Last of Us, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-spoiler-free">spoiler-free season two review</a> and our spoiler-filled review of the second episode.

It’s the big one, folks. Please leave all your golf clubs at the door on your way in so as not to impart any more emotional damage to your fellow readers. Get your “Fore!” or “birdie” jokes out of your system.  Anyone who played <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> knew what was coming, but there’s still a lot to unpack in how HBO’s live-action show adapts one of the most harrowing moments in the series.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197530" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The 28 Years Later Trailer Feels Like The Leftovers Meets Survival Horror" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="135" data-playlist="197530,197527,197525" data-current="197530"><div><p>The 28 Years Later Trailer Feels Like The Leftovers Meets Survival Horror</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197530/197530_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197530/197530_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197530/197530_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23061.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h140928"><a id=""></a><strong>A never-ending nightmare</strong></h2><p>We start with Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) walking through a dark hallway, the very same hallway that Joel (Pedro Pascal) walked down to save Ellie (Bella Ramsey) in season one, unknowingly sealing his fate. At first, it seems like she’s alone, but then we hear another voice. Well, it’s her own voice, but from another version of her who knows what awaits her if she presses on. She tries to tell her to turn back, even going as far as to tell her that “his” brains are on the floor in an attempt to scare her off. But Abby doesn’t believe her other self and heads in anyway, and we hear her crying as she finds the scene on the other side. She then wakes up on the cold floor of an abandoned cabin outside of Jackson. It was all a dream. A nightmare, really.</p><p>Abby walking down that hallway in her nightmares is a recurring sequence throughout <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. Every time she does it, there’s something slightly different to illustrate her mental state. The major difference in the show is the presence of this second Abby, who tries to steer her away from the door at the end. Whereas in the game Abby’s motivations aren’t revealed until much later, the show makes it clear almost immediately that she’s an ex-Firefly with very personal reasons for wanting to kill Joel for what he did at the end of season one. I’m still baffled by this choice, when withholding these details from us was a key source of narrative tension in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p><p>After <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994">season two’s first episode premiered</a></span>, I saw several people online echoing this sentiment. <em>The Last of Us </em>laying everything bare this early isn’t just an embellishment of the sort you might see in most adaptations; it fundamentally undermines the core dissonance of the story it’s recreating for a new audience, without offering anything new to replace it. Abby is a divisive character by design. The game forces you to play as her, do things you might not agree with, and <em>then </em>it tells you how she got to this point. The show, meanwhile, seems uninterested in maintaining that suspense. It would rather skip to the end and tell you that Abby is a sympathetic figure without giving you a chance to believe anything else.</p><p>In fairness, the internet has made this story and Abby’s place in it a dumpster fire to engage with. Game actor Laura Bailey received <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">threats to her family</a></span> for playing the role, and the show <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-part-2-abby-actor-joel-spoilers-1851624206&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-part-2-abby-actor-joel-spoilers-1851624206">beefed up security for Dever</a></span> when she shot her scenes this season. I understand the inclination to try and mitigate any of the backlash, but this is one of the most regrettable examples of <em>The Last of Us </em>show feeling shaped by discourse rather than being the daring narrative trailblazer the games were.</p><p>As Abby wakes up, she finds Owen (Spencer Lord) has already been up and scouting out Jackson while everyone else has been sleeping. He’s discovered the town is heavily guarded and nearly impossible to infiltrate. But patrols are coming in and out of the enclosure, and Abby suggests they find one of them and threaten them into revealing where Joel is. Mel (Ariela Barer) immediately objects. The plan was to take out Joel and no one else. Abby backtracks and says her threats would be bluffs, but it’s clear her bloodlust outpaces everyone else’s. Owen breaks the tension by saying he has a concept of a plan that he’s working on, but Abby can’t just stand around and goes to keep watch with an assault rifle in hand. Wherever she and her friends are coming from, they’re heavily armed.</p><p>Owen’s plan, however, doesn’t end in Joel’s death. It ends with the group heading back to wherever they came from by convincing Abby to abandon this vendetta. The rift between Abby and her friends was apparent last episode, in which everyone else was more concerned with their survival while Abby was solely fixated on revenge. But will the fact that not everybody is as gung-ho about killing Joel at any cost be enough to pull Abby out of this blood rage?</p><h2 id="h140929"><a id=""></a><strong>Bridges mended(?)</strong></h2><p>We now see Ellie’s hut in Joel’s backyard, and the camera notably lingers on her acoustic guitar. The last time we saw the instrument, Joel was playing it on his back porch as Ellie walked past him, and now it’s back in her home. Put a pin in that for a few paragraphs. Jesse (Young Mazino) is here to collect Ellie for her patrol and also give her a hard time for her kiss with Dina (Isabela Merced) the night before. As the two head to get their horses, Jackson is gearing up for something big. Infected are showing more signs of intelligence, including using their own dead as insulation against the cold weather and as a decoy to draw in prey. Between this and the Stalker Ellie encountered last episode, Jackson is on high alert for infected, and not even considering what other dangers might be lurking outside the wall.</p><p>Ellie attempts to get away from Jesse’s older-brother condescension by saying that she wants to do a patrol with Joel instead. This sets off alarm bells for Jesse, as the last time anyone saw the two interacting, it was with Ellie screaming at him in front of a crowd of drunken townsfolk. Ellie puts her foot down and tells Jesse that everyone in Jackson can stop whispering about her tense relationship with her father figure because they’re working shit out. It’s a notable departure from <em>Part II</em>, in which Ellie only gestures at this reconciliation in a brief exchange with Dina, where she says she’s thinking about having a movie night and watching some <em>Curtis and Viper</em>, Joel’s favorite action flick. But this is HBO’s <em>The Last of Us, </em>in which subtext must be written out in giant neon signs for an audience the show doesn’t trust to follow along. With Ellie trying to go on a patrol with Joel, expressing to Jesse that their relationship is complicated but they’re working it out, and the guitar he was re-stringing being returned to her room, it’s clear <em>something </em>positive happened between them, but the only mystery that’s left is the specifics. It’s typical of how <em>The Last of Us </em>shows its cards without much consideration for how doing so cuts off the story it’s adapting at the knees, but what else is new? Ultimately, it doesn’t matter, as Joel has already left with Dina for his patrol.</p><figure id="" data-id="18990cefc38f3d3c473b21f834c0700d" data-recommend-id="image://18990cefc38f3d3c473b21f834c0700d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tommy addresses a crowd inside a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tommy addresses a crowd inside a bar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="18990cefc38f3d3c473b21f834c0700d" data-recommend-id="image://18990cefc38f3d3c473b21f834c0700d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tommy addresses a crowd inside a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ellie and Jesse head into one of the town’s restaurants and find Tommy (Gabriel Luna) preparing to run a drill with Jackson’s civilians for what to do if an infected horde comes a-knockin’. And as people head to their battle stations, Maria (Rutina Wesley) pulls Ellie aside for an unpleasant interaction. Seth (Robert John Burke) wants to apologize for his homophobic outburst at the dance. Or maybe Maria is forcing him to, who’s to say? Ellie wants no part of it, but Maria forces her to stand there while he says he’s sorry and hands Ellie some sandwiches. Ellie rightfully refuses to pick them up, so Maria does for her.</p><p><em>The Last of Us</em>’ handling of the homophobia that has persisted through the apocalypse has always fascinated me because, depending on which interaction you’re examining, it can come off as either meaningful worldbuilding or as if showrunner Craig Mazin is kinda just winging it like a well-meaning dad trying to illustrate the struggle in ways that are often more tragic and don’t make quite as much sense as the games’ take on the subject. (The Bill and Frank episode, with all its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-bill-frank-gay-nick-offerman-bartlett-1850035741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-bill-frank-gay-nick-offerman-bartlett-1850035741">themes of growing old in a post-AIDS crisis world</a></span>, is an example of Mazin’s take on the series getting it right.) We’ll get to examples of the latter down the line, but this scene between Seth, Ellie, and Maria that originates from <em>Part II</em> is so true to life that I and plenty of other queer people have experienced the dynamic it depicts. Maria cares less about Ellie’s righteous anger than she does about keeping the peace in Jackson. Forcing your surrogate niece to stand there and listen to a bigot who, not nine hours ago, called you and your friend a slur in front of god and everyone, is now pulling out a flimsy excuse for his behavior, is the opposite of allyship. It’s the same feeling as when your homophobic uncle says some bullshit at Thanksgiving dinner and your parents expect you to grin and bear it so you don’t ruin the holiday. No wonder this version of Ellie is so jaded at the notion of Jackson’s “community” when, at every turn, she’s being undermined by those claiming to be protecting her.</p><p>As Ellie and Jesse head out on their patrol, they see a snowstorm in the distance. They’re not concerned that it will reach Jackson, though; it should stay in the mountains. Good thing no one lives there for them to worry about, right?</p><h2 id="h140930"><a id=""></a><strong>The wolf circles her prey</strong></h2><p>Back in the mountains that are supposed to be uninhabited, Abby shivers as she keeps watch. Just as the cold is finally getting to her and she starts to head back, she hears a horse neighing in the distance. If that horse had shut the fuck up, maybe she would have turned around and went home and we could end the season here. But no. Abby sees a pair of Jackson civilians on patrol and heads in to get a closer look.</p><p>The snowstorm may not have reached Jackson proper, but it’s still interfering with the town’s radio signals. Tommy orders the patrols to come back, but Ellie and Jesse are too far out to head back through the blizzard. The pair takes shelter in an abandoned 7-Eleven once occupied by Eugene, Gail’s late husband. It’s full of weed and Firefly paraphernalia. Eugene was apparently part of the resistance group in its early days, but left when he grew tired of all the violence it entailed. We still don’t hear much about Eugene here, but Jesse does lament that Joel had to “put him down” and that he “couldn’t be saved.” All signs point to Eugene maybe having been infected, but considering Gail’s conversation with Joel last episode, it must be more complicated than that. Ellie doesn’t protest too much, but it’s clear the situation affected her. Whatever it was.</p><figure id="" data-id="91c891f7142574417bfa42a0259a502a" data-recommend-id="image://91c891f7142574417bfa42a0259a502a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Abby cowers behind a collapsed fence as infected try to reach her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Abby cowers behind a collapsed fence as infected try to reach her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91c891f7142574417bfa42a0259a502a" data-recommend-id="image://91c891f7142574417bfa42a0259a502a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Abby cowers behind a collapsed fence as infected try to reach her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Back with our heavy-artillery-sporting queen, Abby is still tracking the Jackson patrol pair below the mountains. At one point she tries to scale the side of the mountain with nothing to grab onto, further driving home that she’s perhaps too committed to this mission, even at the risk of her own safety. For her recklessness, she tumbles down into a pile of frozen infected, just like the ones Jesse was warning Ellie about. Now hundreds of these fuckers are chasing her down the side of the mountain, eventually pinning her down underneath a broken fence. This scene is genuinely terrifying, and manages to capture the claustrophobia of the game’s setpiece to a fucking tee. All that tension is broken by a gunshot as an unknown gunman saves Abby from an infected that has her pinned down. Then that tension is immediately replaced by a new one as it’s revealed that Joel has unknowingly saved a woman hellbent on killing him.</p><p>The trade-off in the show revealing Abby’s intentions before this moment is that this segment is now dripping with the dread of knowing that Joel has no idea what he’s gotten himself into. Abby hears Dina call out his name, and it all clicks. Even in her adrenaline rush, she can assess the danger in front of her rather than whipping out her gun and popping a cap in her target. Instead, she takes advantage of the infected banging on the door of their shelter to lure Joel into a more secure location: the lodge where her friends are waiting.</p><p>It’s kind of a bummer that the audience watching this show already knows who Abby is, because the entire thing reads as overtly sinister in a way that you would otherwise only catch on a second viewing. When you’re playing this segment in the game, Abby is still an unknown, disorienting addition the game refuses to explain. The adrenaline is pumping, and you might not catch on to the little hints of her intentions. It makes what comes next a true gut punch. But here you’re just screaming at the TV for Joel not to go into the dark closet, which is fun in its own morbid way, but it’s at odds with the story at large. We’ll get more into this as we go through the season, but large swaths of <em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season lack the mystery that made the story compelling, and made dragging yourself through some heinous acts of violence to see it through worthwhile. By the end of this episode, you’re fully aware of the dynamics at play that led to this moment, and you knew it was inevitable last episode. So much of the season just ends up making you watch the brutal aftermath of something you already saw coming rather than a tangled web of grief, anger, and forgiveness to unravel and dissect as Abby and Ellie exact their pounds of flesh. I’m sad that new fans who haven’t played the games are being denied the mystery of Abby’s motivations and the speculation this allowed for, but HBO probably didn’t want to leave all those questions unanswered for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">the years between seasons</a></span>, when people who played the game lost their minds because they had to wait a couple dozen hours.</p><h2 id="h140931"><a id=""></a><strong>Danger approaches</strong></h2><p>Tommy’s retreat order has made it to every patrol except Joel and Dina’s, prompting him to tell Jackson’s radio tower to dedicate all their resources to finding them. I appreciate the brotherly love, Tommy, but you’re about to have a way bigger problem on your hands than a missing patrol. In their efforts to reach Joel, the Jackson crew starts contacting other patrols to see if there’s been any sign of them. Once Jesse and Ellie hear that those two are missing, they don’t hesitate to get on their own horses to start searching. Jackson, meanwhile, has finally found active cordyceps tendrils in its piping, and there’s a massive horde just outside the town’s perimeter. This town is about to get hit from multiple angles, and none of them have any idea.</p><p>Meanwhile, Joel, Abby, and Dina are still trying to outrun the horde on their horses, but the crowd of infected is gaining on them. That is, until the tendrils in Jackson start signaling to their pursuers, who then lose all interest in pursuing Joel and company and break off to converge with another group and head toward the town. Time to see if all of Tommy’s drills could prepare Jackson for a threat of this scale.</p><p>Citizens hunker down in underground cellars as anyone who can hold a firearm prepares to face the infected. We saw Jackson mobilize to fight bandits in <em>The Last of Us Part I</em>, but the show goes out of its way to show you just how coordinated and militarized this town of survivors can be when they’re not hosting dances or throwing slurs at the local gays. <em>The Last of Us </em>is usually so focused on intimate acts of violence carried out by the player, so it’s not often that the series shows a whole community coming together to fight the infected. This is probably the largest battle ever shown in this universe, and a lot of Jackson’s defenses are made up of whatever the citizens could piece together, like makeshift barricades of heavy pickup trucks and tractors, and gasoline barrels that get pushed down rusty slides.</p><figure id="" data-id="a9147d551e8e6fefc390ef0ab4dbd187" data-recommend-id="image://a9147d551e8e6fefc390ef0ab4dbd187" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie looks at something off-screen with a concerned expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie looks at something off-screen with a concerned expression." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a9147d551e8e6fefc390ef0ab4dbd187" data-recommend-id="image://a9147d551e8e6fefc390ef0ab4dbd187" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie looks at something off-screen with a concerned expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Something I’ve always loved is how the contrast between Jackson and the Washington Liberation Front, Abby’s faction back in Seattle, also spotlights how different <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s leads are. Ellie’s kit is made up of ramshackle traps and the kind of firearms you’d expect the average gun nut to have kept around their house before the world went to shit, whereas Abby has military-grade weaponry that would shred through infected without much effort. Even when society has collapsed, <em>The Last of Us </em>has signifiers of status and wealth, it just manifests itself in militarized weaponry rather than a hastily made nail bomb. Seeing Jackson have to make do with whatever it has on hand while Abby and her crew are carrying around killing machines on their backs is an early reminder of the disparity between these two women that only becomes more clear when you play as them. I’m curious to see how else the show can make those different approaches to violence and survival these two women have been taught clear when we’re only able to watch them rather than inhabit them.</p><p>As Joel sees the carnage surrounding Jackson from a distance, he nearly turns back to help with the fight before Abby once again lures him away with the promise of ammunition and manpower to take to the infected. They sure could use their help down there as the horde breaks through the defenses thanks to a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hbo-last-of-us-bloater-infected-kills-perry-explained-1850089658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-last-of-us-bloater-infected-kills-perry-explained-1850089658">giant bloater</a></span> joining the pack. The infected assault on Jackson is pretty disheartening to witness, as they tear through one of the only known functioning civilizations we’ve seen in this world. Buildings that were just full of people are torn asunder, and people who were ready to defend the community run away in fear, taking valuable weapons with them. By the time Tommy manages to peel off the bloater from the horde it feels desperate, a last-ditch effort to save <em>anything</em> in what starts to feel like a lost cause. As the giant infected endured an endless stream from Tommy’s flamethrower, for a moment I thought the show might take a big swing and kill Joel’s brother in a tragic big hero moment, but eventually the infected succumbed to the fire, and Benji still gets to have a dad. Hey, at least someone gets to have one in this story, am I right?</p><h2 id="h140932"><a id=""></a><strong>Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned</strong></h2><p>Sorry, I’m getting ahead of myself. Back at the lodge, Abby’s friends are searching for their missing leader, only for her to show up on horseback with her prey in tow. She ushers the group inside the shelter and attempts to warm herself. Mel gets a chance to show off her medical skills by helping Dina with some frostbite. Even as she’s being treated, Dina keeps her wits about her and realizes she doesn’t know where any of these people came from. They have wolf patches on their gear with a “W.L.F.” logo, but when Dina asks who they are, Abby offers no explanation beyond their names. When she tells the room that these two are Dina and Joel, the temperature manages to drop below the freezing cold of the blizzard outside. Joel is too preoccupied with trying to reach Jackson to notice the tension in the room until Manny (Danny Ramirez) puts a gun to Dina’s head. Abby says no harm will come to her if Joel cooperates. She orders Mel to drug Dina to put her to sleep, and when the doctor shows hesitation, Abby says she’ll “smash [Dina] in the fucking head” if she doesn’t. Mel promises the panicking Dina that this will only put her to sleep for an hour, and then she even looks to Joel to reassure him. This group came to Jackson intending to kill Joel, and everything else this has required of them was not part of the plan. Except for Abby, that is.</p><p>Nora (Tati Gabrielle) disarms Joel, and as a brief aside, her shaved head in the present day makes her look pretty much identical to her character Jordan from Naughty Dog’s upcoming PS5 game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-last-of-us-naughty-dog-1851721022&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-last-of-us-naughty-dog-1851721022"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a></span>. That’s brand synergy if I’ve ever seen it. Hopefully, <em>Intergalactic</em>’s writing has some of the subtlety of the <em>Last of Us</em> games because my god, the way this whole scene just lays it all out is so tiresome. Joel pieces together that Abby’s crew isn’t a group of common raiders; they’re military, but they’re also Fireflies. Well, ex-Fireflies, as Abby clarifies. The resistance group pretty much dissolved after Joel did mass murder in Salt Lake City last season, and now we get Abby whipping out a villain’s monologue to tell Joel about everything he put her through when he decided to kill dozens of people to save Ellie’s life.</p><figure id="" data-id="55b7fc7721d1e278f8667e3df2e33ff2" data-recommend-id="image://55b7fc7721d1e278f8667e3df2e33ff2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel looks down at something off-screen from a balcony." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel looks down at something off-screen from a balcony." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="55b7fc7721d1e278f8667e3df2e33ff2" data-recommend-id="image://55b7fc7721d1e278f8667e3df2e33ff2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel looks down at something off-screen from a balcony." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>She verifies every part of the description she was given five years ago, including reminding everyone in the room that Joel is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-joel-abby-handsome-hbo-max-season-2-ep-1-1851776479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-joel-abby-handsome-hbo-max-season-2-ep-1-1851776479">“pretty handsome.”</a></span> At this point, I’m convinced that line is part of Pascal’s contract because why is Abby saying this shit to the man who killed her father? I admit I’m nitpicking this line, but it’s just a microcosm of my biggest problem with how this scene drags out what was a vicious, unrelenting moment in the source material. Abby had no desire to explain herself to Joel in <em>Part II</em>, and it felt pretty meaningful that even by the time that game was over, Joel and Ellie didn’t know who she was or why this vendetta was so important to her. But again, that’s not speaking intention into the camera, and that kind of unspoken storytelling has no place in HBO’s <em>The Last of Us</em>. Instead, we get dramatic theatrics so Dever has more lines to read and everyone is on the same page about what we’re supposed to feel.</p><p>As Abby continues monologuing, she finally gets a confession out of Joel for what he did in Salt Lake City, and then she gets to work. She shoots him in the leg with a shotgun, knocking him to the ground, and demands that Mel tourniquet his leg and stop the bleeding. Mel once again hesitates. This is far beyond what she signed up for, but Owen tells her to just do what they came here to do. Abby gets in close here and tells Joel what her damage is. Her father was the surgeon who was supposed to operate on Ellie before Joel’s violent intervention. Then she fills us in on what she’s been doing for the last five years: living in Seattle as part of the Washington Liberation Front. There, she and the other soldiers have a code not to kill people who cannot defend themselves. But what Joel did was wrong, and so the code goes out the window.</p><p>In the 12 years since <em>The Last of Us </em>launched in 2013, I have always found Ellie to be the character I related to most. She’s an angry queer nerd who has a fraught relationship with her family, has had so many things she wanted in her life denied to her, and is more or less dragging herself through life in hopes that one day she will find meaning again. That being said, even with all those parallels between me and her, I have never resonated more with a <em>Last of Us </em>character than when Joel told Abby to “just shut the fuck up and do it already.” All this theater and undoing of what made the original story compelling, and for what? Easy answers spoon-fed to the audience like they’re babies eating slop? What a shame. I’m so disappointed that this will be the version of this scene so many people will see first, if they even go looking at the original, that is.</p><p>I’m probably going to keep pontificating about the goals of video game adaptations in these weekly recaps because <em>The Last of Us</em> remains one of the oddest case studies in the growing, lucrative business of repurposing video game stories for other media. All the claims that <em>The Last of Us </em>is a no-brainer for a TV or film adaptation often boil the games down to the cutscenes, as if all the hours between those moments weren’t adding anything to it all. If there was nothing to be gained by actually playing out Joel, Ellie, and Abby’s actions, then what purpose would there have been in making it a video game to begin with? <em>The Last of Us</em> is so preoccupied with recounting plot points like a Wikipedia summary that it lacks any real insight into why those events were arranged in a way that made them meaningful to play through.</p><p>Maybe you can’t completely recreate the sense of betrayal the player experiences when Abby blows out Joel’s knee because it feels so personal. After all, you were made to inhabit that role without knowing where it would lead. The quickness with which it happens is disorienting and you’re left with no answers, only a lingering sense of shock and deception, and you have to sit with it for <em>hours </em>of game time before you’re given any explanation. Sure, that’s not easily translated to a TV show, but you can replicate some of that uncomfortable dissonance by keeping viewers in the dark in the same way you did players. Watching Ellie slaughter people who, unbeknownst to her, were also grieving someone they cared about, and only later revealing the truth of Abby’s motivations might not evoke the same guilt and complicity that the game attempts to by making you play out those actions, but it can still approximate the crucial elements of how the story was constructed rather than haphazardly telling a new audience the chronological events with no real vision.</p><p>That’s lost here, however, as Abby tells Joel everything she’s been feeling for five years, and it makes me wonder what Mazin thinks <em>The Last of Us </em>games were. Are they just a series of events that happened that you could watch with a controller in your hand, or were they a crafted experience meant to invoke specific feelings about our connections to the characters as whom we play? Yeah, maybe you can’t imitate that feeling exactly in passive media, but you sure as hell don’t have to pretend it was a negligible part of what made the story effective. <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>is a thorny, divisive tale <em>because </em>it’s a video game, not despite it. But in this moment, I don’t believe the team behind the show views it that way. This kind of translation feels like they view the attachment (or, in some cases, the deliberately cultivated distance) between player and protagonist as a fun bonus rather than something integral to its DNA; almost like they didn’t even think it was worth attempting to emulate for viewers.</p><h2 id="h140933"><a id=""></a><strong>“If I ever were to lose you…”</strong></h2><p>Ellie finally happens upon the lodge and notices Joel and Dina’s horses outside. As she enters, she hears screams from the upper floor and walks upstairs with her gun at the ready. But as she enters, she’s shocked by the bloody sight in front of her and doesn’t notice Manny at the door. He knocks the gun out of her hand and throws her to the ground, but she does get in a good cut with her switchblade before she’s restrained. She calls out to Joel to get up, but all he can do is watch her from across the room. Owen, clearly shaken by how slowly Abby has dragged this out, tells her to end it. Ellie begs for Joel’s life, but Abby uses the now-broken golf club to stab him in the back of the neck. It doesn’t have quite the impact of her caving his skull in with the club, but it gets the job done, I suppose. Part of me wonders if this is just a tweak made to avoid showing Pedro Pascal’s head caved in, but he was already bloody and swollen at this point. Or maybe it was an attempt to make sure the golf memes don’t break containment for the general audience. Either way, weird deviation.</p><p>As Ellie’s ears start ringing from the adrenaline flowing through her veins, Owen and Manny argue about something, but we can’t hear what. Ellie shouts to the room that she’s going to kill all of them, prompting Manny to kick her in the chest and knock the wind out of her. She crawls to Joel’s corpse as the group leaves. They said they were only here to kill Joel, and despite everything, that seems to be true. When she reaches him, she removes the broken club from his neck and then cuddles up against him, which is when I raised my eyebrows and laughed uncomfortably to no one. Again, it feels like this show cannot just let a moment or feeling be expressed without laying it on thick, even if it starts to feel morbid and performative.</p><p>Then, like an angel descending from the heavens to remind me that a better version of this story exists, original Ellie actor <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOpj33AbXxI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOpj33AbXxI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley Johnson’s cover of “Through the Valley”</a></span> plays over the final scene. Abby and her crew silently walk away, presumably back to their home in Seattle; the people of Jackson slowly pick off the remaining infected; and Jesse arrives at the lodge to help bring Joel’s body back to Jackson.</p><p>When I played this segment for the first time in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> back in 2020, I bawled in the way that leaves you feeling like shit the next morning. When I watched HBO recreate it, I couldn’t stop laughing. Maybe this is one of those things that will always just be poisoned by me having such a vivid recollection of the original scene. If this is your first time finding out about what Abby did to Joel, I hope it still hits for you. For me, it was just another succinct reminder that this show doesn’t have a strong understanding of the work it’s adapting. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And on the keyboards side, for instance, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23858523/logitech-pro-x-tkl-lightspeed-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-price-release-date-specs-features">Pro X TKL</a> has <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-keyboards%2Fpro-x-tkl-wireless-keyboard.html" rel="sponsored">gone up to $219.99</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250303235239/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/pro-x-tkl-wireless-keyboard.920-012154">$199.99 before</a>. One keyboard Dougherty calls out, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250321205050/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/k400-plus-touchpad-keyboard.920-007119">previously $27.99</a> K400 Plus Wireless Touch, <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fk400-plus-touchpad-keyboard.920-007119" rel="sponsored">went up by $7 to $34.99</a> — a relatively small increase that, at 25 percent, is one of the higher price bumps Logitech made.</p><p>Dougherty notes a few products that didn’t see price increases, including the MX Ergo mouse and the G703 gaming mouse. And according to the video, a handful of products have actually dropped in price, like the Pro X Superlight mouse, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250207231555/https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/pro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.910-005940.html">was $159.99</a>, but is <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-mice%2Fpro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.910-005940.html" rel="sponsored">now $149.99</a>.</p><p>Logitech doesn’t seem to have publicly announced the price changes, so we can’t say for certain when or why it made the changes. The most likely explanation is that it’s a response to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">President Donald Trump’s global tariffs</a>, which the company cited earlier this month as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647130/logitech-has-withdrawn-its-fiscal-year-2026-outlook-because-of-tariffs">withdrew its financial outlook</a> for fiscal year 2026. Logitech didn’t immediately respond to our request for comment.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-rumored-to-launch-on-april-21-at-12-pm-est/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We might be mere hours before the announcement and simultaneous release of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1914036912509407602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Detective Seeds</a> (the post has now been removed <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1914046038907772973" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at someone's request</a>), the game could launch tomorrow at 12 PM Eastern Time. Meanwhile, the excited community <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k3kq3i/page_on_virtuous_website_for_oblivion_remastered/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found traces</a> on the Bing search engine of a dedicated game page on the website of Virtuos, the studio behind the remaster.&nbsp; Whether it's really coming out tomorrow or not, multiple insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concur</a> that Oblivion Remastered should shadow drop sometime in the coming week. Let's recap its history of leaks and rumors, then.</p>
<p>In September 2023, an internal document shared as part of the FTC vs. Microsoft trial <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Bethesda planned to make an official Oblivion remaster (as well as a Fallout 3 remaster, which, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-fallout-3-remaster-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is further away from release</a>, according to the latest rumors).</p>
<p>After well over a year of no further info, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new report in January 2025</a> (based on the resume of a former Virtuos employee) not only discovered that Oblivion Remastered was indeed coming, but also revealed a lot of its features. It would be powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and it would feature improvements in six key areas: HUD (Heads-Up Display), Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, and Hit Reactions. Earlier this week, the first screenshots were found online on a Virtuos webpage, previewing the massive graphics improvements that players will be able to witness.</p>
<p>Now that the remaster is nearly official, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got a comment from Rebelzize</a>, Project Leader of the total conversion mod Skyblivion, also scheduled to launch in 2025 after nearly a decade of work in the team's spare time. Rebelzize maintained a positive outlook, focusing on the experience gained and on the project's uniqueness instead:</p>
<p><em>Luckily, this thing was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real, it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all. Gonna focus on the release of our own version and stay positive.</em></p>
<p>Are you eager to step back into Cyrodiil once again? If so, do you plan to play the official remaster or the fan-made one? Let us know below!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 Is the First Nintendo Switch 2 Game Confirmed to Use NVIDIA DLSS]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-is-the-first-nintendo-switch-2-game-confirmed-to-use-nvidia-dlss.1169004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is the first game confirmed to use NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch, despite the currently available footage not featuring any indication of the upscaler being used.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> revealed they received official confirmation from CD Projekt RED that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-development-more-seven-weeks-the-witcher-3-nintendo-switch-2/">Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2</a> uses a "version" of NVIDIA DLSS available for the hardware powered by Tensor Cores. DLSS is reportedly used in all four display modes - docked Quality and Performance, and handheld Quality and Performance.</p>
<p>After having received confirmation, Digital Foundry went back to the footage available in the best possible quality to see if there's any clear indication of the upscaler being in use, but the low post-processing quality, which is at a lower resolution than the rest of the footage, makes it difficult to spot some of those DLSS "edges" that show the upscaler being in use, although some were still found upon a closer inspection of the footage.</p>
<p>Besides confirming that Cyberpunk 2077 uses NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch 2, CD Projekt Red also confirmed that, while all modes target 1080p resolution, except for handheld Performance mode, which targets 720p, dynamic resolution scaling is in place, and the scaling can range from 2x and up per axis, meaning that we are looking at a 540p to 1080p range for the display modes targeting 1080p and a 360p to 720p range for Performance handheld.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #210: Next-Gen Sony Handheld , Cyberpunk DLSS on Switch 2, Docked VRR In Question" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z44nLuk4m-8?start=1216&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console launches in most regions. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

This time, it’s through the <em>Star Wars</em>-themed Galactic Battle, a new Battle Royale season that starts May 2nd and features Darth Jar Jar and the debut of Force Lightning, a new in-game ability. The news was appropriately <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">revealed at Star Wars Celebration</a> in Japan. As with most <em>Fortnite</em> seasons, this one had been heavily rumored in the runup.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Darth Jar Jar is a <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-darth-jar-jar-theory-explained/">goofy fan theory</a> that holds that Jar Jar Binks was secretly a Force user and possibly the real villain of the <em>Star Wars</em> prequel trilogy.</p><p>Ahmed Best, the voice of Jar Jar Binks since <em>Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace</em>, said on stage at the event that he improvised some Darth Jar Jar lines for the portrayal. When asked to list any of his favorites, he said, “‘I am the phantom menace’ was totally [improvised],” adding that the line was something he’s “been meaning to say for over 20 years.”</p><p>Galactic Battle will include X-Wings and TIE Fighters that players can pilot, themed maps, and “all-new Item Shop offerings including Mace Windu.” Players will also be able to buy put their hard-earned Fortnite V-Bucks towards a <em>Star Wars-</em>themed Battle Pass with characters like Emperor Palpatine and Wookiee Cuddle Team Leader. Galactic Battle will play out over five weeks with different themes leading up to a narrative live event. Here’s the schedule, <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">from StarWars.com</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Imperial Takeover – May 2, 2025</p><p>The Pull of the Force – May 8, 2025</p><p>Mandalorian Rising – May 22, 2025</p><p>Star Destroyer Bombardment – May 29, 2025</p><p>Death Star Sabotage – June 7, 2025</p></blockquote></div><div><p>Of course, this is far from the first collaboration between the two pop culture behemoths.

<p>Whilst Fortnite has teamed up with Star Wars before, this marks only the third time in Fortnite's storied history that it has dedicated an entire season to a specific IP, and both prior instances were focused on Marvel.</p> <div>

<p>Right now, the details are pretty sparse - for instance, we don't yet know what characters will, or will not, be added to the battle pass, but there's a number of familiar faces in the teaser above - and it's thought this season will run a little shorter than usual, possibly clocking in at around 30 days. We'll confirm when we know for sure, of course.</p>

            <p>Pocketpair has responded to Nintendo's legal action by asserting the patents The Pokémon Company believes Pocketpair has contravened are invalid due to other games that came before it, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, Tomb Raider, and even Nintendo's own Legend of Zelda series.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/pocketpairs-defenses-against-nintendos-patent-lawsuit-unpacked-ark-craftopia-zelda-ff14-etc-may-render-asserted-patents-invalid/">Games Fray</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/palworld-dev-fights-nintendo-lawsuit-with-comparisons-to-fallout-monster-hunter-and-more/">VGC</a>), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair challenged Nintendo's patent applications which were reportedly filed between February and July 2024, several weeks and months after the monster-collecting game debuted in January of that same year.</p>
<p>Pocketpair maintains through prior preparatory briefs that Nintendo's patents-in-suit shouldn't have been granted given games using the systems and art protected by the patents were already in existence.</p>

</p>
<figcaption>PALWORLD Early Access Review: Is It Worth It?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZl10Mlc7I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Specifically, the developer said the patents contravene art already in place in Ark: Survival Evolved, Pocket Souls, and its own Craftopia, as well as a whole list of other notable references, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, Tomb Raider, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-5">Far Cry 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a>, Octopath Traveler, Pikmin 3, Monster Hunter Ultimate, and a range of prior Pokémon games.</p>
<p>Pocketpair states that games like Rune Factory 5, Titanfall 2, and Pikmin 3 Deluxe "make it easy to see how a player character can perform an action to release a monster or a capture item (like a ball) and fire in a direction by releasing a button", whilst Pikmin 3 Deluxe, Far Cry 5 and Tomb Raider "already showed that there can be different types of throwable objects".</p>
<p>Furthermore, Pocket Souls, Octopath Traveler, Monster Super League and Final Fantasy 14 "made it easy to imagine that one could pick targets on the field and then show an indication of how likely the capture operation is to succeed", and "generally speaking, it has been an element of the Pokémon series for more than 30 years that different capture items have different success rates".</p>
<p>If, like Pocketpair believes, all these games already invalidate Nintendo's patents, "it doesn't matter whether Palworld does what such a patent describes: you can infringe an invalid patent all you want".</p>
<p>"There is no question that Pocketpair and its lawyers have made a huge effort to develop many invalidity and non-infringement arguments," the briefing by Games Fray - prepared by a patent-specialist Japanese lawyer - states.</p>
<p>"Again, a single such argument for a given patent is enough to be cleared with respect to that patent. But Nintendo is suing over three patents, and Pocketpair won’t want to lose over any single one of them."</p>
<p>As Eurogamer sumarised recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">comparisons were made between Pocketpair's own monster-catching title and Pokémon</a> ever since Palworld was first revealed. Dubbed "Pokémon with guns" ahead of its early access release last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemons-former-chief-legal-officer-surprised-palworld-managed-to-get-this-far">The Pokémon Company's former chief legal officer Don McGowan said he was "surprised" the game had "got this far"</a> before Nintendo finally announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a> in September. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit was targeting three patents in particular.</p>
<p>As part of an update in December, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a> but despite this, Pocketpair <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-releases-overdungeon-on-nintendo-switch/">has released a game on Nintendo Switch</a>, and is considering bringing Palworld to Nintendo Switch 2.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Nvidia's machine learning upscaler is used in both docked and handheld modes.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>One of the most ambitious titles lined up for the launch of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt RED</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> has been showcased via work-in-progress code seen at the console's launch tour. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">Digital Foundry had the chance to go hands-on at the recent London event</a> and while our initial impressions are on the record, many questions remained unanswered. Is the port using Nvidia DLSS? CDPR has now confirmed that the answer is yes, making this the first known title to use the machine learning-based upscaling technology.</p>
<p>"We're using a version of DLSS available for Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, powered by Nvidia's Tensor cores," the firm told us. "The game utilises DLSS in all four modes: in handheld and docked, and the performance and quality variations of each."</p>
<p>DLSS has been viewed as a 'magic bullet' of sorts in the run-up to the Switch 2's unveiling. In a world where developers are pushing visual technology to the next level, running games at full native res with consistent performance becomes unviable, so rendering at lower rendering resolutions is commonplace, with upscalers used to produce the final output image. These upscalers can range from basic bilinear scaling to more advanced techniques, like TAA upscaling - where information from prior frames is fed into the current one to improve detail.</p>
<p>DLSS is a form of TAA upscaling, but with a twist - by feeding the lower resolution frame along with history from prior frames and other data, such as motion vectors - a neural network is then used to reconstruct the image. As the Switch 2's GPU includes machine learning tensor cores, there's no reason why any DLSS technology couldn't come to the Nintendo hybrid - the caveat being that there's still a computational cost to using it.</p>

<p>CD Projekt RED also confirmed that the current target for the Switch 2 version of the game is to offer different graphics modes - a quality and performance toggle for the handheld and docked versions. When connected to a TV, there's the choice of a 30fps quality mode and a 40fps performance mode. The latter would presumably operate only with the TV in 120Hz mode - a new frame for every three display refreshes, up against the 30fps quality mode which delivers a new frame for every other refresh. With consistent performance, both should look smooth, with the 40fps mode sitting between 30fps and 60fps in terms of fluidity. Both modes are using 1080p as the output resolution with dynamic resolution scaling in effect in combination with DLSS.</p>
<p>The handheld mode - as things stand - is slightly different. Necessarily so as system performance is lower. In this scenario, the quality mode is still outputting a 1080p image with DLSS and dynamic resolution scaling, again targeting 30fps. The performance mode sees the output resolution drop to 720p, with the handheld screen in 120Hz mode and 40fps as the target.</p>
<p>In terms of input resolutions, our initial pixel counts from the very, very short snippet of footage seen in the Nintendo Direct delivered readings from 540p to 1080p - and the fact we could pixel count it at all made us doubt whether DLSS was in play at all. CD Projekt RED has also confirmed that "scaling can range from 2x and up per axis", so depending on GPU load, the DLSS upscaler will be fed with anything from 540p to 1080p in the 30fps quality modes and the docked 40fps performance mode. For the handheld iteration of the performance mode, the 2x and up scaling would suggest DRS between 360p and 720p, depending on GPU load.</p>

<p>DLSS compatibility had been mentioned by Nintendo and Nvidia in previous PR, but its use in Cyberpunk 2077 (and in both handheld and docked configurations, no less) is our first confirmation of the technology being used in a launch title. However, we are seeing a slightly different utilisation of DLSS compared to PC. There, it's typically the case that post-processing elements are rendered at the same output resolution. So, if you're outputting 1080p from a 540p image, there are still components of the image that should be rendered at full 1080p.</p>
<p>It may be the case that Cyberpunk 2077 is still rendering those post-processed components at input resolution instead, which may explain why we're able to see obvious stair-stepping edges that make pixel-counting possible. As you'll see in the DF Direct posted today, it does look to be the older convolutional neural network version of DLSS that's being used - not Nvidia's freshly minted DLSS 4.0 transformer model.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">hands-on with Cyberpunk 2077 at the Switch 2 London event</a>, our impression was that CDPR's work-in-progress code was recognisably Cyberpunk, but we encountered many situations where it appeared both CPU and GPU were over-taxed resulting in some lurching drops to performance. However, the code was seven weeks old at that point with a good deal of development time remaining until the Switch 2 launch on June 5. We view Cyberpunk 2077 as something of a benchmark game - and can't wait to see final code on the new Nintendo console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/interview/649723/henk-rogers-tetris-book-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When Henk Rogers first read the script for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23650577/apple-tetris-movie-taron-egerton-review">the <em>Tetris</em> movie</a>, he was shocked. “There was so much Hollywood in the movie,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It just drove me nuts.” The film largely follows a pivotal period in Rogers’ life, when he traveled to the Soviet Union to navigate the complex rights issues for <em>Tetris</em> to bring it to platforms like the Game Boy. There, he connected with game’s creator Alexey Pajitnov, with whom he eventually formed a lifelong friendship, and turned <em>Tetris </em>into a global phenomenon.</p><p>The movie turned this experience into something resembling a high-stakes spy thriller — and while Rogers ended up loving the final product, that initial experience inspired him to tell the story of what really happened. “While reading the script I said, ‘I have to set the record straight,’” he says.</p><p>That story now exists in the form of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Game-Tetris-Russia-Love/dp/1962603202?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored"><em>The Perfect Game</em></a>. While Rogers originally sat down to write about the events that transpired in the movie, he soon realized the story was much bigger than that. “I started writing it, and somebody looked at it and said, ‘That could be a book, it’s just not big enough,’” he explains. “I didn’t want to rewrite that part and add water, so to speak, so I added the before and after. So it ended up being about my game career.”</p><p><em>The Perfect Game</em> starts out by exploring Rogers’ early life, bouncing around from the Netherlands to New York City to Hawaii, before eventually landing in Japan, where he founded Bullet-Proof Software and went on to release the influential RPG <em>The Black Onyx</em>. Even before the book gets to the <em>Tetris</em> part of the tale, it’s filled with fascinating insight into the early days of game development. Rogers talks through the many complications and nuances of dealing with publishers and funding, as well as releasing and marketing a game in Japan despite not speaking Japanese.</p><p>But things really kicked into gear at CES in 1988, when he flew to Las Vegas in search of a new game to publish and stumbled on a puzzle game about falling blocks. As he tells it, he knew immediately that he found something special. “I left the Consumer Electronics Show with a sense of purpose,” Rogers writes in his book. “I was determined to publish <em>Tetris </em>in Japan.” That proved tricky, of course, due in large part to the web of copyright laws in the Soviet Union at the time. Rogers found himself traveling back and forth between the Soviet Union and Japan, dealing with everyone from the higher-ups at Nintendo — including legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto — to the intimidating employees at Soviet trade organizations.</p><div><p>“There’s times when my memory is a little shady, but it was such an exciting time that I pretty much remember.”</p></div><p>Rogers’ account is a detailed one, and he says that he wrote the book entirely from memory. That said, he did check with his friend Pajitnov on a few details, which resulted in one of the book’s more charming features. At various points, Pajitnov’s thoughts are inserted into the book, where he often disagrees with Rogers on small details, like how impressed he was by the Famicom version of <em>Tetris</em> or the quality of the elevator in his apartment building.</p><p>“Alexei read my manuscript and was writing in the margins where his memory is different, so I decided to keep those and put them in the book,” Rogers explains. “There’s times when my memory is a little shady, but it was such an exciting time that I pretty much remember.”</p><p>Even if it’s missing the Hollywood thrills of the script that inspired Rogers to write in the first place, <em>The Perfect Game</em> is a fascinating read, particularly if you’re interested in game development anecdotes. And because the story covers the entirety of Rogers’ career to date, which includes setting up The Tetris Company and bringing the game to just about every platform imaginable, there are a lot of stories about pivotal points in the medium, from the launch of the Game Boy to the burgeoning days of mobile gaming.</p><p>The story is especially notable as<em> Tetris</em> continues to thrive. In addition to the movie and book, Rogers was also featured prominently in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24291537/tetris-forever-review-ps5-switch-pc-xbox">Digital Eclipse’s playable documentary <em>Tetris Forever</em></a><em>,</em> and the game still pops up frequently in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636581/nintendo-music-app-tetris-dr-mario-kirby-edit-share-playlists-update">places like Nintendo’s new music app</a>. Rogers has largely stepped away from the business, which is now run by his daughter Maya. So now when he sees the game appear somewhere surprising, it elicits a different kind of feeling. “It feels like success,” he says. “Every time <em>Tetris</em> pops up somewhere, or a new deal comes down the pike, it’s like, ‘Wow, she’s killing it.‘”</p><p>As for that movie, Rogers changed his mind when he actually saw it, describing the film as “emotionally correct,” even if it didn’t get all of the facts right. “The first time I saw it I cried about things that never actually happened,” he says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
