Instead, he insists he saved her.</p><p>This seems like a new take on the opening scene of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, in which Joel recounts the violent events of the first game’s finale to his brother Tommy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-q1-2025-report-reveals-sales-down-by-46-5/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo's Q1 2025 <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240802_2e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a> has been released, and the numbers regarding hardware sales aren't too surprising overall. Nintendo Switch sales have decreased significantly, with 2024 being their lowest year. This quarter of the fiscal year, they sold 2.1 million Nintendo Switches between April 1 and June 30, a significant decrease of 46%.</p>
<p>Their total net sales are down by 46.5%, to 246.6 billion Yen, compared to 461.3 billion Yen during the first quarter of 2024's fiscal year. Their operating profit decreased by a significant 70.6%, with ordinary profit dipping by 55.3%. However, this most likely doesn't come as a surprise to most people.</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch being seven years old, it is not surprising that sales are starting to drop significantly. Both their dedicated video game platforms, mobile games, and IP-related income experienced severe drops. Consolidated hardware sales dropped by 46.4%, with mobile and other IP-related incomes dropping by 53.8%.</p>
<p>Nintendo acknowledges the overall drop in mobile and IP-related sales, saying it's "mainly due to the decrease in income from visual content related to The Super Mario Bros. Movie."</p>
<p>That said, they made a 42.8% profit on other sales, such as merchandise from official Nintendo stores and playing cards, which brought their sales up from 1.9 billion Yen to 2.8 billion Yen.</p>
<p>All of the Nintendo Switch models suffered a significant blow to sales. The original Nintendo Switch suffered the least with a drop of 18.4%, with&nbsp; <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-lite-oled/">Nintendo Switch Lite</a> sales dropping by 56.1% and Nintendo Switch OLED Model sales dropping by 46.3%</p>
<p>Looking at their software sales, two of their IPs were on top for selling over a million units. These two games were Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD. One other title reached a million units, but it is not disclosed in the financial report as to which game that is.</p>
<p>Sales are drastically different from the previous fiscal year's first quarter. Last year saw the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which also saw special edition Nintendo Switches released to celebrate the release. Alongside Zelda, The Super Mario Bros. Movie was released, which boosted sales massively.</p>
<p>Overall, the sell-through in this fiscal year is below the level of previous years. Despite that, sales for Princess Peach: Showtime! and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remained stable. However, these two games combined don't match the amount of sell-through sales Nintendo made with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Princess Peach: Showtime! and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door account for approximately half of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's sales.</p>
<p>Nintendo has a jam-packed year for game releases, so it's possible the next quarter of the fiscal year will be better for them, with games such as The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and Super Mario Party Jamboree being released.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Brace yourself, Half-Life fans – rumours of Half-Life 3 have been resurrected once again, this time originating from the unassuming resume of a voice actor.</p>
<p>There's a chance that by the time you read this,  Natasha Chandel's <a href="https://www.natashachandel.com/resume/">website</a> has already been, uh, revised, but right now, if you scroll down to the "voice over" section, you'll see reference "Project White Sands (video game)".</p>
<p>Chandel did not name the character(s) she provided voice work for, but the project is clearly marked as belonging to Valve.</p>

<p>Is this all-out proof? Nope. Sorry. But at the very least, it's proof Valve is possibly developing another game in addition to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock">Deadlock</a>, and if it's <em>not</em> Half-Life-related, that is an extraordinarily cruel codename to use…</p>
<p>Court documents recently revealed detailed employment statistics for Valve, the company behind the ubiquitous PC storefront Steam, the Steam Deck handheld, and - yes, still - a team dedicated to game development.</p>
<p>Altogether, that's just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-is-massive-but-far-fewer-people-work-at-valve-than-you-might-think">371 people employed by Valve in 2021</a>, for a company believed to bring in around $6.5bn a year. EA, home to FIFA/FC, which also generates around $6.5bn annually, had 13,700 staff on the payroll this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Images of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 have leaked online, including multiplayer maps, menu screens, and perks.</p>
<p>Within hours, the screenshots were hit with copyright claims from Activision, adding credence to the claims they come from an in-development build. However, this is the internet, which means nothing's ever truly gone, and the images are still going up faster than Activision can remove them.</p>

<p>According to the leaker – who distributed the images via a throwaway Twitter/X account – they were unable to secure images or information about the single-player campaign or Black Ops 6's  zombies mode.</p>
<p>Other images hint at a reworked UI and menu system, although it's possible the menus only look that way because it's an in-development build.</p> <div>

		<p>This morning is yet another where we have woken up to the news that the far right continues to riot across the UK, and it is anxiety inducing. For the first time in my 35 years of life, I feel, like many other, unsettled in the country we call home. Disinformation, dishonesty, and dishonourable acts have led to the violent disorder perpetrated by a loud, violent, minority, and it is time that there is a reckoning against all of this.</p>
<p>Growing up, I was told by my family members who were born here in the 60s and 70s, of the violence they faced due to groups such as the National Front, and after decades of hard work to stamp this prejudice out and make our society more equal and equitable, it seems that we are sliding back to those dark times. To see the reports of the far-right and – let’s not beat around the bush here – of racists co-opting a tragedy as an excuse to attack anyone who is not white is disgusting and rage inducing. But we did not get here in a vacuum.</p>
<p>For years, we have seen traditional media, social media, and algorithm-led platforms pushing far-right figures to the fore on a regular basis. This is despite warnings from individuals and groups that doing so emboldens these figures and spreads their message. Challenging them in the social media space does not work, especially if some of those spaces are owned by those that agree with such views. I point to the traditional media groups, both broadcast and newspapers, that have have barely challenged far right talking points, and instead used them to validate their own messages instead. We have seen headlines from the likes of the Daily Mail and The Sun constantly attack those from non-white and non-Christian backgrounds, fuelling hate.&nbsp; Even the likes of the BBC have not helped in this matter, platforming Nigel Farage a record 32 times on Question Time under the pretence of providing balanced opinions, while ITV featured him in I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!, which might have made him seem more affable to some.</p>
<p>All of this has led to massive changes to our society, most significantly propelling us toward Brexit, and now in the most recent General Election, to Reform snatching 14% of the vote, and attracting members of the far-right to it in the process. Even now, reporting on the riots is still being framed as protest across the media landscape, conflating legitimate protest with actual violent disorder and thuggery. Every single reporter and editor in our media should have a frank and open discussion on how they report on issues that affect people from minority backgrounds, and how their reporting over the years has fuelled what has now happened, instead of acting surprised at the result. Will it happen? That is unlikely.</p>
<p>Our politicians have not helped either. Over the last 14 years, all we have really had is culture wars and divisive politics. Asylum seekers have been othered by the very highest of offices, and now are under violent attack. What is worse is a lot of this rhetoric has come from people who are from minority backgrounds, pandering to the far right for a grip on power. They think that moving even further right will get them in the top jobs again. The reality is that once the far right is done with them, they will be discarded and grouped in with the rest of us as an other. Social media is also to blame, allowing constant disinformation to spread faster than the truth and featuring algorithms that push far-right content. On my own Facebook feed I am constantly shown posts from such groups even though I am not a member of any of them, nor do I want to see them. Social media companies need to be held to account and disinformation needs to be stamped out at the source.</p>

<p>Reversing this trend will take a huge amount of effort, and our education system has a large role tackling the narrative that people from minority backgrounds are only recent arrivals to this country or that they are not British. The British Empire lasted hundreds of years and saw people from all over move across it. The first Indian MP elected to the UK Parliament was Dadabhai Naoroji in 1892, something that is not taught in schools. Britain has been quick to show pride that it was the leader in abolishing slavery, while not giving credence to folks like Ottobah Cugoano, Mary Prince, Olaudah Equiano, and Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, all of whom are Black Britons that lived during the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. Our education system skips over Empire, ignoring the hard truths that at one stage in this country’s history there was a huge dark period that saw millions suffer, while a few benefited.</p>
<p>We have to remember that the far-right is loud and often violent, but it is a minority. That lesson needs to especially be learned by those that platform them regularly. Even though they are a minority, the far right has to be guarded against and pushed back against over the long term. This morning I signed up as a member to <a href="https://www.rota.org.uk/">ROTA – Race on the Agenda</a> and<a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/blogs/campaigns-blog/anti-racism-network"> Amnesty International Anti Racism Network</a>, to better educate myself and to get involved in ways to counter the racism that perpetuates across our society. I would ask that, if you are tired of racism rearing its head again and again, you do the same.</p>
<p>A final thing in case any disinformation is spread by the far-right about me. My family settled in the UK 70 years ago. I was born and raised here. I work full time. I come from a Punjabi Sikh background. I am British.</p>

			<p>Sony Santa Monica, the studio known mainly for the God of War franchise, might be working on a brand new IP. Fans have been speculating as much for a while, given that Cory Barlog <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-cory-barlog-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> his desire to create a new franchise after he successfully directed the enormously successful God of War reboot. At the time, Barlog stressed he'd need to convince Sony first, but a LinkedIn resume of a Sony Santa Monica Character Supervisor (<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/according-to-a-developer-at-santa-monica-studio-the-studios-next-game-is-a-new-ip.943911/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> on the ResetEra board) suggests he succeeded in his endeavor.</p>
<p>This developer worked on both God of War and God of War Ragnarok before leaving to join Striking Distance Studios to make The Callisto Protocol. Next, they worked for Unknown Worlds on an upcoming installment in the Subnautica franchise before coming back to SSM:</p>
<p><em>Santa Monica Studios presented the opportunity of coming back as Character Supervisor, looking after the entire Character Development pipeline on their new IP, so here I am, thrilled to be back, working again with the crew and pushing Characters in videogames together.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Cory Barlog did <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-not-directed-cory-barlog-atreus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not</a> direct the most recent God of War entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragnarok</a>, which launched in October 2022 to critical and commercial acclaim. Barlog only worked on it as a producer, so he might have already been cooking something else. As such, the new intellectual property might not be too far away from being revealed.</p>
<p>It's anyone's guess at this point what that might be about, though rumors suggest it might be set in a sci-fi setting. Whatever they're making, fans will surely be eager to learn more, given Sony Santa Monica's excellent pedigree. We'll keep you abreast of any further rumors and/or official news as they appear.</p>
<p>By the way, God of War fans should not fret: the Californian studio surely is not abandoning its prized IP. On the contrary, they appear to have set up separate teams to handle two franchises at once.</p>
