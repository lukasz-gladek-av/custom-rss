			<p>In my STALKER 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>, I mentioned how the game's balance is currently causing frustration for the player:</p>
<p><em>When you're hit in STALKER 2, there's a decent chance you'll not only lose health (which does not regenerate on its own), but you'll also start bleeding. While medkits restore health, you need bandages to stem the bleeding. Similarly, you need to bring food and drinks, anti-rads, and enough ammunition whenever you venture out of the safe zones. You'll want to stock up on all these things because there is no fast travel in this game, and there's no telling when you might need them while roaming the ever-dangerous Zone. However, everything has its own weight; even quest items have weight, and the more you carry, the quicker the stamina drops.</em></p>
<p><em>While that is perfectly understandable within the context of the game's design, I feel that it is absolutely overtuned and ends up being too penalizing. Even when the inventory's weight is in the green range, it only takes a little sprint to deplete the stamina, leading to fairly slow and long treks to travel across the map. I literally wished there was some kind of auto-run functionality, as you're just pushing the forward button for minutes at a time on certain occasions with nothing else to do. A modular approach to difficulty, which is becoming more common in recent game releases, would have been preferable to set the challenge level of combat, travel, injuries and survival separately depending on the player's preferences.</em></p>
<p><em>There's more. The equipment's durability depletes over time, as you'd expect given the realistic theme. Tech NPCs can repair them in the safe zones, provided you've got enough coupons to spare. The problem is that, in some cases, the cost is simply outrageous. I had found an extremely effective armor suit that was worth over 20K coupons. However, when I went to repair it, I was appalled by the NPC requesting 70K coupons - far more than I had available. When repairing something costs over three times its worth, you know something's wrong. I also believe that the side missions could be more rewarding at handing coupons; you don't loot coupons from fallen foes, as they are transmitted digitally to your PDA. You could gather items and then sell them, but there's the little problem mentioned above with taking on too much weight. In short, the economy needs a balance pass, too.</em></p>
<p>Later in the review, I mentioned that either GSC Game World or modders would have to take care of the problem. It looks like the modders already did, albeit in a perhaps excessive fashion. Mere hours after the launch, Nexus Mods user Ronon_Dex_6 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded</a> a mod that provides unlimited carry weight for the player. This works through Cheat Engine, so it's essentially a hack, and it certainly kind of undermines the harsh journey the player is meant to go through. However, it is a temporary solution for those who cannot bear the system as-is, while a better fix can be provided by the developers or by a more elegant mod.</p>
<p>There's also another <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/26" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mod</a> that removes weapon durability loss. This is achieved by manually tweaking the durabilitydamagepershot value to 0.0 in the PlayerWeaponSettingsPrototypes.cfg file. Many more mods will undoubtedly be released for STALKER 2. The development team <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans</a> to release official tools that will allow fans to create cross-platform mods that work on consoles, too. We'll keep you informed of all the most interesting mods as they appear.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-increasing-its-battle-pass-price-in-december/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Starting December 1, the price of the Fortnite Battle Royale Battle Pass will increase to 1,000 V-Bucks, up from 950 V-Bucks. However, the real money cost of V-Bucks will stay the same. Players can still earn V-Bucks by progressing through the Battle Pass tiers. In addition, the price of the 25 Battle Pass Reward Bundle has been reduced from 1,850 V-Bucks to 1,800 V-Bucks.</p>



<p>Fortnite is making <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-crew-will-include-the-battle-pass-lego-pass-music-pass-and-more-starting-in-december" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several changes</a> to its Crew Subscription, along with increasing the Battle Pass price. Starting December 1, the Fortnite Crew will include the Music Pass and LEGO Pass at no additional cost, along with the existing benefits (Battle Royale Battle Pass, 1,000 V-Bucks, monthly Crew Pack outfits, and the bonus benefits of Crew Pack outfit styles, Rocket League’s Rocket Pass Premium). New Passes like the Fortnite OG Pass will also be added to the Crew Subscription.</p>



<p>Players who cancel their Fortnite Crew subscription can still claim premium rewards from the Battle Pass until the end of their billing cycle, but not for the remainder of the Battle Pass duration. Those who remain actively subscribed will not notice any changes in the system. Additionally, players who purchase the Battle Pass, LEGO Pass, or Music Pass separately from Fortnite Crew will still have the opportunity to unlock and claim premium rewards.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>One year after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-bringing-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-to-mobile-devices-next-month/1100-6519544/" data-ref-id="1100-6519544">Netflix brought Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy</a> to its growing mobile-gaming library, two of those games are set to leave the service. Netflix has warned users that they will only have until December 13 to play Grand Theft Auto 3 - The Definitive Edition and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - The Definitive Edition.</p><p>While GTA 3 and Vice City are both set to leave the service, it seems like San Andreas is staying on Netflix for a while longer, with the game not displaying the same "Leaving Soon" card as the other two. According to <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/leaving-soon/grand-theft-auto-iii-and-vice-city-leaving-netflix-games-in-december-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">What's On Netflix</a>, the GTA games were some of the most downloaded in Netflix's library, with San Andreas easily the most popular of the three.</p><p>The GTA Trilogy's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-3-vice-city-and-san-andreas-now-available-free-through-netflix/1100-6519956/" data-ref-id="1100-6519956">exclusive Netflix mobile release</a> was based on Grove Street Games' remasters for console and PC, but included a number of extra quality-of-life improvements, including a popular "Classic Lighting" mode. Their removal from Netflix comes just after the console and PC remasters received a major update, which added the Classic Lighting mode and other improvements from the mobile editions.</p><p>Netflix subscribers who want to continue playing the mobile versions of GTA 3 and Vice City after December 13 will have to purchase the games outright from the Google Play Store or iOS App Store.</p><p>While movie and TV titles cycle on and off Netflix all the time, this is the first major removal for Netflix's game catalogue, and suggests that not all the titles in the gaming library are there to stay. "Just like with series and film, games will be removed from Netflix as licenses expire," a Netflix representative confirmed. "Players will notice a 'Leaving Soon' badge and be notified by the app itself well in advance of removal."</p>

The ranked competition will reward exclusive cosmetic items to those who reach certain milestones, including an exclusive champion skin that will be awarded only to the player who comes out on top at the end of the season.</p><p>Separate to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-season-1-rank-reset-explained/1100-6527765/" data-ref-id="1100-6527765">Black Ops 6's Prestige ranks</a>, Ranked Play is designed for the most dedicated players who want to play multiplayer matches with the same settings, maps, modes, and weapon restrictions as COD's official esports league. In order to qualify for Ranked Play, players first have to log 50 wins in match-made multiplayer games to unlock access to the ultra-competitive mode. All wins logged since the game was released count towards this, even if the games were played before the start of Season 1.</p><p>Ranked Play has changed a little from previous COD titles, with the ranking system being simplified. In Black Ops 6, players will work through eight ranks: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson, Iridescent, and Top 250. Progress through the ranks can be made by earning Skill Rating (SR), which can also be lost by losing a match.</p><p>The rewards on offer for Ranked players include a number of Ranked Skins for the Competitor operator, which are unlocked starting at Gold rank. These skins will be unlocked as soon as you achieve a new rank, rather than being rewarded at the end of the season--with the exception of the Top 250 and overall Champion skins. The peak reward, which is set to be one of the most exclusive skins in Black Ops 6, is the Champion skin, resembling a flaming, crowned, skull-headed operator.</p><p>Other rewards can be unlocked by reaching certain milestones in Ranked Play, and include the Ranked Competitor Skin, Knife Blueprint, a Frag Grenade Skin, a win-tracking Gunscreen, and more. Each season will also come with its own set of unique seasonal rewards that will only be available to earn during that season.</p><p>Cross-play is mandatory for Ranked Play, meaning console players have the potential to be matched against PC players in all matches. This decision hasn't been popular with fans, with many requesting the option to disable cross-play for the hyper-competitive mode.</p><p>If you're looking at getting competitive in Black Ops 6, check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-mp-weapon-loadouts/2900-5960/" data-ref-id="2900-5960">best MP weapon loadouts</a> for Season 1.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-is-now-selling-digital-shoes-for-your-character-skin-with-nike-air-jordans-costing-around-7</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-is-now-selling-digital-shoes-for-your-character-skin-with-nike-air-jordans-costing-around-%C2%A37.1041639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-is-now-selling-digital-shoes-for-your-character-skin-with-nike-air-jordans-costing-around-7<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has a new type of cosmetic option for its characters - Kicks - which are, in a nutshell, shoes. 
</p>
<p>
The first pair of Kicks has been viewable within Fortnite since the start of its current Chapter 2 Remix season - a pair of Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG 'Black Toe Reimagined' trainers, which you can unlock as part of the current battle pass. 
</p>
<p>
As of today, however, Kicks are now equippable by (many, though not all) Fortnite character skins. A range of other shoes - sorry, Kicks - are also available to buy. 
</p>
<p>
Starting today, you can buy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nike Cortez Leather OG - 800 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Nike Air Foamposite One 'Galaxy' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Nike Shox R4 'Comet Red' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Chomp Stompers - 600 V-Bucks</li>
</ul>

<p>
And from tomorrow, you can buy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Air Jordan 3 Retro 'Palomino'- 800 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 3 'Black Cement-Gray' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 11 'Black/Gym Red' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 4 Retro 'Manila' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
</ul>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>I really like the Chomp Stompers - those shark slippers which only cost 600 V-Bucks (around £3-ish?) As a Fortnite-original design, these are cheaper than the other options. There's no way I'm paying 1000 V-Bucks - the price of a battle pass - for anything else.</p>
<p>
Fortnite maker Epic Games says Kicks are currently compatible with over 500 Fortnite skins, with 95 percent of the game's skin library set to be compatible by the spring of next year. 
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-permanent-og-mode-will-have-its-own-battle-pass">Fortnite revealed a shake-up to its battle pass system</a> and the introduction of another separate battle pass for its upcoming, permanent edition of the game's original map: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">Fortnite OG</a>.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/please-square-enix-five-games-that-need-the-hd-2d-treatment/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/please-square-enix-%E2%80%93-five-games-that-need-the-hd-2d-treatment.1041612/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/please-square-enix-five-games-that-need-the-hd-2d-treatment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We shouldn’t be surprised to discover that a good game from the past is still a good game today, but with the huge success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, there’s further proof of concept that the corporate heads over at Squeenix will be paying attention to. While we’ve seen wonderful remakes of games like Star Ocean and Live A Live in the past couple of years, there’s still plenty of grist to this digital mill, so, we’ve had a good think, and come up with five other games that are begging for the HD-2D treatment.</p>
<h2>Final Fantasy VI</h2>
<p>With the producer of Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake saying that he’d love to do this one next, it feels as though this is a thing waiting to happen. Final Fantasy VI is one of the most important releases in the franchise, its release on the SNES paving the way for many gamer’s induction into the series’ fandom, and putting in place some of the series most iconic characters, including the villainous Kefka,</p>



<p>VI was the last Final Fantasy to use a pixel art-style, but it benefits from the improvement in mechanics and storytelling over its predecessors. Sure, we’ve just had the pixel remasters to help preserve this in its original form, but surely this will be the next HD-2D game.</p>
<h2>Final Fantasy Tactics</h2>
<p>Given that Square Enix ‘own’ the idea of the HD-2D remake, it makes sense to plough the Final Fantasy furrow further, and where better to take it than with Final Fantasy Tactics? In a sense, we’ve seen something of what it could look like in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/04/triangle-strategy-review-nintendo-switch/">Triangle Strategy</a>, but Final Fantasy Tactics has sat weirdly dormant amongst the catalogue despite being one of the most iconic and important releases in the Final Fantasy canon.</p>


<p>This strategy game’s in-depth job system, amazing tactical gameplay and memorable characters should surely set it out for a remake or remaster, and HD-2D seems like the perfect way to do that. There are already <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1de4kcu/the_recent_midori_leak_about_visions_of_mana/l8aa74v/">reports and rumours of a remake in the works</a>…</p>
<h2>Chrono Trigger</h2>
<p>Chrono Trigger was the first release in the Chrono series, and though it’s lain mostly dormant since the late 90s, Square Enix have rolled out steady re-releases of this game – heck, I can play it on my Apple TV. Its continued to garner interest because it remains an incredible JRPG, and features the work of a dream team of iconic Japanese creators, Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of the Final Fantasy series, Yuji Horii, creator of the Dragon Quest series and Akira Toriyama, character designer for Dragon Quest and author of both Dragon Ball and Sand Land. Add to that Takashi Tokita, Kazuhiko Aoki and Masato Kato, and this game’s development team was absolutely stacked.</p>

<p>It’s a literal powerhouse of a design team, and Chrono Trigger bears the hallmarks of all their input, with fantastic storytelling, enjoyable gameplay mechanics, and instantly recognisable characters. Much like Final Fantasy Tactics, it’s a series that’s mostly lain dormant, and is thoroughly ready for a return to our screens, not least because Live A Live had the HD-2D treatment a couple years ago.</p>
<h2>Xenogears</h2>
<p>This would be the pinnacle of HD-2D remakes, at least for me, as the foundation stone in the Xenosaga and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/27/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-review-future-connected-switch/">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> series. Originally released in 1998 on PlayStation, it’s strange that its never been returned to as it sits well within the canon of Square’s JRPG heyday.</p>

<p>There’s Active Time Battles, mecha suits, a storyline that draws on both Star Wars and the Bible, and an amazing soundtrack from Yasunori Mitsuda, and its just an incredible piece of RPG history. The fact that it already mixes 2D and 3D visuals means that, structurally at least, it would need less reworking than some of the other suggestions in this list.</p>
<p>It never reached Europe, so that lack of localisation is rumoured to play a major part in why it hasn’t returned. Surely though, the time is now, particularly with the Xenoblade Chronicles series riding high, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-removes-one-more-reason-to-keep-your-wii-u-in-march/">Chronicles X finding its way to the Nintendo Switch in 2025</a>.</p>
<h2>The Legend of Zelda</h2>
<p>OK, we’re breaking out of Square Enix land for this one, but Nintendo has been one of their most reliable partners, the Switch exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/octopath-traveler-review/">Octopath Traveler</a> founding the HD-2D style. Nintendo has traditionally been incredibly protective of their IP, but they’re less averse to partnering with other developers these days, and Square were the founding partners for Super Mario RPG and everything that came since. Sure, they went on a break over some CDs, but that’s ancient history now.</p>

<p>Alongside many other games on this list, The original The Legend of Zelda has been re-released across multiple generations of console, but it’s never been remade or remastered. Now, that could be because Nintendo feels its showing its age as a game, or that they just couldn’t settle on the right way to bring it back up to date. They could give it to Grezzo for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening</a> treatment, but Square Enix’s HD-2D style feels like it would be a perfect match for the earliest Legend of Zelda game and its 8-bit visuals, and it could form an ideal window into the history of the series, while bringing it bang up-to-date.</p>
<h2>Anything from the Squeenix back catalogue</h2>
<p>Square Enix are always looking for an angle – &nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/03/square-enix-confirm-multiple-block-chain-games-in-development-rather-quieter-on-nfts/">like their whole NFT and blockchain nonsense</a> – but while remakes are the safe best, the hip and cool thing these days is actually the demake. Who’s to say that Square Enix couldn’t down-rez some of their more modern games and franchises?</p>

<p>As daft as this might sound, I do actually quite fancy blowing things up with a pixelated Rico Rodriguez in Just Cause HD-2D or some hack and slash pixelated action in Drakengard HD-2D? And while they might have sold off Crystal Dynamics, they kept a hold of their most important game series in the divorce. What about an HD-2D reworking of Gex after next year’s 3D re-release?!&nbsp;OK, maybe that’s a step too far. I should stop now before we revive the <a href="https://kaneandlynch.fandom.com/wiki/Kane_%26_Lynch:_Dead_Men_(Mobile)">Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men mobile game</a>…</p>
<p>What other games would you like to see get the HD-2D treatment?</p>

<p>Fortnite leakers have revealed that a Juice WRLD update has been confirmed for tomorrow. A lot of the content expected in this update has also leaked beforehand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reliable Fortnite leakers <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1859354951140421781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a> and <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1859293173249364194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a> have provided players with several details about the Juice WRLD update. We now know that Juice WRLD is receiving multiple skins, a POI, a weapon, emotes and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting with the skins, Juice WRLD will seemingly have <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1859311479234896116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">two skins</a> in Fortnite; one of them will be a cell-shaded version and will be free for all players to claim. Regarding the new POI, Juice WRLD will have an <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1859529420693713347" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in-game tribute</a> where players can spot the late artist next to the battle royale map.

The other <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1859354951140421781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">two emotes</a> haven’t been revealed, but we know one will be with Eminem, and the other will feature Juice WRLD’s unreleased music.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Creators and consumers are tangling with the use of generative AI in everything from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ms-flight-sim-24-dev-on-why-the-game-needed-to-use-machine-learning-and-ai/1100-6527889/" data-ref-id="1100-6527889">games</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-ai-made-secret-invasion-opening-prompts-response-from-studio-after-backlash/1100-6515426/" data-ref-id="1100-6515426">TV-show opening sequences</a>, and the sentiment on AI seems to be shifting. To help consumers make decisions about which games to buy, game storefront Itch.io now requires all creators to disclose the use of generative AI in games, Itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran announced in a <a href="https://itch.io/t/4309690/generative-ai-disclosure-tagging" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post to the site</a>.</p><p>The text of the post itself is fairly straightforward, directed primarily at the creators who will have to disclose this information.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4403080-ai-generated-itch.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403080" data-ratio="0.47015610651974" data-width="1089" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4403080-ai-generated-itch.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403080"></a><figcaption>Itch.io's generative-AI disclosure</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4403080-ai-generated-itch.png"></figure><p>"We’ve deployed a new field to project edit pages called 'Generative AI disclosure.' This field asks if your project contains the results of generative AI. If you select yes, then we also ask what kinds of generative AI you utilize, including Graphics, Sound, Text &amp; Dialog, and Code," Corcoran wrote. Selecting Yes will give your project an "AI Generated" tag, while selecting No will give it a "No AI" tag.</p><p>Importantly, though, Corcoran notes that "Assets comprised of generative AI (even if modified afterwards) that are not tagged will no longer be eligible for indexing on [Itch.io's] browse pages." The project won't be removed, but will not show up when browsing, and must be discovered through search or a direct link.</p><p>Corcoran is careful not to make a moral judgment of the use of AI, and Itch.io's Content Creator Quality Guidelines state that "we are strictly enforcing disclosure for all game asset pages due to legal ambiguity around rights associated with Generative AI content."</p><p>As Itch takes this measure, many game developers and publishers are moving to clarify their stances on the technology, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-clarifies-its-stance-on-using-ai-in-games/1100-6527867/" data-ref-id="1100-6527867">Remedy</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ms-flight-sim-24-dev-on-why-the-game-needed-to-use-machine-learning-and-ai/1100-6527889/" data-ref-id="1100-6527889">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-executive-promotes-ai-game-development-shortly-after-huge-layoffs/1100-6527567/" data-ref-id="1100-6527567">Netflix</a>, and others.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse revealed that the game's average daily peak concurrents are up by a not-to-be-sniffed-at three percent this year over last year, when Baldur's Gate 3 launched.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, its average daily active users are up by a more substantial 20 percent over last year. "If you zoom out on our sales chart it looks like the heartbeat of a happy little guy," Douse wrote on social media platform X.</p>

<p>These increases, Douse has implied, are thanks to mods (they are "very good", in his words).</p>
<p>Back in October, Larian celebrated 50m mod downloads since it released Patch 7 (which<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings"> introduced mod-support to the fantasy role playing game</a>). At this same time, the developer said 10k of those mod downloads were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-modders-really-want-to-change-withers-name-to-bone-daddy">players changing Baldur's Gate 3's mysterious Undead entity Withers' name to Bone Daddy</a><em>.</em></p>

<p>In June, Larian head Swen Vincke stated Baldur's Gate 3's official mod support would be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">handover moment to players</a>, though the studio will continue to provide updates afterwards.</p>
<p>As for what's next, Larian previously confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-initially-started-work-on-a-follow-up-as-it-was-the-obvious-thing">Balder's Gate 4 was briefly toyed with</a> before the studio decided to try something new instead. The developer is yet to formally reveal its next project, it has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Manchester will get a Pac-Man Live Experience where contestants run around a virtual maze under the watchful eye of the "Pac-Master", a "lively gameshow host". 
</p>
<p>
Set to open at Manchester's Arcade Arena on 22nd March 2025, the offering is described by its creators as a "multi-sensory adventure, seamlessly blending the real world with augmented reality". It's being put together by Little Lion Entertainment, which previously worked on live experiences for The Crystal Maze Live Experience and Tomb Raider.
</p>
<p>
Images show contestants making their way around a maze projected onto the floor, while the series' classic ghosts patrol around them.

"Using a combination of cutting-edge wearable technology, projection mapping and augmented reality, you will be transported into the world of Pac-Man," the event's website promises. "No headsets needed!"
</p>
<p>
Tickets are available now, in 30-minute slots, at Early Bird pricing. Adult tickets are £25. Child tickets are also £25. There's no word yet on how much the experience will cost once Early Bird pricing ends.
</p>
<p>
The experience is played in teams of eight, with two mazes operating concurrently. The full experience lasts 50 minutes, of which you should expect to spend around 30 minutes playing (though presumably less if the ghosts catch you).

<a href="https://www.pacmanlive.co.uk/">Pac-Man Live Experience's website</a> warns this is a "physical activity", and players are "likely to get warm". 
</p>
<p>
"This is an active experience where you'll be moving, dashing and chomping your way to victory," it states. "It's normal to work up a sweat during your adventure, so come prepared."
</p>
<p>
The website's FAQ notes that drinking alcohol is allowed before playing but that anyone deemed too intoxicated would be refused entry "as this is an active, physical experience that requires coordination and awareness for your safety".
</p>
<p>
Fancy dress is permitted, however, "as long as it does not restrict your movement or ability to wear the PAC-Vest".
</p>
<p>
Here's hoping this offering is fun on a level of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-londons-star-trek-inspired-bridge-command-an-interactive-gaming-experience-powered-by-smart-tech-and-role-playing">Star Trek-inspired Bridge Command live experience</a> in London that Jim and I recently visited, and less like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/glasgows-infamous-willy-wonka-experience-lives-on-through-the-sims-4">Glasgow's Willy Wonka experience</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-not-good-4k/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler still has a long way to go to match NVIDIA DLSS and even AMD FSR 2 in some scenarios, especially in games with low internal resolution like Alan Wake 2, which don't make the upscaler a good fit for 4K resolution in its current state.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared</a> Alan Wake 2 running on PlayStation 5 Pro in Performance Mode using PSSR and on PC using NVIDIA DLSS at the ultra performance setting and the same internal resolution - 864p. Generally, with PSSR, the image doesn't exactly look like 4K resolution as PSSR fails to bring very small detail to the image, unlike DLSS, which does a much better job at the same internal resolution and the same settings. In addition, the image on PS5 Pro looks very soft and unstable, with visible noise and shimmering even with a static image, which makes it even worse than AMD FSR 2 in this particular scenario.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler also leaves something to be desired compared to both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR 2 with effects like SSAO, SSR, and volumetrics, as seen in the fog example where it is clearly shimmering with PSSR. As such, the upscaler in its current state is not only inferior to NVIDIA DLSS, but only manages to trade blows with AMD FSR 2, looking better in motion but not as much in other scenarios. Still, looking at what NVIDIA achieved with DLSS since its release, the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution should definitely become much better in the future, as a developer suggested <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">earlier this week.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2: PSSR vs DLSS at Matched 864p Base Resolution" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oxPgok_ZRAs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Digital Foundry also examined the new Alan Wake 2 ray tracing features created specifically for the PlayStation 5 Pro version, comparing them to the low RT setting in the PC version, which lacks equivalent settings. Unsurprisingly, the console effects are considerably worse than those on PC, so there's still a long way to go to have a proper ray-traced experience on a console.</p>

            <p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl released yesterday, and has since seen a strong number of players jumping into The Zone over on Steam.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, its all-time player peak on Valve's platform is 113,587. Meanwhile, it has 71,497 players making their way through the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone at this very moment in time.</p>
<p>These numbers are perhaps not too surprising, given Stalker 2 was one of Steam's most wishlisted titles up until its debut. However, even with a strong wishlist, reviews of the game have pointed out that it has been released with a number of glaring technical issues. These issues are one of the reasons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Eurogamer's own Stalker 2 review isn't on the site just yet</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">Stalker 2 team addressed these issues and acknowledged the game "may" have some "rough edges"</a> now that it is out. The studio has assured its players it will address any niggles that arise in the game, as and when it is able.</p><p>Many users have been forgiving of these issues, however, given the road developer GSC has had to take to get Stalker 2 released at all. Since 2022, GSC has delayed Stalker 2 several times due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-on-hold-ukraine-based-developer-confirms">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>. This has seen the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-developer-reportedly-moving-to-prague-to-finish-game">relocate staff</a> to safely finish the project elsewhere, while others <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-harrowing-update-from-gsc-game-world-the-stalker-2-developer-based-in-ukraine">joined Ukraine's armed forces</a>, and dealt with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-says-russian-hackers-have-leaked-test-build-online-asks-fans-not-to-share">Russian hackers who leaked test builds</a>.</p>
<p>Stalker 2 currency sits with a 'Very Positive' review average on Steam. "Stalker 2 is nothing short of a miracle," reads one user review.</p>

Dragon Age: The Veilguard has launched to "solid" sales in the UK, though has numbers of "nearly 21 percent lower" than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>: Rebirth across Europe. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to European sales data analysed by Eurogamer sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-video-game-sales-jumped-12-in-october-on-the-back-of-blockbuster-launches-european-monthly-charts">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, which noted that Dragon Age: The Veilguard had been the continent's seventh biggest launch of October, after arriving on the 31st.
</p>
<p>
Over on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-off-to-solid-start-on-steam">Dragon Age: The Veilguard launched to a peak of 70,414 players</a>, setting a new record for a single-player game published by EA, previously held by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>. It's all-time peak is now 89,418, with around 23,000 people playing in the last 24 hours.

<p>
Steam reviews, which require users to own and have played the game, sit with a Mostly Positive rating. But on Metacritic, The Veilguard still sits with Generally Unfavourable rating, in contrast to its average score by critics. 
</p>
<p>
In a statement to Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metacritic-responds-after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-review-bombing">acknowledging the backlash to Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> on its site, a spokesperson for Metacritic parent company Fandom said its site was a "place of belonging for all fans".

"We take online trust and safety very seriously across all our sites including Metacritic," the spokesperson said. "Metacritic has a moderation system in place to track violations of our terms of use. Our team reviews each and every report of abuse (including but not limited to racist, sexist, homophobic, insults to other users, etc) and if violations occur, the reviews are removed."

            <p>The publishing rights to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> have transferred from Ys Net to ININ Games, sparking hope of a future multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Ys Net was founded by former Sega developer and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> creator Yu Suzuki, initially to produce Shenmue 3. At release, the game was exclusive to PS4 and the Epic Games Store (for its first year). Even now, the game is only available on PS4 and PC (Epic and Steam).</p>
<p>Enter ININ Games, then, a German publisher focused on remakes and re-releases of Japanese games.</p>

<p>In fact, ININ Games published the console and PC versions of Suzuki's most recent game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/air-twister-review-yu-suzukis-space-harrier-successor-is-a-compelling-curio-rather-than-a-classic">arcade shooter Air Twister</a>, originally released exclusively on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>This new publishing deal has therefore raised hope among Shenmue fans it could be released on other platforms, Xbox and Switch specifically.</p>
<p>Indeed, a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E8u6GL-k0QVeUeDzSSJ2RHZrgtKOvtqu/view">press release</a> states ININ Games is "excited to shepherd Shenmue 3 into its next phase" and the two companies will "honour the series' legacy while ensuring its accessibility to even more fans around the world".</p>
<p>Presumably, that includes its availability on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>ININ's releases include the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wonder-boy-asha-in-monster-world">Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/space-invaders">Space Invaders</a> Forever, the Taito Milestones series, and Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn.</p>
<p>Shenmue 3 received a mixed response on its release, though our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-review-a-faithful-follow-up-to-an-all-time-classic">Eurogamer review</a> was certainly positive. "Yes, Shenmue 3 can look and play like a Dreamcast game," it reads. "But it looks and plays like a Dreamcast game that's as off-kilter, maddening, magical and majestic as the Shenmue and its sequel, both all-time classics. I think there's good reason to rejoice in that."</p>
<p>Fans, meanwhile, are eager for a fourth game to continue the Shenmue story. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-fans-rent-times-square-billboard-campaigning-for-fourth-game">one group of fans even rented billboards in Times Square</a> as part of their campaign.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> team has apologised to its community for the game's less than perfect debut, admitting "this is not the launch experience we want for our players".</p>
<p>Among other niggles, developer Asobo recently admitted it vastly underestimated how many of us would be looking to take to the skies in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 at launch. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuMd7udCyFM">YouTube</a> video, the developer said player numbers had "overwhelmed [its] infrastructure". This was obviously not missed by prospective pilots.</p>
<p>The team is now doing what it can to combat this particular issue, and has increased its server capacity (it has not, at this time, said by how much). Some ongoing issues still remain, however, and our own Matt Wales has just informed me the game is still barely playable for him.</p>

<p>"This is not the launch experience we want for our players and want to apologise to the community," the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 team wrote in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2537590/discussions/12/4626980689722555684/">Steam update</a>. "We will continue to work around the clock with our partners and will provide updates until the issues are resolved."</p><p>As Matt reported earlier this week, Asobo's latest iteration of Flight Simulator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-struggles-to-get-off-the-ground-as-players-battle-launch-day-server-woes">got off to a shaky start</a>, with launch day - in an almost exact repeat of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020</a>'s release - seeing players experience stalled downloads, lengthy queues, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gvkhry/msfs_2024_is_awesome/?rdt=64509">a number of in-game glitches</a>. The developer went on to blame the game's launch woes on "the server responsible for handling data requests [getting] overloaded, causing delays and errors".</p>

That dwarfs the Steam peak concurrent player count of all the other S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, including 2007’s S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 also launched on Xbox Series X and S and straight into Game Pass, so its combined peak concurrent player count will be much larger than what we’ve seen on Steam (Microsoft does not make its player numbers public). The expectation is that its player count will continue to grow as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 heads into its first weekend on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also has a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam, despite suffering from various bugs detailed in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">IGN’s S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl Review in Progress</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC Game World has told fans it plans to address these bugs with a series of patches. “S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is a massive game,” the developer said. “We understand that in such a game, there may still be rough edges: we literally haven't released anything of this scale before. We’re absolutely committed to being here, monitoring your feedback, and quickly fixing any issues that need our attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the first days after release, we’ll be working with hotfixes, rolling them out as precisely as possible, but as frequently as we can. Then, we’ll switch to larger updates that include constant improvements.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Free in-game content is also coming to the game. Expect more on that when GSC Game World shares its roadmap later in December. “We have big plans for the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. universe,” the developer added. “In a way, today is both a return and the beginning of a grand new journey.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help you survive in the Zone, we've got a list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Essential Stalker 2 Tips and Tricks</a>, plus a guide on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_to_Do_First_in_Stalker_2">Things to Do First in Stalker 2</a> to help you through the early game, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_Stalker_2_Doesn%27t_Tell_You">Things Stalker 2 Doesn't Tell You</a> - everything we wish we knew before we started playing.

GSC Game World said at the time that the extra two months would give the developers the chance to fix "unexpected anomalies," aka bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC Game World has also been vocal about the challenges the studio faced getting S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 up to scratch after a mixed reaction to its debut public showing last year. At gamescom 2023, GSC Game World addressed what some had called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-devs-discuss-imperfect-gamescom-2023-demo-address-downgrade-debate"><u>a “downgrade” sparked by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s then latest gameplay trailer</u></a>.

            <p>It's been a year of change for UK high street stalwart GAME, with impacts felt by the chain's loyal customers and long-term staff alike.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">Eurogamer broke the news that the brand would end its long-running trade-in scheme</a> and the sale of pre-owned games, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-discovered-zero-hours-contracts-move-via-mass-microsoft-teams-calls">some staff were moved onto new zero-hour contracts</a>. This summer, we reported on a flurry of further changes, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">the closure of GAME's membership programme</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-to-end-in-store-pre-orders">ending of in-store pre-orders for new releases</a>, as GAME's technical systems were "upgraded" to those of its parent company, Frasers Group.</p>
<p>This autumn, further effects of that change became apparent, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-acknowledges-website-issues-as-customers-await-missing-pre-orders">GAME customers struggled with online pre-orders</a> and faced confusion over deliveries - most notably including the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> Steelbook. And throughout this year, dozens more GAME shops have closed on the high street, replaced by concessions in other stores such as Sports Direct.</p>
<p>As 2024 comes to a close, we've spoken with shop floor staff, managers and those close to GAME's head office for more detail on where the company is currently, and an explanation for why the issues customers have faced over the past few months have been so persistent. All wished to remain anonymous for the sake of their careers.</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted Frasers Group for comment on this report, as it has done with its reporting previously, but once again did not receive a response.</p>
<h2>"We have lost 78 percent of GAME head office staff"</h2>
<p>"When Frasers Group took over GAME, they had their own departments that deal with marketing and logistics making sure stuff goes out on time," someone with knowledge of GAME's head office told me. "But then Frasers Group sat down and said 'why do we need two of everything?'"</p><p>This year has seen layoffs and redundancies across the chain, from shop staff who have been moved to zero hours contracts or offered work elsewhere - such as in Sports Direct stores. Others have simply been told they are no longer required, including a widespread loss of area managers over the past couple of months, as well as the bulk of GAME's previous head office staff.</p>
<p>"They made area managers redundant, eliminating some very loyal staff members - up to 20 years with the company in some cases," a current employee said. "This means store managers now talk to and are managed by someone in head office - the same head office which has also had redundancies and been reduced significantly."</p>
<p>"Since the full integration with Fraser group on 1st August we have lost 78 percent of GAME head office staff," another employee said. "It was triple digits and now in the 20s," another person confirmed. "Of course, we are now suffering the effects of that."</p>
<p>On a shopfloor level, staff say Frasers Group sees redundancies as a way to cut GAME's wage bill while simultaneously investing in more staff for Sports Direct - "the brand they really care about, the more profitable business", one staff member told me. Eurogamer is aware of staff who have quit because they did not wish to be moved from a video games specialist store to selling sportswear and trainers, and others who were only offered nominal shifts, such as just three hours on a Saturday, under new zero hours contracts.</p>
<h2>"There's just been stock issues with every new release"</h2>
<p>The loss of head office staff and those experienced in the video games business has affected the delivery of games to stores, multiple staff say. "The Frasers Group ordering and logistics managers are not doing enough to meet release dates," one person said. "They're just ordering stuff whenever." While the launch of Silent Hill 2 made headlines, GAME staff say that, with few exceptions, the majority of game releases are not arriving on time. "There's just been stock issues with every new release," a staff member said. "Anything that hasn't been EA Sports FC or Call of Duty has been late arriving, or not arrived at all. And if we do get it, maybe we get a handful of copies. I've genuinely been sending more people away than serving. We did get a few <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> consoles in, but only half what we were told we would receive."</p><p>"It appears on the surface to all of us that yes, whoever is in the GAME head office now does not understand what a game specialist is," another staff member said. "The last delivery we had at our store, there were no new releases, no games, no accessories - instead we received 136 Zendaya action figures."</p>
<p>Eurogamer recently reported on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-games-bungled-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-orders-too">customers waiting days to receive Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 copies they had pre-ordered</a>, after GAME previously claimed customers would be available to "pick up and play" the game with an added Steelbook on the day of release. In reality, the game's launch brought an update from the chain that it was aware some orders were still "processing", with no word on how long the delay would last.</p>
<p>"My store got five copies of COD, one of the biggest launches of the year," one source said. "How can you make money on five copies? New copies cost a lot and you don't make much, £6-£12 depending on how much they're marked up. If you have someone working eight, 10 hours a day, you have to sell a lot to make their wages.</p>
<p>"I recently saw six or seven people come in within about half an hour to buy a game that came out that day, only to be told GAME didn't have it. 'What do you mean, it came out today, I pre-ordered it?' they'd say. We just have to tell them we don't have it in, and I'm really sorry. All of them left without the stuff they'd already paid for, on the day of the release. And you know how people who play video games are. We're compulsive buyers. The number of people who are then like 'well cancel my pre-order, I'll buy it from Smyths'. And then they don't come in ever again."</p>
<h2>"Honestly at this point we would not be surprised"</h2>
<p>The Call of Duty snafu came just weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-pre-order-customers-left-in-limbo-as-metaphor-and-silent-hill-2-launches-loom">GAME shipped Silent Hill 2 copies late</a> and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-game-pre-order-customers-receive-copies-but-for-wrong-edition">left customers without the game's accompanying Steelbook</a>, which the chain simply said had been delayed, with no apology or further reason given. Eurogamer asked GAME staff what had happened there, and heard a persistent rumour that the person now ordering the chain's stock had been unaware of how to process it properly. </p><p>"When you have Steelbook editions, you order 50 copies of the game. You also order 50 Steelbooks," a person close to GAME's head office said. "I was told the person at Frasers Group who is now in charge for ordering stock for GAME simply didn't click that they wanted the Steelbook too. They just ordered 40k copies of the game but didn't select the Steelbook. It was only when area managers - some that were still there - said 'you just haven't ordered it' [that Frasers Group realised]. And at first they were like 'what do you mean, I have ordered it'. And they said 'no, for special editions you have to order it under special offers'."</p>
<p>"The Silent Hill 2 Steelbook we have heard several different excuses for," another GAME staff member told me. "The one that comes up the most is since the switch over to Fraser Group systems, all pre-order information was lost into the ether on pre-orders made before 1st August. So information on which stores needed allocations was gone. Then they randomly sent more than required to certain stores and some stores like ours who had pre-orders received none. Another store in my area only had 10 pre-orders but received 37 Steelbooks. So all available Steelbooks ended up at a select few stores."</p>
<p>"There are internal rumours," said a third staff member, "honestly at this point we would not be surprised if it were the truth."</p>
<h2>"Frasers Group doesn't know what to send out, where to send it to"</h2>
<p>Eurogamer has repeatedly heard of issues behind the scenes since GAME moved over to Frasers Group systems this summer, and indeed this is the reason behind many of the chain's various schemes, such as GAME Rewards and GAME Wallet, no longer being supported.</p><p>"They don't even have the sales data," one person close to head office said, "because all of the point of sale and stock managing systems have been ripped apart and converted over to the Frasers Group, or the people who knew this stuff are being made redundant. Frasers Group has no background in games, they have no affinity, no passion for it.  They can't look back at 10-15 years of sales history because it's been deleted.</p>
<p>"My local store, they haven't had Switch Pro controllers in for months," they continued. "Personally I got mine from CEX, saved £20. But some people want them from GAME and they're not being sent. There are warehouses up and down the country filled to the brim with stock because the Frasers Group doesn't know what to send out, where to send it to."</p>
<p>Staff say they don't believe anything will change until Frasers Group acknowledges GAME's current issues - and that this doesn't seem likely, as the company's focus on cutting costs and staff continues. Some even believe the only explanation for the changes is a form of self-sabotage, they told me.</p>
<p>"The general feeling amongst staff has been that the poor decisions, the firing of almost all the knowledgeable staff and now the low stock with absolutely zero communication of the issues from head office can only be a deliberate, calculated attempt to run the company into the ground," one employee said. "If it's not deliberate, it's total incompetence or desperate cost-saving measures that will only be detrimental to profits in the long run."</p>
<p>"I don't think they know they're doing a bad job," another said. "They think they're saving loads of money, still doing well, customers are still coming back. Well, they're not listening to anyone."</p>

            <p>Valve has updated its Steam policy on Season Passes, warning developers if they're not "ready to clearly communicate" about DLC content they "shouldn't offer a Season Pass on Steam".</p>
<p>Now, when a Season Pass is made available on Steam, developers must adhere to <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/seasonpass">new guidelines</a> which include providing a complete list of DLC in the pass, a basic description of its content, and expected release date.</p>
<p>Further, a Season Pass must include at least one released DLC when available for purchase (though Season Passes included in pre-purchasing a deluxe edition are exempt).</p>

<p>"By offering a Season Pass, you are promising future content," Valve's new guidelines read. "In the process of launching a Season Pass you will be asked to commit to a launch timing for each content release in the Season Pass. That launch timing is a commitment to both customers and Steam.</p>
<p>"If you aren't ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC AND when each DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn't offer a Season Pass on Steam."</p>
<p>Valve does acknowledge development can go awry and release dates aren't always met. As such, it will allow developers to self-reschedule the release date once during a Season Pass, though the new date must be within three months of the original scheduled date.</p>
<p>Further - and importantly for users - if a specific DLC in a Season Pass is cancelled, customers will be offered a refund for the value of the unreleased DLC.</p>
<p>"Under the Steam Distribution Agreement you have provided a warranty to Valve that your DLC will conform in all respects to the descriptions provided to customers, including promised release dates," the guidelines read.</p>
<p>"Even if there has not yet been a customer complaint, Valve may take action if you delay a DLC more than a quarter (three months) beyond the release window you originally promised."</p>
<p>That action may include removing the Season Pass from sale, refunding customers the value of DLC, or allowing customers to refund the entire Season Pass.</p>
<p>Valve last week announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-announces-limited-edition-white-steam-deck-oled">white version of its Steam Deck OLED handheld</a>, which is now available to purchase.</p>

            <p><strong>This story discusses the ending of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.</strong><em></em></p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi has said he deliberately intended for the game's ending - the fate of Aerith - to cause debate and keep players guessing until the trilogy's forthcoming conclusion.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Hamaguchi discussed fan reaction to the game's divisive ending and how he wanted to avoid fan service with its development.</p>
<p>"There was a danger there, there was definitely a trap," he said with regards to Aerith's fate. "With the original game, I was just a fan. I played the game when I was younger, and I've got my perspective on that scene as just a single fan. I felt if I made a decision - it has to go in this direction, we have to do it this way - that would very much make it a fan-driven thing. Maybe make it more like fan service. I kind of want to avoid doing that."</p>

<p>As a result, Hamaguchi took a backseat to the original creators - Tetsuya Nomura, Yoshinori Kitase, Kazushige Nojima - and instead shifted his focus to the presentation of their vision.</p>
<p>"Mr Kitase often says this," Hamaguchi continued, "that he really wanted to create that kind of debate and speculation after the game and moving through to the third game, that people keep talking about it up until they do see the final conclusion. In that sense I think we probably have achieved exactly what he wanted to do there and I'm very satisfied with that, because people are still talking about it."</p>
<p>Hamaguchi acknowledged a mixed reaction to the game's ending, but admitted "that's kind of the way we wanted it to go" to ensure discussion continued until the third game in the trilogy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aeriths-fate-in-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-the-trouble-with-remakes">controversial ending</a> is part of a continuous guessing game for players familiar with the original, though Hamaguchi remained tight-lipped on what will be changed in the third game.</p>
<p>"The important thing is that the player will wonder whether it's going to change or not," he said. "So if it was all exactly as it was in the original storyline, you'd know exactly what was coming: there'd be no anticipation, there'd be no excitement. For people who played the game, they'd know exactly what's coming next. It wouldn't really be a fun experience. It might be nostalgic, but it wouldn't be a fun experience."</p>

<p>Hamaguchi notes the ending of Remake with the characters breaking the barriers of fate, the inclusion of the whispers, and Zack's alternate timeline in Rebirth as key moments to keep players wondering.</p>
<p>"The real purpose of these elements is to indicate to the player, this is where the story might change," he said. "It doesn't mean it <em>will</em> change, this is where it <em>could</em> change. You might see something new, you might see something different. And that really does help people to keep engaged with the story and keep having that wonder and that anticipation about what's coming next."</p><p>He continued: "I think that kind of divided opinion is something we were always going to get just because <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, the original game, was such a popular game, it's such a well known game that if we'd have completely left it as it was, not change anything, people wouldn't like that. And if we changed it completely, there'd be another set of people who wouldn't like that at all. So we really have to try and find a balance, I think, to try and satisfy as many people as possible.</p>
<p>"I really do want to continue with that level of fans looking at us [and asking] so how's it going to change? What's the ultimate conclusion of this story going to be? Is it going to be the same? Is it going to change? And to keep that level of excitement and anticipation up for the third game in the series. I think that's the job that we've set for ourselves."</p>
<blockquote>"Is it going to be the same? Is it going to change? And to keep that level of excitement and anticipation up for the third game in the series. I think that's the job that we've set for ourselves."</blockquote>
<p>I had to ask, then, considering the dominance of Aerith's fate to the narrative of Rebirth, is she or Cloud the real protagonist of Final Fantasy 7?</p>
<p>"The way I see it for both Remake and Rebirth is very much the story told from Cloud's perspective," said Hamaguchi. "He is the character you follow, and you see events from his eyes and perspective really. The game design for Rebirth, we set very early on in development as a core concept, the idea of the bonds between Cloud and his allies. So you definitely see things from the perspective of, how does this other party member relate to Cloud? How are their bonds becoming strengthened as they journey together, as they experience things together? I can very much say, for the first two games - Rebirth and Remake - up until then, it is all from Cloud's perspective."</p>

<p>Lastly, Hamaguchi said he was "blown away" when he saw Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth running on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> for the first time. Sony's console was released earlier this month and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-on-ps5-pro-delivers-huge-image-quality-improvements-at-60fps">Rebirth is one of a handful of games to receive a significant visual improvement</a>.</p><p>"I think certainly that was one of the problems with using the PS5 base hardware, is that to try and get 60fps output with the same level of graphic fidelity and resolution as you have in the graphics mode was something that was just really, really difficult to achieve," he said.</p>
<p>"But certainly using the PSSR technology within the Pro, that really did allow us to do both at once and achieve both of those goals of the frame rate together with the resolution. I remember when I saw it for the first time, I really was blown away by it."</p>
<p>PlayStation hardware architect Mark Cerny also had a hand in which part of the game was shown at the PS5 Pro reveal. While Hamaguchi and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> development team wanted to show the grasslands region for its open world elements, Cerny had a different opinion. "He said 'no, we really want to see the Gold Saucer'," laughed Hamaguchi. "He really pushed to show the Gold Saucer. So ultimately that's the one we showed."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth leads this year's The Game Award nominations</a>, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, with seven nominations - including for Best Game, as well as Best Game Direction, and Best Narrative.</p>
<p>While it's unknown when the third and final part of the trilogy will be released, series producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-wont-betray-fans-of-the-original-says-series-producer">Kitase stated previously it won't "betray fans of the original"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Alongside displaying the time, day, and date, <a href="https://timestoptech.com/products/d-20-black-resin?variant=45891310125292">the Timestop D-20</a> includes all the dice-rolling features you need to play tabletop roleplaying games directly from your wrist at the push of a button.</p><p>The watch allows the wearer to digitally roll a 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, 20-, or 100-sided dice, alongside “Advanced Combat” features such as rolling up to 12 dice at once, and D20s with advantage or disadvantage (a fancy way of rolling two dice and taking either the higher or lower results). It’ll also display specific icons when a D20 rolls a 1 or a 20 — known as a “critical failure” or “critical success” respectively in D&amp;D.</p><p>“We wanted a fun animation while rolling, but also an overall subdued look so you could ‘take the game with you’ and even wear the watch at the office,” Timestop says in its <a href="https://timestoptech.com/blogs/super-twisted/dungeons-development-of-the-d-20-watch">blog describing the design process</a>. “We included day and date complications with a perpetual calendar so it was still a practical timepiece.”</p><p>Pricing starts at $99 and is available in three colors: <a href="https://timestoptech.com/collections/all">black, orange, and stainless steel</a>. Shipping starts next year, with stock available for delivery in either January or February.&nbsp;</p><p>One feature you won’t find on the Timestop D-20 is an alarm, because alarms “aren’t fun,” according to its creator. Otherwise, it’s water-resistant, features a backlit LCD display, and uses a replaceable coin cell battery that can last up to three years with “typical use.” I’m not sure how many fireball spells would be considered typical, but it certainly offers a more unique way to play than traditional dice or digital dice-rolling apps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
