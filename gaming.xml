Nintendo has finally confirmed that a Nintendo Direct is coming tomorrow, and it's a Partner Showcase.</p>
<p>Kicking things off on <strong>31st July at 6am PST / 9am EST / 2pm BST / 3pm CET</strong>, we'll be treated to 25 minutes of news on third-party games coming to the Switch and Switch 2.</p>

<p>You'll be able to watch the broadcast in all of the usual spots — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/youtube">YouTube</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/7-31-2025/">Nintendo website</a>, and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nintendo">Twitch</a>.</p>
<p>This is the first Nintendo Direct we've had since the Switch 2's launch (not including the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> one), so there should be some exciting news in there!

			<p>Nintendo has announced a Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase for tomorrow, July 31, 2025. It'll be a 25-minute-long presentation of games from Nintendo's publishing partners, so it's unlikely that we'll get announcements like the release date for Metroid Prime 4. But it could be the kind of place where we see the release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>.</p>



<p>That's just speculation, but it's the kind of news to expect instead of any news about Nintendo's first-party titles, as those are the kinds of announcements Nintendo would likely hold for a dedicated 'Nintendo Direct.'</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There have been <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/with-release-news-expected-soon-metroid-prime-4-has-been-rated/">rumors circulating </a>about a Nintendo Direct happening before the end of July, as a follow-up to the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, to let players know what's coming next for the console. Those rumors were seemingly correct, though not about it being a full-fat Nintendo Direct that would include first-party announcements.</p>



<p>Which could, of course, mean indie titles like Silksong and Hades II show up. Though it could also, and potentially even more likely, mean that we see more ports of games that are already available on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series devices that the Nintendo Switch wasn't capable of running, but the Switch 2 can run perfectly well. </p>



<p>Games like Assassin's Creed Shadows, Hi-Fi Rush, Assassin's Creed Mirage, or news of a release date for some of the major ports already announced, like Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Whatever's there, thankfully we won't have long to wait to find out, as the direct will kick off tomorrow morning at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST.</p>

Instead of a new 3D <em>Mario </em>or <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>deep-dive, the Nintendo Direct will focus on third-party games. </p><p>We’ll presumably get release dates for the upcoming ports of<em> Final Fantasy VII Remake </em>and <em>Elden Ring</em>, but hopefully news about new ones as well.

Are we finally getting <em>Sea of Thieves </em>or <em>Diablo IV</em> on Switch 2?</p><p>Some personal predictions for the event include finally getting a release date for <em>Hades 2</em> (a timed-console exclusive for both Switch 1 and 2) and a mention of Call of Duty’s future on Nintendo’s platform, which Microsoft promised to support with the multiplayer military shooter following for the first time in years. <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, one of this year’s best selling coop games and a cross-gen one to boot, also feels like an obvious pickup. </p><p>The mention of the OG Switch suggests players who haven’t upgraded will have some fresh games to look forward to this fall as well. With over 150 million units sold, it wouldn’t be surprising if Nintendo continues to support the older platform for a little while longer. </p><p>At 25 minutes, this won’t be the big Nintendo Direct fans are really waiting for. That’s more likely to come in September. But it should help fill in some of the question marks still outstanding in the Switch 2's first year. And with more powerful specs in tow, this fall could be one of the biggest for a Nintendo console in quite some time.</p><p> If <em>Borderlands 4 </em>can sneak its way onto the handheld hybrid, even at 30fps, who knows what other current-gen games can make the leap. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-elden-ring-ff7-time-date-1851787326]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has announced a Direct, which is set for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Direct will take place on 31st July, at 2pm UK time. It will be roughly 25 minutes long, and include information about games from Nintendo's publishing partners. This will include titles coming to both Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>So, what can we either hope for or expect from tomorrow's broadcast? Well, we could always start prepping our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> Silksong summoning circles once again. It has to show up some time soon… right? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong">Xbox has a playable demo for Silksong at Gamescom this year</a>, but we know that Team Cherry's sought after Metroidvania is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">also primed for both Switch consoles</a>, so it could happen…</p>
<p>Personally, I would also love to hear or see more from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5's Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</a>. This chap was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">announced during a Nintendo Direct back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, we could perhaps hear about a release date for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> on Switch 2. FromSoftware's incredibly successful game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">announced for Switch 2 back in April</a>, though with no date attached to it. The edition coming to Switch 2 will be the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">which includes the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a>, as well as new armour and a new Torrent appearance customisation feature. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-to-include-two-new-classes">Two new classes are also on the way as part of Elden Ring's Tarnished Edition</a>.</p>
<p>We also may hear more from Supergiant Games, which in April announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">Hades 2 would be a timed console exclusive on Switch and Switch 2</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is still in early access on PC, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-one-final-early-access-patch-before-full-10-release">developer is gearing up for its full fat release (hopefully) very soon</a>.</p>
<p>We here at Eurogamer will be watching along to bring you the news as it happens. What do you hope to see during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-direct-announced-for-tomorrow-3]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview.1256985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s fitting that as Summer continues to blaze its way towards Autumn, we’re being treated to another entry in the Story of Seasons franchise. While the influence of early Harvest Moon and Story of Seasons games have been felt through the cosy gaming genre for decades, the farming and relationship-focused series has continued to plough its own furrow. This time, it’s a remaster of the classic DS outing, Harvest Moon: Grand Bazaar, sprucing it up for the modern day, while bringing it to Nintendo’s brand-new Switch 2 platform, with a flurry of exclusive improvements in tow.</p>
<p><iframe title="STORY OF SEASONS: Grand Bazaar – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lI0QZKEdHbk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the series is best known for its farming action, and a plot of farmland remains the foundation of your experience here, this is actually a game about business. Zephyr Town’s success and its populace’s well-being revolve around the Grand Bazaar, and your time, effort and focus have shifted to selling your produce and goods at the titular market.</p>


<p>Here, the Bazaar takes place at the end of every week, and you build your produce and wares accordingly, ready to sell them for the most profit. You’re handed a stall and a bell, and you have to attract people’s attention before making sure they’re served as quickly as possible. It’s not exactly frantic, at least not in this early portion of the game, but it’s a fun and welcome change of pace from the daily tasks you’re normally embroiled in. As you grow and expand your offering, so too does the market around you come back to life, bringing more visitors to the area, and increasing your standing with the local community.</p>
<p>Ready to begin your new life in Zephyr Town, there’s a very limited character creator here, that only really lifts itself into modernity by getting you to choose your birthday and offering you different pronouns. Still, you can unlock new outfits as you progress, and alter your appearance as you see fit, so there’s still fun to be had making the character your own.</p>

<p>You’ll likely want to make them as charming as possible, because relationships are an integral part of Grand Bazaar. Speaking to characters daily – or greeting them with a quick hello – will improve your standing with them, and you can build up a friendship, and even propose marriage, with your digital soulmate.</p>

<p>Special moments will appear on the map from time to time – with a helpful icon to show that they’re available – and these deepen your understanding of that character, learning about their love of cooking or grabbing a good cup of coffee from the cafe. Here in the preview a lot of time was spent talking to Sophie and Freya, both of whom seemed drawn to my hardworking farmer. We’ll see where it goes!</p>
<p>To be honest though, the highlight of the character roster has to be the mayor, Felix. He is uproariously upbeat and driven, wanting you and your farm to bring trade and prosperity back to Zephyr Town. I had to talk with him every day, just to see if I could make him say something brilliant in his booming voice, and he’s already an icon in my eyes. Interactions are definitely lifted by extensive voice acting, whether in whole during cutscenes or in part alongside written dialogue, and the entire town feels alive and real to you as you explore and chat with the locals.</p>
<p>As a remake of a DS game, Grand Bazaar’s art design and visual quality have seen a stratospheric jump. Now fully 3D, Grand Bazaar looks every bit the 2025 cozy farming sim, with an art style that lends it a Pokemon-esque feel, albeit one with a stable framerate. It goes to show just how good a game can look with a clean and charming aesthetic, and it serves to show up how rough the Switch version of the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game-review/">Tales of the Shire</a> looks in comparison.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 edition uses all that extra processing power to pump everything out at a higher resolution, and there’s a sharpness and vibrancy to the visuals that definitely add an extra level of class. Besides that, there’s enhanced frame rates – seemingly taking them up to 60fps – but otherwise this is, to all intents and purposes, the same game you’re getting on the original Switch.</p>

<p>Where the new hardware adds something extra, is in the addition of mouse controls. However, I have to say that I’m pretty disappointed in how they’ve been implemented. I was hoping for a time-saving point and click option for your farming, much like we saw in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-is-an-amazing-experience-on-switch-2-but-its-not-perfect/">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>, but instead this is a tool for menu management more than anything else. I really hope that someone rethinks this, because it would massively improve players’ quality of life. All it has to do is make farming easier – hopefully that’s not too much to ask.</p>
<p>Grand Bazaar’s positioning as a remake, rather than an all-new entry in the series, is an interesting choice. In terms of quality, the original game sits somewhere in the middle of the series; the fundamentals of farming and trading form a solid foundation, while some of the design choices – such as the way that crafting was handled utilising the windmills – proved to be needlessly finicky. Through our hands on though, it feels like smart updates have been made to make the game more appealing, and I found myself easily drawn into the easy-going action.</p>
<p>Story of Season: Grand Bazaar is clearly familiar, embracing the tick of farming alongside the tock of building relationships, but the addition of the weekly Grand Bazaar gives you something more concrete to work towards. Everything is very focused, Zephyr Town, your farm and the Bazaar only taking a few minutes to walk around, but within that there’s a life to build which feels full of possibilities.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/check-out-two-new-gameplay-videos-for-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Two new gameplay videos have been released for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</a>, exploring the new Fusion system and Heavy Armor mechanics that will enhance the game’s player customisation. Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is set to launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on 5th September 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion | Fusion" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iSXGKlruTww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fusion will give you the option to forsake your humanity and fuse in Immortal Factors that are retrieved from fallen enemies. Factors come in three types –&nbsp;Might, Shell, and Skeleton – which determine the skill that they will offer, but fusing them to your body will mutate your character into something inhuman.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, though, you can always buy your humanity back for a fee, losing all the skills in the process.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion | Heavy Armor" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZGFh8HHEjI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But maybe you won’t need to indulge in body mods, since there’s customisable Heavy Armor that can be applied to your Arsenal mech in the thick of battle, calling it in when the call gauge is full to let you dish out more powerful attacks. In a brilliant move, your regular mech actually climbs into the bigger mech, meaning that you have a pilot inside a mech, inside a mech.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope we get a third game in this series so that we can have mechs piloting mechs piloting mechs. How far can this rabbit hole go?</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/11/daemon-x-machina-review/">Daemon X Machina review</a> back with its original Nintendo Switch release, Miguel wrote, “Daemon X Machina sets the bar for robot action games. The addictive mecha fighting is almost flawless, but it’s complemented by so many other incredible parts to the game. There’s a rich, unique world filled with incredible and memorable characters, endless and addictive customisation, gorgeous visuals and a jaw-dropping soundtrack. Daemon X Machina rarely stumbles, and even when it did, I still couldn’t help but be impressed by this amazing new experience.”</p>

<figure><a title="Ho-Oh Pokémon TCG Pocket: Wisdom of Sea and Sky" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c658c692ace3f/ho-oh-pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Overnight, The Pokémon Company was hit by allegations of plagiarism ahead of the release of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> expansion, <strong>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</strong>. And today, with the release of the expansion, TPC has pulled the card — plus one other card — in question.</p>
<p>In a statement issued on <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1950406273150693652?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">social media</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-suddenly-pulls-card-design-embroiled-in-plagiarism-controversy-as-company-admits-production-issue-and-launches-wider-investigation">IGN</a>), TPC "deeply apologize[s]" for the error, which affects the Ho-Oh EX (3-Star) and Lugia EX (3-Star) cards drawn by SIE NANAHARA, which it puts down to a "production issue". The expansion was datamined yesterday by fans, which is where the card art for Ho-Oh came from.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards". The art has been replaced in-game with a "temporary placeholder".</p>

<p>The team is also "conducting a broader investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game."</p>
<p>The accusations focused on the Ho-Oh card specifically, which appears to be based on fanart art of the Legendary bird from <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu" tabindex="-1">lanjiuji</a>, which they published in 2021.</p>
<p>lanjiuji, confused at the potential plagiarism, shared some <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950044196842459644">comparison pics on social media</a>, and even at a quick glance, you can see that the resemblance is pretty darn close.</p>
<p>They have since released a <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610">statement</a> acknowledging The Pokémon Company's response, stating "My original post stemmed solely from perplexity upon encountering questionable images online, with no means to verify their authenticity as game assets".</p>

<p>"Relieved by the timely resolution, I also thank those who contributed constructive perspectives." the statement concludes. lanjiuji also potentially refers to a figure based on the artwork, created by PC House, which <a href="https://x.com/KetX2L/status/1950099518168432873">someone has linked in the replies</a>. The Ho-Oh art appears to be a commission from the company.</p>
<p>The situation has sparked discussions around Pokémon and its legal terms surrounding fanart — which seemed to suggest that The Pokémon Company owns any publicly shared artwork, and that it doesn't need to notify anyone if the company decides to use it.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/legal/information">legal statement here</a>, but whatever it says, today's decision implies that, while Pokémon <em>could</em> use your art, it wants to avoid doing so.</p>
<p>So, while we wait for the art to be replaced, let's have a look at that placeholder art, then:</p>

<p>Well, at least people are having fun with the temporary cards...! Alongside the new expansion, there's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-much-needed-trading-update-and-a-new-expansion-next-week">huge overhaul to trading too</a>, which is a bit of a boon given how much it was criticised when it first dropped.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-looks-like-battlefield-6-wont-cost-you-80.1256976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has declared that it has no intention of raising its games' prices to $80 anytime soon, so it looks like upcoming releases like&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, as well as already-confirmed titles like&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 26</em>,&nbsp;will still cost you $70 this year.</p>

<p>In an earnings call with investors (courtesy of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-no-80-games-for-now-were-not-looking-to-make-any-changes-at-this-stage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>), EA CEO Andrew Wilson answered an investor's question about whether EA was considering pricing its games at $80, since some of its competitors are beginning to do so.</p>

<p>Wilson said that EA wants to "capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible", and that while the company will continue to seek "opportunities to deliver great value...through various pricing schemes", there are "no dramatic changes planned yet".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-80-ea-andrew-wilson-explosion.jpg?itok=m4An-f78 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-80-ea-andrew-wilson-explosion.jpg?itok=Z8pd041E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA says it doesn't have any plans to change its games' prices yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Wilson's comments come after Nintendo revealed earlier this year that&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">main launch title</a> for the Switch 2, would cost $80 (although that cost is drastically reduced if you pick the game up as part of a console bundle).</p>

<p>Xbox was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-prices-raised-hardware-software" rel="nofollow">originally due to follow suit</a> with its holiday releases, including Obsidian's&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and Activision's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, but after widespread criticism, the company revealed recently that its main lineup this year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" rel="nofollow">will remain at $70</a>.</p>

<p>As for Sony, the Japanese gaming giant seems to be maintaining its $70 pricing structure for now, with recent release&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>coming in at that price alongside future titles like&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, just because these companies say their games will remain at $70 for the time being, that doesn't mean they won't suddenly increase prices next year, or the year after. It's tough to say at this stage.</p>

If some rather telling pre-sell text is to be believed, it looks like it's set for an October release, and we'll be getting our first glimpse of gameplay tomorrow.</p>

The executive added that EA already offers a "fairly broad pricing scheme" across its many releases, including free-to-play, paid, and deluxe editions.</p>

<p>"Our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value," he said. "We'll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players through various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet."</p><p>During EA's previous earnings call three months ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-80-games-isnt-planning-to-follow-suit-yet/1100-6531352/" data-ref-id="1100-6531352">Wilson said much the same thing when asked about $80 games</a>, so his new comments are no surprise.</p><p>A European leak recently suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-reportedly-leaks/1100-6533386/" data-ref-id="1100-6533386">Battlefield 6's standard edition would cost €80 ($94 USD)</a>, but EA has yet to make any official announcements. If preorders do in fact open on July 31, we should find out soon.</p><p>To date, Nintendo is the only major company to offer a new game for $80; it did so when it launched Mario Kart World earlier this year. However, players can get the game at a perceived discount through a $500 Switch 2 bundle. Microsoft was set to follow suit with $80 games later this year, beginning with The Outer Worlds 2, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">the company backtracked and canceled those plans. </a></p><p>According to one analyst, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">consumers are ready and willing to pay $80 or more for new games</a>, adding that every publisher in video games that believes it can raise prices will do so over time. As mentioned, that hasn't happened yet beyond Mario Kart World, but the average selling price of new games could be above $70 when things like deluxe editions are factored in. Beyond that, games make money through microtransactions, and it's expected that Battlefield 6 will have them, too.</p><p>Not every publisher is raising prices, though, as 2K Games will launch Mafia: The Old Country in August for $50.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sandfall Interactive has released a new update for its widely-praised turn-based RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, adding among other changes a Battle Retry prompt.</p>
<p>This has been one of the "most requested" quality of life improvements, the developer said. This new feature does exactly what it says on the tin - if faced with a defeat, players will now notice that a pop-up window appears in the game, which will allow them to give things another go.</p>
<p>This is similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>'s retry mechanic, which was a popular inclusion to Atlus' fantasy RPG when it was released last year. This mechanic allowed players to restart a battle without any consequences if things weren't exactly going the way they had hoped they would. If only real life came with a button like that…</p>
<p>But, I digress. Other tweaks within Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's latest update include the Pictos menu now clearly displaying the Lumina cost of each ability, which the team said will allow for "better planning".</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive has also added separate volume sliders, which means players can now independently adjust the volume for exploration and combat phases.</p>
<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 below:</p>
<p><strong>Performance and Visuals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DLSS &amp; XeSS Enhancements: Added Frame Generation and Low Latency Mode support for both DLSS and XeSS (compatible GPUs only). Enjoy smoother gameplay and lower input lag!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quality of Life Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Battle Retry Prompt: A new pop-up window appears after defeat, giving you the option to quickly retry the battle.</li>
<li>Lumina Cost Display: The Pictos menu now clearly displays the Lumina cost of each ability for better planning.</li>
<li>Autoplay Dialogue: Added an optional autoplay feature for dialogues outside cutscenes. You can toggle it in the settings and during dialogues.</li>
<li>Separate Volume Sliders: Audio settings now lets you independently adjust the volume for exploration and combat phases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added icons to Lune’s Stains to improve readability and accessibility for colorblind players.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combat</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the Rocher holding a crystal occasionally despawning after reentering the Stone Wave Cliffs</li>
<li>Fixed some players being teleported behind the Monolith upon loading a save</li>
<li>Fixed Gameplay modifiers being applied to a New Game save when enabled on other saves</li>
<li>Fixed landing as Esquie without the party spawning, leading to input loss</li>
<li>Fixed the Fog on Flying Manor covering the screen and blocking the view on Steam Deck</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Achievements </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed journals vanishing after loading a Save File that was created at the exact moment of picking up that journal</li>
</ul>
<p>The following two trophies should now pop for you when you load your save if you were affected by these bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed "Expeditioner" and "Trailbreaker" achievements not unlocking if the characters reach a level higher than 33 or 66 after a battle</li>
<li>Fixed 'Connoisseur' and 'Follow The Trail' achievements not unlocking after collecting all required items on some savefiles</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Environmental Polish</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Various environmental bugfixes, tweaks and visual polish across multiple levels for a more immersive experience.</li>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 released back in April, and in May the developer revealed it had passed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">a fitting milestone of 3.3m copies sold</a>.</p>
<p>"Clair Obscur may be a painting with a limited colour palette, but the result is a bold and striking vision," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's four star Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-patch-130-adds-fan-favourite-retry-button-as-used-in-metaphor-refantazio-to-make-redoing-boss-fights-a-breeze]]></content:encoded>

		<p>A bit update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is here, with version 1.2.0 of the hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> kart racer making a few positive changes for the game’s balance and progression.</p>
<p>Key features include that the 150cc AI has been made a smidgeon less aggressive, with a common complaint being about how difficult it is to achieve a three star rating in Grand Prix and Knockout Tour races. There’s also a change for online multiplayer course selection, where traditional three-lap races will appear more frequently for players to choose – Nintendo previously reduced their prevalence because everyone was constantly choosing these over the point-to-point races that have become the open world racer’s bread and butter.</p>


<p>For completionists, there’s further good news as the Free Roam map will now indicate that you’ve gathered all of the P switches, ? panels and Peach Medallions by changing the colour of the number.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there’s a little bit of balancing here, a few bug fixes there, as Nintendo continue to finetune the game that millions are now playing.</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Mario Kart World Version 1.2.0:</p>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player”, added “No COM” to the COM rules.</li>
<li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player” and “Multiplayer”, added “Mushrooms only” to the item rules.</li>
<li>You can now choose “View Replay” after downloading ghost data in “Time Trials”.</li>
<li>You can now choose whom to watch when spectating in “Knockout Tour” and “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li>
<li>You can now see the waiting time until the next race or battle starts in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li>
<li>When using CameraPlay in “Multiplayer” and “Online Play”, the game will now remember the camera cursor position and size until the player closes the game.
<ul>
<li>If you change the number of people playing, the cursor position and size will return to their original settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the “Free Roam” map, when you gather all of the P Switches, ? Panels, and Peach Medallions, the colors of the various numbers will now change.</li>
<li>Made COM weaker in everything other than “Battle”.</li>
<li>Made homing of Boomerang weaker.</li>
<li>Decreased the probability of getting a Triple Dash Mushroom in the low position, whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than “Frantic”.</li>
<li>Changed it so order of getting ? Block is higher than in the past, whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than “Frantic”.</li>
<li>Made it so there is a wheel spinning animation if the player presses the A button (acceleration) too early when starting a race while driving.
<ul>

<li>Fixed an issue where the points in a team race in “Wireless Play” would display incorrectly.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable on the menu screen after the player was retired in “Balloon Battle” in “Wireless Play”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a Peach Medallion would sometimes disappear when doing Rewind in “Free Roam”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable when the player pointed the cursor at their own character or course and pressed A on the “Free Roam” map.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable when the player quit a mission in “Free Roam” right before entering a pipe.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where the player would slip through the ceiling in “Dry Bones Burnout”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player would sometimes hit a fence when throwing a red shell on the first turn in “Moo Moo Meadows”.</li>

<figure><a title="Yomawari" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4627021c6556/yomawari.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're all on tenterhooks awaiting news of a Nintendo Direct that may never arrive, and publisher NIS has only upped the speculation after it accidentally lifted the lid on a new Switch 2 game before swiftly deleting the announcement post.</p>
<p>As brought to our attention on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1md0f07/nis_announced_a_new_2026_game_for_ns2nswps5pc/">Reddit</a> forum by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Joseki100/">Joseki100</a>, the Japanese NIS Twitter account was briefly home to the reveal of a new farming game in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yomawari_the_long_night_collection">Yomawari</a> series, accompanied by a 30th July 2026 release date. The post was swiftly removed, but not before more than a handful of people had nabbed a screenshot (you'll find it below, shared to BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/knoebel.bsky.social">Knoebel</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Running the reveal through Google Translate, this one appears to be called '<strong>The Garden of Honolulu</strong>', and seemingly boasts the same chibi art style as we'd expect from a Yomawari game. Naturally, we won't know anything for sure until the game is revealed properly (as in, for more than a few minutes), but hey, at least the key art looks cute.</p>

<p>Now, as many have pointed out on Reddit, the game does <em>feel</em> like a Direct announcement, one that was potentially scheduled too early and accidentally let slip before anything was made official. There have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumblings of a July presentation</a> for a good few weeks now, and there are only two days left to fit in that window, so don your tinfoil hat as you will.</p>
<p>Whether it ends up being a sign of an upcoming Direct or not, it looks like we'll have another cute farming sim on our hands next summer. You can never have too many of those, right?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-v-devil-trigger-pulled/">Devil May Cry 5</a> was CAPCOM's best-selling game for the first quarter of the current fiscal year, boosted by the Netflix anime show's launch in April.</p>



<p>In its report for Q1 FY2026, the Japanese publisher confirmed that the fifth entry in the series sold 1,782,000 units in April-June 2025, the only game by the publisher to achieve more than 1 million sales in the quarter. Street Fighter 6 is also reported to have been doing well, and thanks to the Nintendo Switch 2 release, the latest entry in the legendary fighting game series has now surpassed five million units.</p>



<p>Looking at the report's Unit Sales ranking, it's impossible not to notice how <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> hasn't performed all that well. The game only sold 477,000 units in the first quarter of the fiscal year, a sheer drop from the high sales reported in its launch window and barely surpassing Monster Hunter Rise. Hopefully, the development team will be able to turn things around and address the issues that have been putting off many players.</p>



<p>Besides confirming Devil May Cry 5's solid performance in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, CAPCOM has also reported significant growth, with net sales increasing by 53.7% year-on-year to ¥45,502 million, operating profit increasing by 90.8% to ¥24,597 million, and profit attributable to owners of the parent increasing by 72.8% to ¥17,238 million. Impressive results, considering the publisher hasn't released any major titles in the quarter.</p>



<p>As a longtime fan of the series, I am happy to learn that Devil May Cry 5 is doing great on the market so many years after its release., showing CAPCOM how there's still a strong interest in Dante, Vergil and Nero's story. Hopefully, it won't take long to see another entry in the series, although longtime series director Hideaki Itsuno leaving CAPCOM<a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/"> last year </a>likely impacted whatever the publisher is planning for the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has pulled a new immersive&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em> card depicting Generation II Pokemon Ho-Oh, citing a "production issue" and pledging to conduct a "broader investigation" into the ways in which it commissions artwork.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/notice-regarding-new-illustrations" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>website, the company says that the card in question has been "replaced with a temporary placeholder", as has its Lugia counterpart (although the issue doesn't appear to apply to the Lugia card as well).</p>

<p>Just in case you're in the dark on this one, Redditor SPARKisnumber1 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1mc1y2b/leaked_hooh_immersive_art_seemingly_plagiarized/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted a Reddit thread</a> yesterday alleging that artwork for an immersive Ho-Oh card for the latest&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow">Wisdom of Sea and Sky</a>&nbsp;</em>was plagiarized from a 2021 fanart piece.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=JwCokNKF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=eWp07F3p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has pulled a Ho-Oh card over a "production issue" (although not the one shown here; that's just for illustrative purposes).</figcaption></figure><p>According to The Pokemon Company, the artist who drew the card in question, Sie Nanahara, was given "incorrect materials as official documents", so it sounds as though the company gave her the aforementioned fanart and essentially told her to copy or trace it.</p>

<p>However, without further official details, all we can do on that front is speculate. What we do know is that the Ho-Oh card is no longer in the game (although The Pokemon Company stops short of admitting plagiarism, of course), and it will be replaced with new art "as soon as it's ready".</p>

<p>Additionally, the company says it will conduct "a broader investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game", so if there is any other plagiarised art based on fan work in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it'll likely be found and replaced soon.</p>

<p>Let's hope that's not the case, though. I'm sure The Pokemon Company doesn't want to end up in a similar situation to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1671927000498597888" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Destiny 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">Marathon</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie when it comes to plagiarized art.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see how this situation develops, but in the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>expansion is out now on both Android and iOS.</p>

                <p>The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) has released a statement condemning the recent crackdown on games featuring adult themes on PC storefronts, calling for "greater transparency and fairness" in the moderation of adult games. The statement comes after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/" data-ref-id="1100-6533253">both Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">Itch.io caved</a> to pressure from payment processors--themselves targeted by anti-porn lobby group Collective Shout--and abruptly delisted or deindexed a number of games with adult themes.</p><p>While IGDA stresses that it is not defending the circulation of harmful material--which many of the delisted games would certainly qualify as--it says that the current enforcement of these policies is vague and lacks transparency, leading to "delisting and deplatforming legal, consensual, and ethically developed games, especially from LGBTQ+ and marginalized creators."</p><p>"Developers report games being delisted or hidden despite prior approval or longstanding presence on these platforms," the statement says. "The lack of transparency around enforcement criteria, sudden shifts in policy, and an absence of appeal pathways leave creators with no clear path to compliance or recourse."</p><p>"Further reports suggest that recent policy changes are driven in large part by pressure from payment processors like Visa, Mastercard, and others, who may threaten to withhold payment processing services from platforms hosting adult content," IDGA continues. "As a result, financial institutions are now influencing which stories can be told and sold in games, with minimal transparency or public accountability."</p><p>IDGA is calling for clearer guidelines from both platforms and payment processors to "distinguish prohibited content from lawful adult expression," saying it's important that games as an artistic medium can tell stories about "intimacy, pleasure, trauma, or identity."</p><p>IGDA is also calling on platforms to provide clearer communication and specific reasons to affected devs, including "structured appeals and revision pathways" when a game is found to be potentially in breach. It also recommends the formation of advisory panels made up of experts and marginalized creators, as well as regular transparency reports on what enforcement actions have been taken.</p><p>"This issue is not just about adult content. It is about developer rights, artistic freedom, and the sustainability of diverse creative work in games," the statement concludes. IGDA's statement calls on platforms, payment processors, and games industry leaders to come together in meaningful conversation on the issue.</p><p>The organization also provides contact details for Visa and Mastercard, urging people to get in touch with the major payment processors to make their concerns around financial censorship heard--and gamers have been doing just that. Gaming communities across social media have <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">organized campaigns</a> to put pressure on the two payment processors, flooding both companies with calls and emails registering their concern about censorship on gaming platforms.</p>

                <p>A big new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a> is here, bringing with it several smaller but likely welcome tweaks, alongside a change sought after by many. In the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" rel="nofollow ">patch notes</a> for version 1.2.0 of the game, which is available to download now, Nintendo noted that it has "increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in 'VS Race' and wireless races." This has been a point of frustration for players, as many prefer to do a standard three-lap race as opposed to the new game's intermission races.</p><p dir="ltr">An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-latest-mario-kart-world-patch-is-driving-players-up-a-wall-in-a-bad-way/1100-6532749/">update last month</a> even made it harder to do three-lap races, so this tweak to make them more common again will probably go down well (as long as the likelihood of getting three-lap races has received a significant boost, anyway). In terms of other notable changes, while playing in free roam, when you manage to get all of the P Switches, ? Panels, and Peach Medallions, the "colors of the various numbers will now change." NPCs are also weaker in every mode apart from Battle, and those of you who rely on Triple Dash Mushrooms in a low position will be disappointed to know that the chance of getting that item has been decreased.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Nintendo has listened to community feedback, and with its latest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> update has "increased the frequency" of lap-type courses appearing on the selection screen when choosing the next course in both Vs Race and wireless races.</p>
<p>Why is this especially of note? Well, back in June, Nintendo made it more difficult for Mario Kart World racers to play lap-only tracks in the game's multiplayer modes. This led to a certain amount of outcry from players, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-updates-random-online-selection-but-what-fans-really-want-is-a-classic-mode">some even going as far as to say Nintendo had "killed" online versus in Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>"They saw players clamoring for a more traditional online mode and did... the exact opposite of what they wanted," one commentator said at the time.</p>

<p>However, Nintendo evidently heard those cries, and a new update known as Ver. 1.2.0 will now increase the frequency of those more traditional Mario Kart lap-type courses in World.</p>
<p>"NINTENDO LISTENED!!!!!!!" one very enthusiastic <a href="https://x.com/ItzVCiPz/status/1950375720716222751">social media user</a> wrote following the most recent Mario Kart World update. "Did Nintendo just [save] Mario Kart World?!!!" <a href="https://x.com/Rodjr129/status/1950370313616969952">another asked</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also made Mario Kart World's homing Boomerang weaker with this update, and decreased the probability of a racer getting hold of a Triple Dash Mushroom when in a low position, "whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than 'Frantic'."</p>
<p>As well as that, the team has added a Mushrooms only option for VS races, and much more. You can check out the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world">full Mario Kart World patch notes via Nintendo here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are still on the fence about giving Mario Kart World a spin, be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">sure to check out Eurogamer's review</a>, where our Tom said how the game "offers neat twists on the classic Mario Kart formula", calling it all "entertaining, snackable, fun".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Electronic Arts (EA) reported its Q1 2026 financial results a few hours ago, beating expectations with a revenue of $1.3 billion (+4.84% over the estimates and 3% more than last year). This is certainly a great setup for the publisher ahead of highly anticipated game launches, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-release-date-indirectly-confirmed-official-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-in-early-access-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skate</a>, and The Sims through <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-next-gen-project-rene-revealed-customization-cross-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Rene</a>. Will EA join other publishers <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Nintendo</a> in raising game prices beyond $70, though?</p>



<p>It doesn't seem like that's happening, at least for the time being. In the ensuing Q&amp;A with investors, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said (excerpt from <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-electronic-arts-q1-2026-beats-eps-estimates-93CH-4158698" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Investing.com</a>):</p>



<p><em>We’re not looking to make any changes on pricing at this stage, but that’s in the construct of we already offer a fairly broad pricing scheme across our various products. When you think about everything from free to play through to our premium products and our deluxe editions, our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value. We’ll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players through various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet.</em></p>



<p>That's great news for gamers interested in games such as Battlefield 6. It may be a conscious decision on EA's part. The publisher is looking to attract <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a big audience</a> for this new installment in the military shooter franchise, after all, and setting a price that many consumers are not comfortable with would be counterproductive.</p>



<p>EA has set the multiplayer reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for tomorrow</a>. Livestreamed events will take place in Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris, and London and kick off at 11:30 AM Pacific Time. We'll have our own Kai Tatsumoto in Los Angeles to play the game and report his first impressions.</p>

        <p>Yes, every Peak headline I write will contain the same pun</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Well, after a prolonged period of teasing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> developers Aggro Crab and Landfall Games look to have bitten the human bullet. Nestled among the notes for the climbing game's latest patch are the words "added cannibalism".</p>
<p>It's not enough that you can mod Peak so that you and your buddies will be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-modders-are-delivering-peak-modding-heres-one-that-fills-your-game-with-the-skeletons-of-dead-players">surrounded by the corpses of fallen climbers</a> as you attempt to do an Edmund Hillary. The folks behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> want you to casually nibble on your colleagues on the way.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Fine," the devs wrote on the smouldering remains of the Tweeter as they deployed patch 1.10.a, which allows you to eat people. The notes don't provide any more details as to how this cannibalism works, but I assume you just walk up to a fellow mountaineer, politely ask permission, and then start munching away.</p>
<p>Maybe don't start with the feet. That advice isn't based on any previous experiences I've had in real life, I assure you. Looking <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aggrocrabgames.bsky.social/post/3luil6jpkzs2a">directly into their eyes</a> as you devour their elbows probably isn't a good idea either.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Aside from the whole eating people thing, this Peak patch adds in a new setting called "Climbing Extra Field Of View", which lets you control how the FOV changes as you climb, and a push to mute button that I was going to accuse of being a means by which to silence cannibalism objectors until I realised it works like reverse push to talk. Polish and Turkish language support has also arrived.</p>
<p>Fittingly for a cannibalism update, a few food and cooking-related balancing tweaks have been made, including one that stops well-done snacks from being de-buffed if you stash them away for later.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a bunch of bug and performance fixes, with the devs having dealt with some wildflowers and temporarily disabled the Napberry plant in a bid to help things run better. They've also had a go at nixing a bug that leads you to take a "significant amount of fall damage when falling a short distance", but it seems their temporary solution has only addressed instances of this that involve "sliding down while holding the wall", so efforts are ongoing.</p>
<p>Digest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498327923676161391">the full notes</a> if you want the rest. Well, unless you're saving space for a buddy you plan to devour on the way to the summit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-cannibalism-is-delivered-by-the-co-op-climbers-latest-patch]]></content:encoded>

Given the two games are likely to be launching reasonably close together, and will be frantically competing for the same audience, it’d be madness to deliberately out-price the rival. However, Wilson said on the call that $80 prices hadn’t been factored into any of EA’s projected earnings through March 2026. Now, that could be because the company wanted to low-ball and report unexpected profits, or it could always have been planning to release <em>BF6</em> at the previous upper price.</p><p>Of course, when pre-orders are announced there will inevitably be ways to spend <em>vastly</em> more than $70 on <em>Battlefield 6</em>, with ludicrous bundles offering imaginary doodads and different dress-up options for your soldiers for possibly hundreds of dollars. Seventy will get you the very basic version of the game, without a season pass, DLC, etc, and it’ll make sure to let you know what a pedestrian person you are as you choose it. Fortunately, there’s the far smarter option of never pre-ordering anything, because <em>it’s a scam</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292]]></content:encoded>

			<p>VALORANT, the competitive first-person shooter developed by Riot Games, was recently <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-11-02/">updated</a> to Unreal Engine 5.3, and, for once, the engine delivers better performance than its predecessor.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared by MxBenchmarkPC puts the game running in Unreal Engine 4 and in Unreal Engine 5.3 side by side on a system powered by an RTX 4070 GPU, highlighting how the UE5.3 version of the game generally runs at higher framerates. Visuals, on the other hand, are almost identical, with only some marginal improvements, which was expected, considering the developer's statements before the patch went live and the competitive nature of the game. The new version of the game also shows an increase in CPU load, RAM and VRAM usage, which may impact some low-end machines, although no report has been shared regarding any massive performance issue on such systems.</p>

<p>It's almost unbelievable to see a game powered by Unreal Engine 5 run so smoothly, without its known stuttering issues. Epic is well aware of these issues, and Software Engineer Ari Arnbjörnsson recently hosted a talk aptly named T<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-declares-great-hitch-hunt-rid-games-stutters/">he Great Hitch Hunt</a> during Unreal Fest 2025, highlighting the causes of the widespread stuttering issues and providing some advice to developers to minimize the issues.</p>



<p>One of the latest games powered by Unreal Engine 5 is the soulslike WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers. Although far from being one of the UE5 games with the worst performance to date, the experience crafted by Leenzee Games still leaves something to be desired from a technical standpoint, as even a powerful GPU like my RTX 4080 needed Frame Generation to hit 60 frames per second at 4K resolution. You can learn more about these performance issues, which the development studios is currently working to improve, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">review.</a></p>
