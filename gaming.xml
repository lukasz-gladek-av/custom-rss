<p>In just a couple of days, players worldwide will get their hands on the long-awaited release of Civilization 7 (stylised as Civilization VII). It has been almost a decade since the last major release in the Civ series, and fans are understandably very excited for the chance to drive empires forward once again.</p>



<p>Recently, an entirely new perspective on the Civilization series was revealed – a <strong>VR version </strong>of Civ 7. It’s being developed by PlaySide Studios and 2K in collaboration with Firaxis and it’s coming to Meta Quest 3 and 3S in the spring.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-truly-immersive">Truly Immersive</h2>



<p>Firaxis, PlaySide, and 2K worked to release a new trailer for Civilization 7, this one surprisingly showcasing a never-before-seen VR version of the game:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Sid Meier's Civilization VII - VR Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lavuwKvZki8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The world of VR has gone from strength to strength of late. The technology is sharpening, price points are dropping slightly, and the library of games and apps available on the best headsets is forever expanding. It’s still a tentative area for some, but some developers are investing much more in the technology, which is great for those who love the immersion.</p>



<p>This is the first time in history that a Civilization game has been available on VR platforms, and it’s coming <strong>exclusively </strong>to Meta Quest 3 and 3S – which isn’t an unheard of thing these days. These headsets dominate the market, and as a Quest 3 owner, I can say that they’re generally the cream of the crop.</p>



<p>The trailer shows exactly how this’ll work, with a unique UI and configuration created solely for VR users to enjoy the relatively complex experience that Civilization 7 promises to offer. Given how long the average game of Civ 7 lasts, it could be pretty exhausting and you might need an external battery on your headset, but those are choices for you to make.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll pick up Civilization 7 on Meta Quest? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Sony has given an actual reason for the PlayStation Network (PSN) outage that brought the service down for roughly 20 hours on Friday and Saturday. </p>



<p>In a post late Saturday night on <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the company blamed the outage on an “operational issue”. Specifics on the issue weren’t given nor was anything said about preventing another issue. However, PlayStation  did, once again, apologize for what happened.</p>



<p>“Network services have fully recovered from an operational issue,” they said. “We apologize for the inconvenience and thank the community for their patience.”</p>



<h6 id="h-new-episode-gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">NEW EPISODE:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Still On Track For 2025: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>As a make good for nearly a full day of service being lost, PlayStation is giving all PlayStation Plus members five extra days. The extension will automatically be added to all plans.</p>



<p>The PSN <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally went down</a> on Friday, February 7 around 6pm ET. The outage impacted users across the globe, taking down the ability to sign in, play online, and even access the PlayStation Store. It started to come back around 3:40PM ET on Saturday, February 8.</p>



<p>As the service was offline, the company didn’t provide any updates to players aside from an acknowledgement of PSN being offline hours after it went down. The next update came to state that service was restored. </p>



<p>What do you think about the reason PlayStation gave for the PSN outage? What about receiving five days of PlayStation Plus for the troubles? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-first-look-more-krieg-campaign-coming-soon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40k-first-look-more-krieg-campaign-coming-soon.1104267/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-first-look-more-krieg-campaign-coming-soon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another week brings with it a fresh batch of Games Workshop products up for pre-order, and this week we're taking a quick sneak peek at a few important new releases for&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K</em>. Games Workshop provided me with preview copies of two new Death Korps of Krieg units, as well as a PDF of the new&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K Crusade: Nachmund Gauntlet</em>, which brings campaign play back into the 41st millenium! Read on for my first impression thoughts!</p>

<h2>Warhammer 40K Crusade - Nachmund Gauntlet</h2>

<p>Enclosed in this massive tome is everything you need to start running your own&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K&nbsp;</em>campaign with your gaming group, compatible with the latest edition of the rules.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade.jpg?itok=rrjN1Ntn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade.jpg?itok=yONWzMBc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Step into war on the bloody streets of Sangua Terra!</figcaption></figure><h3>Nachmund Gauntlet - Storytelling At Its Finest</h3>

<p>This massive book, which clocks in at around 120 pages, dives deep into the story so far - we learn of the warlords seeking to lay claim to the world of Sangua Terra, one of the fortified bastions against Chaos in the famed Nachmund Gauntlet.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of the lore of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K</em>, and want to know the latest in the story the underpins the events of the game as a whole, this is a treasure trove of fantastic storytelling. One of the aspects I most love about all the Codexes and rulebooks that come out for all Games Workshop products is the level of storytelling on display. This isn't simple "the baddies are moving closer to their goal" writing, we dive deep into the various factions at play, their machinations, and more.</p>

<h3>Nachmund Gauntlet Campaign - Build Your Forces, See Them Through</h3>

<p>There are&nbsp;<em>so</em>&nbsp;many campaign rules for this game, it's hard to cover it all in a preview. So I'll keep it brief for the sake of discovery. In this Crusade book, you'll find rules to help guide a campaign over a series of missions, and there's a truly robust ruleset designed to help you play through it all.</p>

<p>You'll order all players into the campaign into alliances (ideally based on the army they're fielding) split between Guardians who seek to protect Sangua Terra, Despoilers who wish to conquer the world, and Marauders who seek to use the turmoil on Sangua Terra to their own benefit.</p>

<p>There are also a whole suite of Crusade rules specific to this Sangua Terran war, including how to use Crusade Badges, Battle Traits, Crusade Relics, and rules on using Tactical Reserves, recording your missions, blessings, agendas, and so much more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade-image-large.jpeg?itok=JwMd1Xxb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade-image-large.jpeg?itok=ur_LOfq3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An image from Games Workshop showcasing how the turmoil of the Crusade can look on your battlefield.</figcaption></figure><h3>Nachmund Gauntlet Campaign - Missions</h3>

<p>As for the missions included in this book, you'll find fifteen distinct missions that see forces doing everything from securing drop sites to acting as heralds for larger incoming forces. One of my favorites is the Saboteurs mission, which sees the Attacker-designated player trying to get deep into Defender territory to use a special action to sabotage important points on the map.</p>

<p>All throughout, these missions seem to me to balance a bit of novel and thematic gameplay with well-balanced challenges. There's nothing in here that feels so story driven that you're at a disadvantage for being on the wrong side of the narrative. This is a seriously robust Crusade book, and if you've got a regular playgroup or a local shop running this campaign, it's well-worth checking out.</p>

<h2>Warhammer 40K - Death Korps of Krieg New Releases</h2>

<p>Many, many new releases are coming this week for pre-order for the Death Korps of Krieg army. We recently covered the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-units-from-new-warhammer-40k-death-korps-army-box" rel="nofollow">brand new Krieg Army Box</a> that just released for the forces, and many of the units that were bundled in the box are now available for pre-order separately. I'm now getting my first look at two additional units coming that weren't included in the box set: The Krieg Heavy Weapons Squad, and the Krieg Command Squad.</p>

<h3>Warhammer 40K - Death Korps of Krieg&nbsp;Heavy Weapons Squad</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-heavy-weapons-unit.jpg?itok=49PN03cC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-heavy-weapons-unit.jpg?itok=NhpYXT7D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Heavy Weapons Squad unleashes serious firepower.</figcaption></figure><p>The Heavy Weapons Squad is designed to be built and suited to your needs! Each unit contains three Heavy Weapons Gunner models and one Fire Coordinator model, and each model has both a laspistol and close combat weapon for when the battle gets a little too close to them.</p>

<p>But we're not here to talk about laspistols! The standard construction for these models is to have each Heavy Weapons Gunner equipped with a lascannon, which fires a single shot at a staggering 12 Strength, dealing D6+1 damage per hit. But you can swap these out as you see fit to include a Twin Krieg heavy stubber which hits hard with three Attacks per model and has Rapid Fire 3.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also build these models with a Krieg heavy flamer, which has the "ignores cover" and "torrent" keywords and deals d6 attacks at 2 damage each.</p>

<p>All in all, this unit is a great option if you want some heavy fire but don't like fielding tanks!</p>

<h3>Warhammer 40K - Death Korps of Krieg&nbsp;Command Squad</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-command-sqaud.jpg?itok=Ie3Xpszc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-command-sqaud.jpg?itok=AnF8d1_4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Krieg Command Squad is great for getting those crucial orders issued to your army.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, let's take a look at the new Krieg Command Squad! This is the Krieg army knife of the army, with so many different weapon loadouts for the various members of the Squad. Where it really all comes together is in the Wargear abilities for the various bits, bobs, and gadgets attached to your models.</p>

<p>Let's chat about those abilities quickly: there's the Master Vox - which allows the Officer in this unit to issue orders up to 24" away, the Alchemyk Counteragents - which gives the unit the "Feel No Pain 6+" ability against mortal wounds, the Regimental Standard - which adds 1 to the Objective Control score of models in the unit (that's for&nbsp;<em>each</em>&nbsp;model), and the Servo-scribes - which, once per battle, lets the Officer issue two Orders at once (and is marked with a very cool Servo-scribes model).</p>

<p>If you're trying to get the most out of issuing orders to your Krieg army, this unit is not only pretty tough, and full of great weaponry, but they'll help you get those orders out efficiently.</p>

<p>That covers everything we got a chance to check out early with this week's preorder previews! Let us know what you think about these new releases in the comments!</p>

<p>The PlayStation Network is back online after being down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for nearly 20 hours</a>. Now, shortly after service was fully restored, PlayStation has issued a (very) brief update on the status of the network via social media.</p>



<p>“PSN has been restored,” the <a href="https://x.com/askplaystation/status/1888376843255824475?s=46&amp;t=hX1f8t9VMLBATttRMgQR3A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post said</a>. “You should be able to access online features without any problems now. </p>



<p>“Sorry for the inconvenience!”</p>



<p>The company also pointed people to the official PlayStation Network <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">status page</a> where it lists all services as currently functioning.</p>



<h6 id="h-new-episode-gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">NEW EPISODE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Still On Track For 2025: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>Aside from the apology, nothing else has been said by PlayStation. There has been no mention of what caused the outage in the first place. In fact, it was the first official statement from Sony since they made a post on Friday night stating that it was  “aware some users” were having problems. In between the post acknowledging the problem and the service being restored, the only other thing PlayStation posted was <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888316952004673561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">how to add M.2 storage</a> to the console.</p>



<p>PlayStation Network originally went down on Friday night around 6pm ET. The outage impacted users across the globe, taking down the ability to sign in, play online, and even access the PlayStation Store.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to PlayStation in an attempt to get an update as to what caused the PlayStation Network to go offline this weekend. Should a response be received—or an more in-depth statement be made in an official capacity—it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-patch-10-02-notes-all-changes-and-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT</a> scriptwriters for VCT Americas brought back a favorite from last season. Sentinels have qualified for the first Masters event of the year after a hot start at Kickoff, thanks to a masterful performance from Jordan “Zellsis” Montemurro in the lower final versus MIBR.</p>



<p>Known to some fans as the “vibes merchant” or just the Sentinels’ bundle salesman, Zellsis had his best individual series performance in years against MIBR. After the series in which he got just his second ace in VCT, the former Sentinels sub turned superstar spoke to Insider Gaming on his otherworldly performance, his progression as an emotional leader, and the things the team still needs to improve.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</em></p>



<p><strong>IG: A stupendous series from you against MIBR. What was the key to your performance?</strong></p>



<p>Zellsis: It has to be my teammates. Usually I’m the one that has to come in and keep everyone’s mood up, lift the energy, everything like that. And I kind of did not do that [today], I was just mellow, I kept my vibes neutral and focused on the game, instead of bashing my head against the wall like I usually do to keep emotions up.</p>



<p>My teammates started off the series with really good energy, so it made my job a little bit easier. When we got to Split though, I got a bit more amped because we loss a very intense [game of] Pearl, so I wanted us to get a bit more hype. But my teammates are insane as well; if I had brought the mood, one of them would have picked up the shooting.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Speaking of that Pearl, we saw a little bit of frustration from you after that knife from Aspas, and then some disappointed faces from the team after the map ended. How did you and the team recover after those moments?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, on the 1v2 I kind of raged. I was just very into the series, I did not want to lose. There were a lot of rounds that should have gone our way, and a lot of rounds where I messed up some key things. I knew one guy was Pit and one was Art, and I just whiffed and got very frustrated in the heat of the moment.</p>



<figure><figcaption>All smiles in SEN City. Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The MVP of vibes was N4RRATE. He was phenomenal today in keeping the vibes up, micro calling for people, and calling out mistakes. I think that’s a big thing that we’re starting to learn on stage together. We need to be calling each other out more when shit goes wrong. None of us are babies, we can fix it in the moment, and if you can’t, then you obviously don’t want to win.</p>



<p><strong>IG: You spoke the other day about your emotional maturity improving and “clicking” over these past couple years. Are there other players or coaches that helped you get better?</strong></p>



<p>All my coaches have always looked at me to be the leader on all my teams from Immi on Version1, to mCe on Cloud9, to now kaplan on Sentinels. They heavily rely on me being the emotional leader for everyone. People who know me know I’m very honest, I’m very brute, and I don’t beat around the bush. But I never try to put someone down when I’m saying something, it’s all about getting better and improving and making sure we’re in the right spot to win.</p>



<p>On C9, when vanity and yay left, mCe forced me to be more of a leader. When we got runi and jakee, we needed a huge voice on that C9 roster. We had the talent, we just didn’t have a lot of voices, we didn’t have a lot of decisive decision-making. And whether I wanted it to be me or not, mCe forced me into that. We had a lot of one-on-ones [together], and it kind of just spiraled me into always having to be like that now. And I’m not complaining, it’s made me a better player overall and a more complete player overall. I can control my emotions more. I can control when I talk about mistakes more and everything like that.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Do you feel your leadership role has increased this year after the departures of Sacy and TenZ?</strong></p>



<p>I definitely think we lack a little bit in high pressure mid-rounding situations. Sacy didn’t really do a lot of micro mid-rounding, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-valorant-champions-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his blueprint of playing the game was fundamentally the right way to play</a> the game. And that’s what he would kind of bring: “Okay, they’re doing this, we need to be doing this.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He just plays culturally differently than a lot of Americas teams. [NA teams] are always rushing, taking ones, whereas I feel like Brazilian teams always played fundamentally sound and he’s always played like that. So he brought that to this team when he played with us. I think with this team, we’re definitely missing a little bit of that discipline that he brought us. But we’re working on it.</p>



<p><strong>IG: What does it say about this team to be able to rebound from such a lopsided loss to G2 and qualify for Masters Bangkok?</strong></p>



<p>I think people need to remember we haven’t been a team [with this roster] that long. We’ve changed roles, we’ve changed so much to fit this team. And we’re still so young, I mean I’m 26 turning 27, John’s 26 turning 27. And then the drop off is insane: N4RRATE’s 22, bang is 20, and zekken is 19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s so much more re: mental and maturity to work on, but we all want to win and we work hard. I can confidently say this team is one of the hardest working teams I’ve ever been on, from the coaching staff to the players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-to-get-vr-port-for-quest-3-this-spring/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, a very surprising announcement took place during the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-world-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civ World Summit</a>, where publisher 2K and developer Firaxis Games announced that Sid Meier's Civilization VII will be released in VR for Quest 3. This is the first game in the franchise to ever be released in VR and it is a major milestone for the franchise. There isn't a set release date as of yet, but the game is set to release in VR this Spring.</p>
<p>Accompanying the announcement is a trailer for the VR version of the game, which you will be able to watch below to see what you can expect from the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sid Meier's Civilization VII - VR Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lavuwKvZki8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that the VR port of this game will be exclusive to the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S, which means there's a large portion of VR users who won't be able to access this game. Already, some fans have made complaints, stating that the VR port of this game should also be on PSVR at the very least. At the moment, it's not certain whether the game is part of a timed exclusive launch or if it's permanently exclusive for that headset.</p>
<p>Civilization VII VR will be handled by the VR veterans at PlaySide Studios, a company based in Australia. Players can choose to swap between VR and mixed reality at any point during their play. In this experience, players will get to view a diorama-style Command Table, much like those seen in historical games and TV shows. The VR version of the game will also provide detailed dioramas of in-game achievements, such as building Wonders and the Archives. Like the original version of the game, you can play solo or compete in online multiplayer matches, where you can play with up to three other Meta Quest 3 and 3S users.</p>
<p>If this sounds like something you would want to play, Civilization VII VR can be wishlisted already on the Meta Store. While 2K hasn't announced a release date, they are aiming for a Spring 2025 launch, with more information likely to come at a later date. While there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/firaxis-reveals-the-civilization-vii-roadmap-for-2025/">no DLCs out</a> for the game at the current moment as it has just been released, it's unsaid whether these DLCs will also be available for the VR port of the game. However, it is assumed that all DLC content will also be released for the VR version of the game to keep it fair.</p>
<p>Will you be purchasing Sid Meier's Civilization VII VR? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/609029/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-is-coming-to-the-quest-soon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/wes-davis">Wes Davis</a> <span>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <em>Civilization </em>franchise is getting the VR treatment with <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - VR</em> on Meta Quest headsets this spring, 2K and Firaxis Games <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/sid-meiers-civilizationr-vii-vr-launching-on-meta-quest-3-and-3s-in-spring-2025">have announced</a>. The “virtual and mixed reality” game will be available for the Quest 3 and 3S, but no price or specific release date has been announced quite yet.</p><p>How are 2K and Firaxis making it work? It’s presented through a “board game-like construction” that’s projected into your physical space using the Quest’s passthrough cameras or shown in a virtual museum environment “looking out onto a vista personalized to your leader,” <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-civ-7-vr-wishlist/">says a Meta blog post</a> about the release. You can switch between the two modes at any time, Meta writes. And when you’re playing in multiplayer mode, you’ll see your opponents around the table, represented by the digital bodies of their chosen leaders.</p><p>Here’s a trailer for the game.</p><p>Meta writes that this version “brings the true <em>Civ</em> experience” to the Quest. For instance, you’ll be able to pick whatever leader you want to run a civilization, a new tweak to the <em>Civilization</em> formula that my colleague Ash Parrish wrote about in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/604489/civilization-7-review">her review of the regular game</a>. One gameplay difference Meta mentions is that the game is sped up by default compared to other editions — not everyone finds VR headsets comfortable for long sessions, after all — but the company adds that you can adjust the pace to your liking.</p><p>We’ll see just how close <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - VR</em> hews to the PC and console versions of the game when it’s released in the spring. Until then, I’ll be thinking about that <em>Futurama</em> episode in which Bender becomes a god.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Co-creator of Back to The Future, Bob Gale, has said that a new video game is in the works. </p>



<p>The news came in a new interview by <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2024/05/back-to-the-future-co-creator-bob-gale-on-why-disney-rejected-script-possible-sequel-or-reboot-more.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cleveland.com</a> (paywalled), who had the opportunity to sit down and speak to Back to the Future’s co-creator Bob Gale.</p>



<p>In the interview, Gale was asked “what’s next” for him in the Back to the Future universe, to which he replied, “We’ve got a shot at a new video game based on Back to the Future.”</p>



<p>Gale continued, ”&nbsp;I don’t want to tell you any more than that because I’m not allowed to, but this is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time. Knock on wood that it will happen. Of course, 2025 is the 40th anniversary of the original movie. We’re planning on some events, plus there’s a documentary that’s in post-production now about the making of the musical.”</p>



<p>For those out of the loop, Back to the Future has had a game before called “Back to the Future: The Game” and released in December 2010 by Telltale Games and released in 5 parts, known as espisodes.</p>



<p>The game received fairly positive reviews and reached number 3 in the PlayStation 3 sales charts on its release, however, Telltale Games did not release any sales figures.</p>

<p>It hasn’t been a smooth launch for the new-generation Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card. After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-launch-to-be-worst-when-it-comes-to-availability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limited availability</a> alongside allegations of a paper launch from consumers, those who’ve been lucky enough to get one of the new $2,000 GPUs aren’t without their issues.</p>



<p>Over the last few days, posts on various <a href="https://www.chiphell.com/thread-2669678-1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/1if73o9/rtx_5090_not_detected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddits</a> have appeared with claims that the GPUs—both the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and Chinese-specific RTX 5090D—are bricking. The common claim among all posts is that the cards are being undetected by their systems. Some have tried clearing the CMOS while others simply cleaned and reinstalled the drivers for the cards. None of those efforts have seemed to work.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Still On Track For 2025: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>The reports began to get so frequent that Nvidia had to issue a statement on the matter.</p>



<p>“We are investigation the reported issues with the RTX 50 series,” the company told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/nvidia-is-investigating-the-reported-issues-with-the-rtx-50-series-cards-after-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-owners-and-some-rtx-40-series-folk-report-black-screen-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>.</p>



<p>It’s a vague statement from Nvidia, but it does acknowledge that they know there’s an issue. What’s caused the problem will likely be revealed if and when Nvidia releases a fix or offers solutions for those suffering.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is staring the naysayers in the face and battling them back with reckless abandon. Despite campaigns on social media to smear the game’s image, the Warhorse Studios RPG is soaring up the charts. It has now more than <strong>doubled </strong>the peak player count of 2018’s Kingdom Come: Deliverance on Steam, and it’s not slowing down.</p>



<p>KCD2 is proving to be a smash hit. Not only did it receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glowing praise in my review</a>, but it’s already one of 2025’s most decorated games. It sold more than one million copies in a single day, with Warhorse Studios and Plaion making a profit within 24 hours of launch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-up">On the Up</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 had, at the time of publishing, hit a peak player count of 233,586 users. That dwarfs the record set by the first title, which was released in 2018 and secured a peak count on Steam of 95,800.</p>



<p>Incredibly, the launch of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has worked wonders for the first game. Players worldwide are flooding the first game to get the scope of the story before landing in the sequel. At the time of writing, the first game was sitting on a peak player count of 38,669 users, the highest it had been since March 2018.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has had some trouble on social platforms because of some of the more complex themes present, but that’s not enough to slow down the growth of this phenomenal title.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has already revealed that this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/">three major expansions</a> will be released for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. The developer has a wonderful track record in that arena, having released a string of top expansions for the first game that provided entertainment long after the story was completed.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k25-underground-match-hands-on-impressions/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wwe-2k25-underground-match-hands-on-impressions-%E2%80%93-buried-potential.1104081/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k25-underground-match-hands-on-impressions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>I recently had the opportunity to go hands-on with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WWE 2K25</a> amid the excitement of this year's Royal Rumble, and earlier this week I <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k25-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared my first impressions</a>, or at least <em>most</em> of them. Due to 2K Games' embargo, I wasn't able to talk about one of the game's features, the new Underground Match, until now.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, Raw Underground was a short-lived attempt to spice up the third hour of WWE's flagship TV program during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hosted by Shane McMahon, Raw Underground segments were one part Fight Club, one part UFC, with competitors working more of a "shoot" style in ropeless rings. While Raw Underground was at least something different, it wasn't particularly well-received by fans, wasn’t really integrated into the rest of the show in any logical way, and was quietly scrapped after just a couple of months.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k2517.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Given that history, it was somewhat surprising to hear WWE 2K25 developer Visual Concepts was reviving the Underground Match, but according to series producer Lynell Jinks, they’re “always looking” for things that could be gamified in a fun way, even if those things didn’t originally blow TV viewers away.</p>
<p>WWE 2K25 partly replicates the original look of the Underground Matches, removing the ropes and surrounding the ring with rowdy spectators, but it doesn’t go all the way. There were no unique Underground arenas in the preview build I played, and according to Jinks, there won’t be any – the matches will simply take place in regular arenas.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k2518.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em>“[Underground matches] can take place in any arena that will kind of take the aesthetic from the Underground match. Turn the lights down low with the spotlights, turn off all the barricade LEDs to give that cool unique look and remove the ropes. So yeah, so it's kind of cool and dynamic in that way.”</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k2519.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As for how Underground Matches actually play, you can only win them by knockout or submission, but otherwise, they’re essentially just no-DQ matches. Admittedly, being able to freely chuck your opponents out of the ring without the ropes getting in your way is fun and allows you to move from the ring to the floor and back again more freely. That said, I would have liked more unique animations specifically tailored for this match or perhaps even some changes to Superstar movesets. The fact that the matches had more of a gritty MMA-like vibe was kind of the entire point of Raw Underground. As presented in WWE 2K25, the Underground Match really feels more like an old-fashioned Lights Out match.</p>
<h2><strong>Current thoughts on the WWE 2K25 Underground Match</strong></h2>
<p>WWE 2K25's Underground Match shows some potential, and I'm all for combing the WWE archives for weird relics that might work better in a game than they did on TV. That said, it's hard to shake the feeling Underground Matches were added to WWE 2K25 simply because they were something the dev team could pull off technically without too much difficulty. I could see some fans adding the Underground Match to their regular rotation while playing Exhibition with buddies, but compared to some other recent additions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k23-solid-midcard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WWE 2K23's Wargames</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2K24's Ambulance match</a>, this fight club isn't that much to talk about.</p>

<p>WWE 2K25 launches on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on March 14, although those who buy the Deadman or Bloodline special editions can play a week early on March 7.</p>

<p>The PlayStation Servers are the equivalent of a quality midfielder in EA FC 25, if you don’t have a good one, everything around you falls apart. EA’s servers are known for being hit-and-miss, but it’s another thing if PSN is lunging in with two-footed tackles to break things down.</p>



<p>EA FC 25 relies so heavily on Servers. The game’s biggest modes include Rivals, Champions, Rush, and Squad Battles, and the Servers can ruin any matches in the blink of an eye. It’s always been a complaint and one that likely isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>



<p>It’s not always EA’s fault EA FC 25 doesn’t work though. Xbox might have issues, but so might Sony and its PlayStation Network. Let’s look into the state of PSN for you right now to see if there’s a hitch in the formation.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-ea-fc-25-servers-down-right-now-on-playstation">Are EA FC 25 Servers Down Right Now on PlayStation?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Please help us, Zinedine. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You should be able to play EA FC 25 online after the servers were restored from the PlayStation Network outage on February 8.</strong></p>



<p>Not since the 2011 PlayStation Network outage has PSN been down this long. Alas, this is the case as Sony’s solid infrastructure is down for maintenance. You might have been unaware of this happening, so let’s fill you in on the timeline.</p>



<p>The early hours of February 8 saw the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Network go down</a> for maintenance across the board. This prevented players from accessing any PlayStation Network Services—crucially, online <strong>multiplayer</strong> being one.</p>



<p>PlayStation has been very hush-hush throughout the outage, outside of one message for the community during and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-posts-short-update-after-playstation-network-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one after</a>. The company’s <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ask PlayStation</a> X page communicated a message to PS users: “<strong>We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN.</strong>“</p>



<p><strong>EA FC 25 is currently playable on all formats</strong> as EA servers are working. If you do have access to EA FC 25 on another platform, you can still play online if you need a fix.</p>



<p>We have an up-to-date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSN Server Status tracker</a> monitoring the PlayStation Network’s status. Keep checking back with Insider Gaming for breaking updates.</p>



<hr>



<p>The PlayStation Network is having a detrimental effect on all online multiplayer gaming. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fortnite-down-on-playstation-now-fortnite-psn-servers-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-gta-down-on-playstation-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-down-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marvel-rivals-down-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> are all high-profile casualties throughout the maintenance.</p>



<p>Do you think PlayStation and Sony should be more vocal throughout this? Are PS users going to be handed a free game or two to make up for the chaos? Only time will tell. Drop a comment to let us know what you think about all of this.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 started as a single-player exclusive game, and then along came GTA Online. This live-service, open-world epic has been the backbone of the GTA franchise for more than a decade, and it’s where friends and foes alike congregate to share their crime-fuelled adventures.</p>



<p>Sadly, GTA Online is inherently tied to the wonders of the internet on PlayStation. That means if PSN goes offline, GTA 5 will be down – and <strong>that means </strong>that GTA Online will be offline too. In this guide, we’re taking a look at what to do if GTA Online stops working and answering a key question: ‘Is GTA 5 down on PlayStation?’</p>



<p>Let’s find out how you can check the GTA Online PSN server status.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-gta-down-on-ps5">Is GTA Down on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>GTA Online is down at the time of publishing due to an ongoing global issue with the PlayStation</strong> <strong>Network </strong>(last checked 08/02/25).</p>



<p>On February 8, the PlayStation Network buckled, crashing worldwide and plunging tens of millions of gamers into darkness. The major outage was a show-stopping event, taking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all PSN services offline</a> in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>For future reference, there are things you can do to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check the PSN server status</a>, but in most cases, it’s a matter of just waiting until the network comes back up again.</p>



<p>If GTA Online is down on PS5, you can bet your last dollar it’s offline on PS4, too.</p>



<p>Read on to check how you can figure out whether it’s a global outage or a more localised issue that’s taking GTA down on PlayStation.</p>

The service for PlayStation 5 and PS4 players that lets them go online, chat with friends, and do all the other things fans expect to do on a modern console is integral for playing everything from <em>Fortnite</em> to <em>Roblox</em>, and the extended (and unexplained) outage across all of these features is making fans restless. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,195670,195150" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The PlayStation status page shows online gaming, account management, social features, the store, and more all still experiencing issues that began around 6:00 p.m. ET on February 6. So what has Sony said about this unusual outage? The only acknowledgement is currently a single post on X that reads, “We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN.” </p><p>Players have wasted no time responding to the tweet (which currently has over 27,000 replies) and complaining about everything from the lack of further communication to all of the games that require an always-online connection to play or authenticate a license (like free downloadable games through a paid PS Plus subscription). Some are constantly checking their phones to see if service is back up while others are forced to contemplate actually going out in the world and engaging with society IRL. </p><figure id="" data-id="f9c512915447871307aa4d08172a6163" data-recommend-id="image://f9c512915447871307aa4d08172a6163" data-format="png" data-width="801" data-height="374" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows someone complaining about PSN.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>PSN being down means there’s no way to play some of the biggest games on PS5 right now, including <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>,<em> Marvel Rivals</em>, and <em>Helldivers 2</em>. The last of those just got a big update this week, while multiplayer functionality in <em>Madden NFL 25</em>, <em>EA Sports FC</em>, and<em> NBA2K25 </em>are also obviously all offline. </p><p>For some, the mysterious and protracted outage is already recalling nightmares of the infamous 2011 PSN fiasco that left the service offline for weeks following a hack that exposed over 70 million users’ data. A few fans are already proactively changing their PSN account logins in case that ends up being the case, though so far there’s no evidence of any security breach. </p><p>Other players are wondering if Sony will have a make-good for the extended downtime, especially on a Friday night heading into the weekend, a high traffic period for the network. Unlike on PC, PS5 and PS4 players have to pay for a monthly $10 subscription to PS Plus Essential to play online to begin with. More likely than not, PSN will just start working again sometime today or tomorrow and Sony will never speak of this outage again. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Remember when we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-hiking-prices-again-but-most-of-europe-has-escaped-for-now">Netflix was hiking prices again, but most of Europe had escaped</a>? Well, not anymore.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/feb/07/netflix-increase-uk-subscription-prices-despite-record-audience">The Guardian</a>, the streaming giant has now confirmed above-inflation price rises for UK subscribers, with its most popular non-ad-supported subscription increasing by £2 to £13 - that's an 18 percent hike - and its most expensive tier rising £1 to £19 a month.</p>

<p>Even the cheapest tier, which includes advertisements, has also increased by a pound to £6 per month. It now also costs an additional £1 to add an extra member to a package.</p>
<p>"We will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can reinvest to further improve Netflix," the company said, saying the increased fees help the firm "continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members".</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us at the time, the news comes as Netflix <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">celebrates its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history</a>, with 19m new customers having joined the streaming service in its most recent fourth quarter. And it's expecting to generate higher than forecast revenue in 2025, too.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-crys-animated-netflix-series-gets-april-release-date-and-a-limp-bizkit-opener">Netflix's animated adaptation of Devil May Cry is almost upon us</a>. The streaming service has announced the series premieres on 3rd April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
