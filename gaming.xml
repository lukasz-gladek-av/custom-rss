			<p>It's been a decade-long journey so far, and it'll have been over a decade by the time its finished, but we're nearing the completion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake Trilogy. With Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 currently in development, we're on the lookout for any bit of information we can get, and in a recent <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-director/">interview with VGC</a>, game director Naoki Hamaguchi provided a little more insight into the game's development.</p>



<p>Recently, Hamaguchi spoke about how he's looking to provide <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-new-gaming-experience-naoki-hamaguchi/">"<em>a new gaming experience</em>" </a>for players with Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, by which he meant Part 3 will have a different kind of focus compared to its predecessors. He also commented that he believes the conclusion to this decade-plus trilogy journey <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-ending-satisfy-old-time-fans-newcomers/">will satisfy old and new fans alike</a>, and with regard to when the game is coming, we heard from Tetsuya Nomura recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-tetsuya-nomura/">that Part 3 is "<em>on schedule</em>."</a></p>



<p>In this interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-director/">VGC</a>, Hamaguchi doubles down on how development for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 is progressing, saying, "<em>We're working really hard on the third game in the Remake series at the moment. It's coming along really</em> <em>well. I've got in my head the vision now, the gameplay structure, the gameplay experience, the core experience, and it's looking in a really good state.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It's something really satisfying that gamers can get their teeth into, and it'll be just a brilliant experience that it really should be and has to be. So we're going to work on that, brush that up even further, and then deliver it in the not-too-distant future. You really can look forward to the climax of the series, and it'll be exactly what you want it to be. So don't worry about that.</em> <em>It's coming, and it's just as good as you think it is. I'm very confident in the game that I'm making there.</em>"</p>



<p>Separately in the interview, Hamaguchi also commented about <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/">Part 3 coming to Nintendo Switch 2, along with the rest of the trilogy</a>. He did his best to reassure players that they don't have to worry about how the games will run on Switch 2, saying they've done "<em>some Switch 2-specific optimizations and further tweaks</em>" to make sure that the games will perform well on Nintendo's new console.</p>



<p>All things considered, it's good to hear how confident Hamaguchi is about Part 3, and it's good to hear that we'll get to see more in "<em>the not-so-distant future</em>." With one last major event left for the rest of the year, we might even be close enough to find out the official name of Part 3 at The Game Awards later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I consume a firehose of online content every day as part of my job. At some point in the last week, through a post, comment, or video I can no longer remember, I became aware of a shortcut for tinkering with the brightness on my Switch 2. Turns out this existed on the original Switch as well. All you have to do his hold down the home button to instantly bring up the slider. Eureka!</p> <p>I’ve had the old Switch since it launched back in March 2017. I still remember passing through the food court at the mall to pick it up from GameStop. Thousands of hours later, it feels slightly embarrassing to report that I never knew about this settings menu shortcut.</p>

 <p>I change my brightness settings a lot depending on where I’m sitting, the time of day, how bright it is outside, and who’s around me. To cut down on the glare in my porch room, I boost it to the max. To save battery on long car rides with the kids, I toggle it way down. In bed with my partner and two-year-old while grinding runs of <em>Hades 2</em>, I also keep the screen dim to not wake them up.</p>

 <p>And every damn time I did it, I was going back to the home screen, clicking on the settings, and going to the screen brightness bar. Was this the biggest hassle in the world? Obviously not! But I love games and I love gaming hardware and one of the cornerstones of that hobby is min-maxing and I felt a little pang of humiliation when I realized I’d been using my Switch sub-optimally all these years.</p> <p>No longer! Don’t be like me! Take the knowledge of this home button shortcut and go control your screen brightness the way Nintendo intended.</p>

<p>Activision has released a new trailer for Black Ops 7, bringing The Replacer back, with a twist. In this escapade, we learn how The Replacer is no longer The Replacer, and instead, he’s being… Replaced. We also see Jake Paul ejected into space, followed by a classic Wilhelm Scream that’s music to our ears.</p>



<p>This is serious, by the way. The trailer features the acting talents of Peter Stormare as always, but this time around, he’s being Replaced by none other than Terry Crews, who *checks notes* needs to pee.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is in <strong>danger</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-trailer-has-the-replacer-replaced">Black Ops 7 Trailer Has The Replacer Replaced</h2>



<p>The two-minute-and-some trailer uploaded on the Call of Duty social channels today might have you baulking at first glance, as it opens with none other than <strong>Jake Paul </strong>front and centre. However, thanks to the shrewd button-bashing skills of Peter ‘The Replacer’ Stormare, he’s quickly blasted from a spaceship and into the murky depths of the beyond.</p>



<p>At that point, The Replacer becomes confused as to who Jake Paul even <em>was</em>.</p>



<p>Here’s the new Black Ops 7 trailer:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As The Replacer realizes he has bitten off more than he can chew by Replacing a space captain, he finds himself adrift alongside ‘The First Baddie in Space’ and a baboon of some kind.</p>



<p>This is a serious trailer, by the way. </p>



<p>Fans have now expressed <strong>serious concerns </strong>that Jake Paul will be added to Black Ops 7 as an Operator. If you thought that blue skins were bad enough <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wicked-grin-skin-argument/">in Battlefield 6</a>, you’ll have a whole new issue to deal with if that comes true.</p>



<p>Terry Crews, on the other hand…</p>

                <p>According to Shawn Layden, a live-service game "isn't really a game." The former PlayStation executive said in an interview that a live-service game is better described as a "repetitive action engagement device."</p><p>Then what <em>is </em>a game? Speaking to <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/10/24/video-games/sony-playstation-online-multiplayer-live-service-struggles-concord-marathon" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Ringer</a>, Layden said a game needs three elements. "I need a story, I need a character, and I need a world," he said. "And Horizon, God of War, and Uncharted have all three of those things," he said. "If you're doing a live-service game, you just need a repetitive action that most people can get their head around, an ability to communicate in that world with other like-minded people, and [the player's] desire to do it again and again and again."</p><p>Layden left Sony in 2019. He hasn't said exactly why he left, but explained in the interview that live-service was "not my skillset." At the time, Sony was investing heavily in live-service and was planning to release a dozen live-service games by 2026. Sony later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">cut that projection in half</a>, and some of the titles it has released, like Concord, failed spectacularly. Others, like Helldivers 2, have been enormously successful.</p><p>Researcher Joost van Dreunen told The Ringer that Sony's misses in the live-service department "sting, but they're not fatal." He said, "Even if live-service fizzles, the PS5 business is strong. The real risk isn't collapse--it's wasted time and money that could've gone into what Sony already does best."</p><p>Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-1-billion-more-into-fortnite-studio-epic-games-to-help-create-the-metaverse/1100-6502349/" data-ref-id="1100-6502349">invested more than $1.45 billion into Fortnite developer Epic Games</a>, so the company likely stands to benefit as Fortnite continues to grow and grow. Sony is also continuing to invest in its own live-service projects, and the next big release is Bungie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>. The game has already had a rocky road to release, though, as it was delayed indefinitely and is caught up in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">art theft scandal.</a></p><p>For his part, Layden said companies should not look to live-service to help turn their businesses around. "If you're trying to go into that space because you have this illusion in your mind of big sacks of money coming every day for the rest of your life, for most it doesn't happen," he said.</p><p>In 2023, one of PlayStation's most important people, Connie Booth, left the company after 30+ years. She has never explained her departure, but former PlayStation developer David Scott Jaffe, the creator of Twisted Metal and co-creator of God of War, said<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJ8WO7ovDE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Booth was fired</a>.</p><p>"She was fired. She was not let go. She didn't retire. She didn't quit. She was fired," Jaffe said.</p><p>Jaffe went on to say that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-ceo-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-2024/1100-6518034/" data-ref-id="1100-6518034">former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan</a> gave a mandate for PlayStation's teams to make more games-as-a-service titles, which in turn reportedly upset a number of PlayStation developers. "All of this was somehow blamed on Connie," Jaffe said. "The blame has fallen on Connie."</p><p>One Sony live-service game that is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-went-wrong-with-the-last-of-us-online-according-to-an-ex-sony-exec/1100-6529585/" data-ref-id="1100-6529585">not going forward is Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Online</a>, which Neil Druckmann said was the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-is-naughty-dogs-most-ambitious-title-ever-druckmann-says/1100-6510559/" data-ref-id="1100-6510559">most ambitious game ever.</a> A live-service God of War game was reportedly planned at one point as well before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">apparently getting canceled.</a></p><p>Another upcoming live-service game from Sony is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fairgames-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529539/" data-ref-id="1100-6529539">Fairgame$</a>, but Sony has been quiet on the project of late, even as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-live-service-game-fairgame-loses-another-key-developer/1100-6534409/" data-ref-id="1100-6534409">multiple senior staff have left, including the founder of its development studio.</a> Despite all of this, Sony has said time and time again that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-remains-committed-to-live-service-but-doesnt-mention-fairgame/1100-6534742/" data-ref-id="1100-6534742">remains committed to live-service</a> and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">learned from the mistakes of Concord.</a></p>

Borderlands 4 is no different, with the legendary shield Cindershelly treating you like a sub to its dom. But, apparently, this armament wasn't supposed to bark smutty lines as often as Gearbox Software coded it to.</p><p>Borderlands 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-update-adds-halloween-event-and-more/1100-6535671/" data-ref-id="1100-6535671">October 23 update</a> made an assortment of changes while also adding a Halloween event to the looter-shooter.

That doesn't sound like anything special, but when you consider how horny the shield was and how often it catcalled, you'd think that maybe you were getting hit on the entire time you ventured around the world of Kairos.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As PC Gamer noted, some of the voice lines were especially raunchy. Cindershelly would say things like "Touch that barrel and scream for me" and "Don't stop till I allow it." The legendary shield would then keep going, telling you to "Show me how close you can get, worm," and "Worship me." Apparently, it got worse in combat, as these lines would trigger when doing or taking damage, which happens all the time in a Borderlands game.</p><p>Cindershelly was built by the Order, a weapons manufacturer for The Timekeeper's army. The shield is a random loot drop, like most gear in Borderlands 4, but you have a greater chance of finding it from The Backhive in The Fadefields' Auger Mine in the Dissected Plateau. It's a solid piece of loot that grants you damage reduction and emits an AOE blast that deals damage once it breaks, based on your Resolve stacks. And now, it's gotten that much better because you'll likely get less turned on since it won't sexily insult you as much--if getting turned on by pixels is a thing you're into.</p><p>Cindershelly isn't the only horny piece of gear in the franchise. Borderlands 2 had the effervescent sniper Hot Mama that, like Borderlands 4's super-horny shield, spoke suggestive innuendos at you while gunning goons down. Welcome to the Goonerlands, everyone, I guess.</p><p>Borderlands 4 is out now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. A Nintendo Switch 2 port is in the works, but has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/" data-ref-id="1100-6534965">pushed out of its October 3 release</a> to ensure it meets the quality Gearbox Software expects of it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders%E2%80%99-impressive-accessibility-features-are-a-rarity-for-nintendo.1334320/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The latest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/805281/tmi-about-kirby">Nintendo Direct on October 23rd</a> brought us an hour-long dive into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/781177/kirby-air-riders-feels-more-like-f-zero-than-mario-kart"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a>, as well as a surprising accessibility announcement. Hosted by game director Masahiro Sakurai, the Direct showed off more features, gameplay, and modes for the racing game releasing for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">the Switch 2</a> on November 20th. Tucked toward the end of the presentation, however, Sakurai devoted a few minutes to <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>’ accessibility options. It was a welcome spotlight on an aspect of game design Nintendo regularly forgets, though not necessarily a sign of broader change for the company.</p><p>An impressive suite of options includes button remapping, changeable text size — something missing from many games, but vital on the Switch 2’s smaller undocked screen — colorblind filters, preset options for changing the size and opacity of the HUD, and a toggle for onscreen outlines (though this was the only menu option not demonstrated during the Direct). Unlike with previous first-party Switch 2 games, inputs can be remapped in-game as opposed to solely through the Switch 2’s system-level options. You can also save named profiles for quick switching and set up the controls so the game is playable one-handed.</p><p>After presenting this list, Sakurai focused in on something he wanted to implement “no matter what” — motion sickness mitigations. In <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> you can add onscreen markers, ostensibly of varying thicknesses and colors, and change the field of view to reduce the perception of motion. Alternatively, you can turn camera shake and tilt off altogether, all of which can be visualized within the menu. For greater simplicity, there are also preset options for visual accessibility from “none” to “medium” and “strong.”</p><p>It’s a boon for players, especially disabled players — not just that these features are included but that they’re being communicated ahead of release. Accessibility menus beyond the bare-bones remain rare from Nintendo’s first-party titles, and it’s significant that a tentpole title from the Switch 2’s release year takes such a major step toward a more accessible and customizable experience. That said, we should temper our expectations of what this means going forward.</p><p>To be clear, this <em>should </em>be a precedent for Nintendo to follow — not just in the maintenance of these features in future titles, but also further accessibility development. But it should be noted that Sakurai has taken a greater personal interest in accessibility over the past few years, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS4CZkBBbW4">particularly in the impact of motion sickness</a>. The evidence of the past six months suggests that the impetus behind <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>’ accessibility considerations likely comes from Sakurai and his team, rather than Nintendo as a whole.</p><div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686591/nintendo-switch-2-accessibility-features-analysis">system-level accessibility improvements in the Switch 2</a> were a similar cause for excitement that they might represent a meaningful change for Nintendo. Instead, the first-party games that followed released with few, if any, accessibility considerations. This culminated in <em>Drag x Drive</em>, where that apathy was more keenly felt in a game depicting wheelchair basketball and yet utilizing inaccessible mouse controls. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/758328/drag-x-drive-review">Nintendo’s suggested players seek mitigations in system-level menus</a>.</p></div><p>Similarly, previous ostensible precedents have proven otherwise. In 2020, <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>appeared to be a turning point for accessibility in gaming going forward. Notably, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2BX4yw8Z4Y">Sakurai praised <em>The Last of Us Part I</em>’s accessibility</a> and cited it as a title from which he learned a lot about accessibility not long before starting development on <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> — only for the broader industry to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/669419/gaming-industry-accessibility-cutbacks">deprioritize accessibility in years since</a>.</p><p>None of which is to say we shouldn’t celebrate this surprising and sudden increase in accessibility in a first-party Nintendo release, nor that players shouldn’t be excited. Looking at the care Sakurai and his development team have taken to make <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>more accessible is a rare bright spot in this industry. It behooves us, however, to not get carried away in regarding this as a turning point at Nintendo given how strongly history suggests otherwise.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTgxMTk="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Geoffrey Bunting</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/806242/kirby-air-riders-accessibility-features-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo has released a new trailer for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment. In it, we see intense combat, including two newly revealed characters, such as a talking Korok, joining the roster.</p>



<p>The Hyrule Warriors series has been going strong for more than 10 years, combining the beautiful world of Legend of Zelda and the hack-and-slash gameplay of Dynasty Warriors. The last release, Age of Calamity, adapted Breath of the Wild and told the story of the Guardians during the Great Calamity. Now, we get to see the original Guardians that took a stand against Ganon, which is shown in flashbacks in Tears of the Kingdom. With its November 6th, 2025 release coming up, a new trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-release-date-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> shows off more of the game’s story and Musou gameplay, alongside some fresh faces.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYpLBmy7xMw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, we get some new footage of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, including story and gameplay. We see the first Guardians battle it out with Ganon’s limitless forces, with King Rauru at the helm. As Zelda is transported there after being attacked by Ganon during the beginning of Tears of the Kingdom, she, like us, will be learning as we go. Still, some new faces have joined the fight, including a traveling talking Korok named Calamo and a transforming Zonai called the Mysterious Construct.</p>



<p>As it takes place during the battle between Rauru and Ganon, we see fresh faces not shown in Tears of the Kingdom. There is a lot of room for the narrative to go, so fans will be in for a big treat. Even still, Koei Tecmo, it’s developing team, have been on a roll recently with Dynasty Warriors: Origins and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-world-record-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>. Seeing as Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity was great, Age of Imprisonment looks to be just as good, if not better.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-have-skill-based-matchmaking-blops-7-sbmm-explained.1334311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Black Ops 7 SBMM conversation has dominated the lead-up to the game’s launch, so let’s see if Activision has finally pulled back on skill-based matchmaking.</p>



<p>If you’re in the gaming circle and you’ve never heard the term ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skill-based matchmaking</a>,’ you’re a lucky cat. The FPS community can’t go a week without bringing up SBMM. The more people learn about it, the more it becomes talked about, and the more mainstream it becomes, the more of an issue it becomes in shooters.</p>



<p>With Black Ops 7 needing a big push to match <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> this year, a lack of SBMM could be the key.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-sbmm-in-black-ops-7">Is SBMM In Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Breakthrough. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is finally doing away with skill-based matchmaking, as the default matchmaking system will no longer just take into account a player’s skill level when forming lobbies.</strong></p>



<p>There it is. The one thing the CoD community has been crying out for over the last few years. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-will-have-non-disbanding-lobbies-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 will use ‘Open Matchmaking’</a> to create online multiplayer lobbies. On paper, this is going to be the most open and lottery-esque Call of Duty multiplayer title in years.</p>



<p>Here’s the official statement from Call of Duty:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We can confirm that Open Matchmaking with minimal skill consideration will be the default for Black Ops 7 Multiplayer. Additionally, to help keep players together from match to match more often, persistent lobbies will be coming to Black Ops 7 at launch on November 14.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The persistent lobbies change is also a welcome addition for many. Activision is seemingly throwing two Hail Marys to win over players and ensure it reigns supreme in the FPS war for the next year.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-skill-based-matchmaking-do-in-call-of-duty">What Does Skill-Based Matchmaking Do In Call of Duty?</h2>



<p><strong>Skill-based matchmaking is an algorithm that uses player data to determine matchmaking factors ahead of everything else in Call of Duty and other leading multiplayer titles with SBMM.</strong></p>



<p>Let’s simplify this: In Black Ops 6, the lobbies you were put into were predominantly determined by how the game adjudged your individual skill level. Let’s say that your combined K/D and W/L for the last 10 matches have been decent, and the game has given you a skill rating of 1.25 (for argument’s sake), Black Ops 6’s matchmaking would then try to put you in a lobby with other players that also have a 1.25 skill rating—give or take a few points.</p>



<p>If you have several bad games in a row, your skill rating could drop, and then you’re suddenly put in with players who (on average) are much worse than you. This means you should be able to dominate the lobby and be the MVP. But doing so would catapult your skill rating again and put you back with players on your level.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has followed in XDefiant’s path by removing SBMM by default. This means you’ll spend the full year being put into lobbies with players of all skill levels, with an emphasis likely on regional proximity over player similarity.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The Call of Duty community is unmatched, and we thank you for joining us in the Black Ops 7 Beta over the last week. This Beta has provided Treyarch the opportunity to try new things and rapidly test and implement player feedback. </p><p>Building on this feedback, we can confirm that… <a href="https://t.co/BKDWLCtoR2">pic.twitter.com/BKDWLCtoR2</a></p></div>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1976285658672136344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>You’ve all wanted it, so now you can’t complain this year! Black Ops 7 has officially gone rogue, and all bets are off where matchmaking is concerned.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-night-striker-gear-switch-the-shining-apex-of-the-super-scaler-concept.1334287/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Night Striker Gear Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159842/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Imagine, if you will, an alternate timeline where 3D graphics never happened.</p>
<p>Instead, Sega's 'Super Scaler' concept — popularised in games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/3d_super_hang-on">Hang-On</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_space_harrier">Space Harrier</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_out_run">Out Run</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/3d_after_burner_ii">After Burner</a> — evolves to the point where 2D sprites can not only be scaled without any degradation in visual fidelity, but are capable of filling the entire screen. That future is basically what you're looking at when you play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/night_striker_gear">Night Striker Gear</a>, a sequel to Taito's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/operation_night_strikers">1989 coin-op</a>, which has been developed by M2 and its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=series%3Am2-shottriggers">ShotTriggers</a> team.</p>
<p>Directed by the legendary Hiroshi Iuchi (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/radiant_silvergun">Radiant Silvergun</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ikaruga">Ikaruga</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/sin_and_punishment">Sin &amp; Punishment</a>), Night Striker Gear is conceptually the same as its forerunner; you control the INTER-GRAY, a flying car which dashes through a series of levels destroying enemies and taking down bosses before selecting a branching pathway to the next stage.</p>
<figure><a title="Night Striker Gear Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159847/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The most obvious evolution here is the visuals, which are quite simply staggering. Everything is composed of 2D sprites, but they're of such high quality that even when viewed up close, the pixelation is barely noticeable. However, they scale and move with insane smoothness and speed, all of which delivers an experience which feels like a late '80s coin-op on steroids.</p>
<p>Factor in some excellent lighting, explosion and particle effects, and you've got a true visual feast (and one which sounds great, too – it has some fantastic music). Yet it's one that is curiously at odds with modern gaming's obsession with hyper-real 3D graphics.</p>
<p>M2 hasn't merely taken Night Striker's gameplay and spruced up the presentation; it has introduced plenty of additional features to make this sequel feel fresh and new.</p>
<p>You can now transform your INTER-GRAY craft into a robot (known as 'GEAR') which comes equipped with powerful homing shots. This state is only active for as long as your 'GEAR' gauge lasts; this is built up over time as you take down enemies or collect special power-ups.</p>
<figure><a title="Night Striker Gear Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159843/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a risk-and-reward element at play here, as, when your GEAR gauge is full, it improves the firepower of your craft in its standard form. Transforming into robot mode makes boss encounters (of which there are two per stage) easier, but you'll lose the benefit of homing shots when you return to INTER-GRAY mode – so deployment of the GEAR is paramount to success.</p>
<p>Enemies attack in waves, and many of these include a red 'captain' – take them out, and the entire wave is destroyed, lending things a welcome sense of tactical depth. Your shield is capable of taking five hits by default, but you'll gain additional levels (or replenish spent shields) if you take down a particular enemy and when you complete each stage.</p>
<p>As well as the standard mode (which offers three difficulty settings), you have 'Pacifist Mode', where your offensive capabilities are removed and the goal is simply to avoid incoming fire. This might sound pointless, but this mode is, in reality, the perfect way to hone your evasive skills for the 'main' mode. Much of the challenge in Night Striker Gear revolves around avoiding enemy shots, and there's no better way of perfecting those skills than in Pacifist Mode.</p>
<figure><a title="Night Striker Gear Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159840/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are multiple endings to encounter depending on which route through the game you take, and accessing the final 'G' zone requires you to fulfil specific objectives (as far as I can gather, getting a 'Wipe Out' bonus on any level – killing every single enemy – unlocks it). Add in unlockable modes and there's a lot of longevity on offer here – much more than the seemingly simple premise might suggest.</p>
<p>It's also an incredibly challenging experience, especially on 'Normal' and 'Hard' settings – so much so that Iuchi has taken a leaf out of his Radiant Silvergun playbook by increasing your available stock of continues (three to begin with) the longer you play. This not only encourages repeat runs but also serves to make things a little easier as time goes on. Online leaderboards further enhance the game's long-term appeal.</p>
<p>While Night Striker Gear's twitch gameplay is quite straightforward — which should come as no surprise, given its arcade heritage — the stern challenge, multiple routes (and endings), online rankings and unlockable content make it a surprisingly deep package, especially when you take the low price into account.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Space Harrier-style gameplay might not be to everyone's tastes, but the visuals are absolutely jaw-dropping, and it's almost worth the asking price alone in order to experience them. While Night Striker Gear's appeal won't last forever, it's such an incredible audio-sensory thrill ride that you can easily forgive it for any shortcomings relating to its longevity.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of this style of game and love chasing high scores, then this is a near-essential purchase. Like so many of Sega and Taito's 'Super Scaler' efforts from the '80s and '90s, Night Striker Gear is one of those games you simply <em>have</em> to experience at least once, even if the ride doesn't last forever.</p></section>

			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is finally here, and before you jump into Obsidian Entertainment's new space-faring adventure in its dystopian world, this guide will help give you a leg-up with some tips and tricks to survive and thrive in The Outer Worlds 2.</p>



<p>It should go without saying that I won't be delving into any story spoilers, but incase it needed to be said, there it is. If you want to check out more about The Outer Worlds 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/">then go look at my full review for the game.</a></p>

<h3 id="h-abl-always-be-looting">ABL: Always Be Looting</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There's no such thing as carrying too much or your bag being too heavy and making you move slower in The Outer Worlds 2, so it's in your best interest to pick up everything that's not nailed down. Loot it all! Show no remorse! Plunder every corpse, unlocked box, locked box, safe, anything you can get your hands on.</p>



<p>But be aware when you're trying to grab something that'll be marked as 'Stolen.' You can steal without repercussions so long as there's no one nearby to see you do it. If there's a witness, however, you'll lose standing with whichever faction you've just stolen from. Not much at first, but keeping it up will make it all the more difficult to go into towns and settlements safely and without being attacked. </p>

<p>Realistically, you can build your character however you like, putting all your points into a few, multiple, or even just one skill on your journey to the level cap at level 30. Each time you level up you get to two Skill Points to spend however you like, and making those choices are all part of the RPG side of The Outer Worlds 2.</p>



<p>But if I could make one recommendation, it would be to level up your Speech skill. Talking to people is arguably half of the whole gameplay experience in The Outer Worlds 2, and while different skills can give you different conversation options, Speech is the skill to level to solve most problems without violence, convince others of your point of view, and, frankly, the one that gives you more interesting conversation options.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-underestimate-the-power-of-shock-and-plasma">Don't Underestimate the Power of Shock and Plasma</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With how many different weapons there are in The Outer Worlds 2, you'll practically be tripping over them and the weapon modifications you can make. Tweaking and adjusting your loadout is key to ensuring that you can survive any encounter you have.</p>



<p>But don't put too much stock into the overall damage output number that appears with each weapon. Pay much more attention to the kinds of elemental damage you can do with different elemental modifications, specifically Plasma and Shock.</p>



<p>A weapon with Plasma damage that technically has a lower overall damage number compared to a weapon without Plasma damage will do more damage overall, with how Plasma effects can stack, and with how Plasma does damage to enemies over time. The same goes for Shock damage, which is especially effective against the automechanical enemies you'll face.</p>



<p>You're essentially always better off going with elemental damage for your weapons over base damage stats.</p>



<h3 id="h-some-companions-are-more-useful-than-others">Some Companions are More Useful Than Others</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Niles in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Over the course of your journey in The Outer Worlds 2, you'll recruit six companions who join you on your adventures, with two of them coming outside of the ship with you. Each of them can help you in different ways, with some being more useful in combat while others are better to have around when you're exploring. </p>



<p>Again, picking which companions join you when you get out of your ship is part of the role-playing you'll do in The Outer Worlds 2, but one of the first two companions you get in the game is arguably the most useful to keep around in your party at all times, and that's Niles.</p>



<p>He's great for taking heat off you in combat, but where his usefulness really lies is outside of it, because you'll always be able to turn to him and craft ammo, weapon mods, armor mods, updates for your companions; pretty much anything you can do at a Workbench, Niles can do for you on the go.</p>



<p>Yes, you'll be able to find Workbenches at different spots in The Outer Worlds 2, but when you're in the middle of trekking across one of the planets you explore in the Arcadia system, particularly early on in the game, it's easy to find yourself low on ammo and health. Having Niles with you means you can use the resources you've collected to keep yourself going, without having to fast-travel back to a town to restock and make the trek back out to where you were, which you'll have to do on foot because running across the map is the only way to get from place to place until you've unlocked fast travel points.</p>



<h3 id="h-do-drugs-keep-your-health-up">Do Drugs, Keep Your Health Up</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To clarify, I'm not actually advocating you do drugs in real life. But within The Outer Worlds 2, your inhaler, which is essentially a toxic drug that refills your health bar and can kill you if you overdose on it, is an important element to keep an eye on.</p>



<p>Specifically, you'll want to keep an eye on how many Inhaler Charges you have at any given time. Running out means you can't heal while in combat, even if you know you have food resources in your inventory, ready for you to eat. You can eat them outside of combat, but not during. Your Inhaler is the only way to stay alive in the middle of a fight, and you'll always want to make sure you have enough charges to get you through any situation.</p>



<p>Basically, you'll want to craft as many charges as possible and/or purchase and collect as many resources as possible to give you additional charges. Right from the beginning of the game, you can have as many charges as you have the resources for, so stocking up on as many as possible ensures you'll be able to get through any fight, so long as you give yourself the time and space to let the charge heal you, and let your toxicity drain. </p>



<p>Speaking of toxicity drain, another point is to find armour that drains your toxicity faster as soon as possible. Draining your toxicity level faster means you can use your Inhaler sooner and more often in combat, to help you get through any situation. </p>

              <p><span>Ever since </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>stopped including every monster in every game with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fans-i-need-yall-to-shut-up-about-dexit-1839949110"><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i></a><span>, someone’s favorite probably gets left behind in each new release. Sure, they might show up in the next game or two, but there are over 1000 of these guys now, and everyone’s bound to get benched now and then. Up until last week, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/only-three-pokemon-are-catchable-in-every-game-but-not-1850461272"><span>only three Pokémon could claim to be catchable in every single RPG</span></a><span>. Now that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is out, two of those are off the list, leaving only one left in every game. And no, it’s not Pikachu, the electric mouse and mascot of the whole franchise.</span></p> <p><span>Magikarp is, as of this writing, the only Pokémon you can obtain normally in every </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPG. This means without trades, hacks, or anything outside the scope of the game. The floundering fish that evolves into one of the most fearsome monsters in the franchise has kept this streak for almost 30 years, thanks to a salesman in </span><i><span>Pokémon Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span> who would give you the water Pokémon. </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>was the combo breaker for almost every other Pokémon because its dex was made up almost entirely of brand new Pokémon from the Unova region, meaning Pikachu, Charizard, and many other mainstays were only available in the post-game. Psyduck and Magnemite were also catchable in </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>through some extremely roundabout means, but they were there, too.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000638880" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638880"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638880">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Now, however, Psyduck and Magnemite are nowhere to be found in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>. This might change with the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC, as they were both reinstated to the ranks of Magikarp through </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>’s DLC, but for now, there’s no sign of the headache-ridden duck or the sentient magnets, making Magikarp the reigning champ. For now, at least.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Phil Spencer has revealed that there is no top-down mandate to use AI for Xbox.</p>



<p>Some new details about Xbox have surfaced recently through an interview with the president, Sarah Bond. Bond recently stated that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-president-says-console-exclusives-are-antiquated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">idea of exclusive games is now antiquated</a>. She also confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-president-confirms-series-x-s-successors-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Series X/S successors</a> are in development. Now, a new interview with Phil Spencer talks about Xbox’s approach to AI. </p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-lets-creative-teams-choose-whether-they-want-to-use-ai">Xbox Lets Creative Teams Choose Whether They Want to Use AI</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://in.ign.com/xbox-series-s/245018/news/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-on-ai-use-much-more-operational-than-it-is-in-the-creative-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, during a panel at the Paley International Council Summit in Palo Alto, California (moderated by Double Fine Studio Head Tim Schafer), Phil Spencer spoke about the use of AI at Xbox. Spencer first spoke about how most use is focused on the “security and protection” of their networks. He added that the scale has grown so much that people alone cannot ensure safety. </p>



<p>Which is why they use AI to keep a check on the conversation and topics, protect child accounts, see who gets to talk to those people, and whether the account is locked down by parents or guardians who are setting those controls. </p>



<p>On the creative side of things at Xbox, AI use is left to the teams. Spencer explains that he has&nbsp;“found that creative teams will use tools that make their job easier when it makes their job easier, and any top-down mandate that ‘Thou must use a certain tool’…is not really a path to success.” The process is to make tools available for the teams and let things “organically percolate”. </p>

<p>It seems that 2023’s Game of the Year, Baldur’s Gate 3, could make its way to the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>The Switch 2 is set to receive a whole bunch of new titles in the coming days, with Metroid Prime 4 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows </a>arriving in December 2025, followed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-nintendo-switch-2-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4 anniversary edition in 2026</a>. It seems that the next title Nintendo could be looking to add to its third-party collection is Larian Studios’ critically acclaimed hit. </p>



<h2 id="h-baldur-s-gate-3-could-be-a-great-third-party-addition-for-the-switch-2">Baldur’s Gate 3 Could be a Great Third-Party Addition for the Switch 2</h2>



<p>The talk about Baldur’s Gate 3 coming to the Switch 2 originates from NateTheHate’s recent reply on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1980357667035181154" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). In one of his recent replies, the insider was asked whether he had any updates for Red Dead Redemption 2’s launch for the platform. To which he replied, stating he doesn’t have anything new on RDR2, but he has “heard something on BG3 for SW2”. However, he needs “more verification” before he can share anything. In a later reply, Nate stated that he will update on this topic soon. </p>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 is a solid choice for Nintendo Switch 2 as it’s one of the most decorated titles out there. In April 2024, the title became the first game to win Game of the Year at all five major award ceremonies, including the Golden Joystick Awards, the Game Developers’ Choice Awards, the DICE Awards, the BAFTAs, and The Game Awards. The game has also received a lot of post-launch love from the developers, including loads of new content and enhancements to improve the gameplay experience. </p>

<p>Some of the improvements revolve around "core movement and animations," which include smoothing landings, speeding up stance transitions, and reducing "bouncing" issues. Other adjustments are centered on "weapon dispersion" to make guns feel and shoot better. The patch will also overhaul audio, update the HUD and UI, and fix map problems to address spawn animations and misaligned assets to improve overall stability.</p><p>Elsewhere in the massive update are fixes to player movements, such as dives and ziplines, as well as tweaks to vehicles like missing haptic feedback when switching tank weapons.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Silver Pines is a Twin Peaks-inspired 2D survival horror metroidvania game (how often does one of those come along) that'll arrive on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 sometime in 2026 from developer Wych Elm Games and publisher Team17. </p>



<p>The game follows Red Walker, a private investigator who has been hired to find Eddie Velvet, a musician who has mysteriously vanished, though, as you might already suspect, while looking for Velvet, Walker begins to uncover a deeper plot and darker mystery behind Velvet's disappearance.</p>



<p>Its art style and survival horror gameplay make it seem like a truly unique debut title from this new indie team. Silver Pines was first announced during the Galaxies Showcase yesterday, and is an easy addition for indie games to look out for as we inch closer to 2026.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>You'll be fighting off shadows while solving puzzles to try and get to the bottom of Velvet's disappearance, which could also lead to Walker's own redemption, as he struggles to deal with a dark history of his own.</p>



<p>We get a lot of horror games, but few of them look like this. Silver Pines seems to be dripping with atmosphere and narrative potential, and it'll be particularly interesting to see how its metroidvania navigational focus plays into the story it's trying to tell.</p>

<p>Hopefully, we will hear more about this game soon and will be able to jump into Silver Pines in time for Halloween 2026. It's always exciting when a new indie studio puts out a trailer like this with a game looking like it could just be the dark horse hit yet for next year.</p>



<p>If you're looking for more horror games, and ones that you don't have to wait until next year to play, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/lovecraftian-survival-horror-shooter-beneath-release-date-pc-consoles/">you should check out Beneath</a>, a new Lovecraftian horror shooter that's out on PC and consoles in just a few days from the time of this writing on October 27.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has hit a major download milestone since launching almost a year ago, and that there are some big bonuses in the offing for players to celebrate the game's impending first birthday.</p>

<p>As announced in an <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-Trading-Card-Game-Pocket-Celebrates-Its-First-Anniversary-and-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has been downloaded over 150 million times across Android and iOS since its launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date" rel="nofollow">on October 23rd last year</a>.</p>

<p>While it's certainly true that not everyone who downloaded the game will still be playing it (and still fewer may have spent actual money on anything within the app), it was reported back in December that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow">a real moneyspinner for developer DeNA</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-downloads-eevee.jpg?itok=851_Dorq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-downloads-eevee.jpg?itok=M6Ukpfeo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has attracted a ton of downloads since launching last year.</figcaption></figure><p>As part of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s birthday celebrations, you can expect a new campaign that will grant you one of each of the new booster packs from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-expansion" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>expansion</a> starting from next week.</p>

<p>New missions and promo reissue events will also be arriving alongside these packs, and you can look forward to new in-app updates landing soon as well, including the new Share feature, an expanded range of cards to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow">traded</a>, and more.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it's a digital version of the popular&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>trading card game in which you can open digital booster packs, trade cards with your friends, and battle using custom-built (or pre-built!) decks.</p>

<p>Since launch, various expansions have been released for the game, including the likes of the Gen 2-themed&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow"><em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em></a>, the Eevee-centric&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow"><em>Eevee Grove</em></a>, and the cosmic&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow">Celestial Guardians</a>&nbsp;</em>set, among many others.</p>




<p>The game has also been the subject of controversy and criticism; when the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>launched, an immersive art card was pulled from&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>over <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">accusations of plagiarism</a>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the trading feature was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-tokens" rel="nofollow">met with widespread criticism</a> when it was first added to the game, prompting DeNA and The Pokemon Company to award players free trade tokens by way of an apology.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.</p>

              <p>What do you expect from a sequel? That’s a question I’ve been asking myself ever since <a href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-sim-2-trailer-release-campaign-splitscreen-1851769691">the first trailer</a> for the follow-up to 2022’s glorious&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, which showed off a lot more of what has come before, but with slightly prettier graphics. Now that I’ve spent a good six hours playing the released version of <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, and having a thoroughly good time doing so, I’m still pondering the same question. Because while I’m delighted to have a whole load of new dirty buildings and vehicles to spray, I really don’t feel like I’m playing a whole new game.</p> <p>To describe 2022’s original is to describe 2025’s&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>. It’s a game about jet-washing enormous structures that are covered in dirt and mud, with a growing variety of jets, nozzles and sprays. Your job is to remove every last speck of dirt, at which point you get paid, can buy more gear, and then move on to the next project. It should be the dumbest thing, and yet it proves outstandingly soothing, even cathartic, as you methodically make a gross thing get shiny and clean. And while I’m delighted to report <em>PW2</em> improves on the original in a bunch of different ways, what this amounts to is tweaks, streamlining the more fussy and less enjoyable aspects, and fixing the weirdness of how the first game handled soap. All very welcome, but none of it revolutionary. This is a refinement, not a step forward, and that leaves me in the peculiar position of being very happy playing the game, while still fundamentally disappointed to not have something <em>new</em>.</p>

  <p>Given that I don’t have any big new concepts to introduce, let’s get right on to talking about those improvements. First up, while the menus are still ludicrously convoluted, the very worst aspect of the first game’s store is gone: soap. In <em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, you needed to buy refills for all manner of different types of detergent for different dirty surfaces—costly refills that lasted literally seconds, and I still suspect made little to no difference at all. You could sort of convince yourself it made a brick wall clean a bit faster, but it could just as easily have been a placebo effect. Now that’s all gone, and soap is just a thing you always have. In fact, it’s a single button press to swap between your washer and your soap-sprayer, with suds collecting on dirty surfaces in a very satisfying way. It’s something that the first game should have done.</p>

 <p>Oh, and it now makes a difference. You’ll occasionally find bits of stubborn dirt, especially on glass, that won’t just spray off with water. So click, soap, click, spray, and now it’ll go. It adds a tiny extra element, and its unfussy and rewarding to do. It’s something the first game should have done.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638868" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638868"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638868">© FuturLab / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Next up is a more rational use of your home base. In the first game you’d occasionally wash people’s vehicles in your own garage, and the game made play of the fact that you owned this business and building, but in the end it was only scenery. While it honestly doesn’t add anything significant, your business’s offices are really nicely used in <em>PW2</em>. They’re explorable, and you can spend your money on furniture and trinkets to decorate the space—completely pointless, but with the lovely bonus of everything you buy being utterly filthy (where are you shopping?!), and needing you to powerwash them clean first. Upstairs are your offices, including shelves covered in trinkets based on each completed job that let you return to play them again outside of story mode, and then a large map of the area from which you can choose story and bonus missions. Or you can eschew this entirely and just access the jobs from the menu as before. (But if you did, you’d miss out on playing with your three pet cats.) It’s something the first game should have done.</p>

 <p>Beyond this…um. Come on, there has to be something else…Oh! You can move the ladders and frames around more easily, and while it still seems to be using the same broken tech that has them refuse to be put down in completely legitimate places but happy to be placed so they’re clipped through walls, it’s all better to use. Those huge frames with all the steps now have ladders on the outside so you can rapidly reach the top, and there are also mechanical cherry pickers for reaching far higher. It’s all stuff the first game should have done.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638865" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638865"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638865">© FuturLab / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course, it’s also a prettier game. Not only is everything more detailed and better lit, but there are nice effects such as little animations of splattered dirt as you clean, and both water and soap effects that make them look as though they’re flowing. They’re not though, and that’s such a damned shame, because some actual physics was my number one wish for this sequel. It’s aesthetically pleasing, but you still have nothing like water trickling down surfaces, or mud puddling at the bottom to be washed away, or any of the seemingly obvious features to add to a sequel.</p>

 <p>That was, in fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-2-dlc-clean-dirt-futurlab-1851773438">one of two elements I suggested a <em>PowerWash</em> sequel would definitely have to add</a>. The other, and it’s far more damning that this hasn’t improved, is the way the game either has a still very dirty surface suddenly PING! clean before you’re done washing it, or has you hunting down the single pixel of dirt on a railing before it’ll let you move on. My theory on this in the first game was that it must be based on the percentage of dirt remaining on any section—perhaps deciding a surface is clean if you’ve cleared maybe 98 percent of the dirt. So if you have a huge flat area of wall, that remaining two percent is incredibly visible and annoying when you’re not allowed to clear it, while on a tiny feature it’s a microscopic speck that’s infuriating to find. And, maddeningly, it’s exactly the same here. I don’t know how to make video games, but I still believe that changing the math from “percentage of total surface” to “percentage of total surface relative to size” cannot be an insurmountable problem.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000638866" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638866"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638866">© FuturLab / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’m incredibly aware of just how ridiculous I sound, picking apart these elements in a lighthearted game about washing playgrounds, with a storyline about some gems being stolen from a giant merman statue whose magic beam had been preventing a volcano from erupting. Not least considering that I’m thoroughly enjoying the game! But then, I’m still mostly at a loss as to how this isn’t just a giant DLC pack for the first game with some necessary UI improvements. Or as we used to say in the olden days, an expansion pack.</p> <p>So yes, please, if you were for some reason waiting for my blessing to spend your $25 on&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> (or to download it from Game Pass I guess), then yes, go right ahead! Heck, $25 would be a great price for an expansion pack of this enormous size! This is very much <em>PowerWash Simulator But Slightly Better</em>, and that’s a good thing to have. It’s not a sequel though, really, is it? Is it? I don’t bloody know.</p>
