            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-guerrilla-collective-2024-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As we hit the summer video game announcement season, we're kicking June off with a collection of indie devs in the Guerilla Collective event today. This is the fifth year that Guerilla Collective has hosted an event, and it generally showcases interesting games from a wide variety of developers that may not get attention at other showcases. If you want to see what your next favorite indie game may be, this is the spot to be, as we have all the announcements made.</p>

<h3>Wrekless - Free Range Games</h3>
<p>After a few minutes of opening, the Guerrilla Collective kicked off with an announcement of skateboarding mmo, <em>Wrekless</em>. The trailer for it emphasized the ability to build, share, and play together in this arcade skateboarding game. Featuring developers who worked on <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em>, this is another team attempting to bring the skating genre back, and into the multiplayer era of self-expression and shared regions.</p>

<h3>Yooka-Replaylee - Playtonic</h3>
<p><em>Yookla-Laylee</em> was one of the games that helped kick off the whole kickstarter spiritual successor thing, and while the game released to mixed reviews, it got a more acclaimed follow-up, and now the team at Playtonic is going back to their first game to improve it. As the definitive version of the game, <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> will feature improved cameras and controls (including a tweaked move set), which will hopefully help many player's issues with the game, improved visuals, an orchestral soundtrack, and both new and improved challenges. There will also be a new collectible currency, a new world map and challenge tracker, and all new tonics, and mechandise at Vendi.</p>

<p><em>Yooka-Replayee</em> is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2448020/YookaReplaylee/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Yooka Replayee">wishlist on Steam</a> now, and will have a developer QnA next week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/l5r-river-of-gold-coming-to-retail-in-august<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For certain dedicated tabletop fans, Legend of the Five Rings is special. It began as a living card game published by Fantasy Flight Games, then spun off into a TTRPG. It even has a <em>D&amp;D 5e</em> conversion, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adventures-in-rokugan-brings-l5r-to-dd-5e"><em>Adventures in Rokugan</em></a>. Now, players can make their fortune when a new board game, L5R River of Gold, comes to retail.</p>
<h2>The <em>L5R River of Gold</em> retail announcement</h2>
<p>The retail announcement of <em>L5R River of Gold</em> was covered by <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/57068/l5r-river-gold-board-game-heads-retail" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ICV2</a>. In the game, players travel through the East Asian-inspired fantasy world of Rokugan as a merchant on the titular golden river, delivering goods for their clan. In addition, they will invest in trade ports, markets, and shrines, and gain influence with manor houses.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/l5r-river-of-gold-card-artwork.jpg?itok=8Jxepd-k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/l5r-river-of-gold-card-artwork.jpg?itok=mU_r4HDx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Is it wise to trust a contract from the Scorpion Clan?</figcaption></figure><p>The goal is to build wealth and best the merchants from the rival clans. Doing this will require resource management and strategy as opposed to intense duels. This is notable since <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> is a setting driven by warring samurai clans, duels of passion, and supernatural demon attacks.</p>
<p><em>L5R River of Gold</em> was developed by Keith Piggott, the same creator behind <em>Drawn To Adventure</em> and <em>The Great Barrier Reef Card Game</em>. It will be published by Office Dog, a company launched in May 2022 under <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group">Asmodee Group</a>,</p>
<p>This board game will be the first new tabletop experience released in the L5R setting in years. The foundational living card game received its last major expansions in May 2021. The TTRPG, currently on its fifth edition, is being supported by another Asmodee-owned company, Edge Studio.</p>
<p><em>L5R River of Gold</em> is for two to four players ages 14 and up. A single game can be completed in 90 minutes. It will be available at retail stores and hobby shops August 2 and will be sold at an MSRP of $49.99. Each copy will include the Patrons mini-expansion, which will improve replayability.</p>

            <p>It's a new month, which means Microsoft have detailed a new batch of games arriving on Game Pass. Not all of the games themselves are new, mind you: they include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>, the HD-2D RPG released in 2018, and its sequel. 
</p><!--more--><p>

Here's the complete list coming in the first half of June 2024:

</p><ul>
<li>Octopath Traveler - Available now</li>
<li>Octopath Traveler 2 - Available now</li>
<li>Depersonalization – June 12th</li>
<li>Isonzo – June 13th</li>
<li>The Callisto Protocol - June 13th</li>
<li>Still Wakes The Deep – June 18th</li>
</ul>
<p>The original Octopath Traveler came to Game Pass back in 2021 and left in March last year, and it returns now to coincide with its release on PS4 and PS5. Octopath Traveler 2 is a first-time addition to the subscription service. Katharine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/octopath-traveler-2-review">reviewed the sequel</a> when it released last year and found it extremely similar, and similarly flawed, to the original:
</p>
<blockquote>Despite knowing this moment is almost certainly in my future, and despite the slightly incredulous realisation that I’ll have spent another 80 hours playing almost exactly the same game I did four years ago, I've still had a good time with Octopath Traveler 2. There’s something innately enthralling about it, and while, deep down, there's still lots of things I dislike about it, cor, those battles are just the absolute business. It remains one of the most captivating combat systems in the entire JRPG genre, and it really does feel good to be back in its gorgeous HD-2D world again, reheated story leftovers and all (and I swear I’m not just saying that because we get another stonking Nishiki score to admire in the process, honest).</blockquote>
<p>Among the other new joiners, the most interesting to me is the launch day arrival of Still Wakes The Deep on June 18th. It's the new game from The Chinese Room, thems what made Everybody's Gone To The Rapture, and thems what are making Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. They're a very different studio from their indie days and I'm curious what they'll produce.
</p>
<p>As always, new joiners mean a similarly sized batch of leavers. The games departing Game Pass on June 15th are Bramble: The Mountain King, High On Life, Rune Factory 4 Special, Spacelines From The Far Out, and The Bookwalker.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster-rumor-multiplatform-fable-gears-xbox-exclusive/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft will be presenting their big <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> this weekend, and there’s plenty of speculation about what might be next for Team Green. Will more games make their way to rival hardware after games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-ps5-april-release-date-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea of Thieves</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hi-fi-rush-ps5-release-march-2024-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a> went multiplatform earlier this year? And what’s going on troubled tentpole franchises like Halo?</p>
<p>Well, reliable Microsoft insider Tom Warren (<a href="https://subs.theverge.com/checkout?plan=108640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up for his newsletter here</a>) has stepped up before the Microsoft’s big show to provide some details about what he’s heard is going on with Team Green. In addition to the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct</a>, Warren is expecting two big first-party reveals – <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-announcement-rumor-xbox-games-showcase-medieval-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-playstation-xbox-core-franchises-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next Gears game</a>. Per Warren, Doom will be full multiplatform and Gears will not.</p>
<p>In his article, Warren runs down some of the games he’s heard are being considered for “Project Latitude” (Microsoft’s initiative to bring first-party games to other platforms) – in addition to Doom: The Dark Ages, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Mythology: Retold</a>, and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield</a> are under consideration. Games that are apparently <em>not </em>under consideration are the next Gears, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/south-of-midnight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a>.</p>
<p>Where things get particularly juicy is <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/halo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Halo</a>. According to Warren, a remaster of the original Halo: Combat Evolved is in the works and it<em> is</em> being considered for a multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Of course, take all of this with a grain of salt for now, but Warren has proven he has the goods in the past. As you can perhaps tell, it seems like a lot of things are up in the air at Team Green – while games like Fable and Gears aren't being considered for multiplatform releases now, if Halo can jump, anything can I reckon.</p>
<p>The Xbox Games Showcase comes your way on Sunday (June 9) at 10am PT. As previously rumored, we might also see some hints about future Xbox hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-might-feature-a-shadow-dropped-1st-party-game-xbox-portable-likely-to-be-teased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including a possible portable</a>, at the show. What are your thoughts on all of this? How do you think the exclusivity question will shake out?</p>

<p id="pJcmZh">These trimmed-down PS5s are equipped with the very same hardware as the older models that will eventually be phased out, but they have a smaller footprint overall and are around two pounds lighter, depending on whether the disc drive is attached. Both consoles are aesthetically similar to the original design, but both feature a small black channel that cuts through both sides.</p>

An ode to some of your favorite games, from <em>Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Slime Rancher</em>, to timeless classics such as <em>Harvest Moon</em>, <em><a title="Series > Story of Seasons [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/story-of-seasons">Story of Seasons</a></em>, <em><a title="Series > Pokemon [44 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/pokemon">Pokemon</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > GRANDIA" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/grandia">GRANDIA</a></em>, <em>Jade Cocoon</em>, and <em>Azure Dream</em>!</p><p>After moving to take care of a farmstead in a quaint little hamlet called Clover Town, you’re introduced to something that changes your life forever: Blobs! Blobs are cute, wobbly, and rotund creatures which hatch from eggs. Treat them with care and they can become your greatest companions! Coming in dozens of varieties (with all of them being cross-breedable!), Blobs can face off against rival blob trainers and help you out around the farm with their unique abilities.</p><p>As your relationship with the locals (some of whom you might choose to settle down with!) and town increases, the secrets of Clover Town start to unlock in front of you. And by secrets, we mean hidden temples, dungeons, and portals to exotic dimensions! These new worlds contain strange items and priceless artifacts that hold the key to the town’s—and your own—future.

Once the dialogue begins, select these answers:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false"> <li>What is the Sentinel of Jinzhou called? <ul> <li><strong>Jue</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li>Which department of the Huaxu Academy is responsible for making Tacetite Weapons? <ul> <li><strong>Department of Safety</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li>Which of these isn’t the recipe for famous Spicy Pulled Chicken? <ul> <li><strong>Caltrop</strong></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true">If you happen to select the wrong answer, there’s no need to fret; it won’t lead to any negative consequences. After this, the two characters will engage with you again in the Journal of Jinzhou Vol. 2.</p>

Attempting to speed up time in-game won’t yield results for this quest, so it’s best to revisit it later. Once the required time has elapsed, you’ll find Yingzhu and Xingzhu on a bridge in Jinzhou, ready to continue the quest.</p> <figure data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">As you progress to the Journal of Jinzhou Vol. 2, you’ll need to decide which character to interact with. Each character will present their own set of questions. However, it’s important to note that your choice won’t impact the rewards you receive. To successfully complete the Journal of Jinzhou Vol. 2, here are the answers to all the questions:</p> <h3 id="h-yingzhu-answers" data-injectable="false">Yingzhu answers</h3> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true"> <li>What’s the official name for the Midnight Rangers fighting on the front lines? <ul> <li><strong>Vanguards</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li>What is the official name of the “gourds” Resonators in Huanglong all carry? <ul> <li><strong>Pangu Terminal</strong></li> </ul> </li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-builds-for-boothill-in-honkai-star-rail/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-builds-for-boothill-in-honkai-star-rail<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="167" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Honkai: Star Rail’s </em>certified intergalactic cowboy, Boothill, has finally made his debut, and he comes with a unique kit strikingly different from standard DPS. </p> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking to build up the Galaxy Ranger, here’s everything you need to know about Boothill, including some of the best Relic sets and team compositions for <em>Honkai : Star Rail’s</em> new DPS. </p> <h2 id="h-strongest-boothill-build-in-honkai-star-rail" data-injectable="false">Strongest Boothill Build in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></h2> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">Boothill is a <strong>Physical Hunt </strong>character whose main role is to dish out as much damage as he possibly can. He is the very definition of a ‘Hypercarry’ and investment into him turns him into one of the strongest single-target DPS characters in the game. However, what makes him stand out from his carry brethren is his focus on <strong>Break Damage</strong>, to dish out the pain.</p>
 <p data-characters="640" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">Boothill is <em>Honkai: Star Rail’s </em>first duelist character, which functions like a Taunt when he uses his Skill on a target. This <strong>Standoff </strong>state forces the target to only attack him, and he gains several bonuses against said target. When an enemy dies to him or has their Break Bar depleted during a Standoff, Boothill gains access to an Empowered Basic attack called <strong>Pocket Trickshot</strong> that deals increased Break damage, and bonus damage to broken targets. To close out his kit, his Ultimate and Technique apply <strong>Physical Weakness </strong>on the select target meaning Boothill is a universal carry and <strong>can face any enemy in the game</strong> without issue.</p>
 <p data-characters="643" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true">Despite Boothill being a Hunt carry type of character, he uniquely does not care much for CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG. He is almost entirely focused on Break Effect and relies on Physical Breaks for most of his DPS. Thanks to his Trace, <strong>Ghost Load</strong>, he gains CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG just by stacking up his Break Effect, meaning he’s significantly easier to build than every other carry in the game. How much Break Effect does Boothill need? Well, as much as you can get. Even though his Ghost Load trace does cap out, Break Effect generally does not. With that understanding, let’s talk about how to build up this gunslinger’s gear.</p>
 <h3 id="h-best-relics-for-boothill" data-injectable="false">Best Relics for Boothill</h3> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">Boothill wants as much Break Effect as he can get, so his best Relic set is the <strong>Thief of Shooting Meteor. </strong>Both of its effects provide a significant increase to his Break Effect, making it the self-explanatory choice. You can farm out this set by running <strong>Cavern of Corrsion: Path of Jabbing Punch.</strong></p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">For his Sphere and Robe set, I highly recommend you run <strong>Talia: Kingdom of Banditry</strong>, as it provides yet another significant boost to his Break Effect stat, provided you can reach the required <strong>145 SPD</strong> to activate its secondary effects. You’ll need to farm the Simulated Universe to obtain this set, specifically<strong> World 4</strong>.</p>

CRIT and CRIT DMG are not terrible on him, but far from ideal. ATK% is a moderately good choice of stat to get for him as well. Finally, as with any Hypercarry in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, you want to make sure you stack a ton of Speed so that he gets multiple turns per turn cycle.</p>
 <h3 id="h-best-team-comp-boothill" data-injectable="false">Best Team Comp Boothill</h3> <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">Boothill thrives off additional turns and characters that buff Breaks since he should be treated as the sole carry on his team. His greatest weakness is his focus on single target, which means you want to give him as many turns to act as possible to make up for this. With that in mind, his most favored teammates are characters that, naturally, support these two requirements of his. Ruan Mei, Bronya, and Gallagher are his best allies.</p>
 <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true"><strong>Ruan Mei </strong>is the ideal Break Harmony support for Boothill, as she helps him shred enemy Break Bars faster, and provides him increased up-time on enemies that are already broken. She also deals significant damage of her own, if built well, to enemies that are broken, which pairs exceptionally well with Boothill’s insane damage output. Finally, Ruan Mei flat out provides a massive damage buff through her Skill that remains helpful for Boothill as it does for any other carry.</p>

Bronya also provides a DMG Buff when she utilizes her Skill on Boothill, which helps a bit with his damage.</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false"><strong>Gallagher </strong>is his ideal Abundance support of choice because he contributes a significant amount of Break damage to assist Boothill in shattering Break bars. He also has a debuff that amplifies the Break damage an enemy is dealt, further favoring Boothill.</p> <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">You can also run <strong>Harmony Trailblazer</strong>, in place of Bronya for the Super Break effect that is unique to them. However, you will be missing out on extra turns from Bronya, which I don’t think is worth the loss.</p>
 <h2 id="h-should-you-get-boothill-s-lightcone-in-honkai-star-rail" data-injectable="false">Should you get Boothill’s Lightcone in <em>Honkai: Star Rail?</em></h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Honkai-Star-Rail-Boothill-Best-Build-Lightcone.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="489" data-current-count="789" data-injectable="true">If you are planning on pulling Boothill, then I do recommend you pull his Lightcone, <strong>Sailing Towards a Second Life</strong>, as well. The difference between his signature Lightcone and the second-best option is honestly massive, and I cannot imagine making good use of Boothill without it. It provides Boothill with the colossal damage output he needs to do his job as a Hypercarry, and if you don’t get it, you’re better off focusing on other characters for the role. It is what it is.</p>
 <h2 id="h-best-eidolons-for-boothill-in-honkai-star-rail" data-injectable="false">Best Eidolons for Boothill in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></h2> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Boothill is a complete character at E0 as long as you have his Lightcone. However, if you’re interested in pulling some of his Eidolons to make him stronger, here’s an overview of them for your reference. E2 is the best stopping point if you’re planning on pulling.</p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Honkai-Star-Rail-Boothill-Best-Build-Eidolons.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Dust Trail’s Lone Star (E1)&nbsp;</strong>– When a battle starts, Boothill gains one stack of Pocket Trickshot. When he deals damage to an enemy, he ignores 16% of the enemy’s Defense. This is a rather strong E1, as it gives him a significant boost to his upfront Break and normal damage at the start of a fight. The faster Boothill can Break, the stronger he will be. Good Eidolon.</li> <li><strong>Milestonemonger (E2) </strong>– When in Standoff and gaining Pocket Trickshot, Boothill restores one Skill Point and increases his Break Effect by 30%. This effect lasts for two turns in total. This Eidolon is a massive increase to his overall performance (Break and Damage), as he gains an entire Relic’s worth of Break Damage. Oh, and here’s a free Skill Point back for that Skill you used. Insane. A good stopping point for Eidolons.</li> <li><strong>Marble Orchard’s Guard (E3) </strong>– Damage boost to Ultimate and Basic Attack. Boothill’s Ultimate hits like a tank shell and increased scaling on it is not a bad thing. Not required, however.</li> <li><strong>Cold Cuts Chef (E4) </strong>– Enemies caught in a Standoff with Boothill receive 12% increased damage. Boothill offsets 12% of damage taken from enemies in his Standoff. This is a decent strong Eidolon as it allows Boothill to amplify the damage a target takes from all sources. However, since Boothill favors being the lone carry on his team, it isn’t all that useful for team support. He, however, still gains the benefit, making it a solid E4.</li> <li><strong>Stump Speech (E5) </strong>– Damage boost to Skill and Talent. Considering that Boothill’s Skill and Talent is where a majority of his damage (outside of Break) comes from, this is a very strong Eidolon to have for him.</li> <li><strong>Crowbar Hotel’s Racoon (E6) </strong>– Basically, this makes the Break Damage caused by Boothill’s Talent deal an astronomical amount of additional damage beyond the standard effect. Literally broken. </li> </ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clank-board-game-buying-guide.891849/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clank-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Clank! is a deck-building adventure that's very much worth your consideration. The game is for 2-4 players, and while the recommendations say that it takes 30-60 minutes to complete, matches go about double that or more, especially with more players. So sit down and get ready, because it’s time to deck-build your way out of a dungeon before the monsters get you.</p><p>Clank!, made by Dire Wolf Digital and Renegade Game Studios, is a competitive game that integrates a base <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> with cards and tokens. Movement is pushed forward with cards gained in the deck-building portion of the game. As with any <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building game</a>, you’ll start with a small collection of cards to start, but advancement will require more cards to be added through your turns. </p><p>You’ll take turns moving and exploring dungeon depths, collecting cards and artifacts, gaining mastery, and evading a boss, which in your starter game is, of course, everyone’s favorite medieval adversary: the dragon. Go through the dungeon's depths with rewards and you will score well. But wait, it’s not so simple.</p><p>When all players are knocked out of the dungeon (unless playing in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player game</a>, where the first player to do this will make the game end), successfully exits on their own or with the help of townspeople (a few spaces on the game board above the depths of the dungeon), they will add up their accumulated scores. Scores are added on acquired treasures (artifacts and other tokens gained along your journey through the dungeon), the value of gold tokens, and cards with a green amount visible in the top right-hand corner. The amount on the cards includes everything you’ve had in your collected journey- not just the ones in your hand.</p><p>The game also has an optional companion app (available for both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.direwolfdigital.Renegade&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Android</u></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/renegade-games-companion/id1046548265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Apple</u></a> users) that can be integrated into play. With the app, you’ll add a further dimension to the experience. You can also play it as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> if you want to go deep alone. </p><h2>The Base Game</h2><h3>Clank! A Deck-building Adventure</h3><div><div id="164688"><p><h3>Clank!</h3></p></div><div id="164694"><p><h3>Clank! Legacy: Acquisitions Incorporated</h3></p></div></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Two-sided game board, 180+ cards, 80+ tokens, 30 cubes, 4 player meeples in different colors, 24 dragon cubes, cloth dragon bag, dragon monster meeple</p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $65.00 USD2</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 Players (best with 3)</li><li>20-30 minutes</li><li>Ages 13+</li></ul><p>The original base game of assorted dungeon hijinx is needed to start your adventure through what may be a series of dungeon exploits. It will guide your adventure through a simple dungeon with obstacles, even at the base game. Future expansions and packs can be added to the game to enhance the difficulty and boss monsters that seek to end your trek to defeat.</p><h2>Expansions</h2><p>Clank! has two types of expansions. The original expansions follow a similar medieval approach to the base game. They add obstacles and other medieval and fantasy-type bosses. The other expansion type goes a different route, which is more geared toward players with a deeper understanding of the game. Those expansions are broken up into space-themed dungeons and legacy playing. Space-themed editions have an expanded board and have space as their fantasy direction. Legacy editions of games are intensive versions which incorporate multiple versions of the game. They will involve numerous playthroughs to complete. As a standard, you won’t finish a legacy game version of really any game on one game night, regardless of which game it is. That’s no different with Clank!’s versions. You’ll have to sit through multiple nights of dungeon-crawling gaming for those. </p><h3>Standard Fantasy Style Expansions</h3><h3>Sunken Treasures</h3><div id="201702"><p><h3>Clank! Sunken Treasures</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Two new maps, a marketplace board, more dungeon cards, Treasure rooms added to the board, room challenges from environments, and card effects brought on by discarding cards.

The addition of water and environmental elements can force players to incorporate new strategies involving timing and skill. Will you sink to the bottom in defeat or will you tread water and escape to the surface unscathed?</p><h3>The Mummy's Curse</h3><div id="201703"><p><h3>Clank! The Mummy's Curse</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Mummy monster in addition to the dragon, a mummy curse die, additional cards and rewards tokens, artifact changes. Two-sided game board, 41 cards, 31 tokens, market board, dragon meeple, mummy meeple, pyramid die</p><p><strong>(Base Game Required)</strong></p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $35.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-4 Players</li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 12+</li></ul><p>Think a dragon was a tough enough adversary for your dungeon crawl? The addition of the mummy monster will add further challenges to the dungeon. It works with curses that change the dynamic, causing havoc and frustrating the dragon. As mentioned in the contents portion, the Mummy's Curse also changes the route to acquiring artifacts in the game. The artifact changes made in this second edition of the game where a player can use an action to gain an artifact in the room (the first two editions didn’t allow for that), become a mainstay approach for all subsequent game versions.</p><h3>Expeditions: Gold and Silk</h3><div id="201704"><p><h3>Clank! Expeditions: Gold and Silk</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Double-sided game board, 8-point artifact, 3 mining bonus tokens, market board, 4 player meeples, 12 web tokens, 3 mining bonus tokens, spider meeple character monster </p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $25.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-4 Players</li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 12+</li></ul><p>Two additional boards with a gold mine are key to this treacherous Gold &amp; Silk expansion dungeon. A spider opponent adds danger as you explore gold mines filled with gold veins and treasures. Webbed rooms create further danger. Successfully navigating the mine may result in additional treasures hidden in a section the spider has placed in its secret lair. Will you get through the spun silk before the spider gets you? </p><h3>Temple of the Ape Lords</h3><div id="201705"><p><h3>Clank! Expeditions - Temple of the Ape Lords</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: 1 two-sided game board, 1 Ape boss meeple, 4 player meeples</p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $25.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-4 Players</li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p>This version of the game adds several elements which may make players go bananas. It integrates apes into the dungeon, bringing a barrel full of assorted shenanigans. Movement on the board can be rotated in some spaces. This version also allows for a mini-campaign mode for playing two different versions of the game- each on their side</p><h3>Clank Adventuring Party</h3><div id="201706"><p><h3>Clank! Adventuring Party</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: side board used for 5-6 players, 30 cubes in 2 additional colors, 6 player meeples, 6 character boards, 127 cards (including 6 starter decks each with 10 cards), 90+ tokens, Hexavultus boss meeple, rules</p><p>(The base game is required, but this expansion is also compatible with Clank! Legacy.)</p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $35.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-6 Players</li><li>60-120 minutes</li><li>Ages 13+</li></ul><p>In Clank! Adventuring Party, you’ll gain six new adventures to choose from to guide you through the dungeon. Each adventurer in this edition will wield its own connected powers. Most are typical magic and fantasy types characters such as the dwarf, orc, elf, and mage. However, there are also a couple of animals too. You can play as a robot monkey or a cute kitten with some bite to it. This version also adds a new villain: Hexavultus. Which party will you choose to go into the depths this time? Choose wisely.</p><h2>More Expansions &amp; Add Ons</h2><p>There are multiple versions of space-type expansions in the series. The game operates a bit differently with a changeable spaceship-type board. There are three space versions of the game available. Clank in Space is the first in the series. Others in the space edition of expansions are <a href="https://zdcs.link/W0qy6" target="_blank"><u>Clank in Space: Apocalypse</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/rdwy5" target="_blank"><u>Clank in Space: Cyber Station 11</u></a>.</p><p>A legacy version of the game based on a comic and podcast was created. That version is called <a href="https://zdcs.link/mV3yJ" target="_blank"><u>Clank! Legacy Acquisitions Incorporated</u></a>. </p><p>There are also character Packs (to be used in the legacy after they’ve completed the legacy version of the game: the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRBbv" target="_blank"><u>Upper Management Pack</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/lVnyN" target="_blank"><u>The C Team Pack</u></a>.</p><p>Several promo cards can be added to the game. <br>
<strong>Bottom Line</strong></p><p>With a <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/201808/clank-a-deck-building-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>7.8 rating on Board Game Geek</u></a> and multiple dungeons to unlock, Clank! is a solid choice for your gaming adventures. The base game is tons of fun to play on its own accord, but each expansion adds an assortment of new adventures. My main complaint is that, sadly, despite the irony of the game being made by a company with “digital” in their name, Clank! isn’t available to play digitally. Their side companion app is a great addition to things, but I wish there were more ways to play. Clank! And its expansions are massive games with tons of pieces. Older kids will love this, but families, especially those with younger kids in the house, will dread when pieces go missing. Moving past those two items, the game is a highly enjoyable adventure in fantasy dungeons with enough challenges to keep folks entertained for a long time.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/duckside-hands-on-preview-dayz-and-rust-inspired-open-world-survivalbut-youre-a-duck</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/duckside-hands-on-preview-dayz-and-rust-inspired-open-world-survival-but-youre-a-duck.891846/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/duckside-hands-on-preview-dayz-and-rust-inspired-open-world-survivalbut-youre-a-duck<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Survival games like DayZ or Rust remain hard to beat, but Duckside presents an interesting challenger. Developed by tinyBuild Riga in Unreal Engine 5 with producers from Hello Neighbor, Duckside is a new persistent open-world survival game where ducks have become combat-trained. Taking the fight to both humans and fellow mallards, I recently went hands-on with the beta. So far, it's a quacking good time.</p><p>I respect that Duckside doesn't justify its unusual premise. There are currently no flimsy narratives or ridiculous origin stories explaining why ducks can suddenly wield weapons or craft tools. All we know is that they've become tired of being hunted and began fighting for freedom. Unfortunately, these new birds of prey can't shake those territorial instincts between each other. This island has become a fierce battleground, offering 50-person servers and PvE against human NPCs across a day and night cycle.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Duckside - IGN Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Using ducks over humans provides unique perks, and the flight mechanics feel great. Some issues with draw distance are noticeable, though tinyBuild confirmed this will be addressed as development progresses. Regardless, taking to the skies feels like a breeze. The stamina system ensures you can't reach unreasonable heights. Landings are usually smooth, yet even fliers can take fall damage, so this requires some precision. Sure, flying makes you an easier target and you could take evasive action. Getting the drop on enemies is considerably more fun, and shooting others when flying is surprisingly entertaining.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Shooting others when flying is surprisingly entertaining.</p></div><p>Arming yourself should be your first priority since leaving the nest unprepared can have dire consequences. Crude options like a crossbow work in a pinch, though ducks have arguably never been more terrifying than seeing one with a sawed-off shotgun. Shelter is another essential consideration when everyone wants to kill you, and location is just as crucial as building quality. While flying across the map is both quick and convenient, being on the island's fringes isn't ideal but neither is making yourself an easy target. Crafting a nest secures a respawn point within your base.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Basic materials are fittingly obtained by pecking objects like trees or rocks alongside abandoned storage cans. I enjoyed how Duckside incentivises moderation as over mining a tree can cause it to collapse, alert other ducks of your presence. Item blueprints can also teach you new recipes for item crafting, but researching new items comes at a cost, so you must use your resources wisely. Key items can be obtained by raiding human outposts like the port area or an abandoned swimming pool, a risky proposition that feels suitably rewarding when you succeed. If you get complacent, well. As the old saying goes, duck around and find out. Since intruders could storm your base at any point, keeping these materials hidden is essential for long-term survival. I learned the hard way that death empties your inventory. </p><p>Of course, you can't stay hidden forever like a lonely duckling. Fortune favors the bold, and I appreciate how Duckside stops you from becoming too comfortable. Alongside a hunger meter, bases eventually deteriorate, though they can be upgraded for increased longevity. Using a persistent server means anything you have could be gone when you next return. Some might scream fowl play, though it's a welcome challenge. Getting too greedy could turn you into someone else's golden goose, so put those materials to good use while you have them. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Duckside - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>One of Duckside's more enjoyable server-wide objectives involves the shrine. You can initiate a sacrifice using white feathers collected by killing other ducks or by offering hunters licenses obtained from humans. That creates a parachute airdrop filled with supplies that everyone can see across the map to effectively encourage a risk vs. reward situation, though I never saw this directly.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Basic materials are fittingly obtained by pecking objects like trees or rocks alongside abandoned storage cans.</p></div><p>You could go it alone but Duckside's a game best experienced with others. Squadding up and working towards a loosely defined common goal, likely involving resource gathering and raiding someone's base, is highly entertaining. My session with the developers ended on an explosive notepad and despite a successful base infiltration, my celebration was brief. To my amusement and despair, I completely forgot about nests allowing respawns and immediately paid the price. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Alone, that likely would've been frustrating. As a team effort, it was hilarious and tinyBuild's take on open-world survival has teeth. Even though it's an early bird, Duckside shows considerable potential and I'm keen to see how this premise expands. A release date remains unconfirmed but you can jump into the open beta eggsclusively on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2682580/DUCKSIDE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> today.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Throughout the colorful odyssey across lands corrupted by a malignant force, players have to drive back the forces corrupting the majestic world, save restless spirits, and harness the adorable power of the Rot to work through puzzles. It tells a touching story about overcoming tragedy and is simply an all-around great game.</p><p>"Kena: Bridge of Spirits uses a different perspective on familiar gameplay ideas to create tons of exciting combat and a deep emotional connection with its world," Phil Hornshaw wrote in the review for the game, scoring it 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review-dont-fear-the-reaper/1900-6417744/">Kena: Bridge of Spirits review.</a></p><p>Alongside a photo mode, new game+, and other welcome post-launch updates and improvements, the Xbox version of the game includes the following extras:</p><ul><li>Digital soundtrack</li><li>Golden Rot skin</li><li>Unique Kena staff</li><li>Retail exclusive sticker sheet</li><li>Xbox exclusive pirate-themed hats</li></ul><p>If you've already played Kena on PlayStation, you should check out all of the PS5 exclusives on sale right now during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-days-of-play-2024-ps5-deals/1100-6523751/">Days of Play</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cuphead-delicious-last-course-art-book-has-never-before-seen-content-limited-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6523733/">Cuphead Delicious Last Course Art Book Has Never-Before-Seen Content, Limited Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/">Walmart Has An Exclusive Edition For EA Sports College Football 25</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide/1100-6521751/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Preorders - Release-Day Delivery Still Available</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-over-60-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-with-targets-limited-time-deal/1100-6523230/">Save Over $60 On 12 Months Of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With Target's Limited-Time Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Set Preorders Are Only Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p data-characters="328" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I was watching the Guerilla Collective Stream today when <em>W.I.L.D. Tactics’</em> trailer <a href="https://youtu.be/V6-rr6Lfbfw?si=s_yCj1Iw6fczRXRj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit the air</a>. It seemed familiar. I was certain I hadn’t seen it before and didn’t recognize the art style, but there was something familiar. Then the Wild Gentlemen logo flashed on screen, and I knew. This is a <em>Chicken Police </em>spin-off.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="WILD Tactics | Official Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V6-rr6Lfbfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true"><em>Chicken Police</em> is something that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/indie-spotlight-chicken-police/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I always hover around</a>. I named the next mainline game in the series, <em>Chicken Police: Into the Hive</em> my <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoids-most-anticipated-games-of-2024/">most anticipated game of 2024</a>. What draws me to these games is the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/zipps-cafe-is-a-short-form-prologue-game-with-heart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obvious passion behind their world-building</a>. It doesn’t necessarily matter what form the games take, but that storytelling is just delectable. I’d make a finger-lickin’ reference there, but I’ve done that enough in other articles.</p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">While the trailer for <em>W.I.L.D. Tactics</em> is entirely a flashy animated teaser with no gameplay, screenshots and information have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384640/WILD_Tactics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrived elsewhere</a>. It’s a turn-based strategy game made in the vein of <em>XCOM</em> but with the series’ noir stylings and anthropomorphic characters. It promises 15 story-focused missions that range from stealth to all-out assault, and 12 characters to carry them out.</p> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">While press material pushes the “story-focused” angle, there is squad and base management, upgrades, and a social system between the characters to keep things dynamic.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="41" data-current-count="41" data-injectable="false">They had me at “World of Wilderness.”</p> <p data-characters="126" data-current-count="167" data-injectable="false"><em>W.I.L.D. Tactics </em>currently doesn’t have a release window, but will be coming to PC. Other platforms will be announced later.</p>

<p data-characters="248" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After a successful open beta earlier this year, TinyBuild has announced that a second open beta for <em>Duckside</em> is now live. More than 150,000 players jumped into the first beta and the developer is expecting many more to take up the call to arms now.</p> <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true"><em>Duckside</em> is a PvP, PvE base building and crafting title set in a persistent open world where players can form groups, create a base of operations, and then head out on missions to raid others, attack marked locations on the map, and cause all kinds of Mallard mayhem. The game is a lot like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-rust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust</a></em>, with regular server wipes to keep things interesting and help avoid any single group becoming overpowered or allowing players to collect and hoard everything on the map. </p>
 <h2 id="h-duckside-s-second-open-beta-brings-meaningful-changes-and-a-fun-new-hat" data-injectable="false"><em>Duckside</em>‘s second open beta brings meaningful changes and a fun new hat</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="DUCKSIDE Demo Trailer | Play Now | Rust-like survival with PVP and Base Building but you're a DUCK!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbaNL8rvkMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true">The second open beta for <em>Duckside</em> will be live from <strong>June 6, 2024, until around June 17, 2024</strong>, though it could go on for longer, depending on how many players try it out. TinyBuid has implemented a slew of new features to keep this beta interesting, even for those who played hours of the first one. </p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">For example, two new defensive structures have been added, both of which should be on every player’s radar for raiding. These are the ship port and the missile silo, both of which will require you to tackle a group of humans to enter. </p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true">You can take advantage of new explosive ammo that will make short work of your enemies, build stronger bases with roof hatches for quick escapes, locate mysterious duck-shaped obelisks for in-game buffs, and try out the PvP or PvE-focused servers if you want worlds with or without fellow players. </p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">Note that you’ll need to build quickly if you want to see everything the game has to offer with regular server wipes every Mondy and Thursday. By using the command “/GetHatForBeta” in-game, you can get yourself a Rubber Ducky Hat free of charge every time you log in, so there’s no need to stash it. </p> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="773" data-injectable="false">In <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2682580/DUCKSIDE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duckside</a></em>, players must gather resources and build bases so they can eke out an existence in a world filled with other potentially hostile ducks. It’s up to you whether you band together with others to create a utopian society or become a warring group that destroys any signs of life. I love the communities that band together in <em>Rust</em> and can’t wait to see what sort of societies emerge after a few weeks in <em>Duckside</em>‘s servers. </p>

<p data-characters="195" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-clorinde-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clor</a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-clorinde-builds-in-genshin-impact/">inde</a> is a 5-star <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-clorinde-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electro DPS</a> in <em>Genshin Impact</em> who synergizes well with Dendro teammates. Here are the best teams for Clorinde focusing on two of her best reactions: <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-dendro-reactions-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aggravate and Hyperbloom</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-teams-for-quicken-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Teams for Quicken Clorinde</h2> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true">Aggravate is the easiest reaction for Clorinde to trigger consistently. All you need is an off-field Dendro teammate to apply the occasional hit of Dendro. Clorinde’s best Dendro teammates are <strong>Nahida, Dendro Traveler, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baizhu</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yaoyao-healer-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yaoyao</a>.</strong> Kirara and Collei can also work, but they’re harder to recommend. Pick one or two of these Dendro teammates to trigger Quicken, which will enable Clorinde to trigger Aggravate.</p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Once you have your Dendro teammate(s) picked out, you can fill in with some flex units of your choice. I recommend an Anemo unit like <strong>Sucrose </strong>or <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kazuha-builds-in-genshin-impact-updated-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuha</a></strong> to amplify Clorinde’s Electro damage. Alternatively, <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-zhongli-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhongli’s</a></strong> shield provides some defensive utility while making enemies weaker to all elements. You can also double up on Electro units with <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-beidou-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beidou</a>, Yae Miko, </strong>or <strong>Kujou Sara. </strong>Mix and match as you like!</p>
 <h3 id="h-example-teams-for-quicken-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Example teams for Quicken Clorinde</h3> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Clorinde – Nahida – Baizhu – Zhongli</li> <li>Clorinde – Dendro Traveler – Sucrose – Beidou</li> <li>Clorinde – Yaoyao – Sucrose – Fischl</li> <li>Clorinde – Yaoyao – Kazuha – Kujou Sara</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-teams-for-hyperbloom-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Teams for Hyperbloom Clorinde</h2> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">Hyperbloom teams are similar to Quicken teams, but with added Hydro. When Hydro reacts with Dendro, it creates a Dendro Core on the ground. When Clorinde hits a Dendro Core with an attack, she will trigger Hyperbloom, dealing Dendro damage to enemies.</p> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">Since Hydro can remove the Quicken status from enemies, having constant Dendro application becomes more important. This increases the value of <strong>Nahida</strong> and <strong>Dendro Traveler</strong>, since these characters are better at applying Dendro from off-field. As with Quicken teams, pick one or two Dendro teammates, making sure you have at least one who can provide consistent off-field Dendro application.</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">Then, pick a Hydro teammate.

Make sure you only have one Hydro unit, though, since too much Hydro can reduce Clorinde’s damage by interfering with Quicken.</p> <figure data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">If you still have an open team slot, and you have your Dendro and Hydro needs covered, feel free to add a flex unit of your choice. <strong>Fischl</strong> is still good, since Oz won’t target Dendro Cores, letting Clorinde trigger most of the Hyperblooms. Anemo units like <strong>Sucrose</strong> or <strong>Kazuha</strong> are great too. <strong>Zhongli</strong> makes for a good shielder, since he will increase both Clorinde’s Electro damage and Hyperbloom damage.</p>

<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Tesla Tower is one of the many stationary turret Stratagems in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helldivers 2</a></em> that you can unlock after some time. It looks pretty good from the demo video and has pretty good stats, so if you want to know more before taking it on a mission, here’s everything you need to know.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-tesla-tower-in-helldivers-2" data-injectable="false">How to get the Tesla Tower in <em>Helldivers 2</em></h2> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false">To get the Tesla Tower in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, you will need to be <strong>level 15 and spend 8,000 Req Slips</strong>. It’s part of the Bridge section in the Stratagem Management menu.</p> <p data-characters="74" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">Once purchased, you can then equip it before shipping out on your mission.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">How to use the Tesla Tower in <em>Helldivers 2</em></h2> <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">To use the Tesla Tower, you will call it down like any other turret. Once it lands, you can’t move it.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="688" data-injectable="true">Unlike other turrets where you can see where it’ll attack next, the Tesla Tower attacks enemies within its shock radius. You can see roughly how far it’ll attack, so you ideally want to stay away before you end up dead. You can go prone to avoid getting hurt or killed, but it’s best to just be away from the Tower’s radius entirely.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Is the Tesla Tower worth using?</h2> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">The Tesla Tower is only worth using at lower difficulties fighting Terminids in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. It’s amazing when it can take down small and medium enemies, but once you start facing heavier targets like Bile Spewers, Chargers, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-how-to-kill-a-bile-titan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Bile Titans,</a> it’s nearly worthless.</p>
 <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="110" data-injectable="false"><strong>Most heavier enemies can walk through the Tower’s radius and crush it before it can deal significant damage.</strong></p> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Also, the Tesla Tower is nearly useless when fighting Automatons. A majority of the attacks this faction has are all ranged, so they can easily take this down from afar.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="false">So, if you want to farm low-level defense missions for quick Medals and Req slips, the Tesla Tower will be good there. Otherwise, at higher levels, like 5-Hard and higher, it’s going to be destroyed in seconds.</p>

<p data-characters="203" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>EA Sports FC 24</em> is set to introduce the UEFA Euro 2024 update today, June 6, 2024. The free update will be themed around the international tournament, featuring the top footballing nations across Europe.</p> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">As part of this free update, Ultimate Team mode players are set to receive a free player pick. The options include Netherlands’ Virgil van Dijk, Italy’s Federico Chiesa, Germany’s Florian Wirtz, France’s Ousmane Dembele, England’s Jack Grealish, and Spain’s Alvaro Morata. The player pick will only be available for Ultimate Team players who have played the mode between December 18, 2023, and January 16, 2024.</p>

The update did arrive with a fresh set of animations before kick-off, showing off fans entering the stadium to cheer for their nation, but the overall update did not receive a favourable response from the game’s community.</p>

<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Rakta Dark Dagger is an interesting weapon in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a> </em>because it’s one of the game’s weaker weapon types, yet provides many favorable qualities. It also is kind of hard to get if you’re a newer player, so in any case, here’s everything you need to know about the weapon.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-rakta-dark-dagger" data-injectable="false">How to get the Rakta Dark Dagger</h2> <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="193" data-injectable="false">To get the Rakta Dark Dagger, you have to <strong>purchase it from the Red Veil Syndicate for 125,000 standing</strong>. To even get that much to hold at once, you also need to be max rank with them or Exalted.</p> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">If you aren’t allied with them when you chose your Syndicate, you have to resort to trading with another player who is. In that case, you will more than likely have to pay another player who is in the Red Veil with Platinum.</p>
 <p data-characters="122" data-current-count="122" data-injectable="false">The Rakta Dark Dagger will usually cost between <strong>25 to 40 Platinum</strong> when you are looking to trade with others in-game.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Rakta Dark Dagger build</h2> <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">Here is a decent build with which to use the Rakta Dark Dagger. This will be using a standard melee build, so it won’t revolve around stealth and finishers.</p> <p data-characters="20" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><strong>Stance: </strong>Pointed Wind</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true"> <li>Condition Overload</li> <li>Drifting Contact</li> <li>Virulent Scourge</li> <li>Vicious Frost</li> <li>Blood Rush</li> <li>Organ Shatter</li> <li>Weeping Wounds</li> <li>Voltaic Strike</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="23" data-current-count="23" data-injectable="false"><strong>Arcane:</strong> Melee Influence</p> <figure data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">This setup turns your weapon into a powerhouse of an AoE weapon. As you accumulate your combo counter, you’re going to be spreading Viral, Radiation, and Shock statuses to nearby enemies, making them all prone to Condition Overload.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="172" data-current-count="172" data-injectable="false">Pair that with the weapon’s passive ability. Now you’re generating shields constantly from the Radiation procs. That will help you survive a lot longer in later levels.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Is the Rakta Dark Dagger worth using and getting in <em>Warframe</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">The Rakta Dark Dagger is very much worth using. It may be a single dagger weapon, but with the right build, it’s one of the stronger “stat sticks” in the game.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="false">The weapon can also make builds that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-use-shield-gating-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">utilize shield gating a lot more viable</a>. Having yet another damage source generating shields will ensure that you won’t die as fast. 5% shield leech isn’t a lot, but when you’re constantly hitting Radiation procs, it’s a godsend.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-awards-destiny-2-players-painfully-slow-clap-emote-due-to-an-undefined-issue.891765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-awards-destiny-2-players-painfully-slow-clap-emote-due-to-an-undefined-issue/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bungie-awards-destiny-2-players-painfully-slow-clap-emote-due-to-an-undefined-issue<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="325" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The launch of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> has been packed with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-error-code-weasel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">error codes</a> and server queues, though some of us are able to get in and play the campaign. Outside of the new playable content, Bungie also seems to have created an issue with the Painfully Slow Clap emote, but it won’t explain exactly what the problem is. </p> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">The same week that <em>The Final Shape</em> was released, Bungie added the Painfully Slow Clap emote to the Eververse Store for 200 Silver. This is about $2/£2, but the problem is, the emote is exactly the same as another emote that was in the original <em>Destiny</em>. While Bungie is usually very specific about the issues impacting <em>Destiny 2</em>, it’s been strangely vague on this one, leading some fans to believe a mistake was made. </p>
 <h2 id="h-bungie-is-giving-the-painfully-slow-clap-emote-away-for-free-and-refunding-anyone-who-purchased-it" data-injectable="false">Bungie is giving the Painfully Slow Clap emote away for free and refunding anyone who purchased it</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">The official Bungie Help account on Twitter, where we’ve all been watching for server maintenance notifications around <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>‘s launch <a href="https://x.com/BungieHelp/status/1798430155381367175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that every player would be getting the Painfully Slow Clap emote due to an issue. You’ll be contacted regarding a refund if you purchased it while it was charging players. </p>
 <p data-characters="114" data-current-count="114" data-injectable="false">The fact that the issue hasn’t been disclosed made this post stand out to me and many other <em>Destiny 2</em> fans. </p> <figure data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Due to an issue, we have made the Painfully Slow Clap emote available to all players. Players who purchased the emote prior to this change will be contacted at a later date for next steps.</p>— Bungie Help (@BungieHelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1798430155381367175?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">The replies to the post are brilliant, with some players saying what we’re all thinking, “Painful clap for the painful launch.” Others, though, want to know exactly what went wrong. “Please elaborate on said issue, I’d like for this to happen more often.”</p> <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">After I did some digging around, it appears that Bungie is giving this emote out to every player because it was already released in the first game. A post on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d897cg/the_painfully_slow_clap_emote_in_eververse_is/#:~:text=MagnaVis-,The%20%22Painfully%20Slow%20Clap%22%20emote%20in%20Eververse%20is%20exactly%20the,emote%20you%20have%20for%20free.&amp;text=Is%20this%20bugged%2C%20or%20are,can%20ignore%20this%20post%20now." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Destiny 2</em> subreddit</a> brought this fact to light, and Bungie developers were quick to respond, explaining in response to the post asking if the game was meant to charge for the emote that, “Thanks for the report, this is not intended and we are currently investigating.”</p>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">I think user Mak on Twitter puts everyone’s thoughts on this matter into context best. “The issue was that it was identical to a free green emote everyone already has. Unclear if the emote in the shop was supposed to be something different or a simple oversight by not realizing we already have the emote.” </p> <p data-characters="578" data-current-count="903" data-injectable="true">As I mentioned above, Bungie is usually pretty specific about issues impacting <em>Destiny 2</em>. The vagueness on this particular subject, without even referencing the fact that it was being discussed on the game’s subreddit, suggests that there may have been an oversight when adding it to the game. Given the sheer amount of content that’s been added to <em>Destiny 2</em> over the years, let alone everything that players brought over from the first game at launch, it’s surprising that this is the first time players have been accidentally charged for an identical emote. </p>
 <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false">Don’t worry about picking the Painfully Slow Clap emote up from the Eververse Store because it should already be in your inventory. When I checked, the fee had been waived and I was informed the item was already redeemed on my account. </p>

		<p>Bioware have announced a full reveal of the next Dragon Age game on Tuesday June 11th 2024 but ahead of that they have revealed the title, Dragon Age The Veilguard. Well, that’s what the image shows, Bioware write it with a colon, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, so who knows which is correct.</p>



<p>“After Dragon Age: Inquisition launched, the studio was given an incredible opportunity to explore, test, and validate a variety of gameplay concepts as we worked to determine what the next Dragon Age could look like,” explains Gary McKay,&nbsp; Executive Producer, for Dragon Age, and General Manager at BioWare.</p>
<p>“We brought everything to the table which, yes, even included a multiplayer concept. The time we spent experimenting and iterating gradually taught us a lot. This work, and the amazing support from EA, helped us re-focus on creating an incredible single player game, with all the choices, characters and world building you’d expect from us.”</p>

<p>He confirms that you play as a brand new character and will be supported by “seven unique” companions. “You’ll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience,” adds Gary.</p>
<p>The full reveal on Tuesday June 11th at 8:00am PT (a very pleasant 16:00 BST for us here in the UK) will include over 15 minutes of gameplay&nbsp; from the start of the game, You will be able to watch via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dragonage"><strong>Dragon Age YouTube channel.</strong></a></p>
<p>Bioware had previously revealed that Dragon Age Dreadwolf, the old title for the game, takes place in a world where the legend of Solas has grown, with different people having different opinions of him. To some he is an elven god while to others an individual that betrayed people who trusted him. Some see him as someone who is there to save others, but at a great cost. How much that of still relevant remains to be seen, it seems like the game has been reworked in the past year.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft is reportedly working on a remaster of Bungie's classic first-person shooter Halo: Combat Evolved and is eyeing up a PlayStation release - alongside multi-console releases for the likes of Hellbalde 2 and the next Doom - potentially marking a landmark moment for one of Xbox's most recognisable exclusives.
</p>
<p>
That's according to The Verge's Tom Warren, who (in the site's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">paywalled Notepad newsletter</a>) says a new Halo: Combat Evolved remaster is currently in the early stages of development. It's one of several new games reportedly being considered for Project Latitude - Microsoft's internal name for its new multi-console release strategy - following multi-console launches for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-did-we-think-of-microsofts-multiplatform-xbox-soft-launch">Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Pentiment, and Hi-Fi Rush</a> earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
Other Xbox games currently being considered for a multi-console release are said to include Doom: The Dark Ages (seemingly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-offers-doom-hint-as-suggestion-of-an-imminent-reveal-swirls">set for a reveal</a> during this weekend's Xbox Games Showcase), Hellblade 2, Starfield, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, and Age of Mythology.

<p>
Warren notes this doesn't mark a full multi-console strategy shift for Microsoft, with the company still retaining some titles as Xbox exclusives. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-6-will-be-announced-in-june-leak-suggests">Gears 6</a>, Playground Games' Fable reboot, and We Happy Few developer Compulsion's South of Midnight - all set to feature in this weekend's showcase according to Warren, with the latter two likely getting 2025 release dates - are reportedly <em>not</em> currently being considered for a multi-console release.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time we've heard Microsoft is considering bringing more Xbox titles to other consoles, of course. Reports <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-mulls-major-xbox-exclusives-starfield-indiana-jones-for-playstation-5-reports">surfaced in February</a> claiming Starfield had been earmarked for a potential PlayStation release, alongside MachineGames' upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.
</p>
<p>
In May, it was reported Microsoft executives have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-bosses-reportedly-pushing-for-no-red-line-around-which-xbox-games-launch-on-playstation">pushing for a no "red line" approach</a> to bringing Xbox titles to PlayStation and Nintendo platforms, in a bid to increase margins. That claim came in the wake of last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-buying-zenimax-parent-company-of-bethesda-id-software-and-more-report">$69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, and Microsoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">close a number of Bethesda studios</a> - including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall studio Arkane Austin - as it refocuses on what it called "priority games".
</p>
<p>
There's no word on when Microsoft might announce a fresh batch of multi-console releases for its Xbox titles, but Warren says he's not expecting any Project Latitude news during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-showcase-2024-time-date-where-to-watch">Sunday's Xbox Games Showcase</a>. That's being livestreamed at 6pm UK time (10am PT, 1pm ET) on 9th June, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">an hour-long Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 presentation</a> will air immediately after.
