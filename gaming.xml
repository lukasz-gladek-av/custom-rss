            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking to boost your productivity without cluttering your desk or weighing down your backpack? A portable monitor opens up a world of possibilities: extend your laptop screen for seamless multitasking at the coffee shop, transform your phone into a mini workstation during travel, enjoy console gaming on a crisp display anywhere or catch up on movies during long commutes.</p>
<p>The beauty of these displays is that they take up less space than a standard notebook while doubling your screen real estate. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">the KYY 15.6-inch portable monitor has dropped to a new record low of $69 (down from $99) for Prime Big Deal Day on Amazon</a>, and the good news is that this deal is <strong>available to non-Prime</strong> members as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This makes it one of the cheapest ways of adding a second monitor to your setup but what counts is what you’re getting for your money. The KYY monitor <strong>provides Full HD 1920×1080 resolution on a 15.6-inch IPS panel which means clear text and high-quality colors from almost any angle due to the 178-degree viewing angle</strong>. The IPS setup provides true color consistency even when you’re not looking directly at the monitor. The addition of HDR tech provides greater contrast and colour depth, creating more realistic images that make both work documents and entertainment media more interesting to watch.</p>
<p>The monitor includes <strong>blue light reduction tech and flicker-free backlight</strong> which helps reduce eye fatigue when sitting for prolonged periods or staying up for gaming sessions. The side menu control wheel gives fast toggling for brightness, contrast and color temp without digging through convoluted button combinations. The <strong>monitor allows both landscape and portrait modes</strong>, which allows it to be flexible for varying uses such as coding for instance.</p>



<h2>Premium features worth the extra cost</h2>
<p>The connectivity choices warrant a special mention since they dictate how easily you’ll be able to truly employ this monitor across your devices. The KYY features a couple of full-function <strong>USB-C ports</strong>&nbsp;which is a big plus point. This allows you to power the monitor and send video out of a single cable when plugged into laptops or phones sporting USB-C with video output (Thunderbolt 3 or USB 3.1). The real-world advantage here is getting rid of cable clutter and streamlining your portable setup. For devices that lack USB-C, there exists a <strong>Mini-HDMI port that guarantees backward support for older laptops</strong>, gaming consoles such as PS4 and Xbox and the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p><strong>Thin and light at 0.3 inches thick and just 1.7 pounds</strong>, the monitor fits into a backpack without adding discernible bulk. The smart cover, which is included, has several uses: it protects the display from scratches when being carried around with its tough PU leather covering, magnetically attaches to the display for a frameless experience, and doubles into a stand with two rotating grooves for varying viewing angles. This makes carrying a separate stand or holding the monitor against some arbitrary object unnecessary. The dual stereo speakers built-in, along with a 3.5mm audio jack, make sound options available without needing external speakers, although the speakers are more geared towards casual usage than audiophile-quality sound.</p>
<p>For this all-time-low $69, you’re getting a full portable display solution with the<strong> Protective Cover and Screen Protector bundle included</strong>. For remote workers or gamers requiring portability for their setup, this bundle gives huge value for expanding your visual workplace.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Turtle Beach Atlas 200 Gaming Headset Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/06/turtle-beach-atlas-200-gaming-headset-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/turtle-beach-atlas-200-gaming-headset-review.1317319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Though they’ve diversified into every type of peripheral known to man, beast and AI construct, Turtle Beach’s legacy is still more for creating gaming headsets. The Atlas 200 is the latest to build on years of knowledge while taking clear aim at the budget-savvy buyer. It’s a winning formula, and they’ve potentially brought us the best budget headset of the year.</p>
<p>The main selling point for this wired headset is absolutely, categorically, irrefutably, the quality of the audio. Turtle Beach have had their drivers and audio delivery nailed down for years at this point – my go-to wired headset remains the seven-year-old original Turtle Beach Elite Pro – and this sounds as utterly fantastic as those do. The difference is that it was, at the time, the pinnacle of their product lineup, whereas you’re now getting all that audio quality in a £60 headset.</p>



<p>That’s being delivered by 50mm Nanoclear Drivers, which are the same as you’ll find in the top-tier £200+ <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/26/turtle-beach-stealth-pro-gaming-headset-review/">Stealth Pro</a>. They are powerful, loud and provide an excellent amount of detail alongside a hefty dose of depth and bass. They’re versatile too, taking the epic sci-fi soundtrack of Star Wars Outlaws and enveloping you in the world of Kay Vess, or making the grid-iron audio of Madden 25 feel direct and visceral.</p>
<p>Thanks to the 3.5mm connection, they’re compatible with a wide range of devices, from plugging into a PlayStation or Xbox controller, to the top of your Nintendo Switch 2, or into your PC. Our review unit came in PlayStation 5-matching blue and grey, and it’s a smart looking piece of kit, though if I’m being honest, I was disappointed that it doesn’t exactly match the PS5’s colour scheme.</p>

<p>The body of the Atlas 200 is wholly built from plastic, and there’s a lot of flex in the body and arms, which bodes well for its longevity. I was able to twist and pull it into a wide variety of extreme situations, and it simply sprang back into shape. If you’re the kind of careless headphone owner who sits down on their headset multiple times a week, this could be the answer.</p>
<p>The plastic used here manages to straddle the line between thin and cheap-feeling and solid and heavy, and the Atlas 200 is pleasingly light in your hand and on your head, coming in at only 280g. It’s broken up by the different fabrics that have been used. The floating blue headband ties through to the external surfaces of the headset, with each end proudly adorned with a PlayStation logo.</p>

<p>The headband is then further cushioned and protected by grey webbing, though I’m not entirely sold on what purpose it serves. It does feel as though, over time, this fabric portion could eventually wear, but there’s been no sign of that through our month-long testing.</p>
<p>The ear cushions are fabric-covered memory foam, and there’s Turtle Beach’s patented ProSpec tech here as well – those are imperceptible notches in the earpads that make wearing glasses comfortable while wearing the headset. Fundamentally, I’ve been able to wear the Atlas 200 all day without any discomfort, and they’ve continued to deliver time and time again.</p>
<p>I do appreciate the fact that there’s no charging involved. They’re ready to go whenever you are, and with all of the mainline console controllers now featuring a headphone socket, there’s less need to seek out a wireless headset, while you can reduce latency by going wired from your console to your controller as well. Admittedly, that might be more cables than some people want to live with, but on the plus side, you’ll never run out of power (unless your gamepad does).</p>

<p>That simplicity follows through to the controls. The left earpiece plays host to a single volume dial, which is smooth to operate and easy to locate. Beyond that, there’s the flip-down mic arm, which is muted when vertical and live when down. It’s a startlingly clear uni-directional mic as well – so much so that other players commented on it – and everyone could hear my extremely important thoughts as we jumped around in King of Meat or slayed another Lagiacrus in Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>At this £60 price point, Nacon’s RIG headsets would be my other consideration, whether that’s wired with the RIG 500 Pro range or with the wireless RIG 600 Pro for a little more cash. They both offer similar build and excellent sound quality, but I do think the Atlas 200 is the more attractive option, simply in terms of visuals. That said, the RIG 600 Pro HS comes in some seriously wild colour schemes if that’s more your thing, and is somehow lighter at 240g while also bringing wireless tech to the party.</p>

<p>Do you need anything more for your gaming audio than the Turtle Beach Atlas 200? It might be a budget headset, but it sounds excellent, with a sound profile that more expensive headsets would lust after, and it’s incredibly easy to live with, thanks to its simplistic controls and universal connection. If you can accept wires in your life, then look no further than the Atlas 200.</p>

            <p>You there, fumbling around in the dark darkness of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-deep-of-night-is-nigh-so-heres-a-big-patch-with-more-balancing-tweaks-than-a-tightrope-walker">Deep of the Night</a>. A new mod offers you the chance to channel your inner gladiator and test your strength in a dedicated boss arena.</p>
<p>I know, I know, you've spent at least 80% of your time with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> thus far battering and being battered by bosses. But come on, you know you need to roll around more big blokes, with the chance to customise each bout of rolling exactly to your liking.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"A standalone game mode focused entirely on fighting bosses" is the promise of modder PositronCannon with their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/449?tab=description">Nightreign boss arena</a>, which has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5645?tab=description">popular</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/1854">siblings</a> for base <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>. It adds a boss selection menu to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-how-to-get-to-roundtable-hold">Roundtable Hold</a> featuring "almost every boss in the game, from Nightlords to minibosses".</p>
<p>Before hopping into a fight, a bunch of options let you tune both your character and aspects of the fight exactly how you fancy. Loadout-wise, there's "full access to the sparring grounds weapon selection menu, the ability to apply/remove passive buffs, set your character's level, set the amount of healing flasks, equip talismans, buy relics and other items for free", as well as cheats if you fancy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the stats and characteristics of each boss can be tweaked, with the chance to specify if you want to take on a foe of a specific depth, a certain variant, or one of Deep of Night's mutated enemies. All ideal if the goal's getting in some lower-stakes practice for a certain expedition scenario or simply messing around with Nightreign's roster of would-be night-ruiners. The likes of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/141?tab=description">Free Reign</a> also let you warp straight to certain boss battles from Roundtable Hold, but to my eye PositronCannon's creation goes a lot more in-depth in terms of options to set up the exact fight you want.</p>
<p>The modder also has some ambitious expansion plans for it, in the form of an "Expedition Boss Rush" mode that'll see players "progress through a series of semi-random boss fights, obtaining items, buffs and runes as you go, culminating in a Nightlord fight." Sounds cool, if you're after a trip out in the evening that's a bit more heavy on slap-fests with serious supervisors.</p>
<p>All of that said, PositronCannon makes clear that their work's aimed solely at solo players, meaning it's not designed for seamless co-op enjoyers and likely won't work with that. So, if you're aiming to fight with friends, you're best off sticking with another boss battle mod or just the base game with seamless.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving this boss arena a whirl, you'll first need to grab <a href="https://github.com/garyttierney/me3/releases">Mod Engine 3</a>.</p>

              <p>If you’re not already one of the hundreds of millions of people who own an Alexa speaker at home, then <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> could be a good time to join the ride. Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">discounted its Echo Dot at a record-low $34, down from the usual $49</a> (and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4515/">the Echo Pop to $24 from $39</a>), and there’s a reason this tiny speaker has become so popular: It removes that daily friction of foraging for your phone when setting timers when cooking, changing thermostats manually or searching for the correct playlist when your hands are full.</p>

<h2>Audio That Finally Keeps Up with the Convenience</h2>
<p>Earlier Echo Dots won their success on the strength of functionality over audio quality, but that changes with this new model: <strong>Amazon entirely rebuilt the internal audio design to produce tighter vocals, more robust bass response, and richer sound</strong> that fills a room rather than just crowding a corner. The speaker includes a new custom full-range driver that addresses high-end reproduction and low-end reproduction much more effectively than older, smaller drivers. That results in your morning news updates coming through with sharp clarity and music streaming through Spotify or Amazon Music with enough richness for casual enjoyment.</p>



<p>Integration with a smart home makes the <strong>Echo Dot a universal remote for your entire home</strong> for all your devices that are compatible. If you have bulbs, plugs, thermostats or cameras that are smart, voice commands replace physical switches or smartphone apps. The motion sensor and internal temperature sensor incorporate another form of automation with routines.</p>
<p>Several Echo devices per home allow whole-home audio so your music accompanies you wherever you go from kitchen through living room to bedroom. Pairing with Fire TV creates a home theater setup with playback managed by Alexa, searching for titles, and volume adjustment. Echo Dot also extends wifi coverage when paired with appropriate eero mesh wifi systems and does away with connectivity dead spots causing streaming stoppages and lost connections.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy features also include a physical off button for the mic that electronically disables the mics</strong>, and gives you complete control over when the unit is permitted to listen. The button glows red when the mics are disabled for obvious visual feedback. Amazon built some layers of privacy into the infrastructure, and the company does not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p>At $34 for Prime Day, the Echo Dot is the least expensive way into a voice-activated home automation and daily convenience features that quickly become a necessity once you experience them.</p>

              <p>Amazon’s <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> leave no brand behind nor any product category, introducing deep discounts on even the highest-end tech available out there. When setting up a high-performance PC, when upgrading a gaming rig or when processes on a professional level demand scorching fast storage velocities, the <strong>Samsung 990 Pro SSD is the ultimate consumer-grade solid-state drive</strong> at hand.</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4513/">2TB variant has fallen to an all-time-low $159 on Amazon, from its usual $199 asking price</a>. This fantastic Gen4 NVMe storage from Samsung is the sort serious gamers, video editors, 3D artists, and data pros depend on when seconds on load time make a difference.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4513/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sequential Velocities That Recalibrate What Fast Is</h2>
<p><strong>Sequential reads go up to 7,450 MB/s, writes up to 6,900 MB/s</strong>. To give you a better idea, you’re getting close to the theoretical limit of the PCIe 4.0 interface which is around 8,000 MB/s tops. That means the drive takes less than eight seconds to unload a 50GB installation for a game or relocate a 4K video workflow file whilst getting coffee. These speeds are thanks to <strong>Samsung’s proprietary controller and V-NAND</strong>&nbsp;which stacks memory cells vertically for elevated density and performance without increasing the physical size of the M.2 2280 form factor that occupies standard motherboard slots.</p>



<p>But sequential raw speeds are only part of the equation: Random read and write performance is more relevant to real-world computing because the majority of activities involve accessing spuradically distributed data across the drive, not large swathes of contiguous files. <strong>Samsung boosted random performance by more than 55% over the last-generation 980 Pro</strong>, directly translating to snappier program launches and less stuttering in open-world titles constantly streaming assets from disk.</p>



<p>The Samsung 990 Pro delivers up to 50% better performance per watt than the previous generation so you get those scorching speeds using less energy and less heat output. This matters for compact form factors with limited airflow, thin notebooks where battery life is a concern or multi-drive workstations where overall heat accumulation might become a problem.</p>
<p>The 2TB capacity provides a sweet spot for current computing requirements – and games are increasingly going over 100GB installations, with some titles such as Call of Duty going over 200GB. Serious video editors who deal with 4K or even 6K video have a need for storing raw files, render caching, and project libraries. Data analysts working on large datasets prefer storing all of them on fast local storage instead of sluggish network drives.</p>
<p>The Samsung 990 Pro SSD is powered by a 1,200 terabytes written endurance rating on the 2TB model which means theoretically you have the capability of writing 600GB of information every single day for five years until the warranty expiration limit is reached. For most users, that is a lifetime of usage. The drive also includes Samsung’s Magician software, which monitors the health of the drives, manages firmware updates, and includes a secure erase feature.</p>
<p>At $159, this is the best pricing that we have seen on Samsung’s highest performance consumer-grade SSD yet.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-hits-roborock-hard-the-latest-10-000pa-robot-vacuum-with-mop-is-now-selling-for-pennies.1317286/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cleaning your floors shouldn’t feel like a never-ending chore, especially when pet hair seems to multiply overnight and daily messes keep piling up. The good news? The <strong>Roborock Q10 S5+</strong> just<strong> became Amazon’s #1 bestseller in robot vacuums</strong> during Prime Big Deal Days, and that’s impressive enough to catch your attention.</p>
<p>This newly released powerhouse combines serious suction, advanced mopping and a self-emptying station into one complete package, and right now it’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/">dropped to an all-time low of $299 on Amazon, down from its usual $399 price tag</a>. When a robot vacuum climbs to the top of the sales charts with those kinds of numbers, you know something special is happening.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Q10 S5+ addresses the fundamental frustration of robotic cleaning: constant maintenance. Its <strong>self-emptying station holds a massive 2.7-liter dust bag that handles up to 70 days of debris</strong> before you need to think about it. For households with shedding pets or high foot traffic, this means you can essentially forget about your vacuum for more than two months while it quietly does its job. The <strong>station automatically pulls dirt and hair from the robot after each cleaning session</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not emptying tiny dustbins every other day like with basic models.</p>
<h2>Powerful Performance That Handles Real-World Messes</h2>
<p>The suction power here is worth a mention because numbers count when you’re working with ground-in dirt. At 1<strong>0,000 Pa, the HyperForce suction power creates enough pressure for it to remove embedded pet hair</strong> from carpet fibers, lift crumbs out of hardwood crevices and deal with the type of debris that lesser robots just bulldoze around. That’s about double what you’ll get on starter versions.</p>



<p>But a vacuum on its own won’t cure the tangling problem plaguing the majority of robot vacs, especially homes with long hair or fluffy pets. Roborock created a dual anti-tangle solution comprising a JawScrapers Comb main brush with a special side brush designed specifically to fight hair wrap. The structure of the comb separates and directs hair dynamically into the suction stream instead of wrapping it round the roller, so you’ll have a lot less time spent cutting out bunched-up grime from the brush bar.</p>
<p>The VibraRise 2.0 cleaning system provides a dual-zone sonic vibration technology that cleans floors 3,000 times a minute. This isn’t the languid wet pad sliding you witness on less advanced models. The active scrubbing action indeed addresses dried-on spills and tacky areas, and the system automatically lifts the mop pad 0-8mm when it recognizes carpet using ultrasonic sensors. That same recognition initiates automatic suction boost on the carpets for further cleaning while safeguarding them against moisture damage.</p>
<p>The navigation tech distinguishes advanced robots from simple bump-and-go ones, and the <strong>Roborock Q10 S5+ makes full home 360-degree mapping</strong> a breeze with its PreciSense LiDAR scanning tech. The tech provides precise floor plans and multi-level mapping, so a two-storey home, for instance, will have both floor plans remembered by the robot, which then changes cleaning strategy to suite both areas. ReactiveTech obstacle avoidance with structured light detection detects chair legs, toys, and cables, amongst others and cleverly navigates a path around them without getting stuck or requiring rescue.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that deal before it runs out of stock (which is a matter of time).</p>

Instead, it’s giving subscribers more points for use in its Rewards scheme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, as part of controversial changes made to Xbox Game Pass, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-appears-to-have-quietly-ditched-the-10-xbox-game-pass-dlc-discount-including-for-cod-points-this-week">Microsoft was found to have pulled the 10% discount on DLC for Game Pass games that Ultimate subscribers were able to get</a>, seemingly in favor of its new Rewards scheme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news first emerged when the Call of Duty community noticed that Ultimate subscribers were no longer eligible for 10% off COD Points purchases as well as Blackcell, the more expensive version of Call of Duty’s battle pass that can only be bought directly with real world money for $29.99. The discount was seen as highly valuable for fans who play Call of Duty via Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But fans discovered that the discount removal extended beyond Call of Duty to encompass the majority of individual DLC packs for Game Pass games. None of this was mentioned in last week’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-rises-to-30-a-month-microsoft-adds-more-day-one-games-and-throws-in-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-to-help-justify-the-cost"><u>Ultimate subscription price rise announcement</u></a>.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has now issued IGN a statement confirming the change and pointing subscribers to its official website for more information.</p><blockquote>“This is not specific to any one game and reflects all games and DLC purchases. Instead of a discount on the purchases, Ultimate and Premium subscribers will earn 10% and 5% — respectively — in points when purchasing select games and add-ons from the Game Pass library. Ultimate members continue to have 20% discount on select games from the Game Pass library. On top of that, all Rewards members will earn points when shopping games and add-ons on the Store, while Premium and Ultimate subscribers will earn even more, 2x and 4x respectively. See more detail on the Game Pass Rewards program <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/rewards" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.”</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, Microsoft’s play here, like so many retailers, is to keep your money swirling around its ecosystem rather than your bank account. Microsoft wants its customers to spend the full amount, and will then give the saving back to them in Reward points so they can in turn spend those on gift cards, keeping the cash in the Xbox ecosystem rather than letting customers save their own money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the latest development in what has been a bruising week for Microsoft’s Game Pass, which kicked off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cancelations-anger-and-frantic-subscription-stacking-the-internet-reacts-to-microsofts-xbox-game-pass-price-hike"><u>with a backlash over Microsoft's decision to raise the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</u></a> from $19.99 a month to $29.99 a month (an extra $120 a year).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To justify the increase in price of Ultimate, Microsoft has increased the number of day one releases per year to 75, and has added Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics for the first time ever. There are also upgrades to Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft+ Classics — valued at $7.99 / £6.99 per month per platform — is now part of Ultimate. Starting November 18, Fortnite Crew — which itself costs $11.99 / £9.99 a month — will be included in Ultimate, with access to the Fortnite Battle Pass and 1,000 V-Bucks each month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cloud gaming boost amounts to better performance. Ultimate subscribers “exclusively enjoy our best quality streaming and shortest wait times,” Microsoft said. Xbox Cloud Gaming has also officially exited beta “as part of our commitment to make gameplay smoother and more responsive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft said the new $30 a month Ultimate price reflects “the expanded catalog, new partner benefits, and upgraded cloud gaming experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Premium tier (what was called Standard) will add new Xbox-published games within a year of their launch, but that excludes Call of Duty games. This means that if you want to play Call of Duty via Game Pass in a timely fashion, you’re pretty much forced into paying for Ultimate. Over the course of a year, that’s $360. And now, you don’t even get 10% off COD Points or BlackCell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are running the numbers and reassessing whether Game Pass remains right for them. Black Ops 7, which just launched in beta form ahead of its November release date, is a $70 game (Microsoft backtracked on $80 after a gamer outcry at the cost of Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds 2). IGN’s poll on the issue, which now has over 32,000 voters, shows 53.2% of our audience will not subscribe to Game Pass at all. 20.7% said they were going for Ultimate despite the price rise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Microsoft has confirmed it's dropped Call of Duty DLC discounts through Game Pass, with subscribers instead earning reward points.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279">CharlieIntel</a> last week, Game Pass Ultimate members could previously receive a 10 percent discount on Call of Duty add-on content. However, this discount has since been removed alongside Microsoft's decision to increase the price of its top tier subscription.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with Eurogamer, Microsoft has now confirmed the removal of this discount, adding the change isn't specific to Call of Duty.</p>

<p>"This is not specific to any one game and reflects all games and DLC purchases," a Microsoft spokesperson said.</p>
<p>"Instead of a discount on the purchases, Ultimate and Premium subscribers will earn 10 percent and 5 percent - respectively - in points when purchasing select games and add-ons from the Game Pass library. Ultimate members continue to have 20 percent discount on select games from the Game Pass library. On top of that, all Rewards members will earn points when shopping games and add-ons on the Store, while Premium and Ultimate subscribers will earn even more, 2x and 4x respectively."</p>
<p>Full details on the rewards programme can be found on the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/rewards">Microsoft website</a>.</p>
<p>A further change has been made to the programme, though. Users are now no longer able to directly redeem earned points towards Xbox Game Pass subscriptions. Instead, you'll need to earn enough points for a gift card in a denomination sufficient to cover the cost of the subscription, and use this to purchase.</p>
<p>Last week, Microsoft announced an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">increase in price of its Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription</a> along with a shake of its tiers.</p>
<p>While it includes benefits such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics, the subscription now costs 50 percent more than before. This change to DLC discounts is another alteration that will impact subscribers for the foreseeable across DLC packs for all games.</p>
<p>The changes to Game Pass come despite Microsoft making record revenue from subscriptions last year.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</a> offers ample character customization possibilities with one of the series' most versatile Job Systems to date. However, having this many abilities can feel overwhelming, especially with Reaction Abilities, whose efficacy can be challenging to evaluate just from their in-game descriptions. As these abilities are a central part of combat, often turning a losing fight into a decisive win, the right choice can completely change how a unit performs on the battlefield.</p>



<p><strong><em>NOTE: This guide is based on Enhanced mode’s Tactician difficulty, but it applies to other difficulty settings and Classic mode as well. All screenshots were captured from the 1.0 Steam version.</em></strong></p>



<div><h2>The Best Reaction Abilities in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-shirahadori" data-level="2">Shirahadori</a></li><li><a href="#h-auto-potion" data-level="2">Auto-Potion</a></li><li><a href="#h-critical-recover-hp" data-level="2">Critical: Recover HP</a></li><li><a href="#h-mana-shield" data-level="2">Mana Shield</a></li><li><a href="#h-vanish" data-level="2">Vanish</a></li><li><a href="#h-reflexes" data-level="2">Reflexes</a></li><li><a href="#h-first-strike" data-level="2">First Strike</a></li></ul></div>

</ul>



<p>Shirahadori is undoubtedly the best Reaction Ability in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles for any unit with high Bravery. This ability turns the unit's Bravery stat into its parry rate for all physical attacks, both melee and ranged, meaning that a unit with 90+ Bravery will be able to parry the vast majority of physical attacks. While it doesn't provide any defense against magic or monster attacks, Shirahadori is so good that it makes it possible for a single unit to clear out an entire map without getting damaged once.</p>



<h2 id="h-auto-potion">Auto-Potion</h2>

<p>Auto-Potion is the ultimate restorative Reaction Ability in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, and the ability to learn for Ramza to win the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-win-the-battle-at-riovanes-castle-keep-in-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-guide/">most challenging battle in the game</a>. This ability makes it so a unit automatically uses a Potion when receiving damage, prioritizing the weaker Potions in your possession. As such, you can get a guaranteed 150 HP healed per attack for a unit with high Bravery if you discard every Potion and Hi-Potion to use X-Potions exclusively, granting this unit unparalleled survivability against every attack that doesn't take them down.</p>



<h2 id="h-critical-recover-hp">Critical: Recover HP</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Critica: Recover HP is a solid Reaction Ability for tanks like the Samurai or the Knight</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Monk</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 500 JP</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Critical: Recover HP is not on the same level as Auto-Potion in terms of utility, but it's a pretty good ability to equip, especially for tanks with high HP like the Knight, Samurai, and Dragoon. When a unit is damaged and put in Critical condition, the ability will fully restore its HP. Unlike Auto-Potion, Critical: Recover HP has a higher degree of risk, as an attack could put the unit to low HP but not in Critical condition, so it's a little less reliable, but it's still overall very solid.</p>



<h2 id="h-mana-shield">Mana Shield</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Mana Shield requires some upkeep to be effective, but it's very good nonetheless</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Time Mage</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 400 </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Mana Shield is another solid Reaction Ability in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles that can give a unit excellent survivability with the proper setup. With this ability equipped, received damage will be converted from HP to MP, which is great for any unit that doesn't use spells, essentially allowing them to survive mortal 1-hit KO attacks with no drawback. If you pair this ability with the Monk's Martial Arts skill Chakra, you can restore your MP to continue using this ability once the unit's MP has been depleted without having to rely on items.</p>



<h2 id="h-vanish">Vanish</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Vanish is a great Reaction Ability to take some risks against enemies using physical attacks</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Ninja</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 1000</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Vanish is a really good reaction ability that works best for units with excellent mobility to reduce the risks of rushing into enemy groups or for backline mages getting targeted by Archers. Upon receiving a physical attack, the unit will be granted Invisibility, making it impossible for them to be targeted by the enemy. Unfortunately, Invisibility will end as soon as the unit takes action, so Vanish isn't as versatile as some of the other best Reaction Abilities in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-reflexes">Reflexes</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Reflexes can make some units almost untouchable</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Ninja</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 400</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Reflexes is a good Reaction Ability that works great for units with an innate high evasion rate or those equipping cloaks. Upon receiving an attack, the unit's evasion rates against physical and magical attacks are increased significantly, making it easier for them to evade attacks. Equip this ability to a Ninja wearing a cloak, and enemies will have a tough time hitting them, although there's still the small chance that attacks will land, so reliability isn't the best.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-strike">First Strike</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>First Strike can be devastating with certain character builds.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Monk</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 1300</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>First Strike requires more effort to learn than the other Reaction Abilities above, but with the proper setup, it can be used offensively and defensively. This ability prevents human units within standard attack range from dealing damage by preemptively attacking them. While its usage is limited to standard physical attacks, if you equip a unit with both First Strike and the Dual Wield support ability from the Ninja, you can create a unit that can obliterate physical attackers before they even get the chance to attack.</p>



<p>With these Reaction Abilities, you should have no trouble dealing with every enemy that bars your way in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an interview published in the latest EDGE Magazine (<a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/us/edge-subscription/dp/39f150bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issue 416</a>), Embark Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-ea-dice-exec-starts-embark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founder and CEO Patrick Söderlund</a> spoke about the coincidence of the studio's next game, ARC Raiders, and Battlefield 6 launching in the same month. </p>



<p>As some of you might recall, Söderlund was CEO and then Vice President and General Manager of DICE for over ten years. As such, Battlefield was a huge part of his career. The executive said Battlefield 6 looks really good, and expressed happiness that the franchise is in a good place now.</p>



<p><em>It is odd. I mean, we built Battlefield! But honestly, when I saw Battlefield 6 and what the team has done with it, I know how much time and energy has gone into it. I think it looks really good, and I’m very happy it does look good. It’s an IP and a game that deserves to be great. I want to play it. And I will play it – until the day we release ARC Raiders. And then I will play ARC Raiders instead.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Due on October 30</a>, ARC Raiders, a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter, is admittedly very different from Battlefield 6. However, Embark's debut title, THE FINALS, has a lot more in common with Battlefield, a first-person shooter with an emphasis on environmental destructibility. </p>



<p>The game launched in December 2023 and has had its ups and downs. Fans should not worry, anyway, as Söderlund said that Embark plans to support THE FINALS for years to come.</p>



<p><em>We take a 12-month approach, reviewing on an annual basis. In December 2024, it’d been out for a year, we sat down and said, ‘We’ll give it one more year and see what happens’. And then, relatively quickly, during the spring, we saw an uplift. So, right now, I don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t continue supporting it for the next five years, to be honest.</em></p>



<p>Season 8 <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-season-8-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched last month</a>, adding new weapons and improving the game's physics destruction.</p>

            <p>Delightful medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a> is among a number of games which have been temporarily delisted on Steam, as a result of a security vulnerability being unearthed in the Unity engine. Other games, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a>, have already received updates as a result of the issue.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"A security vulnerability was identified that affects games and applications built on Unity versions 2017.1 and later for Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems," Unity <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/unity-platform-protection-take-immediate-action-to-protect-your-games-and-apps/1688031">revealed late on Friday</a>. "There is no evidence of any exploitation of the vulnerability, nor has there been any impact on users or customers. We have proactively provided fixes that address the vulnerability, and they are already available to all developers. The vulnerability was responsibly reported by the security researcher RyotaK, and we thank him for working with us."</p>
<p>Unity added that all versions of games made with Unity since an update in September 2017 "may contain this vulnerability". A <a href="https://unity.com/security/sept-2025-01">security advisory page</a> about the issue says such apps risk being "susceptible to an unsafe file loading and local file inclusion attack depending on the operating system, which could enable local code execution or information disclosure at the privilege level of the vulnerable application." The advisory also claims that the Unity engine itself has been provided with the fixes that developers will need.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>A security vulnerability affecting our games that use Unity has recently been identified.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;As a precaution and to keep you safe, we have temporarily removed the following titles and products from digital storefronts while we implement the necessary updates to address the issue:…</p></div>— Obsidian (@Obsidian) <a href="https://twitter.com/Obsidian/status/1974215697845923976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>As a result, publishers including <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/advisory/ADV256762">Microsoft</a> and Obsidian have opted to temporarily pull affected games from sale on Steam while they're updated. Pentiment, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, Wasteland 3, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> are among the yanked games, and as of writing have yet to be restored to the storefront. Meanwhile, some games have ended up as more complex cases. For instance, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>'s premium edition has been pulled, but the base game remains up, because the only element of it at risk is a Unity-developed artbook.</p><p>A number of games have also remained online after receiving rapid updates, with Among Us devs Innersloth having been fittingly quick to <a href="https://x.com/AmongUsGame/status/1974232390479298663">deal with potential susness</a>, while Marvel Snap <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1974171006085554309">was rapidly patched</a>. It's worth noting that Microsoft recommend you temporarily uninstall any affected games until updates are available. The company extend that to games they no longer support, like The Elder Scrolls: Legends and 2019 versions of both Doom and Doom 2. These unsupported games have also been pulled from stores, so the need to uninstall only applies if you already own them.</p>
<p>Odds are the pulled games which haven't been sunsetted will return to Steam relatively soon with fresh updates, but it's maybe worth checking your list of current installs to make sure nothing affected's hanging around on your drives.</p>

<header><section>
<p>A little Game Boy Advance goodness?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you played Orbital Media's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/scurge_hive">Scurge:Hive</a> back when it launched in 2006, on both GBA and DS, you'll already know that it's a super-solid action effort that takes its cues from the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_fusion">Metroid: Fusion</a>, and then melds them into a tight isometric space adventure.</p>
<p>Now, Raitalaika Games has announced that its new Switch port of the game will hit the eShop on 10th October (hey, that's this week!), priced at £14.99/$14.99.</p>
<p>Scurge: Hive sees you jump into the space boots of impossibly long-haired Jenosa Armaon, as she takes on "a shocking and dangerous mission" that sees her, well, head to a mysterious space station to investigate a bizarre lifeform.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is a mission that, across its ~10-hour running time, gives you an intense blast of manga action that plays very like a Samus joint in its power suit and arm cannon upgrading. However, here you also have to factor in tricksy isometric shooting angles and the ever-present prospect of death, as Jenosa is infected and dying. Intense!</p>
<p>Here's some further info from the PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our heroine has been contracted by the Military to recover a top-secret science laboratory on an obscure distant planet. To her surprise, the cause of the disaster is a notorious virus known as “Scurge”, which has the ability to enslave all things to its destructive will. Powered by bio-protective armor, Jenosa is able to resist but not destroy “Scurge”.</p>
<p>She must use her agility, her weapons, and her wits to contain and ultimately defeat the cruel virus before it spreads.<br>
<strong><br>
Features</strong><br>
- Six different levels with boss fights<br>
- Boss Rush<br>
- Isometric platforming, combat and puzzles<br>
- Epic science-fiction narrative<br>
- Upgrade your arsenal<br>
- “Infection meter” mechanic<br>
- Save States, cheats &amp; rewind functionality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With a delightfully chunky art style and some incredibly familiar-looking enemies in some of the screenshots, we have to admit there's something very appealing about a return trip to Confederation Research Lab 58.</p>
<p>The DS version has <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/scurge-hive/">a Metascore of 70</a>, so if you didn't play it two decades back, it's not too late.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-canceled-amd-minimum-order/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-handheld-rumored-to-have-been-canceled-over-amd%E2%80%99s-high-minimum-order-requirements.1317247/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-amd-apu/">Xbox handheld </a>has been canceled over AMD's high minimum order requirements, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>The rumors originated from the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/microsoft-we-are-actively-investing-in-our-future-first-party-consoles-and-devices-designed-engineered-and-built-by-xbox.1688818/page-4#post-270871817">NeoGAF forums</a>, where known AMD leaker Kepler L2, who accurately provided information multiple times in the past regarding AMD products, including consoles, said that, as far as they know, the handheld was canceled because AMD wanted a commitment of over 10 million units to justify the R&amp;D required to make a dedicated SoC for the console. However, with the Steam Deck selling around 5 million units, and the ASUS ROG only selling no more than 2 million units, Microsoft didn't want to take the risk.</p>



<p>Despite Kepler L2's excellent track record, we have to take the real reason behind the cancellation of the Xbox handheld with a grain of salt. As the system was never officially announced, Microsoft will unlikely release an official statement on it. However, considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-might-go-full-third-party-leaving-hardware-for-good-rumor/">the company's strategy seemingly shifting more towards becoming a third-party publisher</a>, it's quite possible it didn't want to commit to producing so many units for a system that may not have been a massive seller.</p>



<p>Although the Xbox handheld was never formally announced, there was no doubt that a portable system has been in the works at some point, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-will-offer-the-best-of-console-and-pc-put-together-says-microsoft-more-info-coming-in-2025/">execs teasing it multiple times in the past</a>. The system would have been part of the company's handheld strategy, which is now going to be centered around the ROG Xbox Ally launching later this month. Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">its relatively high price</a>, the handheld system is proving to be quite popular, as<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-already-selling-out-across-the-globe/"> it's already sold out almost everywhere</a> before its launch set for October 16.</p>

With<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-5-the-ultimate-external-battery-handheld#/"> the GPD Win 5</a>, I can confirm it’s created the most powerful handheld ever — by sacrificing a big chunk of the portability that makes handhelds attractive to begin with. With prices ranging from $1,600 to $2,200, it’s too rich for me, but I’m beginning to wonder if cord-first handhelds might be a legit new category for the most demanding PC gamers.</p><p>The Win 5 is a 7-inch, 1080p, 120Hz VRR handheld that looks like a giant PlayStation Vita crossed with a PSP, right down to its silver rounded metal corners and transparent D-pad. Which, by the way, is one of the best D-pads I’ve ever used. But the reason you’d buy one isn’t the comfortable sculpt, it’s that it’s the first handheld with AMD’s Strix Halo chip. That’s the same one you’ll find<a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/749404/framework-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-max-385-395-plus-review"> in the Framework Desktop</a>, with the fastest integrated gaming graphics yet made.</p><p>To power that monster chip, GPD makes you either A) plug in a power cord, or B) snap on a battery “backpack.” That’s right: there’s no battery inside this handheld itself.</p><p>I was ready for that to be a dealbreaker. I half-expected I’d give up after a few days of fighting the cord or flinging around a heavy brick.</p><p>Instead, after a week and change playing with an early prototype, I’m finding it surprisingly well thought out. GPD studied the cord, leaning into its strengths to create a lighter and far more powerful handheld plugged in. I can attach the battery, then unplug the cord and still play games at high framerate; when I tire of the battery’s weight, I can run a cable between the battery and handheld and stick the battery part in a pocket or bag.</p><p>And this isn’t like sticking a normal USB-C battery into a normal portable. These tethers unlock far more power.</p><p>Even though it’s been over three years since the Steam Deck first arrived on the scene, handheld performance hasn’t evolved all that much. Rivals have put faster chips in their portables, but none play the latest games at 1080p any more competently than the Steam Deck could. Why bother with high-res screens at all?</p><p>The GPD Win 5 justifies its 1080p screen. It plays today’s games that way, not just titles from yesteryear. <em>Cyberpunk 2077, Returnal, Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> all gave me over 60fps at 1080p and ultra settings, without any AI-enhanced upscaling or frame generation techniques. And newer games like <em>Expedition 33 </em>and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> are running at 1080p in high spec for me. Depending on the game and power mode the GPD Win 5 ran two, three, even four times faster than rivals.</p><p>Here’s how it compares to the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus and the Lenovo Legion Go 2, the newest and theoretically the most powerful retail handhelds, each running full bore. Then, you’ll see the GPD Win 5 compared to a wider range of handhelds at 720p.</p><div><h2>GPD Win 5 vs. top rivals</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>GPD Win 5</h3></th><th><h3>Lenovo Legion Go 2</h3></th><th><h3>MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 1080p ultra on battery</td><td>71</td><td>24</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>1080p ultra, plugged</td><td>79</td><td>25</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>720p low on battery</td><td>116</td><td>70</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>720p low, plugged</td><td>138</td><td>67</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 1080p ultra on battery</td><td>92</td><td>33</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>1080p ultra, plugged</td><td>95</td><td>31</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>720p low on battery</td><td>141</td><td>106</td><td>114</td></tr><tr><td>720p low, plugged</td><td>177</td><td>108</td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 1080p ultra on battery</td><td>76</td><td>23</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>1080p ultra, plugged</td><td>71</td><td>20</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>720p low on battery</td><td>89</td><td>46</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>720p low, plugged</td><td>109</td><td>47</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 1080p ultra on battery</td><td>111</td><td>39</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>1080p ultra, plugged</td><td>120</td><td>40</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>720p low on battery</td><td>142</td><td>88</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>720p low, plugged</td><td>180</td><td>89</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 1080p ultra on battery</td><td>34</td><td>24</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>1080p ultra, plugged</td><td>39</td><td>23</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>720p low on battery</td><td>45</td><td>33</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>720p low, plugged</td><td>46</td><td>36</td><td>46</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><h2>720p benchmarks</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>GPD Win 5</h3></th><th><h3>MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Z1E, SteamOS)</h3></th><th><h3>ROG Ally X (Z1E, Windows)</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>51</td><td>51</td><td>57</td><td>41</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>72</td><td>60</td><td>73</td><td>59</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>87</td><td>71</td><td>79</td><td>65</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>97</td><td>76</td><td>82</td><td>71</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in maximum</td><td>138</td><td>77</td><td>86</td><td>71</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>65</td><td>79</td><td>74</td><td>59</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>91</td><td>93</td><td>92</td><td>84</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>112</td><td>105</td><td>99</td><td>91</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>125</td><td>114</td><td>100</td><td>93</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in maximum</td><td>177</td><td>119</td><td>102</td><td>93</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>42</td><td>40</td><td>24</td><td>31</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>48</td><td>30</td><td>40</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>79</td><td>52</td><td>32</td><td>43</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>88</td><td>54</td><td>33</td><td>46</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in maximum</td><td>109</td><td>56</td><td>34</td><td>46</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>55</td><td>62</td><td>52</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>88</td><td>66</td><td>83</td><td>65</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>111</td><td>73</td><td>89</td><td>70</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>125</td><td>81</td><td>93</td><td>76</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in maximum</td><td>180</td><td>81</td><td>96</td><td>76</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>29</td><td>31</td><td>37</td><td>28</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>34</td><td>37</td><td>47</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>40</td><td>42</td><td>50</td><td>28</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>42</td><td>44</td><td>52</td><td>34</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in maximum</td><td>46</td><td>46</td><td>55</td><td>34</td><td>33</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>All games tested at 720p low, save Cyberpunk 2077 in “Steam Deck” mode.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>But you need to know GPD is winning because the Strix Halo chip is guzzling down electricity.</p><p>While the Steam Deck’s processor tops out at 15-watt TDP, and beefier handhelds like the MSI Claw 8 and Legion Go 2 now do 30 or 35 watts, GPD’s Strix Halo can go all the way to 60 watts on battery. Plug in the included AC adapter, and you can play and charge while offering the chip an entire 80 watts of juice. And that’s just how much the processor uses — when you add all the other system components that keep it fed and blast pixels towards your eyes, I sometimes saw battery drain of 100 watts or more.</p><div id=":Rk9djeab96:"><p><figcaption><em>Battery backpack optional.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>With an 80 watt-hour battery I was lucky to get 45 minutes of play away from a wall when running it full bore. And that was with fans blasting so loudly there’s no way I’d be comfortable on public transit or in a car. Never mind that it weighs over 2 pounds and feels back-heavy with that battery on. (There’s an optional battery extension cable if you’d rather stuff it in a bag or cargo pants pocket.)</p><p>But you don’t need that battery at home: plug it into its (admittedly bulky) 180W AC barrel adapter, remove the battery, and suddenly it’s a spry 1.25 pounds, lighter than a Steam Deck. This handheld isn’t the worst of both worlds: you can choose.</p><p>You also don’t have to drain the battery so quickly. GPD gives you fine control over the processor’s power limits, and I was able to take the Strix Halo all the way down to a 6-watt TDP, theoretically giving me six-plus hours of battery life in the least intensive games. (That’s not bad, but not great, for a handheld with an 80 watt-hour battery.) But to actually get more speed than other handhelds, I had to use more power than them.</p><p>Let me illustrate with one last table:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power

modes to begin with — and how much more performance I often saw that way. But notice the battery drain? If I want to play three hours of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the MSI Claw 8 will currently give me better performance than the GPD Win 5 (60fps vs. 51fps). But if I’m willing to play only two hours on a charge, it’s reversed: 87fps for the GPD Win 5 vs just 76fps for the Claw.</p><p>If I only need 45 minutes to an hour, that’s when the big benefits emerge — or when you compare to handhelds that have smaller battery packs than the GPD Win 5 and Claw 8, such as the 55Wh pack in the Legion Go S or the 49Wh pack in the Steam Deck OLED. You get lower performance per hour there because the batteries don’t stretch as far. Scroll right in my table to see those.</p><p>(You might have noticed not all games I tested used the Strix Halo’s full horsepower. <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> mysteriously limited itself to fewer watts even when I gave it free rein, and both the Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS and the Claw 8 trounce it at 720p.).</p><p>Or, you could sidestep all of this battery discussion by simply plugging in the cord.</p><p>You should know the early prototype I’m playing with needs a lot of work, and this is <em>not</em> a review of the GPD Win 5 for that reason. <em>The Verge</em> only reviews final products. I ran into quite a few full-system-hangs, particularly when trying to change the TDP or unplug the DC barrel jack, a buggy touchscreen driver, squeaky triggers and more — which I mention because GPD is a small company that crowdfunds and sells products before it’s isolated and ironed out all those sorts of issues.<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-5-the-ultimate-external-battery-handheld#/"> This one’s on Indiegogo</a> right now.</p><p>Despite some initial reservations, I did have a good time<a href="https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/657618/gpd-win-max-2-review-2024-2025-tiny-laptop-handheld-gaming"> with the GPD Win Max 2</a> and I’m finding a lot to like with this new Win 5: good D-pad, good buttons, a <em>hardware</em> (not software) mouse mode switch, a full-size USB port, it’s even got that<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/759624/china-is-about-to-launch-ssds-so-small-you-insert-them-like-a-sim-card"> fancy new SIM-card like SSD slot</a>.

<p>At Nintendo's Direct in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-release-date-plus-samus-on-a-motorbike">the game's release date was finally revealed</a>, along with the new mode of transportation, which proved controversial for some.</p>
<p>Now, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/a376fcba-6f8a-4b2e-9ff7-7958b45b4997">game's Japanese website</a> has been updated with new details. The motorbike is called "Vi-O-La" and is used to explore expanses across the planet Byrus (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-reveals-more-details-about-samuss-metroid-prime-4-motorbike/">VGC</a>).</p>

<p>It seems the motorbike can only be ridden in specific areas, with players returning to Samus's point of view afterwards - we saw this in the release date trailer.</p>
<p>While riding the motorbike, Samus can boost and power slide to deflect enemies and crush ores, as well as increase speed.</p>
<p>She can also fire projectiles, locking on to up to five enemies. The projectiles return to Samus akin to a boomerang.</p>
<p>The motorbike will also be available as an amiibo.</p>
<p>It's not much to go on yet, but Metroid fans are keen to glean more information ahead of the game's release on 4th December.</p>
<p>The motorbike section of the trailer certainly stood out for providing something novel among otherwise standard <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> gameplay, but also feels particularly flashy and un-Metroid. The games are known for their slow exploration, so the inclusion of a motorbike is certainly a surprise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-give-samus-psychic-powers">Samus will also have psychic powers</a>, used to operate mechanisms, open doors, and control the trajectory of beams. Thrilling.</p>

According to the official release, it will be a "fully real-time simulation with thousands of soldiers fighting simultaneously" utilizing "next-gen multi-threaded AI." </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/kingmakers-official-announcement-trailer"><u>Kingmakers' announcement trailer</u></a> was a viral hit, garnering hundreds of thousands of views on IGN and other channels, with more than a few fans comparing it to Gate, an anime that features a similar mix of modern warfare and medieval fantasy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While many fans <a href="https://x.com/PlanBeeApiary/status/1974187263958659327" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accepted</a> the news, some were <a href="https://x.com/khaliltooshort/status/1974157925624279376" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>disappointed about the late notice</u></a>, especially as the delay came less than a week before the scheduled release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Why is Kingmakers being delayed? In short, it's an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don't want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door earlier," the company explained. "Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that's nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With Kingmakers, we set out to push the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60fps to mid-range PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80% engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement went on to explain that the shooter boasts "tens of thousands of soldiers, each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you'd expect from a AAA person shooter." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out," it added. "Nothing is faked. We have giant six story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it's a real place that can be entered or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every mission takes place in a giant, massive map that each player on the server is free to explore – with or without their own personal army of thousands," Redemption added. "We set out to do all of this, with full drop-in/drop-out four-player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a little bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it. So that is what we are doing now. We're making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent. We want this to be the case whether you have a top-of-the-line rig or a PC that's seen better days."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Redemption Road did not provide a revised release date, but did promise to share a half-hour-long "deepdive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">OpenAI has vowed to give copyright holders “more granular control” over character generation after its Sora 2 app produced a flood of videos that depicted copyrighted characters — including those owned by Nintendo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch of Sora 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-dont-sue-me-sora-2-app-opens-floodgates-to-ai-videos-of-pikachu-mario-and-more">social media was awash with videos featuring licensed characters, such as Mario, Pikachu, and an array of other <u>Pokémon</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">“The Dark Knight” <a href="https://t.co/2Hk0vlJBKJ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2Hk0vlJBKJ</a></p>— Justine Moore (@venturetwins) <a href="https://twitter.com/venturetwins/status/1973405656658092093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">According to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-new-sora-video-generator-to-require-copyright-holders-to-opt-out-071d8b2a" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wall Street Journal</u></a> report published ahead of the launch of Sora 2, OpenAI had already begun contacting movie studios and other intellectual property owners to offer them the chance to retroactively opt out of their fictional characters being available within the app's AI videos. That differed from the approach OpenAI said it would take to using the likeness of a recognizable public figure, which required that person to opt in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, on Saturday, <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/sora-update-number-1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a blog post</a> that the company had been “taking feedback” from users, rights holders and other groups, and would make changes as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He said rights holders would be given more “granular control” over the generation of characters, similar to how people can opt in to share their own likeness in the app, but with “additional controls.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are hearing from a lot of rightsholders who are very excited for this new kind of ‘interactive fan fiction’ and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all).”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/06/gettyimages-2236544077-1759743013545.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called Sora 2 videos using copyrighted characters "interactive fan fiction." Photo by: Kyle Grillot/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Altman said OpenAI would “let rightsholders decide how to proceed” and that there would be some “edge cases of generations” that get through the platform’s guardrails that should not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He said the company would also “have to somehow make money” from video generation, and already the platform was seeing people generating much more than expected per user. He said this could mean payment to rights holders who grant permission for their characters to be generated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The exact model will take some trial and error to figure out, but we plan to start very soon,” Altman said. “Our hope is that the new kind of engagement is even more valuable than the revenue share, but of course we want both to be valuable.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added there would be a high rate of change, similar to the early ChatGPT days, and there would be “some good decisions and some missteps.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tellingly, Altman pointed out the situation in Japan, saying: “In particular, we'd like to acknowledge the remarkable creative output of Japan — we are struck by how deep the connection between users and Japanese content is!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Altman’s statement comes as Nintendo took the unusual step of issuing an official statement seemingly in response to comments from Satoshi Asano, a member of Japan’s House of Representatives. In a deleted social media post he subsequently apologized for, Asano accused Nintendo of “avoiding using generative AI to protect its IP” and "engaging in lobbying activities with the government" over the increased use of generative AI in the gaming industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo denied this, but did warn it would take “necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Contrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI,” <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1974716195246088220" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo said</a>. “Whether generative AI is involved or not, we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One Sora 2 video viewed by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/04/sora-openai-video-app.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a> showed Sam Altman standing in a field with several Pokémon characters, where he says: “I hope Nintendo doesn’t sue us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As CNBC pointed out, Disney and Universal have sued the AI image creator Midjourney, alleging that the company improperly used and distributed AI-generated characters from their movies. Disney also sent a cease and desist letter to Character.AI, warning the startup to stop using its copyrighted characters without authorization.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of the videos that people are going to generate of these cartoon characters are going to infringe copyright,” Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School, told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/04/sora-openai-video-app.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>. “OpenAI is opening itself up to quite a lot of copyright lawsuits by doing this.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN last week, business lawyer and creator of the Virtual Legality podcast Richard Hoeg said the legality of OpenAI’s actions wasn't yet clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In short, we don't have a definitive answer yet," he said. "There are indications in some quarters that training on protected materials is likely going to be deemed legal so long as the materials themselves were acquired for some lawful purpose (and not pirated). But on the output side, the Disney/Dreamworks lawsuit makes some good arguments for why/how the law should expect these platforms to police prompts for infringing requests, especially if they are already policing for something else (porn, bigotry, etc.). But all of those are still just arguments, not settled law.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hoeg continued: "The law moves slowly, far slower than technology, which is why you see these tech companies racing ahead of it a bit. My best guess is that OpenAI is probably going to be okay long term on the training sets they used (assuming they weren't pirated), and that the 'opt out of training' option therefore won't do much of anything. Where they really need to concern themselves is on the output side and/or if they are marketing their software's abilities with protected content themselves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, the famously litigious The Pokémon Company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">formally responded to the use of Pokémon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security</a>, as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents. "Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content," a spokesperson told IGN, "and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

EA's first-person shooter has an October 10 release date, with pre-loads available now across all platforms except the Epic Games Store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 1, Battlefield 6's first major free update, kicks off on October 28 and releases in three phases: Rogue Ops, which brings new map Blackwell Fields, new weapons, and a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint; California Resistance, which introduces new SoCal map Eastwood and a 8v8 mode called Sabotage — that's coming on November 18; and the final phase of the first season, Winter Offensive, which rolls out on December 9. That includes "seasonal map" Empire State and an unannounced themed event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no early access for players buying the more expensive editions, so Battlefield 6 unlocks for all at the same time across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S. Steam players will not need to use EA App to play Battlefield 6 but will need an EA account. Those who purchased Battlefield 6 via the Epic Games Store will need EA App and an EA account to play.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> beta cheaters were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/water-is-wet-the-sky-is-blue-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-beta-has-cheaters">inevitable and expected</a>, with Activision hinting that they were intentionally prepping their big anti-cheat guns prior to early access kicking off. Now the beta's first weekend's passed, the publishers' anti-cheat enforcers Team Ricochet have posted an update addressing the cheating situation, claiming that their efforts thus far have seen a lot of success.</p>
<p>Seriously, they go as far as openly declaring that cheat sellers are "feeling the heat", which is a massive missed opportunity to use the phrase '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">quaking in their unsecured boots</a>', but we can't have everything.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"You may have seen clips of cheaters in the Black Ops 7 Beta," Activision's post read. "We had already actioned on most of those accounts before they hit social media. We’re watching closely, acting in real time, and learning from every attempt."</p>
<p>Cue the whipping out of some stats which the developers say apply to the beta's opening two days. "97% of cheaters were stopped within 30 minutes of their first sign-in," and "fewer than 1% of cheating attempts reached a match, and those who did were removed within minutes." "And this is just the beginning," Activision wrote. "When launch arrives, every layer of protection will be in full force, and Ricochet Anti-Cheat’s defenses will only grow stronger."</p><div>

<p>They're impressive stats to tout, but they do leave some question marks. Without the full numbers in terms of cheating instances detected and dealt with, it's tough to say how much success this symbolises. There's also the matter of any numbers only taking account instances of cheating Team Ricochet managed to detect, leaving the potential for attempts that may have gone totally undetected to have slipped through the cracks.</p>
<p>Activision also went beyond just saying their beta anti-cheat efforts have been successful thus far. "Major cheat providers are now labeling their tools 'unusable' or 'detected'," they wrote further on in the post. "Resellers are acknowledging they have no reliable products to offer for Black Ops 7. We’re not only disabling their cheats, but also their illegal businesses as well. We have now directly contributed to the closure of over 40 cheat developers and resellers since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a> launched. Vendors sharing clips during Beta were already on our radar and we will pursue them beyond in-game enforcement."</p>
<p>The fight against cheating is an industry-wide challenge and we’re committed to leading the charge," they concluded. "We continue to bring new systems online during Beta, fine-tuning our protections, responding faster and gaining deeper insights." It's fighting talk and we'll have to see whether Black Ops 7's full release brings more hoops for regular players to jump through as has happened with mandatory secure boot.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7's beta runs until October 8th, so odds are Activision will be back to share more stats about their anti-cheat efforts across the full duration of early access then.</p>
