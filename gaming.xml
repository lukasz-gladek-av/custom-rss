We finally made it to the end of January! There was quite a bit of Nintendo news this week, so we're sure everyone will enjoy kicking back with a couple o' games over the weekend.</p>
<p>We were treated to yet another Nintendo Direct this week, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> taking the spotlight. It looked really rather sweet, all in all, and it was nice to get some confirmation on the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dreams-price-and-box-art-have-been-revealed">price</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-moves-in-on-switch-1-this-april">release date</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">features</a>.</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">ACNH</a> done got me again. It's like a transporter incident has sent me back to 2020 and I'm once again finding solace in New Horizons' custom design tool, slowly crafting Star Trek-related patterns for my own amusement, watching hours zoom by as I move a single 'pixel' one square to the left and check the result. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dartmonkey.bsky.social/post/3mdntjiik6k2h">It's a happy place.</a></p>
<p>I'm steadily turning my upstairs room into Ten Forward, although I'm painfully aware that in the game somewhere, there must be better furniture to customise and more accurate green drinks to craft, which I just haven't found yet. I've even taken to working through the dreary DLC, hoping to access more cool items. Send help.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I've been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a> for what feels like one hundred years, and I've JUST seen my first real indication that Uchikoshi is up to his usual nonsense. I knew he was, that crafty devil! It's so good, although I will say that A) it must have been a nightmare to review, and B) you can really tell where the frosting gets a bit thin. They've definitely shaved the plot almost to nothing in some places just to achieve the illusion of overall fullness. But, eh, I don't mind! The bits that aren't thin are pretty darn great, and there's more writing in this than I've probably read in a year.</p>
<p>Other than that, I bought a few cheapy games in the Steam Sale — <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3862670/Shelldiver/">Shelldiver</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3069810/Rocket_Rats/">Rocket Rats</a>, most notably, from the same developer. They're well-polished little incremental games, and they very much give me the feeling that this developer has what amounts to a well-oiled factory machine for making incremental games in his head. I bet he can crank these out as soon as he has the inkling of a new idea. Honestly, I have such a huge respect for developers that can do that! Making games in a particular genre is like working out a muscle — it sucks and hurts and takes forever at first, but then it becomes second nature. Having the basic frameworks already built helps a lot, too!</p>
<p>Oh, god, I just read that the developer is only 25. Gonna go lie down and have an existential crisis. Gagonfe, if you're reading this, I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.</p>
<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I reckon it's pretty predictable what my games will be this week! After rolling credits on Dispatch, I know I'll be diving back in this weekend in an attempt to change up my ending and explore more of the what-ifs from my original playthrough. Knowing me, I'll likely rummage the eShop for some Telltale Games I may have missed out. Other than that, it's likely another weekend of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> or finally starting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> on my trusty 2DS when it arrives!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Made my way to chapter 9 of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>, loving it! But being a confused antisocial military bad boy who somehow is the love interest of three brilliant non-existent women is not the only fun way to spend the weekend: I have picked up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/283160/House_of_the_Dying_Sun/">House of the Dying Sun</a> on PC, and it is brilliant! I always loved the <strong>Starblade</strong> / <strong>Star Fox</strong> untextured polygon aesthetic, and this game takes it to the absolute extreme with combined fleet micro management. <strong>Rumble Roses XX</strong> is proving to be a rather solid wrestling title, but a bit too much of a grind for my tastes. It will take me forever to unlock the playable roster, but it does help that I was a fan of the PS2 original. It remains better than the current Switch 2 offerings.</p>
<p>My game of the week is GRID Legends: Gold Edition. I will finally fully recover my investment on the GameCube controller for Switch 2 because no way I will ever play this without the analogue triggers. I was oblivious that the story mode for this uses old-school full-motion video and actors, which gives it a bit of nostalgic charm. I will be spending the next few weeks quite entertained in the virtual tarmac.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Last week was good timing for picking up a copy of Tomodachi Life, eh? Yes, I've been diving back into the 3DS original over the last few days, and I had forgotten how much I love this silly little game! I've scanned in all of the celebs (obviously), and have been dropping in every day to see what's happening with Reggie, Shaq, Christina Aguilera, Miyamoto and... Zendaya? I caught Aonuma rolling around his apartment floor the other day. GOTY stuff, right there.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>While a chunk of my time has been spent playing a game for review (more on that next week), Animal Crossing has taken up most of my Switch 2 gaming. We've been snowed in basically all week here in central Ohio, so not much good trying to go out and have a social life.</p>
<p>But I've mainly been catching up on an RPG white whale, which I'm shocked isn't on Switch: <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/valkyrie_profile">Valkyrie Profile</a>. What a weird, cool game — triAce esoterica aside, I love the tone and combat here. It's perfect for handheld play. Thank goodness for the PlayStation Portal... I'm eyeing up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a>, but February is looking stacked. So we'll see. Keep warm, folks!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-duckov-collaboration-confirmed/</link>
            <guid>1421638</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has confirmed the first major collaboration between Escape from Tarkov and another game, and it’s been brewing for weeks. In a post on social media, the team unveiled the ‘Escape from Tarkov x Escape from Duckov’ crossover event, and while nobody knows what it entails, it was promised that it’s <strong>coming soon</strong>.</p>



<p>In the last few weeks, we’ve seen teasers posted by both Battlestate Games and Team Soda, the developer behind the satirical extraction shooter, Escape from Duckov. Now it’s time to make good on those teases.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-duckov-is-coming-to-tarkov">Escape from Duckov is Coming to Tarkov</h2>



<p>A new image posted on social media confirmed that the Escape from Duckov and Escape from <strong>Tarkov </strong>crossover is indeed happening. We don’t know <strong>when</strong>, but the team at Battlestate Games promised it would be <strong>soon</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s just over a year since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-preview-gamescom/">Escape from Duckov</a> was released, emerging as a jokey extraction game that amassed a very real and surprising audience. It plunges players into a hardcore extraction concept populated by birds, mostly ducks, and gives them all the tools of the trade that we’d usually associate with Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>That means customizable weapons, vendors, multiple maps, a hideout to build, and multiple quests.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>What started as something of a joke has become something much more tangible, and now Escape from Tarkov’s developers are open to making Duckov the sole target of the first-ever cross-game collaboration in the EFT space.</p>



<p>While we don’t know what the crossover will include, fans have been quick to speculate on social media. Some are predicting seeing ducks running rampant around Tarkov’s maps, while others have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-crossover-teased-promo-code/">used earlier teasers</a> to guess that Tarkov’s bosses will be reimagined in Duckov as… Well, <em>ducks</em>.</p>



<p>What’s more likely is that we’ll have some quests to complete in either game that will result in us unlocking limited-time achievements, items, and cosmetics. It’s easy to imagine us needing to find collectable ducks scattered around the world in Escape from Tarkov, turning them in for valuable rewards.</p>

<p>The port is already well underway</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="5cc6f40c0e93e"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5cc6f40c0e93e/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>We heard recently from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi how the follow up games to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-remakes-sequels-will-have-exactly-the-same-gameplay-as-other-consoles">Switch 2 would have "exactly the same" gameplay</a> as other platforms, so when exactly can we expect the next title?</p>
<p>Speaking to Polygon recently, Hamaguchi mentioned how a status update on the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> will hopefully be shared in the "very near future". So far, this version of the game has been built, and the team is now working hard to optimise and polish it. Here's the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Polygon:</strong> "Hamaguchi’s next challenge is bringing <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em> to Switch 2. Though <em>Remake</em> runs great on the console, <em>Rebirth</em> is a significantly larger game, complete with small but intricately detailed open-world zones. Hamaguchi says that the engineering team is handling that tall task well so far, to the point where the port is already far along in development."</p>
<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi:</strong> “At this point, we have gotten the game built. Our engineers are working hard to optimize and to provide the final polish on the build. I’m hoping that we’ll be able to provide more information on <em>Rebirth</em> in the very near future. Compared to the first title, the world map is a lot larger, so there is no doubt that it’s a more challenging production process. But our engineers are very passionate about the work that they’re doing, so I’m confident that we’ll be able to deliver.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rebirth was released on the PlayStation 5 in 2024. At the time, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">our colleagues at <strong>Push Square</strong></a> gave the title eight out of ten stars calling it a great sequel that retained all of the Remake's most important strengths while building on an already brilliant combat system, which excelled at showcasing the iconic RPG setting.</p>
<p>This update about the Switch 2 version of Rebirth follows the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade earlier this month on Nintendo's new hybrid system. A demo is also available on the Switch 2, if you want to test it out first.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Google’s Project Genie Experiment Causes Video Game Stocks to Suddenly Crash as Investors Believe Games Will Be Made Solely with AI]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/google-project-genie-causes-video-game-stocks-crash/</link>
            <guid>1421629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Google's latest AI-based experiment, <strong><a href="https://deepmind.google/models/genie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Genie</a></strong>, has made a massive impression on users and investors alike. Google calls it a 'general purpose model' <strong>capable of swiftly creating photorealistic three-dimensional environments</strong> that can then be explored in a game-like fashion.</p>



<p>Anyone can test it out simply by writing a prompt. Of course, interaction is extremely limited: you can only move around and jump in these environments. Still, it is very impressive, to the point that <strong>it caused the stocks of many video game companies to crash</strong> as investors suddenly believed games would soon be made entirely with AI.</p>



<p><strong>Unity Technologies</strong>, the maker of the <strong>Unity Engine</strong> (one of the most used third-party game-making tools alongside <strong>Epic's Unreal Engine</strong>), went down by 18,80% yesterday. Epic Games is a private company, so it wasn't affected for obvious reasons.</p>



<p>Game developers and publishers also took a big hit. <strong>Take-Two Interactive</strong>, the label behind Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Borderlands, and NBA 2K, lost nearly 10%. <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong>, the Polish developer behind The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077, fell by 8%. But <strong>Roblox Corporation</strong> had a sharper fall than both, losing over 13%.</p>



<p>Asian companies like <strong>CAPCOM</strong> or <strong>Tencent</strong> were barely affected, probably because the craze happened when their markets were already about to close on Friday. Still, this feels like a vast overreaction: Project Genie is just a glimpse into the future, rather than something anywhere near ready to replace properly made videogames.</p>



<p>Even so, Project Genie handles the rendering. Everything else would have to be added in by developers. That is, more or less, the vision <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-predicts-dlss-10-will-offer-full-neural-rendering-interfaced-with-game-engines-for-much-better-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a couple of years ago by NVIDIA's VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, <strong>Bryan Catanzaro</strong></a>. Back then, the man behind DLSS imagined that <strong>DLSS "10"</strong> could render a game's entire visuals using AI-powered neural rendering, interfacing with a game engine to make it feel like an actual game. We might be heading toward that future, but there's no need for developers to fret - we'll still need them, that's for sure.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Project Genie | Experimenting with infinite interactive worlds" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YxkGdX4WIBE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Then there's the other side of this kind of AI: how do you stop copyright infringement? People have already recreated virtual worlds inspired by <strong>SEGA's Sonic</strong> and <strong>Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda</strong> with Project Genie.</p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, this would never fly outside of an experiment. If such technology were ever to be properly released, <strong>Google would need to implement strong guardrails to prevent the AI from directly infringing on copyrighted materials</strong>. Still, users would likely be able to create similar worlds while straying just far enough that the guardrails do not trigger.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Miami Heretics Kick Off Lower Bracket Run Hopes at CDL Major I]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/miami-heretics-cdl-major-i-elimination-run/</link>
            <guid>1421626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League’s Major I tournament is unfolding in Dallas, Texas, and waves are already being made. In the opening days of the competition, some hard eliminations were made, including Toronto KOI, the Carolina Royal Ravens, Vancouver Surge, Boston Breach, and Cloud9 New York.</p>



<p>The narrow majority of those eliminations came at the hands of the Miami Heretics, which kicked both Toronto and Vancouver out of the running for the grand prize. Miami Heretics has had a mixed season thus far, but a lower-bracket run could be in store for the squad.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-miami-heretics-run-through-the-elimination-bracket">Can Miami Heretics Run Through The Elimination Bracket?</h2>



<p>Miami Heretics came into Major I with fairly lacklustre stats. The team has managed to stump up a 3-4 match win record this season, sitting in ninth place out of the twelve teams going to bat this year. At the time of writing, Heretics sit between Toronto KOI and Boston Breach, fairly far down the CDL standings.</p>



<p>However, some kind of resolve tightening must have happened going into the event, as Heretics managed to cling on against Toronto KOI and eliminate the team after an extremely close 3-2 series. It was neck and neck the entire way, and the final round of Search was only separated by two rounds.</p>



<p>The series against Vancouver Surge was more of a wash. Heretics managed to eliminate Surge, currently the last-placed team in the rankings, without the latter managing to secure a single map.</p>



<p>Heretics will arguably face a much tougher test in the next series, as it’s going to be against either Paris Gentle Mates or the LA Thieves. The first- and fifth-placed teams respectively, and both the subject of massive overhauls during the recent off-season.</p>



<p>If there’s one thing this season of the Call of Duty League has proven thus far, it’s that it might be one of the hardest years of COD esports to judge. Presently, the top four teams boast an identical match win record: Gentle Mates, FaZe Vegas, Riyadh Falcons, and the Carolina Royal Ravens. That’s followed closely behind by LAT and OpTic.</p>



<p>As the year unfolds, we’ll see more of a separation hopefully surface, but for now, it’s really (almost) anyone’s game.</p>

            <guid>1421623</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Just one day after the announcement of Genie, Google's generative AI-powered virtual world creator, a number of major video game companies are seeing their stock prices tumble, seemingly because some investors think you can just generate an entire video game with AI now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that's not what Genie is. Genie essentially lets you create a virtual "world" by offering prompts to describe the environment, a main character, and first or third-person view. Once it's created, you can control the described character and wander around the world you've made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's...kind of it? While you can walk around these virtual spaces with your keyboard, critically, there's nothing else you can really do. There are no game mechanics, there's no one to talk to, no goals, no scores or meaningful interactions. Additionally, each generation is limited to just 60 seconds. And while you could maybe argue that this is just the first step on a road to eventually getting AI to generate playable 3D video games, there's no real evidence yet that such a thing is possible, or that the games would be good or even coherent. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a>, for instance, tried to basically copy Breath of the Wild using Genie, and while they got something that essentially looks identical, that's just it. It's not playable, the "Link" looks kind of frightening actually, and Genie had to copy something that already existed to make this. It didn't come up with this on its own. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that hasn't really stopped a lot of investors from suddenly jumping off the video game train, a conclusion first posed by <a href="https://ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/unity-stock-falls-alongside-taketwo--roblox-after-googles-project-genie-launch-4429665" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investing.com</a> and shared by others, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mdnsmltgmk2f" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier</a>. Perhaps the most notable decline is Take-Two Interactive, which reached a six-month low this morning and, while it rallied somewhat by the closing bell, still ended down 8%. Engine maker Unity is in a similar spot, dropping 24% today also to a six-month low. Roblox stock also cratered today by 13% by close today, though notably Roblox has been on a downward trend since November. Still, it's a six-month low for Roblox, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every gaming company is seeing a massive nosedive. Ubisoft is technically down 7% today, but with its stock down to just $1/share, any small movement in either direction will seem significant. The company has been in pretty dire straits for months, even years now, and its announcement of more layoffs, closures, and cancelations earlier this month already had stock even further in a downward spiral. EA stock hasn't changed much today at all, but that's understandable, given EA announced last fall that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo">it was preparing to sell</a> to an investor group headed up by the Saudi Arabian government and will soon exit the public trading market. Meanwhile, Nintendo stock, down just under 5% today at the time this piece was written, has been all over the place all month, following a steady downward trend since November. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The pattern I'm seeing here between Take-Two, Roblox, and Unity is a sudden distrust not in games as an idea, but rather concerns about "platforms". Unity is a game engine. People use it to make games. If Genie can also make games, who needs Unity? In Roblox's case, Roblox is a pure user-generated content (UGC) factory - something that would likely become obsolete quickly if Genie took over. And for Take-Two, the publisher is about to release Grand Theft Auto VI later this year (we hope), which would very likely be accompanied at launch or not long after with some new version of GTA Online. While the current GTA Online doesn't rely on UGC, there have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-launches-official-user-generated-content-marketplace-for-mods">recent suspicions this new version might</a>. Again, the thinking here is seemingly that if people can just make their own little games in Genie, why would they bother doing it in Roblox or GTA or Minecraft or Fortnite or Unreal or anywhere else (Microsoft, for its part is too big to see any stock impact from Genie today and Epic Games is not publicly traded).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Is selling shares of major game publishers going to pay off for these investors? I'm not a stock expert, but if nothing else, it doesn't seem to be like a good idea to bet against GTA 6 right now (though Take-Two's earnings are next week, so we'll see I guess). And while Genie doesn't seem up to the task of making a whole video game out of nothing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">plenty</a> of other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/runescape-developer-jagex-insists-no-generative-ai-will-ever-be-present-in-any-asset-that-a-player-can-touch-hear-or-feel">studios</a> are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-create-hundreds-of-thousands-of-unique-ideas-needed-to-build-in-game-environments">coming out</a> on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-publisher-defends-generative-ai-use-insists-every-game-company-is-now-using-it">one side of the fence</a> or the other on using generative AI of any kind in their work. It seems that one way or another, the folks betting big money on generative AI will reap whatever harvest of that investment there is sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/some-magic-the-gathering-players-attending-lorwyn-eclipsed-pre-release-events-got-an-unwanted-surprise-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles</link>
            <guid>1421617</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Two weeks ago, I happily attended my first-ever pre-release event for a new Magic: the Gathering set. This was for Lorwyn Eclipsed, which veteran players inform me is a long-awaited return to the fantasy stylings of Magic's Lorwyn plane after nearly 20 years. As you can imagine, there were a lot of long-time Magic fans who were <em>very</em> excited about this release, but in the minutes before my pre-release event began, I kept overhearing a tone of anxiety in the conversations around me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cause of the anxiety? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've never been to a pre-release event, what happens is this: you're given a nice little box that contains several booster packs, which you will use to build a deck for the event and play some matches with other attendees. The boxes also tend to contain other goodies, which in the case of Lorwyn Eclipsed involved a deck box, a die, and a single foil card from the set. The foil you get is random, but it's <em>supposed</em> to come from the set you're there to play. And when I opened my box, that's what I encountered. A nice little foil of Shadow Urchin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the reason for the anxiety at the event was because word had gotten around that some people were <em>not</em> receiving Lorwyn cards as their foil promo card. Instead, a number of social media posts had been circulating showing players with six Lorwyn Eclipsed booster packs and one foil card from the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, this is quite the mix-up! Not only is TMNT, uh, <em>very</em> different from Lorwyn, but the TMNT set isn't even supposed to be out yet. It's coming on March 6, just under two months from the date this was happening. So not only was this causing an issue for Lorwyn fans, but TMNT fans excited for the upcoming set were now getting previously unrevealed cards shown off via random social media posts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This situation also complicated the event itself: normally, a TMNT card would not be legal in a Lorwyn Eclipsed pre-release deck. Fortunately, Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3mclkkr2dka2k" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a statement</a> pretty quickly about the situation, saying that stores should replace the TMNT promo cards where possible with Lorwyn cards. Where not possible, players would be allowed to play with the TMNT cards. That... sort of helps, but the fact is that Lorwyn Eclipsed cards are part of a set that's meant to be played together, with cards and mechanics that coordinate with one another to create a balanced game. A single TMNT card is more likely than not going to struggle to fit into decks like that. What's more, shops would have to break into unsold pre-release boxes to take out the replacement foil cards, which essentially just eats through inventory for no reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, you could argue, it's just one card! Who cares! And that's fair. But another sentiment I heard both online and at the event I attended was that the turtle invasion felt like a slap in the face to veteran Magic players. Not only has the wait to return to Lorwyn been long, but some long-time players have grown frustrated at how many collaborations with outside IP (dubbed "Universes Beyond") Magic has been doing lately. Wizards has been doing these crossovers since 2020, though at the time Universes Beyond cards weren't planned to be made legal in the Standard format and many of the ones that followed were just reskins, making them fairly easy to put up with if you didn't want to see Transformers or Doctor Who in your Magic game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But starting last year with Final Fantasy, that changed. The wildly popular Final Fantasy set was dubbed Standard-legal, and this year, Magic is getting more Universes Beyond sets than ever before: TMNT in March, Marvel in June, The Hobbit in August, and Star Trek in November. That's four standard sets - more than Wizards is releasing of non-Universes Beyond sets, of which we are only getting three: Lorwyn Eclipsed, Secrets of Strixhaven, and Reality Fracture. This is a lot to keep up with both mentally and financially, and while you could argue there's no pressure to "keep up," there is if you play the game's Standard format, which always revolves around the most recently-released sets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also worth noting that groups of fans aren't the only ones who are annoyed here. Recently, shareholders of Wizards' parent company, Hasbro, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lawsuit-claims-hasbro-misled-investors-regarding-sales-of-controversial-magic-the-gathering-anniversary-set">filed a lawsuit against it</a>, alleging that it was overprinting sets of cards, thereby devaluing ones that already existed. In the suit, shareholders also claimed Hasbro had previously done some fairly manipulative things with Magic card sales to cover up shortfalls elsewhere in the company. Regardless of whether or not anything comes of the lawsuit, there are some pretty hefty accusations in the complaint that would understandably sow further distrust among those who already felt Magic was overplaying its hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, back to the pre-release event, you can imagine perhaps being a long-time Magic fan, excited for the return of Lorwyn, ready to play some games involving elves and fairies and merfolk, maybe rubbed the wrong way a bit by the sheer volume of Universes Beyond but trying not to let it bother them, only to open their pre-release pack and find "Michelangelo, Weirdness to 11" in shiny foil. Doesn't feel great. Heck, I've only been playing a year, and I breathed a sigh of relief when my pre-release pack (and, in fact, my entire card shop) was decidedly turtle-free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To their credit, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/on-turtles-faeries-and-the-lorwyn-eclipsed-prerelease" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wizards has acknowledged fan frustrations and is trying to make good</a>. In a lengthy blog post written by communications director Blake Rasmussen, he apologized for the "shell shock" of seeing a turtle in a Lorwyn box. "We wouldn't blame you if you found it cool, but maybe a bit rude, that Lorwyn Eclipsed had to share the spotlight with an upcoming set," the post reads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Wizards went ahead and updated its image gallery to include official art of all rares and mythic rares from the main set. "They're already out there if you know where to look, and we'd rather you have them all in one official place," the post reads. "It's ready for you now if you want to take a look."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rasmussen also announced plans for some sort of make-good event for the stores that had to deal with turtles at the event, though they weren't clear as to what that would look like just yet. Here's what he said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Then, to keep the Lorwyn Eclipsed party going, we're going to do—something. We're playing catch up a bit and we wanted to get this article out sooner rather than later, but we're assessing how widespread the issue was and working on some kind of cool, back-end, Lorwyn Eclipsed-related thing we can do for affected stores because we're really proud of this set and we want to make sure it gets its time in the sun. We're going to figure said thing out and get back to you all."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The response to this from the community has been mixed. A lot of people weren't mad about the turtles to begin with. Universes Beyond, some argue, is a great way to get new players into the hobby who might not have otherwise noticed Magic before. Some others who were annoyed with the turtles appear to have been pacified by Wizards' statement and response. Others still aren't happy, believing this is a symptom of a larger problem at Wizards (too much emphasis on Universes Beyond) and an overall lack of care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We won't really know where the community writ large's heart lies on the broader issues until later this year, when the Magic card deluge has fully arrived and we have a better idea of whether or not people are actually buying all these dang sets. As for Lorwyn Eclipsed, hopefully whatever Wizards is plotting to help assuage the affected stores is appropriately celebratory of Lorwyn, which frankly is a pretty cool setting. I ended up having a grand time at my pre-release event, and will probably attend future ones as a result, provided there are no horror stories of Borg showing up in Strixhaven. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/aniimo-preview-all-the-fun-of-creature-catching-with-all-the-transactions-of-gacha</link>
            <guid>1421608</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">When you say the words “creature collector,” you already have my attention. I’ve been both curious and wary in equal measures since Aniimo was first announced. I’m far from the only person hungering for a worthy competitor in the creature-collection, monster-taming space, and I’ve dabbled in quite a few. Aniimo looks particularly vibrant, vast, and cutesy to boot. It’s the addition of gacha elements that has had me a little on the fence. If you’ve ever sunk hours into a gacha, you understand the trepidation. Will this be the sort of gacha experience that has me gleefully forking over my credit card info, or resenting every microtransaction?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After about four hours with Aniimo, I’d say I’m still cautiously optimistic. It has all the ingredients of my favorite games: open-world exploration set in a fantastical alien world, lots of critters to collect, challenges to complete, and… farming? Okay, there might be a few too many ingredients added to this pot, but I’m willing to let Aniimo cook.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Big Butts, Tiny Waist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We leap straight into creating our Aniimo character. I can easily sink hours into a good character creator, so I was pumped to give Aniimo’s a try. From the get-go, the character creator feels super in-depth. I was given six default presets for both a “male” and “female” avatar (not great for all my non-binary pals). You can combine up to three different face presets to get something a little different, or you could just dive head first into the face customization options.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Aniimo Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aniimo’s character creation allows you to adjust the position, prominence, and size of pretty much every facial feature, from your nasal wings to your eyelids. However, it didn’t take me long before I noticed one glaring oversight: skin tone. After searching for a bit, I finally found the options for skin tone buried under all the other menus for “makeup”. Don’t let the three default options take you aback - like it did me - Aniimo won a bunch of points in my book by including a color wheel for unlimited skin tone options.</p><p>Aniimo won a bunch of points in my book by including a color wheel for unlimited skin tone options.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the character customization lost me again in two areas: one, hair options are <em>extremely </em>limited. I can only assume - based on the “fashion” vouchers I saw redeemable later on in my playthrough - that you unlock more hairstyles through in-game currency or progression. Having appearance and cosmetics locked behind gacha mechanics might be expected. The fact that there is only one natural curly hair option - if you can even call it that - available from the start, however, is frankly disheartening.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And second, I was similarly disappointed in the body customization. While I had so much control over fine-tuning the shape of my face, the sliders for body proportions were lacking to say the least. I never expect much in terms of body diversity when it comes to this genre of game, but having to choose between being eerily thin or skinny with a nice butt and boobs was disconcerting.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Which Aniimo Are You?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">With character customization out of the way, I got my first look at my in-game self - and the adorable Aniimo! - in a cutscene reminiscent of a Twitch “IRL” livestream. The livestream overlay, complete with “real-time” chat bubbles from fictional viewers, threw me off a little bit, but luckily, we didn’t linger in the social media influencer realm for long. I found myself in the alien world of “Idyll”, an aptly named "idyllic" planet teeming with lush greenery and charming wildlife with unique powers, called Aniimo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Our first Aniimo crosses our path - an adorable little fire-type Emberpup - smoothly introducing catch mechanics I’m already plenty familiar with. With an Emberpup at my side, my friend Nico laid down the basics of commanding Aniimo to use their abilities to remove obstacles or solve puzzles in the world. After catching a few more Aniimo and commanding my new pals to charge into deadly combat, the story began in earnest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BINI, our little robo companion, is abruptly hijacked by a mysterious glowing D20 die, which pulls me and Nico into some sort of pocket dimension. In these strange ruins, I encountered murals on the wall depicting Aniimo I’ve yet to encounter. Each mural poses a cryptic question, ala a Buzzfeed personality quiz. The reason for this soul-searching became clear once I reached the glowing mural at the end of the path. The depictions of a yellow lion and blue fox in this mural materialized into two tiny Aniimo who can… talk? I was recommended to choose between Helion or Lunara, based on how I answered the murals’ questions earlier.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I really liked being offered a “sorting quiz” to guide me towards which “starter” Aniimo I should choose. After all, the “starter” you choose clearly says so much about you. Only having two options to choose from was a little unsatisfying, though it appears to tie into some sort of “sun and moon” mythology which could be central to Aniimo’s story. I went for Helion, personally, not only because he was recommended, but because of his sassy little personality. With Helion by my side, I was thrown into combat with my first big foe: a giant armored dragon Aniimo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The combat was fun enough for my tastes, if a little button-mashy. I can imagine that timing your dodges and managing your cooldowns might take some deeper consideration as you progress. What really impressed me was the Twining mechanic. Yup, in Aniimo, you actually get to <em>be</em> the creatures. Playing as Helion - rather than just sitting back as a trainer - made for some engaging, brawly combat.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Getting Schooled</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as quickly as I was transformed into Helion and defeated the dragon-type Aniimo, I was thrust into a whole new region. I found myself transported to the Polaris Institute, a futuristic academy devoted to studying Aniimo, located on my home planet of Astra. At this stage of the tutorial, things became a little bogged down in dialogue and instructional demos. To continue my adventure, I needed to become an official student at the Polaris Institute, instead of just a particularly precocious livestreamer, or whatever I was doing before.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To qualify to be a student, I was strong-armed into a combat simulation, which broke down the bare bones of accumulating “EP” and how to choose Aniimo that are elemental counters. Next up, I received my first free outfit - a school uniform - and sat through a quick Character menu breakdown. When I was finally teleported back down to Idyll with this hot anime guy and his hot wolf Aniimo - don’t judge me, you <em>know</em> that’s exactly what they were going for here - I hunkered down for another round of tutorials. After using the Report Terminal and building my Aniimo loadout, I finally had my first taste of exploration.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Creatures</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is where I could start to see myself becoming hooked on Aniimo. There’s something so intrinsically appealing about running around a beautiful countryside and stopping to look at every shiny thing on the ground. There are fast travel spots to discover, new areas of the map to unveil, treasure chests to find, and most importantly, Aniimo to catch!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It quickly became clear that catching Aniimo has a bigger role to play than simply filling out your Aniilog or battling other Aniimo. Depending on their elemental type or other abilities, I relied on my Aniimo to help me solve environmental puzzles, like excavating buried treasure chests or floating on geysers of air. Getting to transform or “twine” with my Aniimo had me squealing with joy. Who doesn’t want to be a tiny little rock crab, walking through a field of flowers?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I quickly discovered how foundational the first Aniimo I caught were, as I swam across streams as Skippy, burned thorny obstacles with Emberpup, or glided around as Celestis. This gave me plenty of motivation to constantly be swapping around my “team” of Aniimo for a reason other than battle prowess. As I discovered later, even keeping starter evolutions - or “Lumin” stage - Aniimo is integral to completing some of the challenges and puzzles scattered around Idyll.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent a lot of time wandering around the map, catching new Aniimo, and collecting Lumin Amber to upgrade the Branch, a giant dandelion which improves the capture chance in that region, and completing miscellaneous milestone tasks, called “Elite Training”. These tasks felt a bit like chores: open “x” amount of chests, hatch “y” eggs, and so on, but completing them did fast track my level quickly while giving me a solid understanding of the core mechanics of Aniimo.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/cubbo4-1769793781632.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">All of the Aniimo I caught while exploring were super cute, if a little… bland. I love some whimsy in my creature-collectors, a healthy mixture of adorable critters with some cursed-looking monstrosities. What’s neat about Aniimo, however, is that there seems to be a bunch of variations in each type. Most Aniimo have branching options for their second or final “stage” of evolution, and on top of the rare “Prismana” Aniimo which can be caught, I found a few fun “alternative” versions with different appearances based around the region I found them in.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">#VanLife Influencer Era</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A few hours into my playtime with Aniimo, I stumbled upon another of its key features: the RV. After discovering this NPC in the middle of a field, I abruptly found myself the proud owner of my own interdimensional RV. After a quick customization, I was prompted to teleport to the nearest “RV Park”. This vibrant campsite seems to be some sort of meeting place where you can get together with other Aniimo players and show off your own little outdoor deck.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/malangel-1769793842657.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As an aside, it wasn’t until I found the RV Park that I discovered that while - no, you cannot pet your Aniimo (boo) - you <em>can</em> pick up the Aniimo. Huh. That revelation made, I stepped through the interdimensional door in the back of my new RV and entered the “Homeland Space.” I assumed that this would be some sort of home-building mechanic, perhaps allowing me to decorate my own little space or interact with my Aniimo. Instead, I found myself on a small patch of barren farmland.</p><p>While no, you cannot pet your Aniimo (boo), you can pick up the Aniimo. <span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Homeland tutorial had me clearing up the farm’s clutter and sowing my first seeds. Once grown, I was able to harvest my crops to sell. As reward, I received “Home Coins,” a currency I can only assume is unique to the Homeland section of Aniimo. With only this brief experience to go off of, I’m guessing that the Homeland farming is meant to be a sort of supplemental gameplay element which will let me idly generate currency every day. In exchange for my Home Coins, it appears that I can trade for other important in-game items, such as Eggs, or purchase “RV Welcome Packages”, which I’m hoping offer plenty of RV furniture and customization.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/susuta2-1769793861500.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, the RV and Homeland feel a little discordant with the rest of my Aniimo experience. I love a good farming sim, but I cannot see myself motivated to spend time planting and selling crops every day if my only reward is just a slow grind to purchasing rare materials. Completing order requests just for extra Home Coins and coupons for RV furniture feels like it would quickly become a slog.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, I was pleasantly surprised during my time playing Aniimo. This is exactly the type of game I can see myself sinking hours into exploration and creature-collecting. The Aniimo were super adorable, and getting to play <em>as</em> the creatures you’re collecting is novel enough in itself to keep me interested. In some other areas, including the main story, Aniimo does feel admittedly empty or bland. I don’t imagine I’ll be filling out my entire Aniilog or progressing far enough to reach late-game mechanics. I’m still hyped to download Aniimo on my PC - maybe even on my mobile or Xbox Series X|S - when it releases, so I can run around as a little Nimbi once again.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/aniimo-preview-all-the-fun-of-creature-catching-with-all-the-transactions-of-gacha]]></content:encoded>

But Morrowind — considered by many to be the greatest The Elder Scrolls game ever released — does not seem to be part of the remaster conversation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why? In an interview with <a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Press Box PR</a>, Bruce Nesmith, who left Bethesda in 2021 midway through the development of Starfield having worked at the company for over 17 years, highlighted a number of reasons why Morrowind probably won’t be top of Todd Howard’s remaster list.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The problem with doing Morrowind is that I bet they don’t have the original code,” Nesmith said. “The game is so old. I don’t know if the original source code exists anymore. If it does, can you even compile it? When you’re looking at Oblivion, they still had the code. They could still compile it. Putting the code into the new version of the engine was a possibility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The other thing I would say is go back and play Morrowind and tell me that’s the game you want to play again. We all have these fond memories of things that were pivotal moments in our gaming fantasy histories that we absolutely move but you go back and play a 20 year old game and you will cringe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“People even had cringe moments with the Oblivion remake but they forgave it because they’re reliving something, they’re enjoying the nostalgia. I worked on Oblivion. I’m even responsible for some of those cringe moments! The further back you go, the more that’s going to be an issue.

              <p>Early today,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/epstein-drop-live-00757275">the Department of Justice released more than three million pages</a> of files connected to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. And as people have started digging into all the new emails and documents, we are learning a lot more about Epstein and his elite inner circle. Oh, and apparently, he would sometimes send people links to porn featuring characters from <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em>.</p> <p>On May 4, 2017, Epstein sent a message to Karyna Shuliak, his last known girlfriend, that simply contained a link to an animated gif uploaded to 4chan that featured multiple characters from <em>FNAF</em> engaging in sexual activities. The animation was apparently made in Source Filmmaker and was shared on 4chan in April 2017. Epstein simply commented “amazing animations” in the subject line of the email.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02328259.pdf">This 2017 email</a>, as well as others from the Epstein files purporting to show him sending <em>FNAF</em> porn he found online to Shuliak, spread across social media <a href="https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/2017398693834420299?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">as part of a collage image</a>. Many assumed it was a joke. But <em>Kotaku</em> and others online have been able to verify that the 2017 email did include <a href="https://archived.moe/gif/thread/10501788">a link to this NSFW 4chan gif post</a>.</p> <p>Discovering that Epstein looked at and shared porn based on the horror game <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em> is <em>far</em> from the worst piece of information to come out of the Epstein emails. But it is a strange piece of information I didn’t know before, and now I do. I can’t stop thinking about him writing “amazing animations” in the subject line as he emailed the link to his girlfriend. We live in a weird, horrible timeline, huh?</p> <p>In other Epstein video game news (because yes, there is more), <a href="https://kotaku.com/emails-reveal-jeffrey-epstein-was-banned-from-xbox-live-2000664660">he was banned from Xbox Live in 2013</a> after Microsoft figured out he was a registered sex offender.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-season-dates-seemingly-leaked/</link>
            <guid>1421572</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a>, 2K Sports is leaving the traditional DLC packs in the past in favor of a new Ringside Pass. </p>



<p>This new pass is WWE 2K26’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-is-going-to-have-a-ringside-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">version of the Battle Pass system</a> that has made its way to all sorts of games over the years. The Ringside Pass will offer players 60 free tiers and 40 premium tiers to unlock. With the Ringside pass, players who reach tier 40 each season will be able to unlock new wrestlers, customization options, exclusive content, and more. </p>







<p><strong>“The Ringside Pass Premium replaces the previous DLC model, rewarding players with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-new playable characters</a> unavailable on the base game roster, including current Superstars, Legends, Personas, and some unexpected names,”</strong> 2K Sports said. </p>



<p>2K Sports is going to roll out the Ringside Pass in seasons throughout the game’s year on the market. The first season is scheduled for launch day with five others planned in the following months. And, now, thanks to the Nintendo eshop, those five other season dates have seemingly been leaked.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-season-release">WWE 2K26 Ringside Pass Season Release</h2>



<p>As mentioned, the first season will come on launch day–for King of Kings, Attitude Era, and Monday Night War Edition owners—on March 6. </p>



<p>Season 2 is scheduled for May 4; Season 3, June 29; Season 4, August 24; Season 5, October 19; and Season 6, December 14. </p>







<p>While we have the dates, specific details of what’s included in each season has yet to be announced. Those will come as each season approaches. </p>



<p>WWE 2K26 promises the largest roster in the history of the franchise with over 400 playable characters. With the Ringside Pass, 2K says players will have more options than ever before in a WWE game.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 launches globally for all players on March 13 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Early today, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/epstein-drop-live-00757275">the Department of Justice released more than three million pages</a> connected to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. And as people have started digging into all the new emails and documents, we are learning a lot more about Epstein, his elite inner circle, and also that apparently he was banned from Xbox Live over a decade ago.</p> <p>On Friday, <a href="https://archive.is/o/VHGL6/https://xboxera.com/2026/01/30/jeffrey-epstein-was-banned-on-xbox-live/"><em>Xbox Era</em> spotted an email from December 2013</a> sent from Microsoft and Xbox Live to an email address used by Epstein in many of his illicit communications. The email was letting the then-alive mogul and convicted rapist know that his Xbox account had been banned permanently due to “harassment, threats, and/or abuse of other players.” That might make you think that Epstein was using his Xbox Live account to do some heinous shit, but a follow-up email from Xbox a few hours later explains exactly why he was banned.</p> <p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01944468.pdf">Epstein was banned because he was a registered sex offender</a>, and Xbox works with law enforcement to keep these kinds of people off its gaming network. While Epstein had been a registered sex offender for years at this point, another email spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/871425/jeffrey-epstein-xbox-live-ban-microsoft-sex-offender"><em>The Verge</em></a> seems to indicate he didn’t create an Xbox account until <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00668878.pdf">October 2012</a>. Microsoft joined a New York-led legal initiative to remove registered sex offenders from online platforms in April 2012. So it took some time before Xbox caught Epstein and kicked him from the service.</p> <p>It’s unclear if Epstein actually used his Xbox Live account to play games. Other emails revealed in today’s massive dump include him asking about an<a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02101088.pdf"> Xbox 360 Kinect in 2014</a>. Another message from 2019 has him asking: “<a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02265766.pdf">Why is there a $25.24 charge on Xbox?</a>“</p>

<figure data-uuid="9eeb5d4fa06d0"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9eeb5d4fa06d0/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following an official response from Nintendo yesterday about the censorship in the Switch versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, the developer AdHoc Studio has now shared a lengthy statement.</p>
<p>In this update, which follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/psa-dispatchs-visual-censorship-settings-cant-be-removed-on-switch">a comment it made to Nintendo Life earlier this week</a>, the studio says the superhero workplace comedy game didn't meet Nintendo's content guidelines.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the good news is that the team is already supposedly working with Nintendo on a path forward to "address at least some of the censored content". It can't make any specific promises, but fans can apparently expect an update in the future.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jopntg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1qremvk/adhocs_statement_on_switch_censorship/">full statement from AdHoc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been quiet for the last few days not because we don’t want to address this stuff, but because we’ve been trying to make sure we’re being good partners with Nintendo. They’ve made their own statement regarding this issue:</p>
<p>“<em>Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations.</em>”</p>
<p>As Nintendo states, any game that’s going to be on the Nintendo platform needs to ‘meet [Nintendo’s] established content and platform guidelines.’ This is the key point. Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn’t meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform. That’s what happened here. Honestly we thought this would be obvious since we’re the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms.</p>
<p>We initially assumed, like some of you, that because games like Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk are on the platform with similar types of uncensored mature content, Dispatch would be allowed to do the same. During the porting process it became clear that was not the case. So we asked that we include a disclaimer on the store page to inform customers that content would be different than on other platforms. We worked with Nintendo to get storefront language approved.</p>
<p>Where we absolutely need to take full ownership is the placement of that disclaimer. Again, it was our intent to go out of our way to tell people looking to buy the game that the content was censored. While we didn’t have complete control of the language, we did have control of the placement. Wires got crossed and we put the disclaimer in the field literally titled “Disclaimer”, instead of the “About The Game” section. We didn’t catch this until after the launch when we saw people saying we should have called out the changes on the store page, and we went to go make sure it was there. It technically has been the entire time, just in the absolute worst spot that makes it look like we were trying to hide it.</p>
<p>This is 100% our mistake and it was fixed in the Americas store pages a few hours after launch to give more visibility. We’ve also added a disclaimer before purchase. As of writing this, the other regions have either published this change or are in the process of review.</p>
<p>So what now?</p>
<p>We’re already working with Nintendo on a path forward. While we can’t make any specific promises just yet, we’re confident we’ll be able to push an update to address at least some of the censored content. I’ll get ahead of it now and say that between dev time and the console submission process, we’re talking weeks not days.</p>
<p>To our fans who were looking forward to playing the uncensored version on Switch, we’re truly sorry. People have a right to be pissed. Lots of lessons learned here. Thanks for sticking with us. More soon.</p>

Season 30 begins on August 4.</p>



<p>The development team stressed that all progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to players’ individual EA accounts, and everything will carry over to Nintendo Switch 2, regardless of when you purchase the console. It also stressed that the game will continue to be supported on all other platforms and that the reason for the switch, no pun intended, is to deliver the best possible experience and utilize the power of the Switch 2.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394">Highguard </a>has added a new gameplay mode, now available to play.</p>



<p>Highguard has added a 5v5 Raid Mode. The mode is now live, but it will be available for a limited time. The mode is experimental and is only playable this weekend. It’s a separate playlist and will not replace the 3v3 raids.</p>



<p>Lobbies have been updated to allow for parties of 5 for the weekend. Additionally, in this mode, Raids are now 10 lives instead of 6, and respawns are slightly longer to allow for generators to be planted or diffused.</p>



<p>A new base has also been added to Highguard. In addition to the new game mode, they have also added a new base, Soul Well. Described as a dark relic from a lost age, the new base has been added to the rotation in all game modes.</p>







<h2 id="h-quality-of-life-improvements-are-also-coming-to-highguard-in-this-patch">Quality-Of-Life Improvements Are Also Coming to Highguard in This Patch</h2>



<p>Additionally, there are several updates for optimization and quality of life. Several optimizations improve animation performance, projectile behavior, and other gameplay systems. These updates benefit both console and PC and will also include features such as a motion blur toggle.</p>



<p>The developers note that players in 3v3 playlists should see some improvements, but they ask for some leeway during testing of the new game mode. Also, Firing Range does not currently support 5v5.</p>

Take-Two’s stock price closed at $220.30 (down 7.93 percent from yesterday), Roblox’s closed at $65.76 (down 13.17 percent), and Unity’s closed at $29.10 (down 24.22 percent).</p><p>Other AI tools have received significant pushback from artists and creators over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/864951/human-artistry-campaign-ai-licensing-artists">allegations of theft</a> of their work to train the underlying AI models, AI’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/845831/ai-chips-data-center-power-water">water and electricity usage</a>, and what this means for creative output. Google DeepMind’s Diego Rivas told <em>The Verge</em> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/718723/google-ai-genie-3-model-video-game-worlds-real-time">Genie 3</a>, the AI world model powering Project Genie, was “trained primarily on publicly available data from the web,” and <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.15391v1">a white paper</a> from Google DeepMind researchers about the first Genie model said that it was trained from “a large dataset of over 200,000 hours of publicly available Internet gaming videos.”</p><p>Many game developers are already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/869386/ai-game-development-gdc-survey">very skeptical of generative AI</a> and its hand in seemingly ripping off existing works to let people create AI slop. The <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>-like worlds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on">I was able to create</a> from prompts with Project Genie somewhat resembled Nintendo’s actual games, but the experiences didn’t have any of the fun or playability of the originals.

They have no scores, objectives, or even sound. They can have strange errors and inconsistencies, like a racetrack road unexpectedly turning into grass. When you’re done with an experience, you can only download a video of it or generate a new one; you can’t take what you’ve made in Project Genie and slot it into a traditional game development tool like Unreal Engine or Unity.</p><p>But the push by investors and executives for AI game creation tools is already being spelled out. xAI CEO Elon Musk has <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2016876797682467277/">promised</a> “Real-time, high-quality shows and video games at scale, customized to the individual, next year.” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2017327913113190789">said Friday that</a> “We’ll see constant leapfrogging between engine centric AI and world model centric AI until they come together for maximum effect.” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg went long on the company’s earnings call this week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869882/mark-zuckerberg-meta-earnings-q4-2025">about how</a> AI will help games feel “more immersive and interactive,” making his comments just a couple of weeks after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/861420/meta-reality-labs-layoffs-vr-studios-twisted-pixel-sanzaru-armature">shutting down VR game studios and projects</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/871348/google-project-genie-take-two-roblox-unity]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1421503</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/sony-interactive-entertainment/" id="3274">Sony </a>has patented a new controller type that could revolutionize how gamers think about what a controller can be.</p>



<p><a href="https://sudoku-online.pro/pdfs/buttonless-sony-ps6-controller.pdf">According to a new patent</a> dated January 27, 2026, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sony-interactive-entertainment/" id="52192">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> is presenting a very forward-thinking adaptive controller. In the pack, they describe the drawbacks to modern video game controllers, including difficulties with fixed layouts. For example, they present a hypothetical scenario in which controllers are too large or too small for some users, and highlight the need for game controllers that support different configurations. They also discuss the desire for improvements in the placement of joysticks or D-pads</p>



<p>The drawing shows the layout of a typical controller without fixed buttons, but with a digital screen that allows customization. It also shows different button and D-pad placements, and notes that a button press can be recognized by different movements, such as a tap or swipe.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Sony has registered a patent for an unusual gamepad without physical buttons.</p><p>It features a fully touch-sensitive surface that supports gestures such as taps and swipes, and it will be able to adapt to finger positions, dynamically changing the control zones. <a href="https://t.co/XnQLO18WfZ">pic.twitter.com/XnQLO18WfZ</a></p></div>— Gaming.Bo3.gg (@Gaming_bo3gg) <a href="https://twitter.com/Gaming_bo3gg/status/2017206220491239924?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-sony-has-redefined-controllers-in-the-past">Sony Has Redefined Controllers in the Past</h2>



<p>Sony has always been innovative with their controllers. The current standard of twin analog sticks began with the DualShock controller, which, in and of itself, was an advanced take on the original PlayStation controller. Later, they would innovate with Sixaxis motion-sensing technology in their PlayStation 3 controller. The PS4 added a touchpad, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PS5 </a>added haptic feedback and dynamic triggers.</p>



<p>While there’s no way to know whether this controller patent will be realized, it shows that Sony is considering ways to be inclusive and allow players to choose their own configurations and play their way. </p>







<p>Also, one could argue that, with the rise of mobile gaming, a younger generation is already accustomed to virtual gamepads. At the same time, it’s a leap into the future that may be difficult for some.</p>

            <guid>1421491</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><em>Gladlands </em>is the latest <em>Dimension 20</em> adventure to hit Dropout. Functioning as a spin on a post-apocalyptic adventure where everyone is nice and trying to help out one another instead of fighting over resources, think of it as the most wholesome <em>Mad Max</em> spinoff you've ever seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Going on this adventure are <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/ify-nwadiwe-and-jacob-wysocki-chat-never-stop-blowing-up-being-new-at-table-and" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b02fe4e6-1370-402b-a680-949a73bfa736" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Jacob Wysocki</a>, Oscar Montoya, Vic Michaelis, and Kimia Behpoornia, among others. Midway through the season, TechRaptor was able to sit down and hear from these performers about what piqued their interest in the project, how they created their unique characters, and what role they think they'd have in the post-apocalypse.</p><p dir="ltr">Starting at the beginning, I asked each how they were approached for the project and what made them say yes. Montoya started "The pitch was essentially, this is a post-apocalyptic world, but instead of devolving into chaos, it's what happens if a caravan of people decide to spread positivity and joy."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Joining The <em>Gladlands </em>Caravan</h2><p dir="ltr">At first, Montoya was in, but when it was revealed who else would be joining the cast, it became a much more enticing offer.</p><p dir="ltr">"Oh, you mean all of my favorite people in the whole wide world? Well, of course I'm in."</p><p dir="ltr">For Wysocki, he explained that <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan </a>"hit him with the math," and while he understood the idea, it wasn't fully clicking. "These are two entities that I recognize," those entities being: <em>Mad Max</em> and 'being nice,' "and I know there's a place where they meet, but it didn't immediately click. It required me probably asking fifteen minutes of questions, but Brennan had it all locked and loaded because he's fucking Brennan, and I see the needle we're trying to thread."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">This idea of excitement to play in a game with all of your friends was a sentiment shared by Michaelis and Behpoornia. They shared their story in tandem, first with Michaelis rejecting the idea before learning who would be on it.</p><p dir="ltr">"David Kerns hopped on a call and said 'literally all of your best friends are going to be here, and it's <em>Gladlands</em>, it's going to be post-apocalyptic like Mad Max but things are better.'" From there, Michaelis texted Behpoornia to confirm.</p><p dir="ltr">"I got an email and I was like 'hmm, I want to do it but maybe I should wait it out' and then I got a text from Vic being like 'hey, are you doing this D20, I got all the information, here's everyone who's gonna be there, here's what's going to happen…' and I was like Oh great, somebody got all the info, somebody I really trust and then it was just all my friends there at the table."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"There was all my friends there, that's kind of all I needed… they should have led with that" - Behpoornia on accepting a role in <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Talking further about having so many friends at the table, Michaelis added, "So much of improv is about the chemistry that you have with people. It's something that we deal with all the time in Very Important People, when you already have that base shared language it's way easier to jump into something, and you get to places that you never would have known before."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Choosing A Post-Apocalyptic Character</h2><p dir="ltr">In this future setting, each performer has created a truly one-of-a-kind character. Wysocki roleplays as KoKoMo, a nine-foot-tall hairy 'snorlaxian, totoroian' character. Montoya is a drag queen, Poppy Persona, Michaelis is a pale corvid-cosplaying mortician, Hugi, and Behpoornia is a normal human man with a 20-pack abs and a cockroach head.</p><p dir="ltr">For inspiration on KoKoMo Wysocki, "his head first went to the 'glad' side of things. I thought about childcare and how these communities, other than western society, raise children and pod them together and there's more of a community effort to look after people than a nuclear family. Then I went to the <em>Mad Max</em> side of things and thought 'what would mutate into that?' and I started to think of a big round couch boy."&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"Then I think I rewatched <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> just for vibes, and I was like yeah, this is that" - Wysocki on creating Kokomo</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Poppy Persona takes inspiration from Aunt Entity, Tina Turner's character in <em>Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome,</em> mixed with Montoya's real-life experience as the Drag Queen Ozma. "When Brennan gave the premise, my immediate reaction was 'Oh! Tina Turner in Beyond Thunderdome' and to me I've always seen Aunt Entity as a Drag Queen because she has to be this larger than life personality to run the Thunderdome."</p><p dir="ltr">"I was like, 'What would my character's Thunderdome be?' and it would be like Drag Queen Story Hour. So that's where the character of Poppy Persona was created."</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-poppy.jpg?itok=AgchLUFb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-poppy.jpg?itok=2DChsHcy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I did ask if there were any other Drag Queen influences that he was drawing on, but Montoya explained, "No, I tried to stay away from any existing Drag Artist. They're all incredible artists."</p><p dir="ltr">Behpoornia's approach was to start with one idea and then iterate upon it. "When I heard it was post-apocalyptic, I thought cockroaches survive that long, it usually helps me in brainstorming when I trust my first idea and then go deeper into that."</p><p dir="ltr">"So then I went, 'how do I make this matter?', if it has survived this long, it's probably a lonely guy, and if it's part of a caravan going around to communities being used for the ability that it can't die, then how does that feel? Does he feel used in that way? It's also such a big idea, I wanted to make any lesson he learned kinda bite sized, so I made him a dumb guy, so everything he experiences, he can sum up the way a kid might."</p><p dir="ltr">For Hugi, Michaelis's inspiration was in the pages of the book <em>From Here To Eternity</em>, "which is about cultural death practices and things that are unique to different cultures, and it really took it from an anthropological standpoint. It made grief a lot more accessible. It was interesting exploring the way a community deals with death, especiallyone &nbsp;that has been ravaged and was one generation away from this mass extinction event."</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-hugi.jpg?itok=9v2P88ct 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1076">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-hugi.jpg?itok=nbVDDOyu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="673">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">"People are still going to die in the <em>Gladlands </em>and the way that we as a society handle death is really important because it's very indicative of the type of society that we live in and so having someone around that's going to treat that with care and respect and to make the people going through that feel seen and honored I think is important to a healthy society. But it's also a job that people don't want to do, so what does the guy who does that look like?"</p><p dir="ltr">As each character could have their own mutations for different body parts, and other irregularities, I was interested to know if that made the character creation process easier or more difficult to nail down a character design. Wysocki explained it was quite the opposite, "It's sort of an easy out in the sense that you can just say 'well, I just mutated that way,' you can't argue with that. It does give you a lot of freedom, so much freedom that somebody's dad could be a motorcycle."</p><p dir="ltr">"Or that you can be the hottest bodied person ever and have the body of a bug" Montoya added, referencing Behpoornia's Tess Tube5.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">First And Second Times In The Dome</h2><p dir="ltr">Interestingly while <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> is the 27th season of Dimension 20 for Wysocki and Montoya this was their second time in the Dome, and for Michaelis and Behpoornia it was their first. I was interested to know how it was coming back for the second time, as well as what they came away with from the experience if it was their first time on Dimension 20.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm more comfortable now, I'm not as intimidated by what the Dome is and how important it is to a lot of people," explained Wysocki "to be supported by very great people there was no way to lose."</p><p dir="ltr">Montoya echoed similar sentiments, "I felt super comfortable because I'd done it before, the first time I was learning how to play the game while I was playing it, but even when it had wildly different mechanics it was a lot easier for me to RP, and that was the easy part of it, AND I get to RP with my friends? Say less, I'm good."</p><p dir="ltr">For those new to the Dome they had experience in playing some home games "which were really fun, but I don't think necessarily prepared me for the amount that you have to be doing in the Dome when you're being filmed and recorded" Michaelis joked.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-table-reaction.jpg?itok=rzAtC7bF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1079">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">"I also hadn't played very much," Behpoornia added "this is what I think all of them are and I'm hearing that it's kind of an outlier here because we're not doing much combat, big bads, magic spells, all of that. So if I had to go back and do something like that I'd be so confused."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Improv Bits In A Strange New World</h2><p dir="ltr">Watching <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> the bits that the party make up and stick with are just as outlandish as the setting they're taking place in. Knowing that it was such a strange world it seemed like there was no limit to a punchline. Talking about the 'Yes, and' at the table Montoya jokes "I feared we did go too far."</p><p dir="ltr">"I was wondering 'is any of this usable? We're just having too good of a time riffing and doing bits. That's just a testament to the kind of storytelling ability the Brennan Lee Mulligan has, he was able to steer the ship when things were getting a little bit too chaotic. We also know when to lock in and when to be silly and goofy and stuff"</p><p dir="ltr">On the flip side Behpoornia mused that she didn't think there was any way to take it too far. "Just knowing the people that were there at the table, knowing that anything you did, even if it was crazy, nothing is a mess up. We could have done anything at the table because one, Brennan is such a big brain that's taking us through exactly what we need to do, and two, everyone else there we've known for years and have performed with so it's the safest space to do anything."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">"I really believe that the only time you can mess up is when nobody is there to back you up," Michaelis added, "With a group like this it's never going to happen, there's going to be somebody who steps in. Even if it doesn't work, there's going to be four of you together"</p><h2 dir="ltr">What Would Your Job Be In The <em>Gladlands</em>?</h2><p dir="ltr">As our time wrapped up and we had finished discussing each characters role I was interested to pose to each of the cast members what role they think they would have in the Gladlands.</p><p dir="ltr">Montoya began "In the Gladlands I would like to think I'd be a Poppy Persona, that's why I created the character, yeah I think that's my answer."</p><p dir="ltr">Michaelis shared that they'd been "constantly threatening to go back to school to be an EMT or a nurse. I think that's probably what I would want to do. Weirdly, I think I'm quite good in hospitals or emergency situations. I'd need the training but I think in a situation like that where there's not TV I'd have a lot more time to focus on studying."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'd maybe want to do some job with the kids in the Gladlands because that just sounds really sweet," mused Behpoornia "It sounds like my level of how I would process living in the Gladlands. So to be someone who can help them process their play in the post-apocalypse sounds like a nice job to have."</p><p dir="ltr">To close us out Wysocki gave the short but sweet answer "I'm just not making it, nah nah nah I like accidentally shoot a president or something"</p><p dir="ltr">You can watch <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> now on Dropout.tv, the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W63ILhEsvGY" rel="nofollow"> first episode is also available via the Dimension 20 Youtube channel.</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/dimension-20-gladlands-is-mad-max-if-everyone-wasnt-being-so-rude-interview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>When you need a tool, you rarely reach for a Swiss Army Knife. It’s an option that only makes sense when you have no other options. Have you ever tried to </span><i><span>actually </span></i><span>cut wood with the shitty and very flimsy saw blade included in a Swiss Army Knife or any other similar kind of multitool? I have. It was a horrible experience, and I ended up buying a saw to finish the job. It turns out shoving many things into one package isn’t an effective way to make something good.</span></p> <p><span>Anyway, have y’all played </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Released on January 26, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><i><span>Highguard </span></i></a><span>is a (</span><i><span>deep breath)</span></i><span> free-to-play fantasy-sci-fi MOBA-like 3v3 PVP hero shooter with base defense and raid mechanics. It was first unveiled as the finale of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">2025 Game Awards</a> and received a less-than-stellar reaction from people online. And since then, the conversation about </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>has been very strange and oddly aggressive. People taking sides. Takes being shot out like mortars across social media. It’s one of the weirdest reactions to a video game I’ve seen in many years.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>But I’m not here to talk about that </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>, the one that exists online as a battlefield for takes, opinions, videos, and discourse about the discourse. I’m here to offer a critical look at the </span><i><span>actual </span></i><span>game. The thing people can play right now. And that </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is far less interesting than the conversation and the mess around it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s perhaps the biggest problem facing </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>as it enters into its second week leaking players like a toddler spilling juice from their first big kid cup. It turns out </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>just isn’t very interesting.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Bland and boring</b></h2> <p><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is such a boring game to look at. Developers Wildlight Entertainment seem to have been unable to decide what kind of game </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is, and the first sign of that is in how it mixes together fantasy, sci-fi, magic, and modern guns. This blending of genres and tropes can be done well, but not in </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>; every asset and model has had any potential character and grit sanded down to ensure the various pieces blend together.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And they do blend. Perfectly. Too perfectly.&nbsp; Nothing sticks out. There’s no charm. No quirks. Nothing to talk about with people or post online. It’s the kind of game that leaves your brain the moment you stop playing it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I’ve played over 14 hours of the game now across many matches, and I struggle to name a character beyond Slade, an obnoxious blonde dude who is the closest </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>gets to creating something that has personality. Everybody else is a generic tough man or sneaky woman with clothing and armor that looks like what you start an RPG with, and then quickly replace.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s a shame that </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is such a forgettable-looking game because I do think the idea of a raid shooter is a cool concept.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Let’s get ready to raid</b></h2> <p><span>When a match kicks off, you start at your base, pick a hero, and set up defensive walls. Next, you and your two teammates ride out and search for loot on the map. This mostly involves speeding around on your mount and opening chests. The other team is doing the same, and you might run into them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Eventually, a large sword starts to form in the world, and each team needs to get to it, grab it, and take it to the enemy base to blast open their shield dome and raid the place. Do a good job raiding and the match is over. Fail and this all repeats, but the loot in the world gets better. Once a team pulls off a successful raid, they win.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This might sound complicated compared to a lot of other shooters on the market, and it does take some time to learn how this all works. But once I did, I was having some fun with </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>. I always felt like my team could come back and win. We were just one awesome raid away from victory.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“I think one of them is named… Val?

That makes sense considering the studio behind </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is made up of devs who worked on that game. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mining-crystals-in-highguard-is-so-damn-satisfying-ps5-pc-steam-2000663527"><span>Breaking large gems out in the world between raids is also extremely satisfying</span></a><span>. I equally enjoyed setting up defenses at my base before heading out to find upgrades. And chasing someone down on the back of a mount is thrilling and not an experience found in most other online shooters. Then you have each character’s unique powers and abilities, which can dramatically change a fight as you drop down a fireblast or whip up a big wall of ice. Oh, and there’s a whole loot economy, in which you need to balance buying better guns with making sure you have enough shields to weather future firefights. And then…</span></p>

 <h2><b>Too many moving parts</b></h2> <p><span>Well, see, we’ve reached the other major problem with </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>: It is trying to be everything.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Similar to its bland art style that makes it feel like the devs couldn’t commit to one idea and instead tossed it all in, </span><i><span>Highguard’s </span></i><span>gameplay is a grab bag of ideas and mechanics from other popular games. And while it would be cool if we could just put ice cream, pizza, wine, and meatloaf into a blender and mix it all up to get something even better, that ain’t how the world works.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The fast, </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>-like gunplay means you die quickly. This makes going out and getting into fights before raids a chore. The upgrade and crystal economy means you have to spend time hunting down and breaking blue rocks, which, while satisfying to smash, compelling gameplay it doesn’t make. And sure, you get some currency from defeating other players, but late-game gear costs so much and you get so little from kills that during long matches, I felt obligated to stop fighting and instead go mining. The raids, easily the best part of </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>, also make mounts mostly worthless, robbing the game of one of its coolest features. And only having three players on each side makes raids feel less epic, and the bases you defend too big. (Though the devs are already playing around with <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584">a 5v5 mode</a>, which might help.)</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663165" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663165"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663165">© Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In other words, each piece of </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>often gets in the way of the other pieces and can derail the whole experience.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>will receive weeks and months of updates to improve some of these problems. Perhaps it will add a 4v4 mode to make the map feel less empty. Maybe the time to kill, especially in the early part of matches, will be increased so fights last longer.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But none of that will be able to truly fix </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>. It would take a lot more work to do that. </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is a forgettable shooter that stuffs too much into one game and ends up being a sometimes fun but uneven mess. At least it’s a mess that most players won’t remember for long after they log off. </span></p>
