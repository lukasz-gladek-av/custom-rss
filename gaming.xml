		<p>Rockstar has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> has been delayed again, and is now coming out on 19th November 2026.</p>
<p>“We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait,” <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak3ak31a49a221/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-set-to-launch-november-19-2026">the studio writes</a>, “but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.</p>


<p>“We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern day Vice City.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> had previously been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">set for launch on 26th May 2026</a>, and while this was the first firm date that we had for launch from Take Two and Rockstar, it had come after the better part of a year of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two execs assuring</a>&nbsp;that the game was going to launch in 2025.</p>
<p>The studio has, quite awkwardly, been grabbing headlines for what has been lambasted as “brazen” union busting by leaders of the IWGB union who has been helping to coordinate unionisation efforts among employees. 30-40 employees were let go last week, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/rockstar-responds-to-union-busting-accusations-says-fired-employees-were-leakers/">Rockstar has claimed was for disclosing confidential details in a public forum</a>, though this is disputed by the IWGB. This will no doubt rumble on for a while to come.</p>

<p>The last we saw of GTA 6 came in May with the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-a-second-trailer/">the game’s second trailer</a>:</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI will take us all back to Vice City for Rockstar’s latest crime story, featuring Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, who’s coming fresh out of prison, and Jason, who works with the local drugrunners after quitting the army.</p>
<p>The trailers have shown off the modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, with a handful of things like social media influence and excesses feeding into the atmosphere, though that won’t stop there being plenty of iconic classic cars and inspirations from the breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular. From packed beaches to going across the swamps on hover craft, and partying at the tops of skyscrapers, there’s also jokes thrown into the trailer about battling crocodiles in back garden swimming pools, “Floridaman” antics – Leonidaman in the game – and plenty more.</p>

			<p>After it was<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/"> initially set to launch on May 26, 2026</a>, Rockstar Games has announced that Grand Theft Auto VI will suffer at least one more delay, as the game gets pushed from May 26, 2026, to November 19, 2026.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a brief post on X (formerly Twitter) from the official Rockstar Games account. No specific reason is cited for the delay; Rockstar just says that it needed the extra time to hit the level of polish and quality it wants.</p>



<p>"<em>Hi everyone,</em>" the post begins. "<em>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026. We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve</em>."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In a reply to the post, Rockstar continues, "<em>We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern-day Vice City.</em>"</p>



<p>Earlier this year, when Rockstar announced its May 2026 date, a little more than a year before it would arrive, it seemed like that could be the final delay for the game. Not only had Rockstar called its shot a year out, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">but reports had claimed it had no chance of arriving in 2025 anyway</a>. It felt like it was always going to have been a 2026 release, so now that we had a 2026 date, it felt fairly set in stone.</p>



<p>That said, this delay is absolutely not surprising, considering how much time, effort, and money has been poured into Grand Theft Auto VI. Rockstar and Take-Two will settle for absolutely no less than what they deem perfect, and will take all the time it needs to hit that quality bar.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again">The Game Business</a> published shortly after the delay was announced, Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick commented on the delay, saying, "<em>When we set a date, we really do believe in it. We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that's exactly what happened</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally, we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach</em>."</p>

<p>Your gear determines much of your success while playing a game of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, but so do your skills. The game chops up 45 different skills across three trees, with most skills improving your general mobility and speed, as well as your ability to loot.</p> <p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174">14 Essential Tips For Getting Started In <em>Arc Raiders</em></a></p> <p>But with so many choices, it’s easy to get lost. So let me share with you my thoughts on which skills are most beneficial, based on my 60 hours with the game.</p>

 <p>Keep in mind, however, that I’m primarily a solo player, and my choices have often been made with that in mind. And while I don’t shy away from gunfights, I’m a fan of stealth games, so I’m often sneaking around on maps like Sam Fisher. I’ve also not yet weighed in on which of the skills at the very ends of the skill trees are best. The game is still young, so metas have yet to be solidified. Still, you can’t go wrong with the options I’ve laid out here.</p>

 <h2><span id="skill-tree-basics"></span>Skill tree basics<span></span></h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> has a level cap of 75. You get 1 XP per level, which you can invest in a skill tree that covers 45 different skills distributed across three main branches. You can sink multiple points into many of these skills. So, no, you can’t unlock everything in the tree. You also can’t respec easily (you’ll have to wipe your character to do so by completing a project, which requires a ton of loot and has a specific timed window in which to send your character off).</p>

 <h2><span id="10-universally-great-skills-for-(almost)-every-playstyle%e2%80%93solo-or-grouped-up"></span>10 universally great skills for (almost) every playstyle–solo or grouped up<span></span></h2> <p>There are a ton of different ways to play <i>Arc Raiders</i>, with various guns and gadgets to help you live out the fantasy of a sniper, grenadier, shotgunner, or even freerunner.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-solo-night-raid-quest-pvp-pve-2000641437">So Much Happens In A Single Hour Of&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em></a></p> <p>Still, there are some skills that will benefit just about anyone. At a minimum, everyone should invest at least one skill point into each of the starting points of each three. For Mobility that’s “Nimble Climber,” which lets you climb and vault faster. For Conditioning that’s “Used to the Weight,” which lets you move faster while wearing heavier shields. And for Survival, “Agile Croucher” lets you move faster while crouching.</p>

 <p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-roadmap-new-map-patch-barricade-2000641734#comments"><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>Has A Big Roadmap And A New Update But Fans Want Some Things Kept Secret</a></p> <p>You need to buy these skills to progress in their respective trees, but they also should give you a good idea of the general direction each tree will take you. From there, I highly recommend observing what you think your weak points are while playing and what you’d like to improve.</p>

 <p><strong>But from the Mobility tree, everyone should at least snag “Marathon Runner” and “Youthful Lungs”</strong> so you can move and run farther and for longer.</p> <p><strong>From the Survival tree, I recommend everyone at least grab “Looter’s Instincts” and “Silent Scavenger.”</strong> These will help you loot faster and more quietly.</p>

 <p><strong>From the Conditioning tree, I recommend “Gentle Pressure” and “Proficient Pryer.”</strong> These two will combine to make your breaching faster and quieter.</p> <p>Lastly, <strong>everyone should aim to get “Security Breach”</strong> from Survival at some point, as it’s required for looting specific locations.</p> <p>These 10 skills will help you with some of the most consistent activities in <i>Arc Raiders</i>: traveling and looting.</p> <p>In my estimation, the usefulness of every other skill is highly dependent on your play style. For example, something like “Downed but Determined,” found in the Conditioning tree, will let you stay in a down-but-not-out state longer before you get fully knocked out. Personally, I’d rather focus on avoiding being downed and investing skill points into something like “Revitalizing Squat” in Survival, which boosts your stamina regeneration while crouched.</p>

 <p>Again, my playstyle, which is often solo, sees me routinely covering lots of distance, so taking a breather while crouched helps me stay moving–plus, if I’m hunkered down in cover and crouched, I’ll also regenerate stamina faster to get away from whatever bad situation ‘m in.</p> <p>That said, I can still offer some general guidelines for things to consider when selecting your skills based on whether you primarily play solo or in a group.</p> <h2><span id="15-of-the-best-skills-for-solo-players"></span>15 of the best skills for solo players<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641791" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641791"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641791">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>All of these skills should be considered in addition to the universal skills mentioned above. In my opinion, Mobility is perhaps the most important skill category for solo players who often need to get the hell out of a bad situation as fast as possible. <b>Consider investing in these Mobility skills if you’re running on your own</b>:</p>

 <ul> <li><b>Slip and Slide</b> (sliding is already pretty generous, so at least one point should work for a while)</li> <li><b>Sturdy Ankles</b></li> <li><b>Calming Stroll</b> (this ability lets you recover stamina while walking at the same rate as if you were still, making it a great way to recover stamina while still heading toward your destination)</li> <li><b>Effortless Roll</b></li> <li><b>Heroic Leap</b></li> </ul> <p>As you can probably guess, this is leaning toward a more parkour-based build, but I’ve found high Mobility is essential to staying alive when you don’t have backup regardless of how much you intend to move around like a typical <i>Assassin’s Creed </i>protagonist.</p> <p><b>From the Survival tree, I recommend the following skills for solo play:&nbsp;</b></p> <ul> <li><b>Revitalizing Squat</b> (lets you regenerate stamina more quickly while crouched, which can help you make your getaway if you’re hiding from an assailant)</li> <li><b>In-Round Crafting</b></li> <li><b>Good As New</b></li> <li><b>Stubborn Mule </b>(good only if you’re okay pushing your luck and exfiltrating with an encumbered status from carrying so much)</li> <li><b>Three Deep Breaths</b></li> <li><b>Traveling Tinkerer</b></li> </ul> <p>I haven’t unlocked some of these skills myself yet, but they’re likely to be the next ones I grab. Again, everything here maximizes stamina recovery and the ability to get what you need to do faster. And crafting in round is a great way to restock restorative items or make up for a poorly chosen loadout.</p> <p>Lastly, there’s Conditioning. As a CrossFit girl IRL, I’m all about conditioning, but I haven’t found it as useful in <i>Arc Raiders</i> for solo play. But your mileage may vary. <strong>I recommend investing in these Conditioning skills for solo runs:&nbsp;</strong></p>

 <ul> <li><b>Unburdened Roll</b> (if your shield pops, especially unexpectedly, this makes a reflexive roll less burdensome on your Stamina)</li> <li><b>A Little Extra</b></li> <li><b>Loaded Arms</b></li> <li><b>Fight or Flight </b>(you’ll need to grab Blast Born before you can buy this, which I don’t find as useful a skill, but them’s the rules of the tree)</li> </ul> <p>Depending on how you like to play the game, some of these skills might be more useful than others. And I’ve also left out some of the “end game” skills, as well as tips on which skills you should sink the most points into after the initial XP cost. The efficacy of any given skill is highly dependent on your own playstyle–and at that point, competency in this game means you should be making your own judgement calls for certain strategies you prefer. For example, I really like being able to breach something as fast as possible, so I’ve been investing more points into Proficient Pryer. But maybe that’s not as important to you, or, you have someone you play with who’s your group’s designated breacher, and so maybe it makes sense for another person to invest in these skills to round out your group’s abilities.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879">I Asked&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ Design Director If Camping Makes Me A Bad Person</a></p> <p>Speaking of groups, let’s have a look at which skills are going to be the most beneficial for a crew.</p> <h2><span id="4-of-the-best-skills-for-groups"></span>4 of the best skills for groups<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641794" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641794"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641794">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Consider these group skills in addition to the universal skills I mentioned above, as well as some of the skills that are suitable for a solo player–being really fast and quiet makes you effective as a lone wolf, but it also makes you an asset on your team.</p>

 <p>When considering group play, we need to consider what actions are impossible when you’re on your own. Here’s one example: You can’t revive yourself in <i>Arc Raiders</i>! If you get downed near an extraction point, you can still potentially crawl your way to safety, but one of the first benefits of having comrades is that they can get you back on your feet. There are a few skills that help you with staying in the game while you’re in a downed-but-not-out state, so those are essential ones to snag. Let’s break it down for each of the trees.</p> <p><b>For Mobility, one skill makes the most sense for group play: Crawl Before You Walk.</b></p>

 <p>Everything else in this branch makes you faster and ups your stamina capabilities. So invest in those as you deem appropriate. If you think your character is too slow and quick to exhaust, then invest in the general skills I outlined, as well as the ones suitable for solo play. But also consider what role you’re going to play in your group. Maybe you’re the designated medic, carrying more restoratives than other people. If that’s the case, then you probably want to be speedy so you can get to a dying teammate as quickly as possible.</p> <p><b>From the Survival skill tree, grab Traveling Tinkerer if you’re typically in a group.</b> In addition to In-Round crafting, this will help you be the go-to person for crafting supplies Topside.</p>

 <p><b>For Conditioning, I recommend grabbing Downed But Determined and Turtle Crawl</b>. These will increase the amount of time you’re down-but-not-out, thus increasing your chances of getting revived by a teammate.</p> <h2><span id="what%e2%80%99s-in-my-skill-tree"></span>What’s in my skill tree?<span></span></h2> <p>I mostly play solo, and while I’ve purchased a few skills with a “see what happens” philosophy in mind, most of my choices were about making myself faster so that I can more quickly and efficiently get out of bad situations and cross great distances.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905"><em>Arc Raiders</em>: The Sickest, Silliest, And Most Spectacular Moments From The Game So Far</a></p> <p>At level 40, I’ve invested 25 points into Mobility, 9 points into Survival, and 7 into Conditioning. Here’s what my tree looks like:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641795" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641795"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641795">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For now, I’m quite happy with my build. In fact, if I froze my build options here, I wager I’d still have a perfectly fun time in the game; I’m fast and I’m hard to kill. (Someone tried again this morning. Didn’t work out for them.)</p> <p>I’d like to be able to craft more items during a game, so Traveling Tinkerer is on my list, as is A Little Extra, which will net me more resources while looting. I’m finding I’ve left behind my reliance on Free Loadouts and instead need to double down on crafting new gear and repairing what I have, so that seems to make the most sense.</p>

<p>Skydance Games’ Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is now delayed and will not release in early 2026, according to a new statement. A new release date has not been announced yet.</p>



<p>If you are a big Marvel fan, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-gameplay-emerges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> has likely been on your radar for quite some time. As a showcase for Unreal Engine, the game brings players to 1943 with Black Panther (Azzurri) and Captain America to defeat Hydra. With an all-star cast including The Walking Dead’s Khary Payton and Horizon Forbidden West’s Drew Moerlein, it was set to be not only a graphical marvel, but a fun one with a rich narrative. Unfortunately, it seems fans are going to have to wait until later in 2026 to get their hands on it.</p>



<p>This story is currently developing and will be updated once more information is revealed.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from Skydance Games</a>, the company revealed that Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will not make it’s planned early 2026 release. Instead, it will launch at an unspecified date, likely still in 2026. According to the developers, the team wants to ensure that the game is up to fan standards and lives up to the hype. The delay announcement does come at an inconvenient time, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> also pushed its release to November 19th, 2026.</p>

<p>BO7 Zombies mode will let players try out a selection of 30 different primary and melee weapons. Out of these, each of the 28 ranged weapons can be chosen before a Zombies match begins, and it will occupy the first slot in the player’s Zombies Loadout. Between the two melee weapons, players can choose one to occupy the next slot in their loadout.</p>



<p>Each weapon has the ability to be Pack-a-Punched, have its Rarity increased, and an Ammo Mod applied to it, which adds additional destructive power to it. Moreover, every weapon has an optional Weapon Prestige and Weapon Camo Progression, with Military, Special, and Mastery Camos.</p>

When the game's second trailer dropped, it took the internet by storm, and currently has over 137 million views, but was accompanied by a delay <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-to-may-2026">into May 2026</a>.

            <p>Tonight, 6th November 2026, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> published its latest financial report, and it had some pretty large revelations about the upcoming game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>. The headline news: instead of launching on 26th May, 2026, the game has been pushed back about half a year to 19th November, 2026. This has also been <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167">confirmed by tweets</a> from the offical <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> social media accounts.
</p>
<p>Per Take-Two, this delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve. Rockstar has our full support of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">This isn't the first delay</a> the game has seen this year. Back in May, it was confirmed that the game had slipped from its previous release date into May 2026.</p>
<p>As a result of this news, we're already starting to see Take-Two stock plummet. The story broke about 9pm UK time, and as of 9.35pm stock has dropped by a massive 8% (see image below). In real terms, that means Take-Two stock is down about $30.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">has spoken to IGN</a> about the delay: "We've had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year. And mostly we’re grateful to Rockstar for constantly seeking perfection.
</p>
<p>"We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach."</p>
<p>It seems both investors and the general public don't share this same sense of optimism, as stock continues to fall as I'm writing this story.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is currently expected to launch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on its new date of 19th November. And there's little doubt it's going to be big, even with this new set-bacK: Take-Two confirmed earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-has-now-sold-a-staggering-210m-copies">GTA 5 has now sold an astonishing 210m copies</a> since its release 12 years ago, so it's probably not unreasonable to assume its massively anticipated sequel will manage to do that and then some.

 <p>This is the second delay <em>GTA 6</em> has suffered in 2025. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799">Back in May</a>, the game was delayed from launching sometime in 2025 to May 26, 2026.</p> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> was first revealed, officially at least, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-vi-gta6-first-trailer-gameplay-footage-details-leak-1851005265">in December 2023.</a> That followed a<a href="https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414"> massive leak in 2022</a> that showed off early, in-development gameplay footage of the upcoming sequel.

<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed to November 19th 2026, according to Rockstar Games. The news comes just before Take-Two Interactive was set to reveal the sales report for the year.</p>



<p>There’s no denying that Grand Theft Auto 6 is the most anticipated game of 2026. The third-person open-world shooter is a household name, for good and bad. Rockstar Games’ enormous success with GTA 5 is still going strong even after a decade since release. At a time, when it was slated to release in 2025, developers feared it would release near or with it and get nothing. Despite a delay to May 26th, 2026, the hype hasn’t died out in the slightest. The last trailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-2-is-live-featuring-jason-and-lucia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raked in 137 million views</a> and growing, so it’s clear people are anxious to get their hands on it. Well, it’s going to be a bit longer of a wait.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-delayed-to-november-19th-2026">GTA 6 Delayed to November 19th, 2026</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026.</p><p>We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and… <a href="https://t.co/yLX9KIiDzX">pic.twitter.com/yLX9KIiDzX</a></p></div>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a<a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?t=ptQ-g0f12tfyu0M9qfbBQw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> tweet from Rockstar Games</a>, the company revealed that <strong>Grand Theft Auto 6</strong> is now <strong>delayed to November 19th, 2026</strong>. The game was originally set to come out on May 26th, 2026. In a <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540444126249252?t=R8mT952wpGMG1v8Lb-jajg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement from Rockstar Games</a>, they said the following,</p>



<p><strong>“We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern day Vice City.”</strong></p>



<p>It has already been a long, long road since Grand Theft Auto 5, so the almost year-long wait now is disappointing for sure. The company seemed adament that it would make the May release earlier this year, but it looks like that isn’t happening. It did seem likely, as there has been no new trailers or marketing since the last trailer. While the finished product will likely be worth the wait, it still stings knowing it’s going to take longer.</p>

  </div><p>GTA 6 has already been delayed publicly once, as the game was originally expected to launch right around now in Fall 2025 before Take-Two delayed it to May 2026. At the time, Rockstar said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">needed more time to make a game that exceeded fan expectations.</a> In fact, the game's second trailer was released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">exactly six months ago today on May 6, 2025.</a></p><p>GTA 6 is coming to market with an enormous amount of hype behind it. One expert has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-ref-id="1100-6521839">GTA 6 is the single most important game release in history.</a> It's the first new entry in the series since 2013's GTA 5, and is predicted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell more than 40 million units in its first year alone.</a></p><p>Another talking point regarding GTA 6 has been what its price point could be. One industry observer has said there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">"hope"</a> from some that GTA 6 would come to market at $100 to help give other publishers a reason to raise prices as well. A GTA 5 actor recently said GTA 6 would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-warrants-a-100-price-tag-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6535876/" data-ref-id="1100-6535876">well worth $100 given the game's size and scope.</a></p><p>Developer Rockstar has found itself embroiled in controversy, as the studio recently fired dozens of employees for what it called "gross misconduct." Rockstar said employees were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-says-it-fired-workers-for-leaking-secrets-not-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6535987/" data-ref-id="1100-6535987">leaking company secrets</a>, but a labor union says this is baloney and that the affected staffers were fired for attempting to unionize.</p>

Now, one player has taken his love for the game to the next level by breaking a new world record for the longest video game marathon.

It's estimated that he danced to over 3,000 songs and burned more than 22,000 calories in that span. The previous record was set in 2015 by American gamer Carrie Swidecki, who set her mark at 138 hours 34 seconds on Just Dance.</p><p>Csépe told the site that his attempt "was the most physically demanding experience" in part because he spent hours moving without stretching. He also noted that he needed the help of a small staff of people to keep him him fed and drinking enough water to see the attempt through to the end. </p><p>"What also added to the challenge was managing and documenting all witness activities and their time allocation by myself; essentially before, during and after the record attempt," said Csépe. "Motivation is always a given with rhythm and music games! Those who love this genre can always tell that there is nothing more encouraging than dancing or doing body workout while listening to your favorite tunes."</p><p>Csépe already secured a handful of world records before this attempt, including the longest video game marathon playing a puzzle game while playing Tetris Effect for 32 hours 32 minutes 32 seconds; and the longest video game marathon playing a racing game for a 90-hour session on Gran Turismo 7. For now, Csépe hasn't decided which record to chase next.</p>

                <p>Arc Raiders has been out for a week now, but how is the game performing commercially? Quite well, it appears. According to Alinea Analytics, the PvPvE game from Embark Studios has sold 2.5 million copies already, bringing in gross revenue of $100 million+ in its first seven days.</p><p>The $40 game is having the most success sales-wise on Steam, where the research firm <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-has-sold-25m-copies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">estimated</a> it's sold about 1.7 million copies, or 69.2% of total sales. PlayStation followed with 400,000 units and Xbox brought up the rear with 300,000 copies sold thus far.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As an extraction shooter, Arc Raiders does not have mass-market appeal, Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics said. "Extraction shooters have always attracted a core group of players who thrive on tension, consequence, and emergent storytelling. But the steep learning curve has limited wider appeal," he said.</p><p>Arc Raiders was originally going to be a free-to-play game before Embark announced it would take a paid approach instead. Elliott said free-to-play isn't the right fit for every game, and Embark may have learned some lessons from its previous game, The Finals, which is free. That game had a strong launch but tapered off over time.</p><p>Arc Raiders being a paid game may also may encourage people to stick with it, Elliott said. The game could be "stickier psychologically" because people may feel that if they paid money for something, they should keep playing. Free-to-play games, meanwhile, have a low barrier to entry and a low barrier to exit, the expert said.</p><p>Arc Raiders is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 1 best-selling game on Steam right now</a>, and, with more than 300,000 concurrent players today, November 6, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inside the top five for most-played games on Steam.</a></p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/" data-ref-id="1900-6418435">Arc Raiders review</a> scored the game a 9/10. Reviewer Mark Delaney said, "Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter unlike any other, a totally unpredictable, immersive, thrilling story generator directed by the community."</p>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/">VGC</a> alleges that Square Enix is laying off staff in "<em>nearly all areas</em>" of its Western offices, with staff in its Europe and US offices hit. There's currently no word from Square Enix on how many have been impacted by this layoff, but sources told VGC that just from Square's London office, 140 employees are at risk of redundancy.</p>



<p>The news was delivered to staff through an internal video call as part of a restructuring that Square had mentioned <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">in the progress report it published today</a>, the same report where it boldly claimed that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-is-pushing-hard-for-ai-in-game-development-planning-to-let-it-handle-70-of-qa-by-2027/">wanted 70% of its QA work to be done by AI by 2027</a>.</p>



<p>In the progress report, Square writes, "<em>a fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization is being implemented with the aim of further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency</em>."</p>



<p>This aligns with VGC's report, which includes the same wording from Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu, who also added that this layoff is intended to make Square more "<em>lean</em>" and <em>"agile</em>." The cuts will save Square 3 billion yen annually, according to the company's projections.</p>



<p>Along with the cost savings, the cuts are meant to bring work that developers are doing at Square Enix closer to home, so to speak. In the progress report, Square says the decision came by intending "<em>To strengthen development capabilities from a Group-wide perspective and to optimize resource allocation for maximizing the value generated by IPs, a further review of the development pipeline was conducted. As a result, a decision was made to close overseas development studios and shift toward consolidating development functions in Japan.</em>"</p>



<p>Square is not the only Asia-based developer moving away from branching studios in other parts of the world. Shortly after a successful launch for Marvel Rivals, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/">NetEase cut its California-based team</a> as part a restructuring to keep work on the game closer to its home studio. NetEase also shut down two of its subsidiaries, one yesterday, and one today, as part of its continuing restructuring to limit the number of branching studios it has in the Western world.</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/">Fantastic Pixel Castle shut down with the loss of NetEase's support</a>, and today, NetEase closed Toronto-based studio, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-has-closed-yet-another-game-studio-funded-just-two-years-ago/">Bad Brain Game Studios</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-has-too-many-apps.1346170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814054/nintendo-store-app-ios-android-games-shop">a new store app</a> on Android and iOS giving users the ability to purchase hardware, accessories, and games for the Switch and Switch 2. When I open my phone and scroll down to the N’s, I get a neat, full row dedicated entirely to Nintendo. That’s four apps: the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15995098/nintendo-switch-online-app-out-now-ios-android">Switch app</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">the music app</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637319/nintendo-today-news-app">the Nintendo Today news app</a>, and now the store. (The tally increases to five if you’re a parent using the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676982/nintendo-switch-2-parental-controls-app-gamechat-restrictions">Switch Parental Controls app</a>.) And it is entirely too much.</p><p>Nintendo has always been the one company of the big three publishers that does its own thing, and that’s worked both for and against it. The company hasn’t chased development trends with the same zeal as Microsoft and Sony. That insulates Nintendo when those trends don’t pan out, like exorbitant spending on live-service games that fail. But also hurts it when it comes to performance and user experience. Console-native voice chat, for example, has been a standard on other platforms for a long time, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">but was only offered on a Nintendo console with the Switch 2 this year</a>.</p><p>With the deployment of these apps, Nintendo is both trying to innovate and playing catch-up with results that feel confusing and overwhelming. Do we really need four distinct apps? That’s not to say these apps shouldn’t exist; they serve valuable and necessary purposes. But when I look at all the programs I have to manage in my Nintendo life, it just feels like it’s too much.</p><p>You need the Switch app for screen captures and social features. You need the store to buy things. While one doesn’t <em>need</em> the Nintendo Today app, it does have useful features, like release date reminders, and it has been used to share announcements <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638133/legend-of-zelda-movie-premiere-date-2027">before they come down other official channels</a>. The music app also isn’t a hard need, but Nintendo doesn’t make its music available on streaming services, and searching YouTube for music can be hit or miss.</p><p>It’s also strange that the apps cannibalize features. I can see my play activity in both the store and the console app. The store also has a news page that’s more robust than what’s on offer in Nintendo Today. Could we not just combine all these into one central location? PlayStation and Xbox do in their apps, and it’s a seamless experience to jump from my PS5 screenshots to the PS Store.</p><p>I will grant that the music app should be kept separate, as it seems a bit unwieldy to throw a music player on top of what should be a singular administrative app. But even that feels like it’s an overcomplicated solution to a simple problem. Nintendo is precious about its IP, sure, but why does that have to mean that instead of listening to official tracks on Spotify I have to download a bespoke app just for one company’s library? Since using the music app requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I wonder if siloing its music like this is a way to enhance the appeal of its subscription. I also wonder if it has anything to do with a reticence to pay royalties. In the music app, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions">Nintendo doesn’t credit composers</a>, something it’d be required to do if it offered its music up to streaming services.</p><p>As the gaming industry continues to mature, companies are realizing that not only are they in competition with other game makers for people’s time and attention, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123956/microsoft-xbox-competitors-phil-spencer-cloud-gaming-amazon-google">but with social media too</a>. And while other companies try strategies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/809053/halo-playstation-xbox-multiplatform-strategy">bringing their exclusives to other platforms</a>, Nintendo seems to be going in a much more ambitious direction.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/management/message.html">in a statement posted on Nintendo’s investor relations website</a>, president Shuntaro Furukawa wrote, “We hope for Nintendo to be a name that people naturally turn to, part of everyday life and there for families as they grow.” You can see that strategy in products like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">Alarmo</a>, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fjp%2Fmy-mario%2Fgoods%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored">the My Mario children’s line</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/797623/pikmin-close-to-you-nintendo-pictures">its animation</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/706610/donkey-kong-movie-copyright-notice-nintendo-strategy">movie projects</a>, theme parks, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/756718/nintendo-super-mario-kids-hello-mario-free-app">Hello, Mario</a>, yet another app designed specifically for kids. That’s a lot to have going on, and it’s clear that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">some strategies seem to be working</a>. But if Nintendo isn’t more careful about how (and how much) it’s deploying these apps, people are gonna start clearing up space — if not in their lives, then at least in their phones.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/815741/nintendo-apps-nintendo-store-nintendo-music]]></content:encoded>

In particular, Battlefield 6 fans have been requesting bigger maps in Conquest, and they didn't wait around for Battlefield Studios to do it. Instead, a handful of fans have created their own big maps with Battlefield Portal and REDSEC.</p><p>Reddit users andy_6170 and kurtinthegrind have joined forces to create Club House, a Conquest play area that has plenty of space for large scale battles to break out. There are options for bots or botless versions of Club House, as well as servers that can support 64 real players. The Conquest and Tech Center options open up most of the map, while Operation Tech Center offers a smaller-scale experience in and around a single building. As described by the creators, Conquest mode features "vehicles, semi-urban areas ideal for infantry fights, and hills perfect for snipers. It's also a great map for helicopter combat!"</p><p>Separately, Battlefield lead producer David Sirland wrote on <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1985980359436083539" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> that the game needs "more of the large sandbox types for sure though!" Sirland indicated that maps and weapons will be added continuously over time. He also noted that the dev team will be "looking at fixing issues on the existing maps, and changing things up when necessary to make it better too, of course."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1985980837293408370" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Maps and weapons is of course the biggest area we'll just keep adding to over time, so this will move in that direction for sure.<br>We are also looking at fixing issues on the existing maps, and changing things up when necessary to make it better too of course.</p>  — David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1985980837293408370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Earlier this week, Battlefield Studios made adjustments to Battlefield 6 to make some of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-challenges-have-become-signiciantly-easier-to-complete/1100-6535960/" data-ref-id="1100-6535960">the achievements easier to complete</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In 1995, a 14-year-old teen in Australia, Eduards Nits, went to McDonald’s with friends. They bought some food, including a Quarter Pounder hamburger. But one friend, seemingly full of other food, couldn’t eat the burger. He asked Nits to hold on to it until he returned. He never came back. Weeks passed. Then years. Then decades. And now Nits and his longtime friend Casey Dean are the owners of <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/04/lifestyle/worlds-oldest-mcdonalds-quarter-pounder-turns-30-years-old/">a 30-year-old burger</a> from McDonald’s.</p> <p><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/strange-debate-worlds-oldest-mcdonalds-burgers-21114479.php">As explained in a recent interview with <em>SFGate</em>,</a> the decades-old burger, now commonly referred to as Senior Burger, has not grown moldy or stinky in the last 30 years. The burger has instead shrunken up and turned into a hard, brick-like object. The two friends still have the original wrapper and container the burger came in, including a thin piece of brown wax paper that wrapped around the burger when they bought it back in the 1990s. This is one of the pieces of evidence they use to prove their claims that the burger is indeed from 1995. Sadly, the receipt was lost to time as the duo never planned on keeping the burger for decades.</p>

 <p>“It no longer looks like a hamburger,” Nits told the outlet. “It’s no longer food. It just looks like artwork.” According to the duo, who consider themselves the keepers of what they claim to be the oldest McDonald’s burger on the planet, Senior Burger was never put in a fridge and instead was stored in old boxes, cupboards, and closets. It’s toured Australia, with Nits’ mother, a teacher, even taking it to school to show her class.</p>

  <p>Sadly, because the duo lacks a receipt, the burger can’t be officially verified as 30 years old by The Guinness Book of World Records. But that doesn’t matter to the friends as they see Senior Burger as a piece of history that will be passed on to future generations. As for McDonald’s, they don’t seem to be fans of the old hamburger, likely because it makes their food look rather unnatural. 30 years and no mold, fungus, or stink? Is that even beef? McDonald’s says so and claims old burgers like this stay well preserved thanks to being kept in dry locations.</p> <p>Regardless of all that, I want to take a bite of this thing. Would it kill me? Maybe. Would it taste horrible? Definitely. But damn, I’d love to be able to write a review on <em>Kotaku</em> about eating the world’s oldest burger.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Square Enix has released a statement to the media regarding the layoffs. However, they didn’t clarify the number of people being let go, and Insider Gaming has asked for more clarification. </p>



<p>The full statement is as follows:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are reorganizing our operations in North America and Europe to strengthen our development structure and to drive a globally integrated marketing strategy. This was an extremely difficult decision, made following careful consideration and analysis by our leadership, in order to best position the Group’s long-term growth.</p>



<p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the talented team members who will be departing the company for their significant contributions to Square Enix. During this period of transition, we remain committed to treating each individual with the utmost respect and providing extensive support throughout this process.</p>
</blockquote>



<hr>



<p><strong><em>Original Story:</em></strong> Square Enix is letting go more than 100 employees in a global mass layoff.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN’s Rebekah Valentine</a>, Square Enix is letting go up to 137 people in the United Kingdom (UK) along with an unknown number of people in the United States (US).</p>



<p>The layoffs were announced in a video call with staff located outside of Japan. These cuts will impact those working in marketing, publishing, business planning, QA, IT, and more. Staff being let go will start being notified on Thursday. Full details on what Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu called a <strong>“fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization” </strong>will be given in the future.</p>



<p><strong>“In the current fiscal year, a fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization is being implemented with the aim of further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency,”</strong> a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">presentation shown</a> first to staff before being made public said.</p>



<p>It has also been reported that those not let go from the company will be required to work more often in office. </p>



<p>They also come the same day the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/square-enix-wants-ai-to-handle-70-of-qa-within-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said it wants to have 70%</a> of its QA and debugging handled by AI by the end of 2027. It’s unclear, however, if this plan attributed to the current round of job cuts.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Square Enix for comment on the layoffs. Should a response be received or a statement be made public, it will be added to this story.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s collaboration with KPop Demon Hunters is not done yet, if new leaks are to be believed. The first wave of the collab saw a bundle of skins based on the HUNTR/X trio hit the item shop, while the seasonal Horde Rush mode got a KPop Demon Hunters-themed makeover. Now, <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1986484452563034475" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">word is</a> that KPop Demon Hunters will return to Fortnite with a jam track for the song "Golden."</p><p>The KPop Demon Hunters collab was noticeably missing any jam tracks or dance emotes with music from the Netflix film. That absence was likely the result of how quickly the collab was put together. Since the movie wasn't expected to be such a massive hit, the deal might have gone from conception to fruition in just a couple months--that's lightning speed for something like this.</p><p>Right now, the only leak about further KPop Demon Hunters content in Fortnite is about the jam track for "Golden." It's possible that other HUNTR/X jam tracks could be added, or that a new wave of skins could come with the tracks, but there's no info about that just yet. The members of HUNTR/X are also prime candidates for the next music pass in December, but there haven't been any leaks about future Festival-season headliners.</p><p>Fortnite has followed up the packed Halloween event that introduced the KPop Demon Hunters to Epic's metaverse with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">Simpsons takeover over of the main Battle Royale mode</a>, which has boosted Battle Royale and Zero Build to their highest player counts of the year so far.</p>

<p>Although there’s no denying that the console has been a massive commercial success since its launch on 5th June 2025 — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">officially selling over 10 million units</a> — there’s a niggling, underlying sense of dissatisfaction amongst some fans regarding Nintendo’s first-party lineup (and let's just save Game-Key Cards for another time, hm?).</p>
<p>It’s not that difficult to see why. Disregarding ‘Switch 2 Editions’, we’ve had a total of five first-party exclusives for the system so far: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, and now <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. Certainly not a bad start, but I'd argue that out of these, only Bananza has received (almost) universal acclaim. Even Mario Kart World, widely regarded as Switch 2's 'killer app' before launch, has been criticised for its structure and open world.</p>
<p>And although Bananza has been praised far and wide for its satisfying, chaotic gameplay, there’s nevertheless a feeling that this isn’t <em>quite</em> what fans want in the system's first year. Donkey Kong, as beloved as he is, isn’t Mario.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c7d7b0ae6e6c7"><a title="DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7d7b0ae6e6c7/dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And that’s the issue, right? Although on the surface, a brand-new Mario Kart game and a 3D Donkey Kong platformer <em>should</em> be slam dunks for Nintendo, they both kind of fall short for some. Compare this to 2017 when the original Switch saw the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_2">Splatoon 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> all in the first year, and I can understand the frustration. <em>[<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a>, too!... - Ed.]</em></p>
<p>I, however, have not felt any of this, and it’s down to one simple reason: third-party games. I can distinctly remember those first few months after the Switch’s launch; outside of Breath of the Wild and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, I spent the majority of my time playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thumper">Thumper</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. These were great games and I don’t for one moment regret my time with them, but goodness, they were pretty much my only options for a while.</p>
<p>With the Switch 2, it's the polar opposite. Third-party support has been absolutely <em>phenomenal</em> right out of the gate, and I’ve already sunk hours into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, and more. I frankly can’t keep up.</p>
<figure data-uuid="47dc14a77a03e"><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/47dc14a77a03e/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus / Sega</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Switch got good third-party support too, of course, particularly as its sales exploded. But hardware limitations proved to be a significant barrier over time, and for years I’ve been gazing longingly at games on other platforms and thinking, <em>'Cool, but I wish this was on Switch.'</em></p>
<p>We've been dreaming of a time when third-party publishers would go above and beyond to support a Nintendo system — the dark days of the Wii U still loom in my mind — and the Switch 2 already feels like a realisation of that dream. No longer does it feel like we’ve been left behind, and we already have publishers planning launches for flagship games day-and-date with other platforms.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. For years, Capcom has leaned almost exclusively on PlayStation for its marketing, but the company appears to have shifted that focus over to Switch 2 for its upcoming release. The original Switch, as capable as it was, couldn’t handle Capcom’s more recent RE games natively, and so they were relegated to ‘Cloud Version’ status. They felt like an afterthought, with Capcom razor-focused on advertising its flagship titles on Sony's consoles - no real surprise when you consider RE started on PS1.</p>

<p>Not anymore. Now that Switch 2 can fight the other platforms' fire with fire, Capcom clearly sees enormous potential. Cue the announcement of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-switch-2-pro-controller-and-amiibo-confirmed">special edition themed Pro Controller and a Requiem amiibo</a>, and it’s looking more and more obvious that the Switch 2 is a high priority to accelerate Capcom's growth.</p>
<p>And let’s be fair, the PlayStation audience know Resident Evil very well at this point; it seems unlikely that this shift will greatly affect Requiem’s performance on Sony's console.</p>
<p>Has every third-party effort been perfect? No. A few games, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, prove — at least at launch — that performance can still hit a few snags on Switch 2, while we've still yet to receive a firm release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> after a last-minute delay.</p>
<p>There are some teething issues, then, but by and large, I think we can expect great things from third parties. Even when the PS6 and whatever the heck Microsoft is cooking up launch, it's likely that games will remain scalable enough to run on Switch 2 without looking and performing like crap.</p>
<p>We're very much in an era of diminishing returns regarding raw power, so I feel like pretty much any game launching on Switch 2 will at least look good, if not great. And publishers who perhaps weren't as invested in the Switch certainly won't want to make the same mistake twice with the Switch 2. So if they can scale a high-end game down just enough so that it impresses visually yet still performs well, you can bet they'll be doing it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="60d1aca42bb2f"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/60d1aca42bb2f/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So if you're someone who generally sticks with first-party software, I'd urge you to branch out and see what else is out there. I understand the frustration if you feel these first months have been a bit lacking. As for me? If this level of third-party support holds for the years ahead, I can honestly see Switch 2 becoming my primary console for almost <em>everything</em> bar PS5 exclusives.</p>
<p>It's just that good.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/relic-entertainment-announces-ambitious-plans-for-the-future/">Relic Entertainment</a> has announced that a new DLC for Company of Heroes 3 is set to arrive later this month on November 27, 2025. The Company of Heroes 3: Endure and Defy Battlegroup DLC expansion will add four new battlegroups, each with its own play styles, new powerful units, and more when it arrives on PC later this month.</p>



<p>Each of the new battlegroups has been designed for both multiplayer and co-op/skirmish AI modes, with US Forces getting the Italian Partisan Battlegroup, the Wehrmacht getting the Last Stand Battlegroup, the British Forces getting the Polish Cavalry Battlegroup, and the Deutsches Afrikakorps getting the Kriegsmarine Battlegroup.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Company of Heroes 3 - Endure &amp; Defy Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Ryr8UF4SX4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The teaser trailer shows a bit of the new battle groups in action, though Relic Entertainment said in a press release that it will be putting out more information about the coming expansion as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>The Italian Partisan battlegroup is a class of resistance fighters and saboteurs to help enhance your ground forces in battle. They can sabotage your enemy with tunnel networks to plant underground explosives, steal resources, and wreak havoc behind enemy lines. The Last Stand Battlegroup is all about defending the line with new vehicles to bolster your defences, while the Polish Calvary battlegroup add strong lancer sections to the front line. They especially thrive against veteran enemies.</p>



<p>When the DLC arrives, it'll be available at a 10% launch discount for its first two weeks. For those who've not yet even jumped into the base game for Company of Heroes 3, it'll be 60% off for a limited time as part of a Black Friday sale.</p>

Under UK law, Square Enix must undergo redundancy consultations to see if any jobs can potentially be saved, so the final number in the UK could be smaller. It is not yet clear which teams were impacted by this, or to what extent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Internally, a slide presentation <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now publicly available</a> was also shared with employees earlier today, offered a progress report on Square Enix's ongoing "reorganization of overseas organizations", of which this restructuring seems to be a part. Per Square Enix, the strategy has already involved "clos[ing] overseas development studios and shift[ing] toward consolidating development functions in Japan."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a part of this, Square Enix already sold Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montreal, Square Enix Montreal, and a number of associated IPs to Embracer Group. It also already <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-confirms-us-eu-layoffs-as-part-of-restructuring/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laid off workers across its Western operations in 2024</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That leaves Square Enix with the Life Is Strange, Outriders, and Just Cause franchises currently managed by its Western studios, as well as the publishing of Powerwash Simulator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix has shared a statement with IGN confirming the layoffs, but did not respond to questions about the number of individuals impacted, what roles, or if any projects or specific studios were impacted:</p><blockquote>We are reorganizing our operations in North America and Europe to strengthen our development structure and to drive a globally integrated marketing strategy.</blockquote><blockquote>This was an extremely difficult decision, made following careful consideration and analysis by our leadership, in order to best position the Group’s long-term growth.</blockquote><blockquote>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the talented team members who will be departing the company for their significant contributions to Square Enix. During this period of transition, we remain committed to treating each individual with the utmost respect and providing extensive support throughout this process."</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same presentation shared today, Square Enix also shared that it expects 70% of its QA work to be handled by generative AI by the end of 2027. The company has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-president-states-the-company-will-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai">stated in the past</a> that it intends to be "aggressive in applying AI" across both development and publishing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
