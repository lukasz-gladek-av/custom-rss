			<p>The implementation of the PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler isn't perfect in all titles due to some games reportedly using an older version of the upscaler.</p>
<p>Commenting on the<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/df-star-wars-jedi-survivor-ps5-pro-severe-image-quality-problems-but-rt-in-performance-mode-is-nice.1038024/page-4#post-131783178"> ResetERA forums</a> in a thread discussing the disappointing Star Wars Jedi: Survivor PS5 Pro update, a developer going by the name of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/koralsky.22833/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koralsky</a> commented on the poor image quality produced by PSSR in certain titles, revealing that the difference in image quality between different games is caused by the different versions of the upscaler used. In regard to the latest entry in the Respawn series, the developer confirmed the game is using SDK 9, being an Unreal Engine 4 game, so the team couldn't implement the latest up-to-date version of the upscaler that requires SDK 10 or higher, and has possibly used the very first version, hence the bad image quality.</p>
<p>While Koralsky couldn't provide more details on how many iterations of the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler are already available and how each version improves on the previous, they could confirm that users should expect IQ improvements in the second and third batches of PS5 Pro-supported games using PSSR. In a game the developer is currently working on, for example, one of the later versions of PSSR, but not the latest, is giving much better results in comparison to TSR and FSR, and, as such, they expect the upscaler to get in a much better state in six, twelve months, compared to the state it is in the first batch of PS5 Pro supported titles.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro console is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the recently released mid-generation system in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299455/house-lan-gaming-parties-software-engineer-kenton-varda<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re nostalgic for the era of lugging your desktop to a friend’s house to play <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, software engineer Kenton Varda doesn’t have <em>exactly</em> the solution — but he thinks he has something better. The Cloudflare Workers tech lead has spent more than three years and at least a million dollars to <a href="https://lanparty.house/">transform his Austin house</a> into the ultimate local PC gaming pad, complete with 22 machines and a dedicated hardware room. It’s dubbed the LAN Party House, and you’re probably not invited.</p><p>LAN (short for local area network, as many readers likely know) parties were the best option for “online” gaming <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/11/just-a-bunch-of-idiots-having-fun-a-photo-history-of-the-lan-party/">in the era of dial-up internet</a>. While some are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/1/2603289/dreamhack-winter-2011-120-gbps-connection-lan-party">large-scale events</a>, Varda’s house is aimed at having groups of friends drop by, pull a gaming station out of a hidden wall or table panel, and start playing.</p><p>Much of the house was specifically designed to hold PCs. There’s a basement room with 12 gaming stations built into folding wall cabinets, two call rooms equipped with their own gaming stations for private meetings, and an office space used for board games. A large table in the latter also unfolds to reveal an additional six gaming PCs plus two personal workstations. (In case you’re wondering, each PC contains an Intel Core i5-13600 CPU, a GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, and 32GB of RAM.)<em> </em></p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</p><div><figcaption><em>Each gaming station is housed in folding cabinets that convert into individual desk setups.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Kenton Varda</cite></p></div></div><p>Some of these machines are discrete desktops, but most are monitors that connect to a central room that holds and cools the towers. Varda says the 22 PC stations collectively cost about $75,000, but the full-house project was “a 7-digit number.”</p><p>Varda — who’s apparently hosted LAN parties as frequently as every other weekend —&nbsp;says most of the people who drop by are “not actually hardcore gamers.” They focus on team-based games like <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>or the non-deathmatch modes of <em>Unreal Tournament 2004. </em>One room also includes four built-in <em>Dance Dance Revolution </em>(DDR) pads. These aren’t public events — “sorry, you must be invited,” Varda says. “I’m sure you understand: For security reasons, we can’t just let random people on the internet into our house.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Four DDR stations are also embedded into the floor for any emergency dance-offs.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: <a href="https://lanparty.house/">Kenton Varda</a></cite></p></div><p>This is actually the second LAN party house that Varda has created, having <a href="https://newatlas.com/google-engineer-builds-ultimate-lan-party-house/20833/">completed a previous property in Palo Alto, California in 2011</a> that went similarly viral. That 1400 square-foot house was smaller than his latest property according to Varda, who says it “made for a pretty awesome bachelor pad, but would have been a bit cramped for raising a family.” He lives in this house with his two children and his wife, entrepreneur Jade Wang — who’s apparently a <em>DDR</em> fan. The new place was funded with money from the pair’s long career in tech, as well as the $1 million in profit he apparently got when selling the old house. It’s far from the worst thing you can spend a tech industry windfall on.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption><em>The actual PCs remotely wired and housed in this dedicated engine room that requires its own A/C intake.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Kenton Varda</cite></p></div></div><p>Varda acknowledges that this setup isn’t exactly the classic LAN party model. And in fact, his first house was built to let people bring their own machines. “Nobody ever did,” he notes. “Not once.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-is-finally-getting-full-crossplay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>After nine years, Rainbow Six Siege is finally getting crossplay between PC and Console players. The news was announced as part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4tB2kOgWqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Operation Collision Point</a> reveal on Sunday.</p>



<p>When playing online, players on console will have three different pools to choose from when looking for a match. There will be platform-specific pools to keep you against those on the same system, a consoles-only pool to allow crossplay between PlayStation and Xbox, and a PC crossplay pool. The pool can be set in the general settings under “Crossplay Matchmaking”.</p>



<p>As far as the players are concerned, they’ll be able to invite anyone to a match through Ubisoft Connect. Those on console who decide they want to play with PC players will have a separate PC rank from their traditional console rank for ranked playlists.</p>







<p>With the addition of crossplay between the platforms, the team knows that cheating is a concern. It’s something that the developers have been working on handling before the feature became available.</p>



<p>“We are excited to confirm that MouseTrap V2 will be a part of this feature to keep things balanced,” UX Designer Abhishek Agarwal said. </p>



<p>Creative Director Alexander Karpazis added that the system will allow detection if someone is trying to play with a mouse and keyboard against just console players that will move players to the PC pool if they are detected. Regarding cheating, there is a new “Cheater Match Cancellation” system that will remove a cheater from the game and cancel the entire match if one is detected.</p>



<p>What do you think of Rainbow Six Siege getting full crossplay support? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Twenty years ago this month, Valve released Half-Life 2. The company is celebrating the anniversary with a <a href="https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife2/20th" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">20th anniversary update</a> that includes new content and various bug fixes. Best of all, Half-Life 2 is free right now on Steam, but only until 1 PM ET today, November 18.</p><p>One of the most exciting additions for the Half-Life 2 update is new commentary tracks (spanning 3.5 hours) for the entire game featuring the original Half-Life 2 developers discussing how they brought the game to life. Additionally, Half-Life 2 now has in-game Steam Workshop support, along with support for Steam's new Game Recording feature. The update also fixes various issues with the 20-year-old game, including holes in the game world and disappearing objects. Players can also expect "cleaner, smoother horizon lines" and higher-resolution lightmaps across the entire game.</p><p>What's more, players can choose original graphics settings for blood and fire effects or new ones that were released later. There is also a High Quality mode that's been added, while the aim assist feature has ben overhauled to help it feel better.</p><p>Something else to know is that Half-Life 2's Episodes 1 and 2 are now part of Half-Life 2 itself, and due to this, Valve said it will be "reducing the visibility" of the standalone versions on Steam. They will now appear inside the Tools menu on Steam.</p><p>In addition to the update, Valve partnered with former GameSpot video producer Danny O'Dwyer's Secret Tape for a two-hour documentary about Half-Life 2. In this feature, Valve discusses the game's origins, development, and legacy, and of course, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-writer-shares-episode-3-details/1100-6452861/" data-ref-id="1100-6452861">fabled Half-Life 2: Episode 3</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-half-life-2-episode-3-hl3-update-canceled-ice-gun-1851701011" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku reports</a> that in the documentary, Valve discussed why Episode 3 never saw the light of day and even revealed new footage of the game. Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic and would have focused on a ship, Borealis, that went missing.</p><p>The game was in the works for six months, but amounted to a "collection of playable levels in no particular order" and only containing some story elements. However, writer Marc Laidlaw said the team was "running out of fuel" and ultimately decided to abandon Episode 3 altogether as the team worked on finishing Left 4 Dead, which would be released in 2008 to great success. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="323">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YCjNT9qGjh4?start=323" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Valve engineer David Speyrer said the "tragic and almost comical" part of Left 4 Dead's success was that, "By the time we considered going back to Episode 3, the argument was made like, 'Well, we missed it. It's too late now." </p><p><span>Speyrer said that in hindsight, Valve made the "wrong decision."  He said, "W</span><span>e could have definitely gone back and spent two years to make</span> Episode 3<span>." </span></p><p>While Valve never made Half-Life 2: Episode 3, the company did create a new Half-Life game, the VR title Half-Life: Alyx. It was released in 2020 to critical acclaim, and was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2020-half-life-alyx/1100-6485617/" data-ref-id="1100-6485617">GameSpot's Game of the Year.</a></p><p>In other news, the Half-Life 2 20th anniversary update has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/220/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">helped Half-Life 2 reach a new concurrent player record on Steam.</a></p><h2><strong>Half-Life 2 20th anniversary patch notes:</strong></h2><p><strong>Content:</strong></p><ul><li>Added 3.5 hours of Developer Commentary by members of the Half-Life 2 team.</li><li>Half-Life 2: Episode One and Episode Two are now playable from the Half-Life 2 main menu.</li><li>Half-Life 2: Lost Coast has been added to the Extras menu.</li><li>Added Steam Workshop support.

Its main differentiators are the ability for users to build their own Bluesky servers if they so desire, and a suite of moderation tools that make it easier for users to ward off toxic behavior. For instance, if you block someone on Bluesky, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>you block them in real life</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> both parties are unable to view each other's posts, and any posts from the blocked user interacting with the blocker are rendered invisible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are also "Starter Packs," user-created recommendation groups of accounts that let users easily find accounts they might want to follow.

"From a game marketing perspective, it just made sense to look for alternatives," he said. "Also I'm too old for TikTok."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While some users on the site formerly known as Twitter were seeing less engagement, others were making more—off of anger and toxicity. Game designer Monica Fan said they were one of many developers from a marginalized background who saw extreme posts spread further and further, and they started looking for an exit. "The hate is different when it's not [driven] by personal opinion, but rather as a way to make money," they said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Almost </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>everyone</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> who responded to us expressed relief at being so removed from hateful posts and users that had dominated X since 2022 (and were often elevated by Musk, sometimes directing harassment toward developers). Plenty of developers faced abuse on the basis of their race, gender, or sexuality. Brass Lion Entertainment design director Osama Dorias told us that among other issues, the tolerance for racism and sexism is what sent him looking for alternative platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">X's policy of training the generative AI LLM "Grok" off of X posts also sent some users away.

Kitfox Games founder Tanya Short said she assumes it "won't last" if the population keeps growing, but she nodded to the platform's butterfly logo and said the site's operators seem to be interested in promoting "easy-going vibes."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Bluesky.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nina Freeman—an indie developer pulling double duty on Dontnod's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lost Records: Bloom and Rage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> said she initially made an account just to grab the handle, aware that she would need some social media to market her games. "Since I don't typically work with a publisher, I have to do all my own marketing. So maintaining some social media presence is important." She said her main focus is on Twitch, but moving to Bluesky helped her "reconnect" with fellow developers after a long break from social media. "It's fun to see more and more familiar names popping up in this new space."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For some folks, it's a fresh start. The increasingly harsh environment on Twitter (which existed before Musk's takeover) sent some developers away from the platform, including Dave Kosak, former </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> narrative and quest lead who struggled with online harassment after the California lawsuit against Activision Blizzard. He said Bluesky's "nuclear block" tool has helped him feel reconnecting with the game development community. With "block lists" also built into the platform as feeds that can be subscribed too, it makes it easier to identify larger groups of users you may not want to interact with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The business case is building too. Aster Wright pinged us to let us know indie developer/publisher </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-finji-ceo-bekah-saltsman-would-update-about-her-gdc-talk-on-indie-pitching">Finji</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is setting up social account for games on the platform, because it's already seeing growth and engagement and connecting with players. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs">Starter packs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and custom feeds are also helping them find a non-professional audience and be found by others. Polygon Treehouse creative director Alex Kanaris-Sotiriou seconded this, saying he's already seeing better engagement from posts on Bluesky about the studio's upcoming game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mythwrecked</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> than on other platforms. Riot Games social media manager Eric Aaberg said he's "testing the waters" for seeing if Valorant's esports fandom will gather in the platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Plane Toast creative director Émi Lefèvre said her team set up a "brand account" relatively early because the platform was quickly becoming a "legitimate" place to share projects. "For now, I'd say it's a great platform to share early development and get early feedback from kind people," she said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is the lack of an "algorithm" that recommends posts to your main feed a good or a bad thing? The answers were mostly positive—custom feeds let developers aggregate who they want to see more easily, and not trying to "game" the algorithm shifts how people post. Some raised the point that no algorithm means it's harder to have your game passively recommended to other users, which will affect the platform's viability as a tool for talking to players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indie developer Robert Yang pointed out that so far, Bluesky isn't suppressing visibility on links off the platform, making it more likely his followers will see it when he links to his work. "Even when there were only like 5 people on Bluesky, that was already 5 more people than Twitter would let me reach," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some developers like Neha Patel were late arrivals because they felt they needed to focus on other platforms like X to have any shot at a career. Fewer resources in the industry for marginalized developers meant she and others didn't have the privilege to withdraw from a major platform for networking and marketing her work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Leaving was going to have a high cost, so seeing a "fun" audience helped soften the blow for her. She said it's the most fun she's ever had on a social media account.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="There's always a storm on the horizon">There's always a storm on the horizon</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some folks we've spoken with—especially those who saw Bluesky in its earlier, rougher days—voiced some caution at viewing the platform as a panacea to X's hostility. Earlier in its lifetime, the site struggled with moderation and seemed to signal it wanted users to moderate their own communities. That changed after Black users reported an uptick in hostility, with one high-profile incident being an account with a slur in its name that seemed to slip by the automated moderation tools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Katherine Cross (who occasionally contributes to Game Developer) closely analyzed the state of Bluesky and warned in a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/bluesky-twitter-social-media/">2023 Wired column</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that its professed moderation strategy might put a ceiling on organic connections between communities. "If Bluesky lives up to its promises, the various and sundry right-wing 'culture warriors' and other crypto-fascists might find themselves behind a permanent block that cannot be undone by corporate chicanery," she wrote. "But those same mechanisms will also, of necessity, put up barriers between diverse communities...making it impossible to recreate Twitter’s serendipity."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ivy Road animation lead "Aura" (a longtime Twitter user whose posts regularly exploded in virality) pointed out that what developers want out of Bluesky—what she described as the vibe of "Twitter circa 2019"—could lead to X's flaws being born again. "2019 Twitter was already in a place where I had to watch I said very carefully, and that's very true of Bluesky as well. This is the only site where random things I say consistently get picked up by the media, and it means I have to be very cautious that even casual comments might become news."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Bluesky.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indeed, Twitter's network effect and the regular instance of tweets blowing up and driving "dunk-quoting" is a phenomenon that Bluesky sometimes enables. Tools limiting who can quote your posts help, but the network effect Aura is referring to is created by the nature of the site. Many of these safety tools, however, only came to be after users like political commentator Jamelle Bouie briefly decamped from Bluesky, tired of being swarmed by users ready to fight over every kind of post.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's also a question of what developers will do if their core communities outside of the Western game development industry still live on other platforms. Fan said they're still maintaining a presence on X because Asian game developers haven't begun to make the jump, and indie Shawn Alexander Allen explained he wouldn't be permanently setting up camp as long as the indie/underground rap community is still a thing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then there's the general frustration that developers need to be on platforms like Bluesky in the first place. "We were taught in school that if we ever want to get a job in the industry we need to be 'Twitter famous,' Fan said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Freeman agreed, saying "I don't like that it feels almost essential to work with a publisher or a bigger platform to get the visibility you need...even within just the indie space, never mind the mainstream."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">BlueSky's AT protocol may mean the communication method itself isn't controlled by one company, but the easy-to-use app is, and that may leave it vulnerable to the same kind of takeover that befell X, as Lefèvre pointed out. "I still have a bitter feeling about it as this is still a centralized platform owned by a corporation and we'll never be safe from someone taking over," she said. "I wish people would give </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://mastodon.social/explore">Mastodon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a try but right now it's still lagging behind unfortunately!"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What's next for game developers on Bluesky?">What's next for game developers on Bluesky?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars: The Old Republic</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> narrative director Ashley Ruhl said she hopes Bluesky can be a place where indie and solo developers can be "elevated," praising the "Starter Pack" system with helping her broaden the kinds of developers she connects with. System Era design director Liz England echoed this sentiment, saying she hopes the platform can revitalize one of Twitter's best strengths, erasing walls between new and aspiring developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers said to help market games on the platform, they still need better media uploading tools and access to back-end analytics. The only gifs you can post right now are ones that exist in Tenor, and the odds of a high-quality gif of your game going viral aren't very high at the moment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A key metric to watch out for will be if Bluesky attracts sports fans, as community manager Casey Lucas pointed out. "The demolition of chronological feeds has frustrated sports fans a lot. People like to live-tweet along with a game, interact about games/tournaments using hashtags, build communities of fellow fans, especially if they live outside the geographic area where their favorite team or sport is located," she explained. "I suspected Twitter was on the outs for good when the combination of algorithmic feed and political force-feeding got so bad it started to annoy hockey and football fans."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Across all the followers who wrote into us though, there was a universal theme: everyone wants Bluesky to be a safer, calmer, and more encouraging space for their community. Everyone seems tired of the confrontational type of posting that took place on X, which made directing harassment at other users feel like a fun game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, there's at least a brief moment of joy of having an online space that doesn't cater to white supremacists and conspiracy theorists. It will take careful work by Bluesky management—and a concerted effort by users—to keep it that way.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure was released last month across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. The Switch version was created by Engine Software in association with developer Deck Nine Games.</p>
<p>It's a direct sequel to the first game in the series and follows original protagonist Max, though this has proven controversial with some fans due to the consequences of the original game's final choice.</p>
<p>Deck Nine is the studio responsible for various <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> prequels, follow-ups and remasters. The original game, however, was developed by Don't Nod.</p>
<p>That studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-director-hits-out-at-hateful-comments-about-life-is-strange-double-exposure">creative director Michel Koch hit back at "hateful" comments</a> against Deck Nine from disappointed fans.</p>
<p>"I didn't play the game yet, and I have no idea where they are taking the story. But what I know is that nothing justifies hating on people for how they wrote their game!" he wrote on Twitter/X.</p>
<p>"You can be disappointed, you can want other narratives for those characters you love, or different stories… but ultimately creation is hard and very subjective and if [Double Exposure's] story does not please you, it does not erase what you imagined."</p>
<p>"Like its own hero's dabbling with time travel, Life is Strange: Double Exposure highlights the troubles of trying to revisit old memories, while raising unanswered questions about the future," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">Eurogamer's Life is Strange: Double Exposure review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-playstations-state-of-play-may-2024">brief tease earlier in the year</a>, Sony has now lifted the lid further on Alien: Rogue Incursion, with a new trailer and - importantly - a release date.</p>
<p>The upcoming game was once slated for launch on PS VR2 at some point this 'holiday' season, but today the team narrowed that tenuous date down. VR fans, get your headsets ready, Alien: Rogue Incursion is set to make its unsettling debut on 19th December.</p>
<p>In addition to this date, Survios' chief product officer <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/alien-rogue-incursion-new-story-trailer-gameplay-details/">TQ Jefferson</a> shared a new story trailer, which "delves deeper into Zula’s [the game's protagonist] story on LV-354, also known as Purdan". </p>
<p>Jefferson said this trailer was made with a three-act structure, culminating in a "big finish". I won't spoil that big finish for you here, because where is the fun in that? Instead, you can find out for yourself by checking out Alien: Rogue Incursion's new story trailer for yourself below.</p>

<p>Speaking on the trailer's third act, Jefferson stated: "We’ve established by this point that danger is truly everywhere, and now we want to show players that you have the means to fight back."</p>
<p>Zula will be able to do this with weapons such as the M41 Prototype Pulse Rifle and gear such as a Plasma Torch, with Jefferson saying all of this will allow players to experience the world of Alien "like you never have before".</p><p>"You will finally get to feel what it’s like to step into the world of the films - Aliens in particular - and immerse yourself in an experience so visceral and real that it will change your perceptions forever," the developer proclaimed, adding the game has gone gold.</p>
<p>So, what did you think?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-become-best-selling-pokemon-games-in-japan.1038504/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-best-selling-japan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have become the series' best-selling games of all time in Japan, beating out the previous record-holder for the first time in decades.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/24646" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu report</a> (for which we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have sold over 8.3 million copies between them in Japan, which means they've officially sold more than the original&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Red and Green&nbsp;</em>(since Japan's game was&nbsp;<em>Green&nbsp;</em>rather than&nbsp;<em>Blue</em>).</p>

<p>Until this moment, those original games held the record for Japan's best-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, and given just how much of a phenomenon&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>was when it first arrived, that's no mean feat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-coalossal.jpg?itok=klUuspfK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-coalossal.jpg?itok=aE4MZqtO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have become the best-selling games in the series in Japan.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that these sales figures do only apply to Japan, so&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>may well not be the best-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>However, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-sold-13936-million-units-super-mario-bros-wonder-sold-1196-million" rel="nofollow">huge success of the Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow">sky-high sales numbers</a> of&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>around the world, I wouldn't be surprised if the newest games were also the best-selling in other regions.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, mainline <i>Pokemon&nbsp;</i>games are released every three years or so, and since&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>launched in 2022, we can perhaps expect an announcement regarding the next major&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games soon.</p>

<p>It's likely, though, that Nintendo will wait until the successor to the Switch is announced. We're expecting news on that front <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">sometime before April 2025</a>, so the new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games may well be revealed alongside the console.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-venonat.jpg?itok=LgYrtUII 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-venonat.jpg?itok=cvyror6x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games could be announced before the fiscal year is out.</figcaption></figure><p>That announcement seems especially likely to coincide with the Switch 2's given that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>met with criticism at launch regarding their lackluster performance on Switch.</p>

<p>They're not the only games in that particular firing line, either. It seems that devs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch" rel="nofollow">may be avoiding releasing games</a> on the Switch owing to its aging internals, so a successor would presumably improve things on that front, not just for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>but across the board.</p>

<p>Still, since it's been confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 (or whatever the console ends up being called) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">will be backwards compatible</a>, perhaps there'll be some sort of performance boost for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>on that front. We can but hope.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em><a href="https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-gb/buy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on Nintendo Switch</a>. A DLC pack,&nbsp;<em>The Treasure of Area Zero</em>, which comprises two extra story episodes, is also available now.</p>

<p>Knowing firsthand whether you can run an upcoming simulator is step number one in immersing yourself in the experience wholly. With a game like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2025, the system requirements determine everything, down to your enjoyment of the game. If your computer can’t run the title, you’ll find it a jarring experience that runs the risk of leading to motion sickness. Thankfully, we have the info you need!</p>



<h2 id="h-here-s-the-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-pc-requirements">Here’s the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PC Requirements</h2>



<p>In a simulation game that somehow manages to span the entire planet, albeit in minimal detail in some locations, one would assume the system requirements would be exceptional. They’re pretty high in some spots. Previously, there were rumors that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-on-pc-wants-64gb-ram-to-run-at-its-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MFS 2024 would require 64 GB of RAM</a> to run on the high-end. However, that doesn’t appear to be the case any longer, as the recommended amount of RAM sits at 32 GB currently. </p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-requirements">Minimum Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X / Intel Core i7-6800K</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Radeon RX 5700 / GeForce GTX 970</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 50 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>



<li><strong>Network</strong>: Broadband – Network Speed of 10 Mbps Bandwidth</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-requirements">Recommended Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>

<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Radeon RX 5700 XT / GeForce RTX 2080</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 32 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 50 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>

</ul>







<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-releasing-on">What Platforms is Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Releasing On?</h2>



<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will be released on November 19 and immediately available to play on PC and Xbox Series X|S. Unfortunately, the flight simulator that spans the globe isn’t coming to PlayStation 5. There’s no word on whether this might change, but with past Microsoft console-exclusive titles, like Grounded and Sea of Thieves, launching on PS5, it’s not outside the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>It’s becoming the norm for an upcoming game to launch with two, three, or sometimes even four unique editions that vary in price and content. The more you spend, the more in-game content you receive. It’s a shame. But if you’re the type of gamer who only plays a handful of titles throughout the year, especially if you have a favorite franchise, paying a little extra for one game makes more sense. Regarding the many airplanes in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, paying for the most expensive edition is how you’ll unlock everything at launch.</p>

            <p>A sequel to Turtle Rock's bloody good <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a> is seemingly in development under the codename "Gobi 2".</p>
<p>Whilst Turtle Rock confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/back-4-blood-wont-get-more-new-content-as-dev-shifts-focus-to-new-game">work had shifted to its next title at the beginning of last year</a> and there has been no official word that Back 4 Good 2 is coming, there have been plenty of rumours, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gtphrt/back_4_blood_2_seems_to_be_in_development_under/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">latest of which</a> may be our strongest hint yet that a follow-up to the Left4Dead-style zombie slaughter game is on its way.</p>

<p>Firstly, take a look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/633807/depots/">Back 4 Blood's backend on Steam</a>. There you'll see the word "Gobi", which was seemingly the internal codename for Back 4 Blood.</p>
<p>Now take a look at the <a href="https://www.istunt.com/jesse-hutch-4776">online portfolio</a> of motion capture actor and stuntman Jesse Hutch, who includes his performance as a "lead performer" in "Gobi 2". More interestingly still, Hutch <em>also</em> worked on the original Back 4 Blood game. Curiouser and curiouser, right?</p>

<p>Whilst we won't know for sure until Turtle Rock make it official, this - along with the domain back4blood2.com being registered last year - makes the sequel all the more likely. Watch this space, eh?</p>
<p>Back 4 Blood launched back in October 2021 and has received a total of three paid expansions since then. It was generally well-received, with Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell calling it a "delightfully scrappy hang-out shooter" that delivered a successful if "strange mix of old and new" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/back-4-blood-review-weird-but-wonderfully-moreish-horde-shooter">Recommended review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Beastieball was practically made for me, and I can’t thank the creators enough. It comes from Wishes Unltd., who previously released the incredible <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/05/chicory-a-colorful-tale-review/">Chicory</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/27/wandersong-review/">Wandersong</a>, both of which are joys to play, so I’m not shocked to find that Beastieball maintains those good vibes. This time around, it’s all about a world of creature catching, and also… volleyball.</p>

<p>Basically, you have to try and save land near where you grew up from being overrun and turned into a Beastieball stadium, and to do that, you have to become a Beastieball coach and go on the ultimate tournament arc, constantly pushing yourself and your Beastie’s to new heights, and probably learning some stuff along the way. It’s a very cute idea, and it all gets fought out via volleyball.</p>


<p>Battles are turn-based, and you can do different things depending on if you’re attacking or defending. Each Beastie gets its own special attacks and support abilities, and each one also has its own stats. Different attacks can hit in different directions too, and if you attack a lane or a row where there isn’t an opposing Beastie, then you can win the game outright. You can also throw your attacks at the Beasties to drain their stamina, and when they hit zero stamina they need a nap before they can play again.</p>


<p>None of the Beasties get hurt, which is nice, and the ones you find in the wild will willingly play with you because they actually want to – like when a cat runs at you from across the street meowing to say hello and get some fussing. Plus, if you can show off your skills, they’ll join you as long as you’ve got a spare jersey. It’s just so darn cute, and it’s such a nice change of pace from pitting cute creatures against each other in deathmatches to get badges… or any other very non-specific examples you can think of from the genre.</p>
<p>The character designs are all wonderful, you get to recharge your social battery for cool events as you defeat stronger foes, and you can customise your character as you want. Beastieball is still in Early Access, but it already feels like one of the coolest games I’ve played in ages. It’s just so wonderfully fulfilling, and it makes for a great change to a lot of other games in the genre. Also, we need more volleyball games so I can live out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS-N8KfZ5EU">Haikyuu</a> dreams because I’m almost definitely too old to join a volleyball team.</p>

<p>Beastieball is out now via Steam Early Access. Please play this game and don’t miss out on it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/payday-3%E2%80%99s-dev-team-downsizes-no-layoffs-in-sight-yet.1038450/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/payday-3s-dev-team-downsizes-no-layoffs-in-sight-yet/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Typically, when a game experiences a rough launch or a development team decides to downsize, it isn't good news. While Starbreeze has downsized the Payday 3 team, it doesn't seem that there are planned layoffs, which, in the current climate of the game industry, is great news. When it comes to games that were highly anticipated and then flopping, Payday 3 is pretty high on the list. Even Starbreeze is aware of the fact that the game launched unsuccessfully. As a result, they've now downsized the team, as reported in <a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starbreeze's interim report</a>.</p>
<p>In the report, CEO Mats Juhl states "in the coming months, investment will be lower as we round off 'Operation Medic Bag' for Payday and therefore enter Year 2 with a smaller team focused on continuously updating the game with new content." The report did not specify how downsizing the team will affect Payday exactly and whether it will affect the frequency of updates in Payday 3. This means that <a href="https://wccftech.com/payday-3-will-add-solo-mode-still-requiring-online-connection-soon-alongside-nvidia-dlss-3-support/">the updates</a> will be smaller or less frequent. Despite the fact that the team has downsized and that Payday 3 didn't perform quite to their expectations, the report says that Starbreeze "remains financially strong," which is a good sign for a company in today's climate.</p>
<p>In the report, there was no mention of any layoffs, which is a pretty good sign. Hopefully this means that the staff have been relocated elsewhere within the company, or that they have already landed on their feet. While Payday 3 wasn't quite so successful, Juhl does mention that the recent DLCs that have been released for Payday 3 were well received, providing a glimmer of hope for Starbreeze. Although Payday 3's sales weren't up to scratch, the company's overall revenue has been cushioned nicely by the "relatively stable sales of Payday 2," a game that players found themselves returning to instead of playing Payday 3.</p>
<p>While the report predominantly focuses on the financial updates of the company, and how their current games are performing, there is also mention of Project Baxter, a dungeons &amp; Dragons project that "continues at full speed," with the report going on to state that there are internal playtests taking place, with a lot of "active discussions" happening with a lot of industry-leading companies.</p>
<p>While Starbreeze is known for making the iconic Payday franchise,&nbsp; they have also made games such as Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. They've also started to dip their toes into publishing, with Dead by Daylight being one of the most well-known titles that they've published.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-underperformed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-admits-new-ip-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-underperformed.1038447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-underperformed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has admitted that&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, an action-tower defense hybrid that also represents a foray into new IP for the studio, underperformed compared to its expectations.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcoms-new-ip-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-missed-sales-targets-despite-high-reviews/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a> (which, in turn, cites a Japanese <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/396057" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GameBiz report</a>),&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>received strong reviews from both critics and players, but failed to translate those reviews into unit sales.</p>

<p>Capcom blames this deficiency on "insufficient marketing and the failure to generate buzz prior to release", as Automaton says. In essence, not enough was done to let people know what exactly&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>was before release, and that's never going to help unit sales.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-tower-defense.jpg?itok=209PJ2rg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-tower-defense.jpg?itok=zgTImkld 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>didn't sell quite as well as Capcom hoped for.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio certainly isn't wrong when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>' critical performance. The game has an 82 critic average on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16948/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenCritic</a>, with 90% of critics recommending it, and it enjoys scores in the 80-85 range across <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all</a> three current-gen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">platforms</a> on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/critic-reviews/?platform=pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Metacritic</a> as well.</p>

<p>Users also seem to have broadly positive opinions about the game. It currently has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510710/KunitsuGami_Path_of_the_Goddess/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">91% Very Positive rating on Steam</a> across 1,149 reviews (at time of writing), so it's clear that those who are playing&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>are enjoying it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it's often the case that critically-acclaimed games that exist within a particular niche can't drum up sales.&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>might be a tough sell for a lot of players; it's an action-tower defense hybrid, and it's not easy to see exactly what kind of game it is from screenshots, either.</p>

<p>Still, in the GameBiz report (for which we're using machine translation), Capcom says it intends to continue promoting&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>in order to achieve its initial sales target, although it wasn't clear about what that target actually is.</p>




<p>Although sales of&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>were apparently lackluster, Capcom says games like&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection&nbsp;</em>have been selling as expected.</p>

<p>Additionally, the company is currently gearing up for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>in February</a>, and if its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">beta performance</a> is anything to go by, that game is likely to provide a massive boost to Capcom's finances when it's released.</p>

<p>FromSoftware is set to bring back its best-selling Dark Souls game for a new audience. According to a new claim, Dark Souls 3 is getting the remaster treatment from the studio.</p>



<p>The report comes from known leaker “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shpeshalnick.xboxera.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shpeshal Nick</a>” Nick Baker, who made the reveal during the latest episode of his Xbox Era podcast.</p>



<p>“A lot of people will probably file this under ‘this was obvious’,” he said. “What I have heard is that we are getting a Dark Souls 3 remaster.”</p>

<p>Baker hinted that he had more information on the remaster, but wasn’t “allowed to pass that on”. One aspect was regarding resolution and framerate that Nick believes “will be more” than the 1080p 60FPS that the original game features.</p>



<p>First released in 2016, Dark Souls 3 is the best-selling Dark Souls game with over 10 million copies sold. As a franchise, Dark Souls has sold over 35 million units since its debut in September 2011. It also helped fully establish the Souls-like genre that a number of games have utilized in recent years  like the Nioh series, Lords of the Fallen, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-blocks-under-13s-from-dming-others-outside-games-amid-scrutiny-over-child-protection<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a> has announced significant changes designed to protect children who play on the platform amid increased scrutiny and concern from parents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the changes due in the coming months, users under the age of 13 will no longer be able to directly message others on Roblox outside of games or experiences (also known as platform chat).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox will also introduce a built-in setting that limits users under the age of 13 to public broadcast messages only within a game or experience. By default, users younger than 13 will not be able to directly message others. Parents can change this setting in Parental Controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From today, users under the age of nine will only be able to access games or experiences with content labeled Minimal or Mild, with parental consent required to access Moderate content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox's changes come on the heels both of a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>damning Bloomberg report this summer</u></a> about the prevalence of child predators on the platform and, more recently, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-accused-of-massively-inflating-user-stats-and-fostering-hellscape-for-children-in-scathing-report"><u>report from investment firm Hindenburg Research</u></a> that accused the company of, among other things, being a haven for groomers and pedophiles due to a lack of up-front screening of new accounts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It claimed to have found open trading of child pornography on the site as well as violent and hateful speech and sexually explicit content in numerous games marketed to kids on the platform. Roblox responded, saying that "safety and civility" have been "foundational" to Roblox since its inception. However, Hindenburg followed up by pointing out that it had not addressed allegations of Roblox being a "pedophile hellscape."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve spent nearly two decades building strong safety systems, but we know there’s always more to be done,” Matt Kaufman, Chief Safety Officer at Roblox, said in a note to the press issued today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Last quarter saw a record average for daily active users on Roblox - over 88 million - and as our platform has grown in scale, we have always recognised that our approach to safety must evolve with it. Today’s launch represents the next stage in that evolution. It is the culmination of many months of product development and consultation with online safety experts, and follows the rollout of more than 30 new safety feature enhancements this year alone, as we continue on our mission to build a safe and civil space for play, learning and creativity for millions around the world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also from today, accounts with parent privileges will be able to view their child’s screen time over the past week, set daily screen time limits, and view their child’s friends list. In addition, accounts with parent privileges will be able to access existing Roblox tools that allow parents to set spend restrictions, limit or enable certain chat functionality, and determine the type of content their child has access to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the coming months, Roblox will also introduce new restrictions to prevent users under the age of 13 from searching, discovering or playing experiences that have yet to be assigned a Content Label. Restricted content will remain blocked until a user is at least 17 years old and has verified their age by uploading a selfie and a photo of a valid government-issued ID.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Roblox announced that it will age-gate certain experiences for users under the age of 13, based on the type of user behaviors sometimes found in those experiences. These new restrictions apply to experiences that are primarily designed for socializing with users outside of their friends list and experiences that allow free-form writing or drawing, such as on a chalkboard or a whiteboard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 2018, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-bans-players-who-gang-raped-a-seven-year-olds-avatar" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roblox faced criticism</u></a> after a mother reported her seven-year-old daughter's Roblox character was violently sexually assaulted by several other characters. Around the same time, a six-year-old girl was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/05/girl-6-invited-sex-room-playing-childrens-video-game-roblox-7605376/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reportedly invited into a "sex room" in the game</u></a>.

There are no blocks to slice or balls to smash, and you don’t need to flail your arms like an octopus in a mosh pit. While other games ask you to zone out and follow along to a pre-set beat, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em> lets you wield the most majestic of brass instruments—the trombone, and lets you take control of the music itself. You’re not just reacting to a song like a musical lemming—you’re performing it. Every note, slide, and toot is yours to control, letting you decide whether to stick with the melody or go rogue in Improv Mode with a jazz solo wild enough to have your music teacher reaching for the tissues.</p><p><strong>Campaign Promises</strong></p><p>Our all-new Campaign Mode offers an epic journey packed with surprises for beginners and <em><a title="Games > Trombone Champ [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a></em> veterans alike. It eases you in, letting you get comfortable with the instrument’s quirks and rhythm. But don’t get too cozy. The campaign ramps up faster than a trombone glissando, introducing complex tracks and challenges that push your rhythm, timing, and ability to adapt. Every milestone you reach unlocks new tracks, and you’ll leave your mark on the leaderboards as you compete for the illustrious title of the one true <em>Trombone Champ</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Hornucopia</strong></p><p>Let’s be honest. One trombone just isn’t enough. How many is too many? We’re not sure yet, but we’re definitely going to find out. At launch, you’ll have over 20 trombones to unlock, each with its own sound, style, and… personality. From a purrfect cat trombone that meows as you play to a ridiculously floppy pool noodle that bends with every slide or even a melting ice cream cone, each trombone has a unique look, sound, and feel. And with dozens more unlockable trombones rolling out in the coming weeks and months, there will always be a new piece of brass to chase after.</p><p>As if that weren’t enough for you relentless collectors, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em> also offers a full set of collectible Tromboner Cards. Yes, they’re called Tromboner Cards, and yes, they’re exactly as ridiculous as they sound. With 50 individual cards packed with absurd trombone trivia and mysterious lore, these cards are truly another thing to unlock and collect. Think you’ve got what it takes to snag them all? Just don’t lose your grip on the slide (or your grip on reality) along the way.</p><p><strong>Make It Make Sense</strong></p><p>Thanks to the advanced haptics and adaptive triggers of the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em> lets you feel each note as you play. Whether you’re executing a delicate note or unleashing a full blast, the tactile feedback makes each musical moment feel impactful. Plus, with the game running at a smooth 120 hertz on <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and delivering crisp, vibrant visuals in 4K HDR, every toot and slide looks as impressive as it feels. The dynamic environments and audience reactions adjust to your playing, adding an extra layer of immersion to every performance as you bring the music to life.</p><p><strong>Setting the Stage</strong></p><p>As our debut PlayStation VR2 adaptation, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em>, kicks off Flat2VR Studios’ mission to take the classics and give them new life in VR. This is just the beginning for us—we have more in the pipeline, each reimagined to fully leverage the immersive power of VR.

			<p>Today, KOEI TECMO Europe and developer Gust revealed some <a href="https://wccftech.com/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-releases-march-2025/">new details about the upcoming title</a> Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land. These details give players a glimpse into the combat system of the game and the synthesis feature. For those excited about the game, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land is set to release on 21 March 2025 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. For the first time ever, players will see the Atelier Yumia franchise on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, allowing more platforms than ever to have access to the game.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of more details about Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land, KOEI TECMO Europe has released a brand new trailer, which you can watch below. The iconic synthesizing system will be making a return to Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land, where players will be tasked with manipulating "mana" to be able to create new items that are beneficial to combat or can aid you in exploring the world around you. As you progress through the game, you'll have to learn how to master Resonance Synthesis, which is where you add ingredients that resonate with each other to create a higher-quality item. It does sound like it's going to be a bit of a tricky system, but it also seems like there's room for trial and error and lots of different combinations to try out.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land - Second Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jREQBeHXIoU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To make sure that the new Atelier experience is fresh, the combat system has been revamped, offering a real-time combat system with intuitive gameplay. In this new Atelier game, skills that are available for active team members now depends on the distance from the enemy, whether they are close or ranged attacks. This is different from previous games in the franchise, as players are now able to move and swap out characters in the team during active combat. There are now also additional combos that can be activated once the correct conditions are met, allowing for combos such as the "Friend Action" or the "Mana Surge."</p>
<p>Also announced are <a href="https://atelier.games/yumia/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Premium Box and Special Collection Box</a>, which you can pre-order if you want some extra goodies to celebrate the release of Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land.</p>
<p>The Premium Box contains the base game, an art book, a B-3 size cloth poster with an original illustration, a CD, and an Early Access costume for Yumia. Alternatively, there is also the Special Collection Box, which includes all of the content from the Premium Box but also contains the following: a handkerchief in the style of the Aladiss Research Team bandana, an A1 tapestry, six keychains, six clear file folders, a sticker sheet, Yumia's stuffed animal and a short story with an accompanying translation booklet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-lego-horizon-adventures-playset<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lego, Guerrilla, and Studio Gobo have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>playset to commemorate the release of the game of the same name.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/celebrating-the-lego-horizon-adventures-launch-with-a-brand-new-lego-set/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new PlayStation Blog post</a>, the "<em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>Aloy &amp; Varl vs. Shell-walker &amp; Sawtooth Playset" (try saying that one fast ten times) will come with 768 Lego pieces and will feature Aloy, Varl, and two of the series' most iconic creatures.</p>

<p>Aloy comes complete with her signature bow, while Varl carries his spear. They've both got pretty confident expressions on their faces; these are very much the&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>versions of the characters rather than those from the original games.</p>

<p>The Sawtooth, meanwhile, is fully articulated, and has "opening jaws, a swivelling torso, and a posable neck, head and legs". These might be Lego creatures, but they're no less formidable as a result.</p>

<p>You'll be able to grab the new&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>playset starting from March 1st, but pre-orders are already open <a href="http://lego.com/product/Aloy-Varl-vs-Shell-Walker-Sawtooth-77037" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Lego.com</a> if you know that you're going to be picking this one up. The set costs £39.99 or your local equivalent.</p>




<p>This new playset has been released to coincide with the launch of&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, a new Lego adventure game set within the world of Guerrilla's&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-horizon-adventures-release-date" rel="nofollow">on November 14th</a>, the game's narrative serves as a retelling of&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, albeit with significantly less doom and gloom and significantly more comedy Lego pratfalls.</p>
