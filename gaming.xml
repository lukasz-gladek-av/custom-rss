            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>publisher tinyBuild has announced that the game is getting a live-action movie adaptation, and this announcement comes before a release date for the game has even been revealed.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/story-kitchen-will-take-tinybuilds-time-travel-game-kingmakers-to-live-action-film/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a report by VentureBeat</a> (endorsed <a href="https://x.com/tinyBuild/status/1821533320456384702" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by tinyBuild itself</a>), production company Story Kitchen has teamed up with both tinyBuild and&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>developer Redemption Road in order to make the movie.</p>
<p>It'll be a collaborative project between the three studios, and according to VentureBeat's report, the movie will aim to "tell a unique story and establish the intellectual property" in a simultaneous fashion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingmakers-movie-combat.jpg?itok=2tNfrhCY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingmakers-movie-combat.jpg?itok=unaXrmZj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie, even though it hasn't even technically got a game yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Story Kitchen cofounder Dimitri Johnson says that&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers</em>' "action, world-building, and intriguing sci-fi" make it the perfect choice for a "propulsive new franchise in Hollywood".</p>
<p>tinyBuild CEO Alex Nichiporchik, meanwhile (whose&nbsp;<em>James Bond</em>-style exploits during the outbreak of war in Ukraine <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinybuild-war-room-meeting-led-to-crazy-plans-to-extract-employees">you can read about here</a>), says he and his studio are "extremely pumped" to be teaming up with Story Kitchen. Nichiporchik describes the&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>movie as a "time-bending spectacle".</p>
<p>Story Kitchen cofounder Mike Goldberg and Nichiporchik both think that&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>has got rich enough lore behind it for a movie, and Nichiporchik further points to adaptations of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-teaser">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/fallout-season-one-review-welcome-to-apocalypse">Fallout</a>&nbsp;</em>as proof that video game movie adaptations can work.</p>
<p>Of course,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaitlyn-dever-last-of-us-season-2">The Last of Us</a>&nbsp;</em>doesn't get out of VentureBeat's article without a mention, either. tinyBuild and Story Kitchen seem to have all the right touchstones for a&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>adaptation, but whether or not it works - or, indeed, even comes to fruition - remains to be seen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-kingmakers-tv.jpg?itok=ok3PF3R1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-kingmakers-tv.jpg?itok=XXfqHqD8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>is arguably the touchstone of quality for anyone wanting to make a video game-to-TV or movie adaptation.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's unlikely that the&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>adaptation will be quite so weighty as&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>; any property in which assault rifle-wielding soldiers go up against medieval knights must surely be at least at a certain level of silly to proceed.</p>
<p>Still, we'll have to wait and see what Story Kitchen cooks up (ahem). The studio has a good pedigree; it's responsible for adaptations of properties like&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, and it's also behind the recently-announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-dredge-movie">live-action&nbsp;<em>Dredge&nbsp;</em>movie</a> that's currently in the works.</p>
<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>itself, no release date has yet been revealed for the game, and given that tinyBuild <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinybuild-financials-2023">made a pretty significant loss last year</a>, the publisher will likely be hoping for a date sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more, and in the meantime, if you want to wishlist&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>on Steam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">you can do so here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-breaks-2-000-games-milestone-will-support-black-myth-wukong-at-launch.947949/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-breaks-2000-games-milestone-will-support-black-myth-wukong-at-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today's GeForce NOW Thursday lineup is rather light, but it has just enough games to allow NVIDIA's cloud streaming platform to boast about having over two thousand compatible games.</p>
<p>As you might remember, GeForce NOW had a rather lengthy beta phase that began in October 2015 (although the free beta available for everyone came <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-free-beta-available-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out</a> in January 2018) and lasted until February 2020, when NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidias-cloud-gaming-service-geforce-now-is-officially-out-of-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the official release of the cloud streaming platform just as the world started grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;Before the end of the launch month, NVIDIA already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-boasts-over-one-million-new-gamers-using-geforce-now-since-it-left-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boasted</a> GeForce NOW's one million user base despite several publishers (such as Activision Blizzard) leaving GFN after the beta.</p>
<p>As of two years ago, NVIDIA said that there were over 20 million GeForce NOW users. Of course, the cloud streaming platform has made big strides in its performance throughout these years. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-rtx-4080-superpod-rollout-begins-today-10-new-games-added/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultimate tier</a> is equipped with RTX 4080-class graphics cards, allowing gamers to play the latest PC titles at up to 4K resolution or 120 frames per second while also supporting NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, ray tracing, and Reflex.</p>
<p>One of those is Game Science's Black Myth: Wukong. The action RPG (which was shown once again today in a stunning new gameplay <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-shows-its-stunning-game-world-in-final-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer</a>) will be available on GeForce NOW at launch. Overall, NVIDIA's cloud streaming platform popularity definitely benefited from Microsoft's decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-to-bring-all-its-xbox-pc-games-to-geforce-now-including-activision-blizzards-if-the-deal-passes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring</a> all its games from the Xbox, Bethesda, and Activision Blizzard divisions to GFN as part of its bid to get the Activision Blizzard acquisition approved by regulators.</p>
<p>The full list of weekly GFN additions can be found below. As a reminder, the Summer Sale is still ongoing, albeit only for a little while longer. Moreover, Priority and Ultimate subscribers can grab an Elder Scrolls Online 'Noble Snack' emote for free starting today. Free members will get the opportunity starting tomorrow.</p>
<p><em>● Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks (New release on Steam, Aug. 6)</em><br>
<em>● Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (New release on Steam, Aug. 8)</em><br>
<em>● Ratten Reich (New release on Steam, Aug. 9)</em><br>
<em>● Nine Sols (Steam)</em><br>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wolfeye-studios-reveals-images-details-for-new-action-rpg/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/WolfEyeGames/status/1821531821328499064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, WolfEye Studios shared three first-look images of its anticipated action RPG, featuring different settings and characters.</p>



<p>The first image showcases a dusty landscape and base of some kind, while the other images create more of a steampunk look. Fans quickly praised the art design for its creativity, style, and worldbuilding.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/WolfEyeGames/status/1821532563862687792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separate post</a> on X, WolfEye Studios offered another landscape shot. It also invited curious fans to sign up “for a chance at Private Alpha access.” This leads to another compelling visual, teasing “Candis Technologies” with the slogan “the future is bright.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Just yesterday, Arkane co-founder Raphael Colantonio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dishonored-and-prey-fans-should-watch-out-for-wolfeye-studios-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased WolfEye Studios’ next game</a>, adding that fans of Dishonored and Prey “will be happy.”</p>



<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arkane-co-founder-first-person-action-rpg-dishonored-prey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">with IGN</a> today, Colantonio also offered some new details about the nature of the project itself, though it remains untitled.  </p>



<p>They explained it’s “an ambitious new IP built upon the DNA of earlier Arkane games to deliver a rich and detailed world, freedom of how to play, and a deep RPG experience.” They added that it’s a first-person action RPG, and it is “actively in production.” </p>



<p>And although WolfEye Studios encouraged fans to sign up for the private alpha, Colantonio says there will be a “limited private Alpha in 2025.” So, players will have to wait some time before experiencing any gameplay.</p>

<p>It has just been revealed that the BAFTA Award-winning ‘bullet hell’ title, Vampire Survivors, is headed to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on August 29. This stellar title was released in 2021 and took audiences by storm, offering up a plethora of replayability stacked alongside rogue-lite mechanics and one of the most insane visual palettes I’ve ever seen in a game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-t-put-it-down">Can’t Put It Down</h2>



<p>I’d never played a game like Vampire Survivors when I demoed it at WASD London, and as soon as I stood up after my 30 minutes in-game, I was hooked. I immediately purchased it on Steam and fell in love with it, spending hours looping the various maps and modes with a vast array of characters to play as and secrets to unravel.</p>



<p>This highly-reviewed, top-rated title is now making its way to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, and it’ll be released digitally on August 29.</p>



<p>The base game will cost just $4.99, with various expansion packs and DLC bundles being offered at prices ranging from $1.99 to $2.49. It’s amazing that something with so much potential and so many hours of entertainment costs so little. I can’t recommend this game enough. </p>



<p>It’s particularly special if you’re a fan of retro gaming, thanks to the visual style employed by poncle, the game’s developer. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-order-1886-and-god-of-war-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-shut-down.947919/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-at-dawn-reportedly-shut-down<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Order: 1886&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>developer Ready at Dawn has reportedly been closed down by parent company Meta, with employees apparently being encouraged to apply elsewhere in the company.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ready-at-dawn-studios-closing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a report by Android Central</a>, which in turn cites an "internal memo sent to employees". Per the memo, which was apparently written by Meta's Oculus VP Gio Hunt, Meta's budget for its VR-based Reality Labs division is set to be slashed by 20% by 2026, and Ready at Dawn's closure is part of that initiative.</p>
<p>A Meta spokesperson subsequently told Android Central that rather than being made to "save money", these cuts were, in fact, part of ensuring that Oculus can make a "better long-term impact" in the world of VR gaming.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ready-at-dawn-closure-lone-echo-2.jpg?itok=l2V8xCdy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ready-at-dawn-closure-lone-echo-2.jpg?itok=72e0ZWmK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Since it was acquired by Oculus in 2020, Ready at Dawn has mostly focused on making VR games.</figcaption></figure><p>As Android Central points out, Meta's <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Meta-06-30-2024-Exhibit-99-1_Final.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">second-quarter earnings report</a>&nbsp;was released last week, and during an earnings call, the company said that its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-marvel">Quest 3 headset</a> was "exceeding...expectations" in sales terms, so Ready at Dawn's closure might seem like it's strangely-timed in relation to that announcement.</p>
<p>Still, the company's shuttering comes at a time when many studios are either being closed or are suffering heavy layoffs; recently, studios as diverse as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">Bungie</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">EA</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Palia&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-developer-singularity-6-layoffs">Singularity 6</a> have all been hit by layoffs, while companies like&nbsp;<em>Elex&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report">Piranha Bytes</a>&nbsp;(reportedly) have been shut down outright.</p>
<p>Ready at Dawn's is a long and storied history. The studio opened back in 2003, when it was founded by several former Naughty Dog employees. In that light, its first game, 2006's PSP platformer&nbsp;<em>Daxter</em>, makes a lot of sense, and the studio would go on to work on more games for Sony, including two&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>PSP titles.</p>

            <p>
WolfEye's debut game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/weird-west-review">Weird West</a> attempted to pack a little of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>'s immersive sim sorcery into a top-down action-RPG. For the studio's next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey">Prey</a> with a "real RPG" experience redolent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> and modern-day <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout</a>.
</p>

<p>
"The structure is very freeform, and you can explore whatever you want," Colantonio tells me over videocall. "But the mobility and the type of gameplay is very reminiscent of games that we've worked on in the past, like Prey or Dishonored. So you have this blend between an RPG, like an open experience, where you can go wherever you want, and level up, and there's branching etcetera, but at the same time, the physicality and the types of gadgets and powers that you've seen in games from Arkane before. So if you look at the continuum from Dishonored to Prey, and then we imagine, how would it be if it was even more open than that, even more RPG than Prey."
</p>

<p>
Colantonio and Roby aren't saying much about the game's story right now, but the announcement screens give you a sense of the ambience and stakes: industrial brickwork, big smoky skies, automatons of delicately embossed steel. There are Gatling guns and water silos, canyons lined with rickety gantries, and workshops sliced into what seem like convenient shady hiding spots by the setting sun.
</p>
<p>
"It's a world where you can recognise the scenery, but then the types of technology are futuristic, even though in a style of fabrication that would have made sense in the 1900s," Colantonio says. "That's why you have this really unique look - it's not really steampunk, but some people will say it's steampunk. And part of the story is that at some point you will realise why this alternate timeline was created."
</p>
<p>
The developers aren't quite ready to talk about specific gadgets at your disposal, either. The project entered pre-production in 2022, and Wolfeye have only just finished the first vertical slice - that is, an internal demo which gives a sense of every aspect of the experience. But you can expect to get your grubby mitts on automatons of various kinds, together with firearms such as shotguns and one particular fancy traversal tool which sounds like it wants to be this game's Blink. 
</p>
<p>
"We have this thing that is a magnetic rope, so it sticks to any metal in a very systemic way," Colantonio says. "If there is any metal in the scene, like a bin or anything, it sticks to it and spawns a rope you can use to climb, for example." You'll also get abilities that appear more supernatural in nature, such as one that lets you "set a point that allows you to escape from the middle of combat later".
</p>
<p>
In general, Colantonio goes on, the game is about "going deeper into the space of possibilities" offered by his and Roby's previous projects at Arkane, while stirring in concepts and approaches from traditional role-players. "If you think about our games, I think they have, one, interesting worlds to explore that are very - I don't know if realistic is the word, but even though they are not real they are grounded, there's full coherence and lore that players will enjoy discovering. And the other aspect is play your way. There's a very sandboxy aspect to it, where you can customise your playstyle and the game responds to it as well as branching the story. If you did some things, there are consequences now and then - there are multiple ways to do things. 
</p>
<p>
"So we are doing this again, but I think putting this in an RPG structure gives even more possibilities. It's a little more free, in a way, and that's new for us and I think our players will enjoy it. Because our games have always been adjacent to RPGs, but this time we're going real RPG - so dialogue trees, level-ups and stats and other things that you can grow." Colantonio seems especially enthused about the addition of proper branching dialogue, noting that this is relatively unexplored territory for Wolfeye. "If you have [a high enough speech skill] or if you've done something specific, you can tell something to someone to access new options and possibilities."
</p>
<p>
The character stats, meanwhile, will be familiar to genre aficionadoes, though Colantonio again cautions me that everything is still WIP. "We've just finished a vertical slice, and the detail of the stats will change as we make progress in the game, because if you think about it, the stats are guiding all the underlying systems. They can change name, they can encompass more mechanics than one, so all of this is still very flexible. So it's too early right now to describe all of the stats. But yeah, it would be that kind of thing - maybe it's not "Strength" but "Fortitude". We're still trying different things and adapting, so that might change all the way until alpha." 
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Is the game still recognisable as an immersive sim in the Arkane mold, given all these additions to the formula? "Definitely, people who are into our past games will enjoy that layer," Colantonio assures me. "So yes, it is on the page of an immersive sim, even though from a genre perspective, people will perceive it as an RPG."
</p>
<p>
He gives me a tentative example of an in-game scenario that brings abilities, gadgets and obstacles together into an open-ended, Dunwallian melange. "In the current vertical slice, it's the beginning of the game, and so there are different things you do to understand who you are and the story's inciting incident. But before that, one of the challenges is to go through a factory that's protected by automatons, and here there are, again, many ways you can do things, whether it's the more direct approach with dynamite you've found on the way, or shotguns and protective gear or protective drones - because you might have drones. Or you can be sneaky and find the security room and disable the automatons."
</p>
<p>
As to which RPGs have proven influential, there are some obvious big hitters. "I would definitely mention Fallout," Colantonio says. "I can tell you a list of RPGs that we've been very impressed with in general, but it doesn't mean that they are a direct comparison or inspiration for us. Skyrim has been a very good one, Baldur's Gate 3, of course, a really fantastic game, and the Fallout series, from when it was 2D and since it came to 3D with Fallout 3, New Vegas and Fallout 4. That kind of structure is really what we like." 
</p>
<p>
All of this comes with the caveat that Arkane aren't trying to make anything nearly as sprawling as an Elder Scrolls game. "The scope, the size - historically we've always created games that are more dense, higher density, and less about size," Colantonio says. "So that is something we always favour - more possibilities and more detail, more craft, over endless repetitive dungeons. We're not going for that - it's going to be more of a crafted world. It will land somewhere between Fallout, Prey and Dishonored, if you wanted to try to pinpoint it." 
</p>
<p>
The game's world won't have any discrete exploration, combat or town areas; it'll be a steadily unrolling sandbox that supports a multitude of methods, nice and nasty. Unlike Weird West, it won't have any loading transitions between areas. Definitely don't call it an open world, though. "It's not like Weird West, it's more of an evolution of Prey, if we were to look at the game structure," Colantonio notes. "Prey, technically it would be considered continuous, some people would say 'no, it's an open world'. The reason we don't want to say open world is that it comes with expectations that it's going to be gigantic - you know, it takes six months to ride a horse from A to B - which is not at all what we do. But technically, it's an open world in the sense that it's so continuous, you can go anywhere, there's no loading, etcetera." 
</p>
<p>
Colantonio and Roby's old outfit Arkane isn't in a great place, at present. Parent company Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">recently shut down Prey's original creators, Arkane Austin</a>, following a poor reception for the studio's vampire shooter Redfall (and more importantly, following Microsoft's $68.7 billion splurge on the acquisition of Activision Blizzard). Arkane Lyon have survived these "strategic repositionings", and are working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arkane-release-new-marvels-blade-concept-artworks-hinting-at-missions-combat-and-levels#comments">a new immersive sim featuring Marvel's vampire hero Blade</a>. The future of the Dishonored series - which technically includes spy-fi extravaganza Deathloop, a game set in the same universe - remains ambiguous, though <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-is-the-only-exciting-thing-on-bethesdas-leaked-5-year-plan-and-im-worried">the words "Dishonored 3" appear on a leaked Microsoft planning document from 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>
Wolfeye have long traded on their Arkane associations for publicity. But in the wake of Microsoft's reductions, they increasingly resemble an Arkane rescue mission, clawing back that legacy of immersive sim design from Bethesda and Microsoft. According to Roby, the studio has "essentially doubled" in size since the release of Weird West, and they've hired a lot of former colleagues from Arkane Lyon and Austin, these being people "who know already the value of the kind of game we're doing from a design standpoint, and from a pure experience standpoint". 
</p>
<p>
Wolfeye has become the "alt-Arkane," suggests Colantonio in closing. "I think it's the spirit of Arkane, for sure, but Wolfeye is its own company. We do have so many people from Arkane at this point that it does feel like being at Arkane prior to being acquired. So yes, it's an unleashed Arkane. It's a free Arkane."</p>

Roblox has responded to news the government of Türkiye has banned access to the platform in order to "ensure the protection of our children".
</p>
<p>
News of the ban was shared yesterday by the country's Minister of Justice Yılmaz Tunç in a lengthy statement on social media site X.
</p>
<p>
Tunç didn't provide a specific reason for the ban beyond it being "due to the content that could lead to the exploitation of children" and that the country is "obliged to take the necessary measures to ensure the protection of our children".

<p>

As <a href="https://www.turkiyetoday.com/turkiye/roblox-banned-in-turkiye-following-nationwide-instagram-block-37398/">Türkiye Today</a> reports, the ban was primarily motivated by reports of inappropriate sexual content on Roblox and exploitation of children.

</p>
<p>"We've spent almost 20 years making Roblox one of the safest online platforms for our users, particularly the youngest, and ensuring the safety of our users is at the core of everything we do," said a Roblox spokesperson in a statement to Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"We respect the laws and regulations in countries where we operate and share local lawmakers' commitment to children. We look forward to working together to ensure Roblox is back online in Türkiye as soon as possible."</p>
<p>
The ban arrives five days after Instagram was similarly banned, due to accusations from a senior aide to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of censorship of posts related to the death of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh. "We will continue to defend freedom of expression against platforms that serve global exploitation and injustice," said Fahrettin Altun, head of the Presidency's Directorate of Communications.
</p>
<p>
The banning of both platforms has fuelled debates on government control over online content.

            <p>As <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1820891833028727212">teased</a> earlier this week, Arkane founder Raphael Colantonio has today unveiled the first details of his next game at WolfEye Studios.</p>
<p>While the game's name is still under wraps, this new project is a first-person action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that's set in an alternate America in the 1900s, marking a shift in time and perspective from the top-down, isometric sandbox towns of WolfEye's debut game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/weird-west">Weird West</a>.</p>
<p>As the studio also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-co-founder-teases-sci-fi-rpg-as-next-game">previously teased</a>, the new game's visuals will be grounded in a retro sci-fi aesthetic - and if the first three in-game screenshots didn't already give it away, Colantonio (who's creative director for this new game) and executive producer Julien Roby tell me over a video call that both its gameplay and art direction are intended to be "something like Fallout meets Dishonored".</p>

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>"That's where we want to be, we want to be in that space," Colantonio tells me. "If there is such a thing as a continuum between Fallout and Dishonored, I would say Prey is somewhere in the middle because it's already more RPG than Dishonored, and this new game is somewhere closer to Fallout, as far as the RPG-ness goes."</p>
<p>That means you can expect "a lot of [quest objectives] such as 'investigate about this thing, infiltrate that building'," Colantonio explains, "but with any approach you want." This can range from "very, very direct" approaches, perhaps utilizing the new weapon mods WolfEye are making for this game, or "more indirect" methods, such as talking your way in or out of a scenario with the game's speech options. All classic RPG fare, in other words, which Colantonio and Roby hope will "add even more layers of possibilities [to the game], which is really what we've always been about."</p>
<p>"I love personally RPGs that fall back on their feet when you shoot them between the eyes, for example," Colantonio says. "Games from Obsidian are pretty good at that, and that's that zone that we're hitting in this game."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Wolfeye---Final_Canyon.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>WolfEye Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The world will be "continuous", too, allowing players to "go anywhere" and "kill anyone you want", Colantonio adds. He doesn't ever mention the words 'open world', mind, but I get the feeling it will at least be more connected than the discrete locations of Weird West, for example.</p>
<p>Alas, WolfEye isn't ready to reveal any details about the citing event that set this alternate timeline in motion yet either - only that "something happened in America," Colantonio says, "and the player is going to find this out as they play. It's going to be one of the reveals in the development of the plot."</p>
<p>As for what part of America the game will take place in, there are a couple of hints we can glean from those initial screenshots WolfEye has released. It still looks as though there will be a certain Wild West-ness about it, judging by the canyons and rocky landscapes, and when I put this to Colantonio, he confirms that, "Yes, of course, you can recognise the views and the vistas. It's in that area, and in that location."</p>
<p>Crucially, though, the game won't be drawing from traditional Western tropes. "I think the big distinction we're making here is, as far as genre literature goes, this is more like sci-fi literature than it is Wild West or whatever," he says. "I think the Western is a genre of literature that people associate with certain types of scenarios like revenge or duels in the streets. We don't have any of that."</p>
<p>Rather, it's more of a visual backdrop "where something so crazy has happened that there's not much left of it," he adds, though he does tease that at least some form of culture has managed to evolve in the intervening 20-30 years since that event in the game, "but it's already a different thing," he clarifies. "If you really wanted to pinpoint it, it would be like some sort of, I don't know, steampunk outtake 1900s."</p>

</figure>
<p>It's an ambitious step-up for this entirely remote team, but throughout our conversation, Colantonio and Roby are both keen to emphasise how many former Arkane developers are now working at WolfEye - including Prey's lead visual designer and Dishonored level artist Emmanuel Petit, who's now the art director on this new project. They have also been able to hire a handful of Arkane Austin developers following that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-blizzard-boss-mike-ybarra-defends-xboxs-phil-spencer-following-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-closures">studio's closure</a> earlier in the year, though Colantonio states that "we had done most of our growth before" over the last couple of years. Still, working with so many former colleagues from across their respective careers "makes things a lot easier," says Roby, and Colantonio agrees. "It's the same formation of people [from Prey and Dishonored] who are now with us, so we already know what we're doing," he says.</p>
<p>That said, the studio's headcount still only numbers between 55-60 people, according to Roby, and the challenge will be "trying to keep the game within a scope that allows for the team to be that size and not too much beyond," he says. "Beyond that size is where things start to change the way you actually work, and we'd like to keep that sense of, 'Hey, everyone has a big impact on the game and a big enough say on what they're doing'."</p>
<p>As for when we might next hear more details about WolfEye's new game, it likely won't be until next year, when WolfEye are planning to run a private alpha for it (<a href="http://www.wolfeye-studios.com/signup">sign-ups for which are available now</a>).</p>
<p>"We're still discussing the details for it," Roby says, "but whatever we call it, we want to make sure that before we release the game, we get the community involved." The studio put on a similar test for Weird West, but Roby admits that they did it "way too late before release and we didn't really have time to act on the most major feedback". Hence the desire to bring in players earlier this time, so they can better act on any potential problems.</p>
<p>With pre-production now complete, WolfEye will now be moving into full production while they search for a publishing partner.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-new-details-on-bungie-restructuring-plan/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20240807/sA7GHnQS/202503_1q_02_en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">briefing video</a>, Sony President, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki offered clarifying statements about its Bungie restructuring plans.</p>



<p>Totoki said that the purpose of the restructure is “cost restructure and portfolio optimization.” They also said that Bungie’s back office functions “should be integrated with the studio of SIE.”</p>



<p>Totoki further mentioned plans to concentrate Bungie’s head count and resources on Destiny 2 and live-service title Marathon. They said there would be “constant resources there.” However, “other title development” will instead move to PlayStation studios. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Rounding out the briefing’s mention of Bungie, Totoki broadly said that the organizational structure will also be changed. There are plans to “optimize the overall studio structure.”</p>



<p>The briefing follows Bungie’s extensive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-announces-major-layoffs-and-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs and restructuring</a>, which Bungie announced last week. It affected over 200 employees at Bungie, including about 17% of its workforce. Bungie also moved some of its employees to Sony as part of the restructuring.</p>



<p>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons cited “rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions.” They also called it a “difficult and painful day, especially for our departing colleagues.”</p>



<p>In June 2024, Bungie announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-announces-destiny-2-codename-frontiers-is-coming-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2 Codename Frontiers</a> is coming in 2025, though there isn’t a concrete release date yet. It was accompanied by teasers for upcoming Year 10 episodes. These plans should remain unchanged, given Sony’s new briefing.</p>

<p>Following the IOC’s announcement regarding esports joining the Olympics, Verizon has decided to provide access to competitive video games all across the US. The popular phone and data company has officially announced a high school esports league that will be free to all students.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-verizon-announces-first-ever-free-scholastic-high-school-esports-league">Verizon Announces First Ever Free Scholastic High School Esports League</h2>



<p>With esports growing at an alarming rate, many schools in the US have been scrambling to develop an esports program. What was originally just considered a LAN club, is now an actual program that could award kids with college scholarships, as collegiate esports continues to thrive.</p>



<p>Verizon has been focused on providing students with immersive learning content across the US. Now, though, the company is taking it one step further and providing kids with access to esports.</p>



<p>Schools that choose to participate will receive free coaching guidance from esports professionals to help prepare them for the yearly esports seasons.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Verizon Innovative Learning Esports League officially opens for registration today (August 8). Schools can now sign up to hop on board with the program.</p>



<p>The league’s season will run from September 23, 2024, to December 13, 2024. The league is in partnership with the nonprofit, Games For Change, which is helping to provide the coaching guidance.</p>







<h3 id="h-about-verizon-innovative-learning">About Verizon Innovative Learning</h3>



<p>Verizon is not only dedicated to giving students access to free esports across the country but also looking to add new and immersive ways for kids to learn in the classroom. Their dedication ranges from kindergarten to seniors in high school, as they are constantly giving new tech-driven content to teachers.</p>



<p>Not only are they focusing on esports, but also pushing gaming and game designing into classrooms. This helps to further the notion that gaming is a great career.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hopefully, Verizon’s mission will be successful and we see a new wave of gamers come into the spotlight from it.</p>

That’s just the case with this custom <strong>Scuf Instinct Pro</strong> controller in a black tiger camo finish, which is on a clearance sale at <a href="https://howl.me/cmP1ZZtANRW">Best Buy</a> for $155.99 ($84 off).</p><p>The Instinct Pro is an excellent step-up controller over the standard Xbox gamepad, as it’s nearly the same great controller with some nice upgrades. It supports the wireless connectivity built into Xbox Series X / S consoles and of course can be used on PC — just like the stock controller — but it also features four rear paddle buttons built into the chassis of the gamepad and lockouts for the shoulder buttons that give them a mouse-click hair trigger feel.</p><p>What you’re not getting with the Scuf is Hall effect sticks, so it’s possible the right or left analog stick may drift over time after many hours of use, but it’s frankly the same risk you run with Microsoft’s similarly priced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Elite Series 2</a> controller. There have been more drift-proof controllers slowly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911052/gamesir-t4-cyclone-pro-wireless-controller-hall-effect-joysticks">cropping up over time from third parties</a>, but outside of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/30/23981792/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-xbox-pc-wireless-controller-antidrift-announcement-price">few exceptions</a>, most are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/18/23799149/gamesir-g7-se-xbox-windows-hall-effect-drift-free-controller-price">wired only</a>.</p><div><p>Scuf’s Instinct Pro is its top-tier controller for Xbox consoles and PC. It is the only third-party wireless option around, and for its very high price, you get rubberized grips, built-in mappable rear paddle buttons, hair-trigger locks, swappable sticks, and user-configurable cosmetics.</p></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Spaceship likers, come hither. Long-running <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space sim</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elite-dangerous">Elite Dangerous</a> has just unloaded a new interstellar vessel into its universe, and she's a beaut. The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/359320/view/4363510595754651475">say the developers</a>. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.</p>

<p>Ah, that was good. No action. No shooting aliens. No drama. Just a man and his space truck on the open space road, occasionally accompanied by the presence of large letters. LOAD MORE. God, yes. DELIVER FIRST. Maybe I will!</p>
<p>As for the ship's design, some fans have playfully made fun of the fact that the ship looks a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a>'s ubiquitous mining ship, <a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Venture">the Venture</a>, simply flipped upside down and given a few slinky angles. And while some similarities do exist, it is not as close in design terms as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a>'s equivalent space truck, <a href="https://starcitizen.tools/Vulture">the Vulture</a>. Whatever the inspirational source, it looks good in my book. I will not complain about the big yellow starmobile.</p>
<p>But some players might, as it currently costs about £10 in real-world money (via the special in-game currency, Arx). It's not the first time Frontier has charged for a spaceship - the <a href="https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Python_Mk_II">Python Mk II</a> came out in May for the same price, also locked behind that special currency. Previous to that, players saw all spaceships added to the game as free updates. Any irritation about this might now be soothed, however, seeing as that Python MK II was made buyable with normal in-game credits yesterday. The same staggered release is planned for the trucker's delight pictured above. In November it'll be on the "open market" for all players. </p>
<p>Ship manufacturing in Elite Dangerous has been slow in recent years. This year has seen the first new ships since 2018. Which helps to explain some of the frustration players may feel when they get excited about this asteroid miner's dreamboat, only to realise it costs money now. For me, I'm satisfied just to watch the advert and soak up the atmosphere of blue collar space work reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/blasphemous-devs-reveal-cryptic-teaser-for-fall-2024-content/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/BlasphemousGame/status/1821516844248776904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, the official Blasphemous account revealed a mysterious new teaser for some kind of content coming in Fall 2024.</p>



<p>The teaser doesn’t feature any gameplay, instead featuring the brief cinematic of a single cryptic object. This leaves fans to speculate on its purpose, with many comparing it to the Mea Culpa and how that could tie into the existing lore.</p>



<p>The post says that “the bells toll again, Penitent One,” and that “your patience has been a virtue, but you need not wait for much longer.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This may hint at potential DLC for Blasphemous 2, possibly adding new gameplay and features. Developer The Game Kitchen first launched Blasphemous 2 in August 2023. </p>



<p>So, it’s fitting to announce something new this month, and there has been enough room for the developers to work on fresh content. </p>



<p>Blasphemous: Stir of Dawn, the first major DLC for the original game, released about a year after Blasphemous. </p>



<p>That DLC introduced a variety of new content, including new enemies, bosses, areas, and features. It also added New Game+, a highly requested feature. Stir of Dawn was also a free update for all players. </p>



<p>Blasphemous 2 could receive similar DLC in Fall 2024, but the teaser doesn’t reveal much. At this time, The Game Kitchen did not confirm anything concrete except the release window.</p>

                <p>A new patch went live for Destiny 2 this week, and alongside the usual balance changes, a "generous" buff to the drop rate of Exotic class items had fans excited. <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny_2_update_805" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Bungie</a>, the chances for acquiring Exotic class items from chests found in the Overthrow activity have been adjusted.

		<p>The first reviews for the Borderlands movie have dropped, and critics have not held back in their critiques of this latest video game adaptation, describing it as “<a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/borderlands/">a&nbsp;botched Guardians wannabe</a>” and that it comes with “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/borderlands-movie-review-b2592670.html">wildly miscast actors and an impenetrable script</a>“.</p>
<p>Borderlands releases in cinemas this week, from today (8th August) in the UK and from tomorrow (9th August) in the US.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands (2024) Final Trailer – Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jack Black" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Icnysn53neU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s just a few dissenting voices in these early critic reviews, which has left the film with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/borderlands/critic-reviews/">a Metacritic rating of just 33</a>, and it seems that any real positivity stems from Cate Blanchett’s performance as Lillith. “Blanchett knows exactly what movie she’s in, and she seems to be having the time of her life,” said <a href="https://screenrant.com/borderlands-movie-review/">ScreenRant</a> on the way to the 7/10 highest score, while <a href="https://collider.com/borderlands-movie-review/">Collider</a> gave it a 5/10 and called it “a fun ride, but a bloated cast and breakneck pacing don’t allow it to reach its full potential.”</p>
<p>And it’s the potential that other critics felt let down by. <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-eli-roth-1236098894/">Variety</a> cited the film’s predictability and a “tamer-than-expected take” on the game series,&nbsp;<a href="https://bleedingcool.com/movies/borderlands-review-imax-action-karen/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">BleedingCool</a> said there are “No emotional depths, stakes, or convoluted plot worth speaking of,” and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-movie-review-generic-and-disposable/1900-6418265/">GameSpot</a> said, “that’s what happens sometimes when a movie spends four years in post-production being repeatedly reworked–over time, everything gets sanded down into nothingness.”</p>

<p>There’s plenty more reviews out there, but almost all of them lay into the long-in-production film.</p>
<p>The film was in development for a good few years and was announced way a back in 2015. Eli Roth was in the director’s chair for the Borderlands movie, his filmography includes the likes of Cabin Fever, the Hostel films, The Green Inferno, Death Wish, and The House with a Clock in its Walls.&nbsp;The film was completed some time ago, but Tim Mller was brought on board to reshoot some scenes.</p>
<p>The cast includes Jamie Lee Curtis as Tannis, Cate Blanchett as Lilith, Ariana Greenblatt as Tiny Tina, Jack Black as Claptrap, Kevin Hart as Roland, Edgar Ramirez as Deukalian Atlas, the Founder and CEO of the Atlas Corporation, and Florian Munteanu as Krieg.</p>

Results exceeded expectations, with the highest numbers having been driven by the launch of Dungeon &amp; Fighter Mobile in China. </p>



<p>While The Finals remains a solid pillar for Nexon, the report stated that ‘ongoing adjustments’ are being made to improve player retention, which has been an issue in the game for some time.</p>



<p>Soon, Nexon and Embark Studios will bring The Finals to China, via Tencent. This will be through a customised version of the game that’s built to accommodate a Chinese audience. Recently, Ubisoft confirmed that both Rainbow Six Siege and Rainbow Six Mobile were clear to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-china/">deployed officially in China</a>, also through a partnership with Tencent.</p>



<p>When it’s eventually released, ARC Raiders will also make an appearance in China. This third-person extraction shooter has a solid premise but not too much of it has been seen aside from some leaked playtest footage.</p>
