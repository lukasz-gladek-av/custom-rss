            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Bethesda Game Studios announced that the Fallout Day 2025 broadcast would be streamed live on October 23, 2025, at 1 PM Eastern Time via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a>, and Steam. Bethesda said fans can tune in to learn new information and announcements about 'existing Fallout games, community celebrations, and upcoming fan events'. October 23 is no random date: it's when the two-hour-long nuclear exchange between the United States and China led to the post-nuclear setting of Fallout.</p>



<p>When Bethesda mentions existing games, the mind immediately goes to Fallout 76, since it's the only franchise game that gets regular updates. However, Fallout 76 just got a major reveal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-qa-bringing-ghoul-tv-show-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the deep dive of the Burning Springs update</a>. In December, Bethesda Game Studios will release a major land expansion, bringing Fallout players to Ohio for the first time in the franchise. The new region draws heavily on Fallout 3 and New Vegas aesthetics, aiming to recapture the feel of a harsh, depraved wasteland seen in those games. </p>



<p>Then there's the introduction of The Ghoul, the character played by Walton Goggins in the TV show, who is coming to the game and will introduce the bounty hunting feature with tiered contracts (grunt and head hunts). Bethesda hopes this will create ongoing, repeatable content that encourages both solo and cooperative play. The randomization of contract locations and the public event nature of head hunts foster community interaction and provide a robust source of rewards, addressing players’ desires for challenging but rewarding activities. </p>



<p>There might be some additional tidbits about the Burning Springs update to be shared in the upcoming Fallout Day broadcast, but by and large, the reveal for Fallout 76 already happened. As such, franchise fans are already hoping to hear something about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-3-oblivion-remasters-xbox-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-rumored Fallout 3 remaster</a>, as that might fall under 'existing Fallout games'. Of course, it's always possible that Bethesda has just found a new platform to launch Fallout 4 on, like the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/blink-video-doorbell-is-almost-free-amazon-offloads-its-own-brand-at-a-loss-2000632081</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blink-video-doorbell-is-almost-free-amazon-offloads-its-own-brand-at-a-loss.1319956/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon has made serious moves into home security with its <em>Ring</em> and <em>Blink</em> brands and gives homeowners accessible ways to monitor their properties without professional installation. If you want a doorbell camera that’s effective, affordable and lets you keep tabs on everything happening at your front door, <strong>Blink is the way to go</strong>. The<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/"> newest model of the Blink video doorbell just hit a record low price of $34 (down from $69) for Prime Big Deal Day</a>, and this deal ends tonight. It’s <strong>exclusively available to Prime members</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Years’ Worth of Battery Life Redefines Everything</h2>
<p>The larger pain point with doorbell cameras is often the power issue: Hardwired versions demand electrical work that the average person would like to do without, and battery-powered versions require charging every few weeks. The <strong>Blink video doorbell eliminates this nuisance with a two-year battery life on two AA lithium batteries</strong>. Consider that: you install it once and don’t mess with it again until the year 2027. No climbing ladders to haul it down to charge, no panic should it die on vacation, no maintenance woes.</p>



<p>The camera provides a <strong>vertical field of view that captures people from head to toe</strong>&nbsp;which matters more than you might think. Standard doorbell cameras often cut off packages left on the ground or miss the tops of tall visitors’ heads. This full-body perspective means you see delivery drivers placing packages, kids trick-or-treating, or anyone approaching your door in complete context. The 1<strong>080p HD resolution delivers clear images</strong> during daylight, and infrared night vision switches on automatically after sunset to maintain visibility in complete darkness.</p>
<p>The integrated Sync Module Core (see picture above) is the control center and connects your doorbell to the home’s Wi-Fi network and facilitates all communication between the doorbell and the phone version of the Blink app. It is <strong>simple to plug the module into a standard outlet somewhere in your home</strong> and get the doorbell connected to the phone. Should the button be pressed or motion be detected, the event is captured by the module, then triggers an instant notification on the device.</p>



<p>Detection areas let you decide what areas will cause recording: If the doorbell is pointing at the busy street, then you can mask that section off so cars passing by don’t jam your phone with unimportant notifications. Focus the detection zone on your sidewalk and porch, then receive notifications for activity that is relevant. <strong>You can customize the sensitivity via the app</strong>&nbsp;which gives you the freedom to decide just how much movement will trigger a recording.</p>
<p>The doorbell is controllable via Alexa voice control and can be integrated with other compatible Alexa devices. Ask Alexa to display your front door and the feed is shown on Echo Show devices around your house.</p>
<p>At just $34, that is a 50% off deal and the lowest price on this model ever. Make sure you don’t miss it before it runs out of stock.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re deep into Prime Big Deals Days now — Amazon’s two-day sales even where you can save a bunch of cash on products across every category. It’s a great time to pick up that espresso maker you’ve been eyeing or that bidet your brother have been trying to convince you to get for months. Something you might have been waiting on for a discount is one of those TV backlights. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4644/">Good news, the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 is one of the Prime Big Deals this week and you can save as much as 46%.</a></p>
<p>There are three different sizes to match however big your TV is. The 11.8-foot light strip is sized for TVs between 55 inches and 65 inches. The 16.4-foot light strip is made for TVs between 75 inches and 85 inches. Then the 21-foot light strip is for your mega mondo-sized TVs at 98 to 100 inches.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4644/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>For shorthand, we’ll call them small, medium, and large. The small set normally priced at $140 has come down to $75. The medium dropped from $170 to an even $100. And then the big boy large light strip is down from $220 to just $150.</p>

<h2>Synchronize Color</h2>
<p>The way the Govee light strips work is a camera sensor is placed on the top of your TV. This model actually has a dual-camera sensor to more accurately capture the color on screen. It then takes that color and assigns them around the light strip which you’ve installed behind your TV around the edge. Each light strip has 60 LEDs per meter and they glow matching the color on screen as if to extend your viewing across the wall and room.</p>



<p>You can customize how your Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 looks. Using the app, manually adjust the saturation of the lighting effects to either be super vibrant or more subtle. Go with whichever fits the vibe of what you’re watching. It works well with movies, shows, or even video games. Casting the vibrant colors of each new zone you come across in <em>Hollow Knight</em>: Silksong can dramatically enhance your experience.</p>
<p>Combine the backlight LED with other Govee products such as wall or corner lamps. Have all the lights in your home synchronize to what’s on screen, bathing you and your living room in colorful light.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4644/">Get your set of the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 on sale today for as low as just $75.</a> Discount will be for as much as 46% at least through Prime Big Deals Day.</p>

            <p>
How about a fresh look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starseeker-astroneer-expeditions">Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions</a>, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-call-starseeker-astroneer-expeditions-a-sequel-the-original-still-has-years-of-updates-ahead">not-an-Astroneer-sequel</a> from System Era? The developer revealed an extended look at gameplay yesterday, detailing what it is you'll be doing exactly. As has already been established, it's an online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> game, one of those "friendslop" kind of games you'll see people be mean about on Ditter and TikTok comments. To be specific, you can play it solo, or with three of your friends, but there are elements that draw on other players (more on that in a bit).
</p>
<p>
Like a lot of These Kinds Of Games (we really should agree on a name for them at this point), to start off you'll have to prepare for the challenge ahead. You do this on the titular S.S. Starseeker, a big ole ship filled with a bunch of other cutely designed also titularly titled Astroneers. Here, you'll buy and craft different tools and items to bring with you, and decide what it is you want to take with you on expeditions. That might be something useful, or, if you're that kind of person who just likes to goof around while everyone else actually has fun playing the game, you could bring a beach ball instead.

<p>
Expeditions! Structurally these sound pretty par for the course. You land on a planet, you go do a mission or a task or somesuch, and you get back before your oxygen runs out. Along the way there might be alien creatures to do battle with, bits of loot to plunder, that sort of thing.
</p><p>
The Astroneery element of it all is that you have a terrain tool that you can modify in different ways. At its base you just remove terrain, but different nozzles can make it shoot out water, build up the land, launch aliens or yourself into the sky, etc.
</p>
<p>
There's no procedural generation to be found on the planets you visit either, the main one the game is launching with, Tefra, was made by hand, so you'll be able to revisit particular locations from expedition to expedition. As you progress, you'll also unlock more landing zones to other parts of the planet, which subsequently have tougher challenges to face.
</p>
<p>
These challenges might include something simple like repairing some equipment, or bringing up a receiver to a high point on the map. Some of them might even encourage you to work with other groups of players to complete them, a point I quite like - there's not enough online games about collaboration out there!
</p>
<p>
No exact release date just yet, but Starseeker: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/astroneer">Astroneer</a> Expeditions is due out some time in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft has announced the the first list of games being added to Xbox Game Pass <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-price-subscription-renewal-delay-xbox-2000632625">since the service’s unpopular price hike news rolled out last week</a>. It includes <em>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures – Merry &amp; Mischievous Edition</em>, the update to a 2023 co-op holiday adventure that I’m sure fans have been waiting for.</p> <p>The “festive platformer” has you searching for collectibles, snowboarding down Mount Crumpit, and even parachuting through Whoville. Apparently that was not enough to impress many of the only 27 people who reviewed the $40 Steam version. “This game is BAD!” wrote one. “Quite terrible all things considered,” wrote another. “The original game from the 90’s was a world play style game with objectives and missions…this is a game for a 5 year old.”</p>

 <p>Don’t let that completely dissuade you from checking it out though! Here’s everything coming to the various, newly priced tiers of Game Pass in October 2025:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><em>Supermarket Simulator&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 8</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Baldur’s Gate and Baldur’s Gate II: Enhanced Editions</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;(PC) – October 9</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>The Casting of Frank Stone </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 14</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Ball x Pit </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 15</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 15</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Eternal Strands </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 15</strong><br> Now with Game Pass Premium</li> <li><strong><em>He Is Coming&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>(Game Preview)</strong><strong>&nbsp;(PC) – October 15</strong><br> Now with Game Pass Premium</li> <li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 15</strong><br> Now with Game Pass Premium</li> <li><strong><em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>(PC) – October 16</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Keeper </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 17</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Evil West </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 21</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 21</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>That is 12 games in total, and some of them are shaping up to be quite good, especially <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>. But it’s also worth noting that only three of these games require Game Pass Ultimate. The rest are all available with Game Pass Premium or Game Pass PC. This is the last batch hitting before the new $30-a-month price hits most Ultimate subscribers on November 4, so while Microsoft might be trying to win players over with a few surprises in November, this month is mostly what we expected it to be.</p> <p>The three games leaving Game Pass on October 15 are <em>Cocoon</em>, <em>Core Keeper</em>, and <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.</em> <em>Cocoon</em> in particular is an outstanding puzzle adventure you can finish in just a couple of sittings. If you haven’t given it a try or already beaten it, I highly recommend checking it out in the next week before it’s gone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Prime Day deals are going in full swing, making it a great time to invest in a gaming monitor. If you’ve been looking for something feature-packed at a more approachable price, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4641/">we’ve just spotted the 27-inch LG UltraGear QHD gaming monitor going for $297 on Amazon, which is a 41% discount off its regular price.</a></p>
<p>This is a significant drop, but it’s only limited to Prime users at the moment. Non-Prime users can snag it up for $349, which is also a nice $151 off. Prime members also enjoy free delivery, but just be sure to get your orders in soon. The retailer has marked it as a limited-time deal, and we won’t be surprised if it expires soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4641/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Color Accuracy on a Massive Screen</h2>
<p>The 27-inch screen size is quite spacious, offering a decent 2560×1440 QHD resolution. The IPS panel offers vibrant colors, exceptional contrast, and impressive detail – all of which come together to create an immersive gaming or streaming experience. It also supports VESA DisplayHDR 400 and covers up to 95% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, so you can expect deeper blacks and more visual accuracy. There’s an ultra-fast 1ms (GtG) response time, paired with a 240Hz refresh rate to keep slowdowns and lags at bay. Racing past opponents or engaging in competitive matches where every second counts; this monitor won’t disappoint.</p>



<p>It’s officially G-SYNC Compatible and also supports AMD FreeSync Premium. You can choose a GPU without worrying about screen tearing or stutter. Connectivity options are plenty – HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, and a 4-pole headphone out that supports DTS Headphone:X. The stand is also adjustable, so you can play around with tilt and height to get the right viewing angle for yourself. This is also great for setups that multiple people use. You don’t really have to settle for an awkward angle while trying to make it work for you.</p>
<p>LG also includes an Enhanced Gaming GUI that lets you choose between display presets like Gamer, FPS, or RTS modes for an even better view.</p>
<p>All in all, this deal gets you an impressive, high-resolution gaming monitor for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4641/">If you’re a Prime member, you can get it for under $300. Non-prime members are in luck, too, since they can grab one for $349, which is still a good discount on a model this packed.</a> It’s a limited-time discount, so if you’ve been thinking of making the upgrade, we recommend grabbing it as soon as you can.</p>

                <p>Fans of the Dead Space series have expressed strong dissatisfaction over the pricing of a new crossover bundle in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-new-skate-game-in-15-years-is-out-now-and-its-free/1100-6534774/" data-ref-id="1100-6534774">EA's free-to-play title, Skate, currently in early access</a>. The bundle features a cardboard-style Isaac Clarke costume, a themed skateboard, the Necro Stomp emote, and several stickers. The bundle is priced at 3,350 San Van Bucks, the game's virtual currency, but the pricing structure forces players to spend a minimum of $35 to acquire the necessary in-game funds. While a USG Ishimura T-shirt is available for free, the cost of the full bundle has drawn criticism for being excessive.</p><p>While this isn't the first collab between Dead Space and Skate, as there was a free <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-3/cheats/">Isaac Clarke skin in Skate 3</a>, the new bundle has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadSpace/comments/1o0usq9/the_state_of_dead_space/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">continued the debate over microtransaction practices</a>. Some players drew comparisons between the original Skate 3 unlockable and this new version, pointing out that when the costume was free, it felt more like a fun Easter egg than a monetized item. However, others have suggested the new costume's exaggerated cardboard look may be intentional, aiming for a Halloween costume aesthetic rather than a direct replica of Isaac Clarke's iconic armor. Even so, the $35 price tag remains a sore point. </p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/BlackoutTV_/status/1975646767518536028" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>On the left is Isaac Clarke from Dead Space in Skate 3.

One Reddit user offered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1o19akx/skate_is_charging_40_for_a_terrible_dead_space/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a more nuanced view</a> of the game's direction: "On the one hand, I do get it. I would definitely have preferred this game to be a traditional, single-player Skate game where everything is included in the purchase price. On the other hand, I've been playing and loving the new Skate. You do get tons of cosmetics for free if the virtual dress-up part of the game is your bag. The biggest downside is that you only get a handful of items for free that are from real skating brands."</p><p>The user went on to say they paid $25 for the Supporter Pack and felt the overall value was strong, citing access to branded items and a surprisingly generous season pass system. "A traditional Skate was never going to happen these days, so if it took being F2P to get made, I'd rather have this than nothing, as there is a lack of good skating games these days."</p><p>Reactions online have reflected a mix of disappointment and cynicism. "Let's hope that one day Dead Space will reach a state as an IP that it isn’t solely relegated to just being a skin in a mediocre always-online game to boost microtransactions," another Redditor wrote.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Rodrigues_520/status/1975629911059800416" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Another fan on Twitter</a> commented, "You can buy three Dead Space games with that money (and probably three Skate games)." While some appreciate the ongoing crossover between two beloved EA properties, many argue that the current execution--and its pricing--detract from what could have been a celebratory moment for both franchises.</p><p>Still, the pricing has stirred frustration among Dead Space fans in particular, many of whom are disheartened by the franchise's uncertain future. Despite the critical success of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-space-remake-review-hits-the-marker/1900-6418021/" data-ref-id="1900-6418021">2023 Dead Space remake,</a> EA has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-no-longer-working-on-dead-space-2-remake-insider-claims/1100-6522552/" data-ref-id="1100-6522552">reportedly shelved plans for a Dead Space 2 remake</a> and a potential Dead Space 4, reassigning <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-iron-man-developer-now-working-on-battlefield-too/1100-6522500/" data-ref-id="1100-6522500">developer Motive to the Battlefield franchise</a>.

			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn has been significantly improved on Nintendo Switch 2 by a new patch that went live this week.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/SMetaldave64">a new report shared on X by SuperMetalDave64</a>, the 1.4 update introduces significant visual improvements, including improved texture quality, LOD draw distance, and lighting and fog with less light bleed. Even at a glance, these visual improvements are easily spottable and bring the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game closer to the other console versions of the survival horror game developed by Bloober Team.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The newest update 1.4 to Cronos: The New Dawn on Switch 2 is the biggest yet for graphical improvements:</p><p>-Textures Noticeably Improved<br>-LOD Draw Distance Improved<br>-Lighting/Fog Improved (less light bleed)<br>-Item Pick Up Highlight Effect Fixed <br>-Time Reversal Effect Fixed <a href="https://t.co/yxBq2SSrEG">pic.twitter.com/yxBq2SSrEG</a></p></div>— SuperMetalDave64 (@SMetaldave64) <a href="https://twitter.com/SMetaldave64/status/1975335969537860057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>SuperMetalDave64 also shared a quick comparison between the 1.3 version, the new 1.4 version and the max settings PC version of Cronos: The New Dawn. This side-by-side comparison clearly highlights the improvements which make the Switch 2 version a more palatable choice than at launch.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn leverages a lot on its visuals to create the haunting experience that defines the game, so the improvements introduced in the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game effectively improve the whole game on the system. You can learn more about how the game's atmosphere makes for one of Bloober Team's best games by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">my review</a>.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is now available worldwide on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Paradox has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III</em>&nbsp;expansion by the name of&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven</em>, and it's taking things in an Easterly direction later this month.</p>

<p><em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>is the latest major expansion for&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III</em>, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-expansion" rel="nofollow">April's&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe</em></a>, and it's introducing settings and campaigns that are entirely new to the series, so you're pretty much guaranteed never to have experienced them in a&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings&nbsp;</em>game before.</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>will bring "detailed representations of medieval China, Japan and Southeast Asia", and each new playable nation will bring brand new mechanics for you to grapple with.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crusader-kings-iii-all-under-heaven-expansion-menus.jpg?itok=vkcaKgDi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crusader-kings-iii-all-under-heaven-expansion-menus.jpg?itok=JQvEw3Le 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III&nbsp;</em>expansion is on its way later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Nations included as part of&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>include Japan, China, and a Southeast Asian empire, and you'll be able to enjoy new mechanics like the Celestial government system (which is unique to the Chinese civilization), Tributary Missions, and the Silk Road, the latter of which will allow you to prosper like never before.</p>

<p>Paradox is promising that this expansion will build on&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III&nbsp;</em>"on a monumental scale", so this isn't just a minor DLC pack; it's a full-throated expansion that should augment your experience with the game significantly.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III&nbsp;</em><em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>expansion right here.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III</em>, it's the third major entry in the&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings&nbsp;</em>series of grand strategy games, and like its predecessors, it tasks you with playing as a dynasty and attempting to survive the slings and arrows of Middle Ages politics.</p>

<p>It's proven pretty popular with players, too, racking up <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/crusader-kings-iii-passes-four-million-sales" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">four million sales</a> at last count despite being available on Game Pass (although that may not be the boon it once was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">thanks to recent changes</a>).</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/crusader-kings-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/crusader-kings-iii/9n7gg222gtth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <p>It's pointless me trying to sum this game up before you've clapped the lips of your eyes around it and taken a long drag. There's a trailer below. Do it now. Nod if you've done so. Right, that was Soul Injector Commando, a video game about shooting some semblance of everyday humanity into the bodies of the billionaires who're behind all of the world's problems.</p>

<p>You are the Soul Injector Commando, brought back from the dead by god themselves and sent to a bunker. All of the rich bellends have been handily lured there by an audacious fake meteorite prank worthy of enshrinement atop the YouTube algorithm until the end of time. You romp through, soul injecting until you can soul inject no more.  </p>
<p>There a nine levels to get through, filled with these malcontents who'll "become normal humans, get normal jobs, and be happy" if you succeed. At your disposal are a number of different weapons and upgrades, fully voice acted dialogue I assume will help you tell them the error of their ways, and time trials to try if you get through a bout of soul injecting and decide you'd like to try that level again.</p><p>And, to be frank, why wouldn't you? I can't see the likes of being assembled by a dino head with six arms, blasting your way through a supermarket while coins flick around and a big bowl guy waves a gloved hand in joy/resignation, or driving a tiny SUV with wings getting old quickly. Ditto splattering execs as a sentient golf ball, encountering what looks like an intergalactic skeletal drummer, or fighting whatever the head thing that pops up around the minute mark is. I've not even mentioned the two-headed butterfly knight creature.</p>
<p>To bring us back down to Earth a bit, Soul Injector Commando's the latest work of developer and artist <a href="https://www.jeremycouillard.com/">Jeremy Couillard</a>, who's got a well-honed knack for the surreal. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1014570/AlienAfterlife/">AlienAfterlife</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188760/JEF/">JEF</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1506080/Fuzz_Dungeon/">Fuzz Dungeon</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2164310/Escape_From_Lavender_Island/">Escape From Lavender Island</a>, and the snappily-named <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/789380/Sometimes_to_Deal_with_the_Difficulty_of_Being_Alive_I_Need_to_Believe_There_Is_a_Possibility_That_Life_Is_Not_Real/">Sometimes to Deal with the Difficulty of Being Alive, I Need to Believe There Is a Possibility That Life Is Not Real</a>. They're all now on my wishlist, and not solely because their art styles are 90% made up of things that my uncle's prog rock band would've given anything to put on their album covers.</p>
<p>Soul Injector Commando doesn't have a release date yet. It strikes me as the kind of game that'll just rock up instantly whenever the universe needs it to. Until then, you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3220370/Soul_Injector_Commando/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smartphone upgrades are usually expensive, especially if you’re looking to grab the latest model from top brands like Apple, Samsung, Google Pixel, etc. But that’s not the case today.</p>
<p>Now is a great time to pick a new smartphone for yourself or gift it to a loved one, thanks to Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/"> The retailer has slashed the price of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (256GB) down to $935 for Prime members and $950 for non-members.</a> That’s up to a massive 28% off. This model comes unlocked and even includes a 1-year U.S. warranty for peace of mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Features Samsung’s Highest-Resolution Ultra-Wide Lens</h2>
<p>In a slim, sleek build, you’re getting a whole bunch of useful features packed inside. There’s a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor that makes day-to-day usage both fast and smooth, plus 256GB of storage that lets you keep all your favorites close. This storage capacity sits between the 128GB and 512GB versions, and should be enough for most people, unless you want a beast to store large 4K videos or tons of games.</p>
<p>The 6.9-inch display pushes 2960 x 1440 resolution, so whether you’re streaming or browsing, visuals stay crips and vibrant. Navigation is made super easy with the included S-Pen. Of course, cameras deserve a special mention – it’s Samsung after all. You’ve got the brand’s highest-resolution ultra-wide lens here. The main 200MP wide-angle lens offers incredible clarity, with 2x optical quality zoom. Then there’s a 50MP ultra-wide lens, a 50MP telephoto lens with 5x and 10x optical zoom, and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. The 12MP front camera keeps your selfies detailed and gram-worthy. Galaxy AI takes your photos and videos to the next level by letting you make quick edits and even clean up background noise for better clips.</p>



<p>The powerful 5,000mAh battery is designed to last an entire day of use, so you won’t have to worry about juicing it up mid-day. Those using a Galaxy smartwatch can enjoy some helpful health and fitness features with the two devices are paired together. And since it’s an unlocked model, you can use it with any carrier of your choice, from T-Mobile to Verizon, Xfinity, and others.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/">On a regular day, this smartphone will cost you around $1,300 without any discounts. The current deal lets you grab it for under $950, and the offer applies to several color options.</a> It won’t last long since Prime Day wraps up tonight, so be sure to hurry.</p>

              <p>Whether you’re planning some spooky movie nights for Halloween or want to stream your favorite movies during the holidays, now’s a great time to upgrade your setup with a good streaming device. Roku makes some of our favorites, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4639/">we’ve just spotted the fan-favorite Roku Ultra going for $69 on Amazon.</a></p>
<p>This device typically retails for $100, so this $31 discount is a nice chance to snag it up for less. The deal is part of the Prime Big Deals Days happening right now. The event officially wraps up tonight, so we’re not expecting this offer to stick around for long. If this looks like something you’ve been wanting to invest in, we recommend acting fast to get your orders in sooner rather than later.</p>

<h2>Faster Streaming, Endless Content Options</h2>
<p>You’re not just getting a wealth of streaming options here. It’s also 30% faster than any other Roku player, so a more efficient experience is a given. The streamer supports 4K resolution, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos audio. Translation: Clear, detailed visuals, plus an audio that surrounds you. Whether you’re rewatching the forever classic Frankenstein with friends or starting a new TV series, dark and bright scenes come through with great vibrancy. It’s like bringing the cinema home without leaving your couch.</p>
<p>All your favorite streaming apps are going to be in one place (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Prime Video, Apple TV+, etc), with no shortage of content to view. There’s also a bunch of free stuff included that you can watch without paying for a subscription. Navigation is made easy with the included remote, which also features backlit buttons for easy usage in the dark. Hands-free voice control lets you just use your voice to manage everything, whether you want to lower the volume or pause the movie.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi 6 support reduces buffering, and there’s also a Bluetooth headphone mode for when you want a more private listening experience without disturbing the others around.</p>
<p>Altogether, it’s going to be a solid entertainment upgrade. You’re getting a ton of content from both streaming apps and live channels right there in one place. Plus, there’s no compromise on the visual or audio quality. The included voice remote makes it easy to browse through the wide selection, put on your favorite movies, and manage sound settings. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4639/">This deal brings the price down to less than $70, making it quite affordable to upgrade.</a></p>

              <p>Was Netflix’s<em> The Witcher</em> trying to give Cavill the boot as early as season 2? Did <em>Borderlands 4</em> cut one of the previous game’s most unpopular characters during development? And why is Atari making it harder to play an all-time classic on PC? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Craft breweries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/05/business/craft-breweries-close-sales-decline.html">are apparently on the decline</a>, the surest sign yet that the millennial zeitgeist is dying. This is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/05/business/craft-breweries-close-sales-decline.html">not a good thing</a>. I am also part of the problem, having traded my beloved Hazy IPAs at the <em>local</em> bar for cheap pounders from the grocery store.</p> <h2>The original <em>System Shock 2</em> is disappearing from stores thanks to the remaster</h2> <p>As spotted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-system-shock-2-will-be-delisted-from-steam-soon-then-lumped-in-with-the-more-expensive-remaster">by<em> Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a>, the 1999 sci-fi immersive sim classic will be delisted from PC storefronts on October 10. From that point forward, the only way to access it will be as part of the 25th anniversary remaster. The original game was just $10 to buy individually, but will cost $30 to access as part of the remaster. “Existing owners of <em>System Shock 2</em> (1999) will still be able to re-download and play it from their library, but new users will no longer be able to purchase <em>System Shock 2</em> (1999) as a standalone product,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/866570/view/542243728060844444?l=english">reads a notice</a> from publisher Atari.</p>

 <h2>Netflix deletes an important date in its report about Liam Hemsworth taking over for Henry Cavill in <em>The Witcher</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Either that's typo or that Henry Cavill shit was even messier than we think, because season 2 premiered in 2021 and Cavill didn't even announce he was leaving until the end of 2022 <a href="https://t.co/v2pHao4f5k">https://t.co/v2pHao4f5k</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1975657153420742935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The streaming company <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/liam-hemsworth-the-witcher-geralt-transformation">published its own profile</a> of Hemsworth alongside a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK9dU6JIroU"><em>Witcher</em> season 4 trailer</a>, but it included a very curious detail. According to the original version of the article, Hemsworth was first contacted about taking over the role back in 2020. That was between when season 1 and 2 aired, and two years before Cavill was officially replaced. This data point might add more fuel to the intrigue surrounding <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-netflix-henry-cavill-season-4-superman-why-1849723343">his messy departure</a>, but Netflix has now gone back and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/liam-hemsworth-the-witcher-geralt-transformation">deleted the date</a> from the profile altogether without any explanation. So now it’s&nbsp;<em>definitely</em> fueling more intrigue.</p>

 <h2>A controversial <em>Borderlands 3</em> character was seemingly cut from the sequel</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alright I guess we're gonna talk about it:</p> <p>AVA WAS CUT FROM BORDERLANDS 4</p> <p>There are numerous files related to her in the game, more specifically outlining that she was completely replaced by Amara late in development. This means yes, she was originally going to team up with… <a href="https://t.co/QF8ESnQp0p">https://t.co/QF8ESnQp0p</a> <a href="https://t.co/tBoVNJ8hpq">pic.twitter.com/tBoVNJ8hpq</a></p> <p>— EpicNNG (@EpicNNG) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1975222704094814674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Ava debuted in <em>Borderlands 3</em> as Vault Hunter Maya’s apprentice. Many players did not like her and were relieved she did not return in <em>Borderlands 4</em>. But <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975223565248299443">new datamining</a> of the files suggests that might have not always been the plan. File names suggest her role may have been replaced by the new Vault Hunter Amara, indicating Gearbox was paying very close attention to feedback from the last game when trying to nail the new one’s story, which it mostly does.</p>

The irony is that Sony spent much of the PS4 console generation and this one paying Activision extra to promote its platform as the best place to play <em>Call of Duty</em>, complete with exclusive early access and other perks. Microsoft has promised versions of new entries in the series would have platform parity and Sony, understandably, now has little interest in helping to promote its rival’s biggest blockbuster.</p>

 <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em> appears to be always-online</h2> <p>That’s according <a href="https://www.doesitplay.org/game/Battlefield%206/ps5/Base%20PS5?region=PEGI&amp;version=Standard">to Does It Play</a>, which reports that the game needs an internet connection to work, even for the main campaign, even though <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-jump-button-battlefield-6-disc-2000632532">the data appears to technically come the PS5 disc</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Details of the recent Discord data hack continue to paint a darker picture for the company and its users. According to Discord news source Discord Previews, the group taking responsibility for the compromise claims to have an enormous amount of user data, specifically millions of user photos.</p>



<p>In a post on social media <a href="https://x.com/DiscordPreviews/status/1975909634293854364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord Previews</a> said that <strong>“the perpetrators of this attack claim to have obtained 1.5 TB of age-verification photos totalling 2,185,151 images.”</strong> It was added that the stolen data is being used, as with most instances like this, to “extort Discord”.</p>



<p>On October 3, Discord publicly announced that an “unauthorized party compromised one of Discord’s third-party customer service providers.” This incident, which happened in late September, had the following data impacted:</p>



<ul>
<li>Name, Discord username, email, and other contact details if provided to Discord customer support</li>



<li>Limited billing information, such as payment type, the last four digits of your credit card, and purchase history, if associated with your account</li>



<li>IP addresses</li>



<li>Messages with our customer service agents&nbsp;</li>



<li>Limited corporate data (training materials, internal presentations)</li>
</ul>



<p>Information such as full credit card and CCV numbers, private messages, passwords, and other authentication data wasn’t involved.</p>



<p>According to Discord’s own policies, ID submissions are supposed to be deleted after age verification is complete. </p>



<p><strong>“Discord and k-ID do not permanently store personal identity documents or your video selfies,” </strong>they say. <strong>“The image of your identity document and the ID face match selfie are deleted directly after&nbsp;your age group is confirmed, and the video selfie used for facial age estimation never leaves your device.”</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Discord for comment on how the company is looking to move forward and why so many age-verification photos were still within the company’s database. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Discord hack leaving millions of user photos and information exposed?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has made its first Xbox Game Pass lineup announcement since its controversial decision to raise the price of the Ultimate subscription.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Microsoft sparked a backlash with its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cancelations-anger-and-frantic-subscription-stacking-the-internet-reacts-to-microsofts-xbox-game-pass-price-hike"><u>decision to raise the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</u></a> from $19.99 a month to $29.99 a month (a 50% increase that amounts to an extra $120 a year).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To justify the price hike, Microsoft upped the number of day one releases per year to 75, and added Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics for the first time ever. There were also upgrades to Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft insisted the new $30 a month Ultimate price reflects “the expanded catalog, new partner benefits, and upgraded cloud gaming experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that didn’t stop fans from reassessing whether Game Pass remained right for them. IGN’s poll on the issue, which now has over 42,000 voters, shows 53.9% of our audience will not subscribe to Game Pass at all. 19.8% said they were going for Ultimate despite the price rise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Microsoft has soldiered on with its Game Pass lineup announcement for October 2025, revealing the games subscribers can expect in a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/08/xbox-game-pass-october-2025-wave-1/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some big first-party hitters in here, including Double Fine’s Keeper, and the Xbox Game Studios’ published Ninja Gaiden 4.

But Microsoft has confirmed it has delayed the Ultimate price hike in some countries, such as Ireland and South Korea.

Its sequel upped the scare factor even further, earning critical acclaim while deepening the series’ mythos. With a new developer at the helm of its threequel, the question on everyone’s minds is whether the franchise’s third outing sticks the landing.</p>
<p>The answer is, '<em>Yeah, sort of</em>…' but with some major caveats. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares III</a> is essentially a soft reboot for the series with an all-new storyline and lead protagonists, yet it faithfully adheres to the well-trodden gameplay formula and level design of Tarsier Studios’ earlier entries, resulting in an experience that leans perhaps too much into reiteration rather than reinvention.</p>
<p>While competently executed under the auspices of Supermassive Games, the third instalment failed to spike my cortisol or wrack my nerves the way <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/little_nightmares_ii">Little Nightmares II</a> did. The series' trial-and-error gameplay is present, along with its oppressive atmospheres and macabre set pieces, but it all felt more brisk, gentler, and less pulse-pounding than its celebrated predecessors.</p>
<figure><a title="Little Nightmares III Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159390/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Boasting multiplayer for the first time in the series’ history, the implementation of this fandom-requested feature plainly misses the mark. While the game is built around variations on clever co-dependent puzzles that require two players to solve, co-op is locked behind online multiplayer to preserve "atmosphere and immersion", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-3-doesnt-have-couch-co-op-to-preserve-atmosphere-and-immersion">according to the developer</a>.</p>
<p>While I can understand the intent behind not wanting Little Nightmares to play like a party game, this feels to me like a case of the developers overthinking things. When I began my review, I had a friend over who had beaten the first two games and was eager to jump in, and the fact that I couldn’t just hand them a Joy-Con felt antithetical to the game’s multiplayer hype.</p>
<p>It’s a welcome addition that a Friend’s Pass will be available at launch, allowing you to play with a friend who doesn’t own the game, meaning only one copy needs to be purchased. However, both players will need their own consoles. While cross-generation play between Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 is supported, cross-platform play remains unavailable.</p>

<p>Due to these limitations (only a single Switch code was available to us during the review period), I completed my review playthrough in single-player mode, aided by an AI companion, which left things feeling a lot like Little Nightmares II, which paired its single-player mode with a bot, but even more streamlined because in this entry, your CPU partner essentially solves half the puzzles for you, given its two-player cooperative design.</p>
<p>You control one of two new leads: Low, a bow-and-arrow-wielding boy donning a plague doctor mask, and Alone, a girl with pigtails and an aviator helmet equipped with a wrench used for melee combat and puzzling. But what’s really puzzling, though, is the absence of any kind of character swap mechanic tailored specifically for single-player mode.</p>
<p>While your AI-managed companion is generally competent, there were one or two instances where it stood idle or failed to perform key actions, creating soft-lock situations that required checkpoint reloads. Those moments broke immersion and highlighted how the puzzles, clearly designed around teamwork, lose some of their intended satisfaction when played solo.</p>
<figure><a title="Little Nightmares III Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159387/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Puzzles involve synchronising an action with the wrench together with timed arrow shots to manipulate the environment, obtain keys, and traverse obstacles, offering a new wrinkle on otherwise standard fare for the series. Combat situations occurred a lot less frequently than I was expecting, but similarly required a bow and wrench pairing to finish off enemies.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, you can replay chapters, or the entire game, as either of the two protagonists, experiencing how each character’s unique toolset alters puzzle-solving and exploration. As in previous Little Nightmares entries, collectible items return, cleverly hidden throughout each level to reward curiosity and thorough exploration.</p>
<p>What Little Nightmares III really gets right, though, is its atmosphere, with tension-building and evocative sound design as well as beautifully crafted biomes that bring the series to previously unseen locales, from a haunting arid desertscape with churning mills and updrafts that can be ridden with umbrellas to an abandoned institute on a sub-tropical island teeming with fatal flora.</p>
<figure><a title="Little Nightmares III Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159392/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You will navigate crumbling fairground structures at a surrealist nightmare carnival, evade grotesque adversaries in deliberately slow, nail-biting stealth sequences, and be chased down by monstrous creatures inspired by anxieties surrounding authority and adolescent vulnerability. In other words, it still <em>looks</em> and <em>feels</em> like prior Little Nightmares games.</p>
<p>That said, this entry feels distinctly more 'by the numbers' than its predecessors, playing comfortably within established boundaries punctuated by a few modest innovations to gameplay mechanics. Its storytelling unfolds in a similar vein but concludes in a way that felt like the additional chapters of paid DLC — planned for release in 2026 — are needed to fully grasp.</p>
<p>I completed my playthrough in around four to five hours, which makes it as long as past titles, despite having only four chapters, as compared to five in both prior entries. Performance on Switch 2 left much to be desired, essentially feeling like a base Switch build targeting 30fps with soft, grainy visuals and micro-stutters aplenty when the action ramped up.</p>
<figure><a title="Little Nightmares III Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159386/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The end-game boss, in particular, moved in a distracting, almost stop-motion fashion during certain sequences. Though the game’s performance falters — at least at launch — it definitely remains playable despite being a far cry from a 'next-gen' third-party experience. Players who are sensitive to performance issues should consider grabbing this one on another platform.</p>
<p>I encountered a frustrating issue in the final chapter where a key item required for progression repeatedly despawned before it finally appeared in its proper location, allowing me to continue. Although the overall gameplay experience was otherwise smooth, this incident suggests that a few lingering bugs and optimisation issues may still be lurking under the hood.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Little Nightmares III faithfully preserves the oppressive mood, clever environmental puzzles, and visceral unease associated with the series, but feels like an echo of what came before. While its dark allure remains potent, the baffling absence of local co-op undercuts the game’s most ambitious feature. Though its multiplayer concept shines in theory, the absence of a character-swap feature to enrich single-player mode feels like another missed opportunity.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-detailed-pc-specs-from-minimum-to-ultra/">out in just two days from the time of this writing</a>, and when it launches, it'll do so with support for NVIDIA's DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen technology, alongside Little Nightmares III, which also launches on October 10, and with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen support.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/battlefield-6-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-nvidia-reflex/">NVIDIA in a new blog post about the latest batch of DLSS 4 games</a>, when pushing max settings on Battlefield 6, at 4K, and while using an RTX 50 Series card, you get a "<em>3.8X</em>" boost in frame rates on average. "<em>GeForce RTX 5090 performance rockets to over 470 FPS, the GeForce RTX 5080 exceeds 330 FPS, the GeForce 5070Ti is in touching distance of 300 FPS, and the GeForce RTX 5070 surpasses 230 FPS.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Little Nightmares III doesn't exactly require the kind of high frame rates you'd want from a shooter like Battlefield 6, it'll still be nice to have a smooth experience while exploring the horrors that Supermassive Games has in store.</p>



<p>Beyond Little Nightmares III and Battlefield 6, NVIDIA also confirmed that when Crimson Desert launches next March, it'll do so with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen support, with more details to follow as to what that'll look like closer to the game's launch.</p>



<p>Lastly, the mountain biking game Mavrix by Matt Jones has also been confirmed to be adding support for DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation. </p>



<p>Last month, Jurassic World Evolution 3 and Annata <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-ananta-jurassic-world-evolution-3/">were added to the list of games</a> that support DLSS 4.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s a fairly safe bet that even if you’re a huge <em>Star Wars</em> fan, you’ve never seen these six characters from&nbsp;<em>The Phantom Menace</em> like this before. That’s because Anakin Skywalker, Queen Amidala, Qui-Gon Jinn, and the others have assumed LEGO BrickHeadz form in <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4638/">this eye-grabbing and fun LEGO Star Wars set that’s marked down by 31% in a new Prime Big Deal.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>This cool set for kids 10 and up contains six collectible buildable characters — Anakin, Amidala, Qui-Gon, Darth Maul, Captain Panaka, and Jar Jar Binks, each with movie-authentic details in BrickHeadz form. In total there are 732 pieces, with each figure measuring over 2.5 inches high, 1.5 inches wide, and 2 inches deep. Each has its own baseplate, and some have their own accessories like young Anakin’s hammer and Darth Maul’s double-bladed red lightsaber. Once built, these unique collectible figures are more displayable than playable, and make great decorations or conversation pieces.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4638/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Anytime Gift</h2>
<p>It’s never too early to start thinking about the holidays and knocking items off your list, but this LEGO BrickHeadz The Phantom Menace set is a terrific anytime present — birthday, great report card, or just a thoughtful gift for a young <em>Star Wars</em> fan in your life. The six BrickHeadz figures are fun for boys and girls age 10 and up to build, and then great decorations for any kid’s bedroom.</p>
<p>Even in the fun and unique-looking BrickHeadz form, the detail LEGO adds to these six figures from&nbsp;<em>The Phantom Menace</em> is exceptionally cool. Anakin Skywalker comes in his podracing outfit, while Queen Amidala’s dress comes with gem elements to snap in place. All 10 of Darth Maul’s horns are in place, and Qui-Gon Jinn’s Jedi outfit is easily recognized.</p>



<h2>Unanimous Reviews</h2>
<p>All of the Amazon reviews on the LEGO BrickHeadz The Phantom Menace collectible set are raves — it’s one of the very rare Amazon items that has a unanimous 5-star rating, but then again, how can you go wrong with Star Wars figures from LEGO? This is also a collectible set, part of LEGO’s larger 25th anniversary celebration of both&nbsp;<em>The Phantom Menace</em> being released in theaters and the first LEGO Star Wars building sets being released in stores.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4638/">The Prime Big Deal at Amazon takes 31% off the price of the LEGO BrickHeadz The Phantom Menace collectible set, bringing it from its usual $55 all the way down to just $38.</a> But, as with all of these Prime Day deals, you’re on borrowed time. Once Prime Day’s over, so is this Prime Big Deal.</p>

<p>Bethesda is preparing the world for another epic day. Fallout Day 2025 has been announced, and there are broadcast date details, along with information on its start time, and a sneak peek at what the company could have in store for you all on the S.P.E.C.I.A.L day.</p>



<p>Some people love Christmas Day, others look forward to Thanksgiving. But for long-time Bethesda fans, it probably doesn’t get better than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-day-broadcast-dates-and-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout Day</a>. The 2025 edition is upon us, and last year’s showcase provided huge updates on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-release-notes-pts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 76</a> and new content and DLC.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-day-2025-date-amp-time-announced">Fallout Day 2025 Date &amp; Time Announced</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More content for Fallout 76? We’ll have to see. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bethesda and Fallout fans can look forward to Fallout Day 2025 starting at 1 PM ET on October 23!</p>



<p>News of this comes directly from <a href="https://x.com/Fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fallout</a>‘s social media: “Save the date!

<p>If you didn’t know, FalloutforHope is a charity organized by Fallout content creator Kenneth Vigue and aims to “offer hope and relief for children and their families at a time of year when loss is felt and help keenly needed.”</p>



<p>This is amazing publicity for a good cause, which should round off what is usually a solid show.</p>



<p>While Bethesda hasn’t explicitly revealed anything in particular that will be shown off or announced during Fallout Day 2025, the company has said the broadcast will feature “news about existing Fallout games” and news on upcoming Fallout fan events.</p>



<p>Could there be a surprise announcement regarding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-fallout-3-remastered-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 3 Remaster</a> lying in wait? I guess we’ll all have to tune in and find out.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📅 Save the date!

The stream will take place on Thursday, October 23 (the day the bombs fell in the Fallout universe) at 10 &nbsp;PT/1 PM ET/6 PM BST.</p><p>"Tune in for the latest news about our existing Fallout games, community celebrations, and upcoming fan events!" the announcement reads.

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 update launching on all platforms will introduce new content to the RPG developed by Sandfall Interactive released in April 2025.</p>



<p>The new update was confirmed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/506216119584948426?l=english">a new message shared by the studio on Steam</a>, celebrating the game selling 5 million copies, and the original soundtrack composed by Lorien Testard hitting 333 million track streams since its release. This new update, whose release date has yet to be confirmed, will include new content and features according to the developer. These are:</p>



<ul>
<li>A new playable location environment with new enemy encounters and surprises to find.</li>



<li>New challenging late-game boss battles</li>



<li>New costumes for each party member that will also provide new customization options</li>



<li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian, which will bring the total number of supported languages to 19.</li>
</ul>



<p>New content coming to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is excellent news, as the new challenges will only improve one of the best JRPGs released in the current generation, and, in my opinion, a serious contender for this year's Game of the Year award. You can learn more about why I believe so by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">checking out my</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sandfall Interactive has announced a brand new sales milestone for turn-based indie RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, and there's a big new update in the works as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/thank-you-from-sandfall-interactive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has hit five million sales since launching earlier this year. That means it's picked up another 1.7 million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow">since May</a>, which is very impressive indeed for a game that doesn't have a huge studio backing it (no shade, Kepler).</p>

<p>In order to celebrate the new sales milestone, Sandfall says it's working on a huge new update that will bring lots of new content to the RPG, so if you've been hurting for stuff to do post-game, this might be the one for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-maelle_0.jpg?itok=kMu-0r8e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-maelle_0.jpg?itok=b2Gs9-Ro 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has sold very well indeed.</figcaption></figure><p>The new update will, according to Sandfall, bring a brand new area in which you'll find "new enemy encounters and surprises to discover", as well as new challenging late-game bosses to battle.</p>

<p>You'll also find new costumes for each member of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, so you can finally take them out of those stereotypically French outfits from the base game (although if you don't, I won't blame you).</p>

<p>All of this is in addition to new localizations for the game, which will bring its total number of supported languages to 19, as well as "more to come", which is rather tantalizing.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG developed by French indie studio Sandfall Interactive, and it revolves around the titular Expedition 33's attempt to defeat the Paintress in order to prevent the culling of everyone of a certain age each year.</p>

              <p>It’s quite the pickle. You’ve got a well-loved 2016 indie hit, and you figured it’d be nice to make it free on Steam for a bit. But then, a good while later, you decide it’s time to give it a graphical overhaul, update it with a whole new online multiplayer mode, and start charging a little bit for all that work. Except, nope. It seems there’s a limit for how many times you can switch your game from free to paid. So, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beloved-co-operative-platformer-pico-park-classic-edition-has-been-accidentally-made-free-on-steam-forever">spotted by&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em></a>, Tecopark’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/461040/PICO_PARKClassic_Edition/"><em>Pico Park: Classic Edition</em></a> and its new multiplayer mode is stuck at free, and will always be.</p> <p>Japanese developer Tecopark’s&nbsp;<em>Pico Park</em> games have proven hugely popular multiplayer games over the last ten years. Alongside the&nbsp;<em>Classic</em> version, there’s 2021’s re-imagined&nbsp;<em>Pico Park</em>, and most recently 2024’s&nbsp;<em>Pico Park 2</em>. They’re all cooperative puzzle games for between two and eight players, in which you’re challenged to collect a level’s keys via collaborative platform action. As you might imagine, this can become chaotic extremely quickly as groups attempt to arrange their cute cat-like characters into stacked piles to reach platforms, or assign themselves to pressing multiple buttons at once to open doors. And in the <em>Classic</em> version, that madness could go up to as many as 10 players. Albeit, until recently, only in local multiplayer.</p>

 <p>Tecopark’s Shunsuke Miyake posted to the game’s Updates page on August 20, “I’m thinking of updating&nbsp;<em>Classic Edition</em> for the first time in nine years… Since I’m doing it anyway, I’ll update it with online support.” He added, “<wbr>I might charge a small fee for it. I recommend installing it while it’s still free.”</p>

 <p>Come September 13, that update had happened, and the game now had art that matches its two sequels, ran on monitors running over 60Hz, added Steam inputs, and most significantly, now included online multiplayer. Miyake added, “We’ll keep it free for about a week.” Which was pretty generous!</p>

 <p>Then this last weekend, a new update appeared. The title is “<em>PICO PARK&nbsp;: Classic Edition</em> is permanently free!” with the text explaining this change.</p> <blockquote><p>“I was planning to switch to a paid plan after updating the online support, but I forgot that once you switch from paid to free, I can never go back to paid! : )”</p></blockquote> <p>He then adds, “If you enjoy playing this free version, be sure to try the series (<em>PICO PARK</em>, <em>PICO PARK 2</em>) too.”</p>

 <p>The 2021 version of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1509960/PICO_PARK/"><em>Pico Park</em></a> was an updated port of the Switch’s 2019 game (keep notes, there’s a test at the end), with all-new levels and online multiplayer, along with a bunch of new modes and ways to play. It even lets you use your phone as a controller for party gaming around one screen, rather than forcing you into the hassle of hooking up eight Xbox controllers at once.</p>

 <p>Last September’s&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2644470/PICO_PARK_2/"><em>Pico Park 2</em></a> offered a brand new set of levels, along with all the previous features, including cross-platform support. Both games are extremely well received, eliciting very creative Steam reviews from people broken by their experiences. “This is the game where friendships go to DIE,” says one positive review. Another says, “this game ruined my relationships with all my friends and I am now left alone. Great game.” My personal favorite reads, “You get to see who’s stupid among your friends, then realize it was you all along.”</p> <p>And now, it seems, you can experience the original version of all this in its prettier glory, and online, for free! Poor ol’ Tecopark. For real, go buy a sequel if you enjoy it! Poor people just wanted to make a well-earned buck. Honestly, they should add it as a free game on Itch.io too, where at least people can then choose to pay for it if they want to.</p>
