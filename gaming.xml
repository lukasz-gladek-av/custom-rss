<p>When was the last time you came in first on Call of Duty: Warzone? You might win a match next year with a few worthwhile Warzone tips and tricks from someone who won a single round way back when the game was first released.</p>



<h2 id="h-open-your-parachute-early"><strong>Open Your Parachute Early</strong></h2>



<p>Most people carefully plan their drops with pinpoint accuracy. They know which building they’ll camp in and the route they’ll take into the zone once it appears. But you know better.</p>



<p><strong>Open your chute early</strong>. When you do, you pull your starting pistol. Did you know you can kill opposing players while they’re still floating down to the ground? Use these precious seconds in the air to down an enemy player, or at the very least, take some of their health away.</p>



<h2 id="h-spend-cash-early-spend-it-often"><strong>Spend Cash Early, Spend It Often</strong></h2>



<p>When you die, you wind up in the Gulgag. You’ll receive a single life in a 1v1 against another opponent there. If you die, you’re done. If you win, you resurrect and parachute down once more.</p>



<p>To avoid losing all of the money you earned up to this point, spend it early and often. You can buy a self-resurrect for $4500, which is invaluable to avoid the Gulag and remain in the match.</p>



<p>While playing in a party, any help you can provide to your team makes you invaluable, so spend the money to revive dead teammates!</p>

<h2 id="h-avoid-the-gas"><strong>Avoid the Gas</strong></h2>



<p>Well, duh. This is a non-tip, you’re likely thinking. But wait, the gas in Call of Duty: Warzone is unlike the gas found in PUBG or Fortnite. In this battle royale, the gas is deadly. With the gas rapidly encroaching your position, you cannot hang around, waiting to unleash an ambush.</p>



<p>If you have a gas mask, your character will automatically put it on when inside the gas zone. But this process takes a long time. Use that limited time to find a better position—a gas-free position.</p>



<h2 id="h-grind-the-pre-game"><strong>Grind the Pre-Game</strong></h2>



<p>Many are content to sit around and wait for the actual battle royale to begin. They grab a drink, eat a snack, or check their social media.</p>



<p>During the pre-game, use those precious minutes to train your weapons. You earn XP before the match by getting kills, which unlocks perks, attachments, and skins.</p>

<p>What’s the end game of any role-playing game? It’s fashion, right? Many of us play RPGs and MMORPGs because we feel a deep connection to a character we built from the ground up. As that character progresses in level, becomes stronger, and finds better gear, a part of ourselves flows into said character. And upon reaching the end game, when you’re all-powerful, what then? Well, it’s time to learn how to transmog gear in <strong>Diablo 4</strong>!</p>



<h2 id="h-travel-to-kyovashad"><strong>Travel to Kyovashad</strong></h2>



<p>You can transmog your gear in Diablo 4 by traveling to the central city of Kyovashad. You’ll find a small inn directly to the north of the waypoint. On the top floor, the only room at the top of the landing that players can enter, is a bed and a cabinet. It’s here that you’ll transmog your equipment.</p>



<p>Once you activate the cabinet, you’ll find various options to customize your character better. You can alter your appearance by adding cosmetic items like the wolf pup backpack cosmetic from the beta or transmog your gear based on available cosmetics.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-earn-transmogs-in-diablo-4"><strong>How to Earn Transmogs in Diablo 4</strong></h2>



<p>If your selection of transmogs feels lackluster, it’s because you’ve been spending all your time raking in the gold instead of salvaging items.</p>



<p>By visiting the local blacksmith in any settlement, you can salvage unwanted gear and, occasionally, receive a new transmog. You can tell when you’ll earn a new cosmetic look based on the hammer-like icon over the item.</p>



<p>Of course, you’ll also be able to buy premium cosmetics through the in-game store. Those, however, can be pretty expensive. As we’ve seen since the Early Access launch, the store features quite the pricing scheme. A single outfit collection can cost up to $25!</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can buy the occasional single piece, like a shield cosmetic, for much less.</p>







<h2 id="h-saving-outfits-for-later-use"><strong>Saving Outfits for Later Use</strong></h2>



<p>Perhaps one of the most annoying aspects of a transmog system in RPGs is having to continually update your appearance after acquiring new gear. For some, it’s easier to wait until max level. Others, however—myself included—like to look like an absolute unit throughout the game.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in the transmog section, you’ll find ‘Ensembles.’ You start with a single ensemble slot and pay gold to unlock additional slots.</p>



<p>This feature allows players to quickly transmog an entire gear set to suit their style and appearance desires with one click.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As surprising as it was to see Nintendo drop an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-just-surprise-dropped-the-scariest-game-teaser-of-the-year/1100-6524826/">uncharacteristically creepy teaser</a> earlier this year about a masked man known as "Emio," few could have expected it would be related to a brand-new entry in the company's long-dormant Famicom Detective Club series. What's less surprising is just how riveting the game turned out to be, an expertly paced thriller whose setting, music, and atmosphere masterfully crescendo into one of the most suspenseful denouements Nintendo has ever conjured.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Spoilers for Emio - The Smiling Man follow.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">The lead-up to this climax, however, is anything but straightforward. Like the previous two games in the Famicom Detective Club series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club/" data-ref-id="5000-635127">Emio - The Smiling Man</a> is a slow-burn detective story--a densely plotted mystery that unravels methodically over the course of roughly a dozen hours. Picking up a few years after the events of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/famicom-detective-club-the-missing-heir/" data-ref-id="5000-527219">The Missing Heir</a>, the Utsugi Detective Agency is enlisted to aid police detectives Junko Kuze and Daisuke Kamihara in investigating the death of a teenage boy, who was discovered wearing a paper bag unsettlingly scrawled with a smiley face.</p><p dir="ltr">What's most shocking about this scene, however, is how it eerily parallels a series of unsolved murders that occurred in town 18 years ago, leading you and the police to suspect the same culprit is responsible. The only other lead to go off of is a disturbing urban legend of a serial killer known as Emio, the "Smiling Man"--a paper-bag wearing individual who approaches crying girls at night and strangles them, placing a smiley face paper bag over their heads afterward to leave them with an everlasting smile.</p><p dir="ltr">With this tenuous connection as your starting point, you embark on a winding investigation, navigating a deliberately laid breadcrumb trail of clues, misdirections, and dead ends. But for all the progress you make, the answer always seems just beyond reach. Every new lead you uncover only raises further questions, and it often feels as if you are no closer to discovering the connection between the cases, let alone the culprit's identity and whereabouts.</p><p dir="ltr">That is, until you reach the penultimate chapter. Following a tense car ride with Detective Kamihara, you return to the city center to canvass the locals for any more potential leads you can discover. After a largely fruitless search around town, you eventually meet two unassuming construction workers, who suddenly turn your understanding of the case upside down.</p><div tabindex="0"

person of interest from the serial murders who has been missing for 18 years; and one of Makoto Kuze, Detective Kuze's missing brother who also disappeared around the time of the serial murders. The construction workers claim to have just recently worked with a man named Minoru Tsuzuki, but they don't recognize the Minoru depicted in the police sketch. Rather, they both identify the sketch of Makoto as Minoru.</p><p dir="ltr">Even more curiously, the construction workers recall driving Minoru home on the last day of their project. The background music suddenly falls silent as the two recount dropping Minoru off in the middle of nowhere at the foot of the mountains, then watching the strange man as he wordlessly waded through the overgrowth and up the mountainside. It's a confounding twist, made all the more chilling by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPiQu-iBXag" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ominous track</a> that accompanies their testimony, reinforcing the feeling that you're on the precipice of some horrible revelation.</p><p dir="ltr">The tension is only amplified as you delve into the final chapter, which begins with your arrival at Yamanba Pass, the eerie stretch of road in the middle of the mountains where Minoru was last seen. The atmosphere is immediately unnerving. The overgrown brush and dilapidated pavement make it apparent no one has been through the area in quite some time, and the only audible sound is the faint, haunting murmur of the wind blowing through the trees. With sunset quickly approaching and no other path forward, you have little choice but to enter the woods and continue pursuing your new lead.</p><p dir="ltr">The ascent is unbearably foreboding. As dusk gradually creeps in and you steadily make your way up the mountainside, scanning the thick foliage for any clues that may lead you in the right direction, you come upon multiple forks in the trail, most of which either double back to a previous area or lead off to a dead end. It's tense and disorienting, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG-SKfTAFHM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unsettling background music</a> that plays as you negotiate this seemingly endless forest only accentuates the feeling of unease.</p><p dir="ltr">But what really lends this scene an overwhelming sense of dread is the way the game deftly manipulates player expectations. Though you as the audience are aware that several characters have had brushes with the Smiling Man at different points in the story, you as the protagonist have yet to meet him yourself--which must mean your inevitable face-to-face encounter with the elusive killer could happen at any given moment while you're desperately navigating this dark, remote mountain.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a palpably tense experience, and a testament to how masterfully executed the game's closing chapters are. And that's to say nothing of the wrenching epilogue that unlocks after the credits roll, which ties up every loose end and lingering question in gutting fashion. Though it may not have garnered as much mainstream attention as some other releases, these climactic moments solidify Emio - The Smiling Man as one of the year's most poignant titles, a genuinely tender, funny, and heartrending tale that will stay with me for years to come.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

			<p>This year, many awesome games were released, and some fantastic DLCs and expansions for games for titles that debuted in previous years were also launched. Some of them were completely unexpected, while others had people waiting eagerly for the DLC to unlock on their device so that they could get stuck in. Here is Wccftech's best DLC/expansion of 2024.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a></em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Alan Wake 2: Night Springs (8.5/10)</h2>
<p>Alan Wake 2 has received two DLCs, both of which were released this year. Night Springs came out stronger than The Lake House. Both were phenomenal and the perfect addition to the Remedy universe. In typical Alan Wake fashion, the story was wild and unpredictable but a ton of fun to dive into.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it is starkly different from the game it's attached to. It doesn't have much to do with the main characters of Alan Wake 2 and instead takes you on three individual characters' journeys, including Control protagonist Jesse Faden. Below is an excerpt from the review written by Francesco De Meo.</p>
<p><em>While the gameplay is pretty much in line with the North Star episode, this episode is considerably better than the other two and the one that feels the closest to the base experience. It is possibly even more daring than the base game in terms of visual presentation, masterfully blending together some very different styles, something that alone makes it worth the price of admission.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">10/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Starting off strong, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is an absolutely fantastic expansion to Elden Ring and has so much content that it's basically the same value as a whole game for half the price. This was eagerly awaited by many and was even given a perfect score by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree's open-world design stands out as a testament to how the Elden Ring experience still surpasses anything else on the market. As such, I believe a perfect score is justified, even with the evident lack of significant innovation and some technical hiccups.</em></p>
<p>It introduced some great bosses and more lore for the Elden Ring universe. Players got to face off against some of the hardest bosses the Elden Ring universe has seen, with new ways to level up and gain strength to carry them through the DLC. FromSoftware can do no wrong, or so it seems anyway.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</h2>
<p>This year also saw the release of a new expansion for one of the most loved MMORPGs on the market right now. Dawntrail is the latest DLC for Final Fantasy XIV, a DLC that is brilliant in its own right but doesn't quite stand up to the excellence of Shadowbringers or Endwalker, for example. However, the game hasn't really ever experienced a terrible expansion, and all have elements that are enjoyable in their own way.</p>
<p>The same goes for Dawntrail, which introduced new Jobs (playable classes) for players to pick up, too. Players now have the option to play as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-unlock-viper-in-ffxiv-dawntrail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viper</a> or a <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-unlock-pictomancer-in-ffxiv-dawntrail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pictomancer</a>, which are two incredibly fun classes to get into.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Dredge: The Iron Rig</h2>
<p>Dredge is a fantastic game that blends the "cozy game" genre with a hint of horror. The game takes you on a solo fishing adventure, where everything is not quite as it seems. Soon, you're fishing up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2561450/DREDGE__The_Iron_Rig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lovecraftian horrors</a> from the ocean and making a quick buck by selling them to a vendor who doesn't seem all too surprised.</p>
<p>This year saw the release of The Iron Rig, the second official expansion for the game. It adds another couple of hours to the game and allows you to build the newest destination, with 50 new fish to catch and more achievements to get. Compared to the base game, this expansion is more focused on the fishing element, which is perfect for those who enjoy that element of the game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>World of Warcraft: The War Within (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/">9.5/10</a>)</h2>
<p>World of Warcraft is a game that often gets a lot of hate, as they have released some expansions that haven't done the game justice and led to the game nearly dying (thank you, Shadowlands.) However, The War Within is an expansion done right, introducing a fun new villain from the Void. The new zones are gorgeous (albeit a bit laggy in Dornogal), with a lot of fun side quests, dailies and a great campaign that is still being added to.</p>
<p>When it comes to expansions being accessible, The War Within is up there as one of the best. The focus is no longer strictly on those who want to do Mythic+ dungeons and Mythic Raiding, and there's a shift of focus over to those who enjoy questing and doing single-player content or multiplayer content with minimal consequences. Here's my summary from the review:</p>
<p><em>Overall, World of Warcraft: The War Within has been a delight to experience, from fun and rewarding mount grinds to surprisingly adorable pets (looking at you, Oop'lajax), as well as some genuinely heartbreaking quests that you get to experience in the main story campaign.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-co-ceo-open-to-bringing-back-classic-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-single-player-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot released</a> in September, many players loved the nod to the history of Sony and PlayStation classics throughout the game. From tributes to more recent franchises like Horizon and Uncharted to older series like Ape Escape, the game fed into nostalgia in a big way. This has led to questions about whether PlayStation could dip into its backlog of classic franchises for new games in the future.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/26274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>, PlayStation Co-CEO Herman Hulst was asked about past PlayStation series and the possibility of bringing them back. According to Hulst, it’s not something that’s out of the question for the company.</p>



<p>“The numerous IP holdings we hold are important assets for PlayStation, and as part of our efforts to strengthen our portfolio, we are continuously looking at opportunities to leverage past IPs, as well as developing new franchises,” Hulst said via auto translation.</p>



<p>Hulst added that the company’s goal is to release games made by the best developers whether they are a part of PlayStation Studios or not. He tipped the hat to external studios for the “many successes so far”.</p>



<p>The idea of reviving past franchises has picked up steam across the games industry over the years. Currently, fellow Japanese company Sega <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-outlines-segas-plans-for-new-slate-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is in the middle</a> of a massive revival of classic games like Golden Axe, Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, and more. </p>



<p>Whether PlayStation decides to bring back classic titles down the line obviously remains to be seen. Still, it has to be nice for longtime fans of the studio to see that the door isn’t closed if the right opportunity comes along.</p>



<p>What classic PlayStation franchises do you hope to see get a revival in the future? Let us know down below and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2024 – Best PC Game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/28/game-of-the-year-2024-best-pc-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-the-year-2024-%E2%80%93-best-pc-game.1070508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/28/game-of-the-year-2024-best-pc-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Time was that PC gaming was synonymous with mouse &amp; keyboard gaming, this being the best way to play twitchy first person shooters, clickathon real time strategies, and the like. But PC gaming has morphed to be so, so much more than that. In fact, PC has become something of the urplatform for those who can afford it, as it has gobbled up former console exclusives, opened the floodgates to indie devs and early access, and controller support has got better and better to the point that Steam Deck and other handheld gaming PCs are now totally viable.</p>
<p>All of which brings us to our Best PC Game award, drawing from across the breadth of what PC gaming can offer. And no, they won’t be pushing your 4090 or ray tracing to the max.</p>

<p>It might be a little unfair to be putting a single release that contains 50 separate games (51 if you count the secret hidden one) up against more traditional releases, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/08/ufo50-packs-50-retro-styled-games-into-one-amazing-package/">UFO 50</a> truly stands out as a modern day classic. Inspired by the infamous Action 52 cartridge from the NES days (but with no sign of the woeful CheetahMen, thank goodness), UFO 50 sets itself up as the complete catalogue for an unreleased console from the 80s. Contained within are a dizzying array of NES-like games from all kinds of styles and genres, many of which would be fantastic taken on their own.</p>
<p>Completing each title unlocks content for the framing narrative but there is also plenty of high score and speedrun potential for the more skilled gamers. That being said, you will need to make use of old-school techniques and learning level designs and enemy patterns to succeed. There is little of the modern handholding that AAA games rely on here.</p>

<p>I’ve put most of my time into UFO 50 on the Steam Deck so it has felt like a console experience and it really comes into its own here. Whether you remember the halcyon days of dodgy multi-game cartridges or not UFO 50 is so full of charm and originality that it fully deserves to be seen as the standout PC exclusive title of 2024.</p>
<p><em>– Steve C</em></p>
<h2>Hollowbody – Runner-up</h2>
<p>I’d been looking forward to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/hollowbody-review/">Hollowbody’s</a> release for a long while after playing an early demo and enjoying its novel take on survival horror via a Blade Runner aesthetic. This excitement was proved entirely well placed when I got my hands on the full game. The fixed camera angles, traditional feeling combat and excellently designed environmental puzzles all combine to make a true modern day classic, all topped off by the futuristic dystopian UK setting.</p>
<p>Since release, Headware Games have added plenty of new features and fixed the few bugs that remained to make an even more complete package. Most recently an over-the-shoulder third person camera perspective has been patched in to appeal to gamers who don’t share my nostalgia for the old school tank controls and fixed views. So good is Hollowbody that I’m planning to go back and replay it to look for extra stuff I missed before I do the same with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>. If you have access to a PC that can run it, then you owe it to yourself to check it out.</p>

<h2>Ara: History Untold – Runner-up</h2>
<p>The last few years have seen a rush of new historical 4X games launch, as all manner of developers seek to put their spin on this subgenre before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/civilization-vii-gameplay-revealed-with-february-release-date/">the next big Civilization game hits</a>. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/ara-history-untold-review/">Ara: History Untold</a> brings with it a fresh perspective and emphasis on the empire building and cultural aspects of the genre, almost deemphasising warfare and combat as you manage supply chains, production lines and more to get ahead.</p>
<p>There’s and arresting visual style to how your cities will sprawl across the map, but the framing of the game through the passing of ages and distinct technological eras will have a much greater impact for those who love to sink turn after turn after turn into this genre.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-nintendo-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon it will be 2025, also known as the year Nintendo <em>finally </em>pulls back the curtain on its next console. After 2024 was filled with shaky rumors, alleged leaks, and nonstop speculation about the Nintendo Switch successor, we know for a fact Nintendo will share more about the next generation in less than 100 days. If that’s not exciting enough for you, the Nintendo Switch still has a few cards up its sleeve and 2025 will finally see the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,</a> eight years after its initial announcement. And, as always, there will surely be some surprises along the way, with some possibly tied to a certain plumber’s 40th anniversary. Here’s what to expect from Nintendo in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Nintendo in 2025: What’s Already On the Books</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get into Switch 2, let’s recap what we already know is coming to Switch in 2025. Nintendo has been incredibly consistent at publishing a Switch game most months for the last two years, and while I’m not sure they’ll keep up that pace to the same degree in 2025, we already know about a fair number of games coming in the next few months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">January 16 marks the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD,</a> a remaster of the 2010 Wii platformer that includes the extra levels from the 2013 3DS port. That’s right, this is the third time Nintendo is selling us Country Returns and it’s now been more than a decade since the last original Donkey Kong Country game with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze">Tropical Freeze’s</a> launch on Wii U. Hopefully Donkey Kong’s recent inclusion in Nintendo’s movies and theme parks will eventually result in a brand new video game, but for now you’re getting Country Returns again, and you <em>better like it. </em>As someone who’s bought and played both previous versions, it really is a fantastic platformer and one worth trying if you’ve never played it before.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re getting another HD remaster on March 20, but this one is much more exciting. After years of fan demand, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x">Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition</a> is finally landing on Switch, meaning the entire Xenoblade Chronicles series will be available in one place. Xenoblade Chronicles X is the odd one out in the series: It’s not <em>directly </em>tied to the trilogy and it was doomed to originally release on Wii U back in 2015, so this second chance at life will be many players’ first chance to dive into this enormous open world RPG. The visually enhanced Definitive Edition also adds brand new story content longtime fans will surely dissect and theorize about for years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, those are the only firm release dates we have for Nintendo in 2025, but there are a few huge games coming sometime in the coming months. That includes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, Game Freak’s return to the Legends subseries after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Arceus</a> successfully shook things up back in 2022. We still know very little about what Legends: Z-A will entail, other than it centers around an “urban redevelopment plan” in the Kalos Region’s Lumiose City from Pokémon X &amp; Y, and that Generation VI’s Mega Evolution is set to return in some way. Pokémon took a much needed year off in 2024 so it’s exciting to see what Legends: Z-A will look like after taking a bit more time in the oven.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One big third-party Nintendo Switch exclusive worth shouting out is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and the New World of Steam,</a> which is scheduled for release sometime in 2025. It’s the big return of Professor Layton and his assistant Luke after more than a decade out of the spotlight. I’m hopeful it will actually make it out on time – Level-5 has been a bit too eager to announce release windows before games are actually ready, but whenever this finally comes out it will be an exciting return for a series that’s always been heavily associated with Nintendo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The final TBA 2025 game on Nintendo’s calendar right now is the long-awaited Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. First announced at E3 2017, Prime 4 was MIA for years <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-revealed">before its re-reveal at June’s Nintendo Direct.</a> Prime 4 is coming from Retro Studios, developers of the original Metroid Prime trilogy, and it features the return of Sylux, a villain first introduced in the Nintendo DS spinoff Metroid Prime Hunters. The most recent trailer is absolutely gorgeous and I can’t wait to see how the full adventure shapes up later this year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>We’ll Know More About Switch 2 in Less Than Three Months</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Enough messing around, let’s get into what you’re all here for: the Nintendo Switch successor. Last May, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-it-will-announce-switch-successor-console-within-this-fiscal-year">Nintendo would make an announcement about the Nintendo Switch successor “within this fiscal year.”</a> Nintendo’s fiscal year ends on March 31, meaning that we’re expecting an official unveiling sometime within the next 90 days or so. Other than Nintendo’s recent confirmation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-officially-be-backward-compatible-with-original-switch-games">Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the Switch 2,</a> the company has been very quiet about what the console will actually be like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, March might not be the end of the story. It’s possible we will get a quick teaser trailer before the end of this fiscal year, similar to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/first-look-at-nintendos-new-console-nintendo-switch">the Switch’s reveal trailer in October 2016,</a> followed by a full presentation ahead of the official launch. Or Nintendo might tell us everything we want to know right away, which is the best-case scenario. Either way, I’m confident we’ll get a big presentation at some point this year with all the answers we’re looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last time Nintendo held a big in-person event in Japan to properly unveil the Switch, which was broadcast live around the world. I’m expecting a slightly different strategy this time as I think Nintendo will stick to its prerecorded Nintendo Direct-style presentation to show the successor off. But I think the information presented will be largely the same, where Nintendo will likely share information on the following:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Name</li><li>Release Date</li><li>Price</li><li>Launch day/window game lineup</li><li>Specifications</li><li>Unique features</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what these console details will actually be, your guess is as good as mine. But I can almost guarantee the Switch successor will launch before the end of 2025 as I don’t see a world where Nintendo announces it as early as March and waits until 2026 to release it. And I’m personally expecting the Switch successor to be very iterative of Nintendo Switch, maintaining the hybrid design that made it such a global success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new console means new games and Nintendo is definitely cooking up a big lineup for the next console’s first year. Not counting projects it was a co-developer on, Nintendo’s internal development teams only put out one game last year: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splatoon-3-side-order-dlc-review">Splatoon 3’s Side Order DLC.</a> It’s clearly been full steam ahead on Switch 2 games for a while and I’m expecting some heavy hitters at launch and in the first year of Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We are well overdue for a new 3D Mario because it’s been nearly eight years since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey.</a> That was the last <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury">brand new 3D Mario apart from Bowser’s Fury,</a> which was a bite-sized expansion added onto 3D World’s Switch release in 2021. I’m confident Nintendo is setting up the next 3D Mario to be the Switch successor’s must-have game at launch, to get all of the hardcore Nintendo fans snap up the new console right away. And it just so happens that 2025 is the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros., and given how big Nintendo went for the 35th anniversary in 2020, I think it’s a safe bet that Mario will be front and center at the next console launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about Mario Kart? We’re even more overdue for a brand new Mario Kart entry given that it’s been 11 years now since Mario Kart 8’s original release. Yes, we got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Tour, and the Booster Course Pass</a> in the time since, but it’s still been way too long since a wholly original home console Mario Kart. I go back and forth between thinking 3D Mario or Mario Kart is the big launch game, but either way I think we get both before the console’s first holiday season. Right now, I’m feeling a 3D Mario at launch as the big single-player showcase game, with Mario Kart coming just a bit later to get families interested in picking the console up over the holidays. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As much as everyone loves Mario though, Nintendo will want to diversify its launch lineup beyond its most iconic character. I could see some sort of Zelda remake or remaster in the cards to get that franchise represented as soon as possible on the next hardware, with the two most likely candidates feeling like an Ocarina of Time HD remake or a Breath of the Wild remaster that runs at a solid 60 fps. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think it’s a safe bet that Mario will be front and center at the next console launch.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also expecting Nintendo to unveil some sort of brand new IP to hit the console at launch or shortly after. The Wii had Wii Sports, Wii U had Nintendoland, and Switch had 1-2-Switch, so there will likely be some sort of casual, family-friendly experience to show off what the new hardware can do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also hopeful we might get a glimpse of Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai’s new mystery game at some point in 2025. Sakurai dropped one of the biggest plot twists of 2024 when he revealed that he prepped his entire YouTube channel in advance and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-quits-youtube-with-final-video-teasing-mystery-new-game">has been secretly working on a new video game since early 2022.</a> It’s been in development for three years now so it’s not out of the realm of possibility that a reveal is planned for sometime this year. It’s most likely the next Smash Bros., but I would love to see Sakurai’s take on a more niche Nintendo series like Star Fox or F-Zero. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of F-Zero, I wouldn’t be surprised if Switch 2 is home to a remaster of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a> or an entirely new game in the series. Nintendo has been building up hype for the F-Zero series for the last year now, first with the release and continued updates in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/f-zero-99">F-Zero 99,</a> followed by the addition of nearly every game in the series to the Nintendo Switch Online game catalog. I feel like it’s accelerating toward something big for the series and there’s almost no better way to show off new, powerful hardware than a gorgeous, futuristic racing game running at a perfect framerate.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Switch 1 Support Will Continue</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes will definitely be on Switch 2 in 2025 but Nintendo will continue to support its 140 million-plus Switch 1 install base with new games. We already discussed the Switch games we know are coming in 2025 but there will certainly be more reveals as the year goes on. I’m expecting Kirby to show up on Switch 1 in some way – it’s been two years since Return to Dreamland Deluxe – either through a remaster of a fan favorite like Kirby Planet Robobot or an entirely new game. I also think it could be time for Nintendo to wheel out some of its smaller series and I’ve got a feeling in my bad knee that Rhythm Heaven could finally make its Switch debut this year in a similar fashion to Rhythm Heaven Megamix showing up on 3DS after the Switch was already out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Could Next Level Games Show Up?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Luigi’s Mansion 3 developers Next Level Games have put out a new game every three years since 2013. The studio’s last full game was Mario Strikers: Battle League in 2022, meaning 2025 is the year for its next project if this development cycle pattern is to continue. It could be time for Luigi’s Mansion 4 on the Switch successor but given how much Mario I already think is in the cards for 2025, I could also see this game getting unveiled at some point for a release sometime in 2026. While I definitely think some studios will continue developing games for the older Switch hardware, I firmly expect to see Next Level Games’ new project on the next console and wouldn’t be shocked if we get a glimpse of it in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Nintendo’s Entertainment Endeavors Continue</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Nintendo is much more than a video game company at this point and it has some solid entertainment plans lined up for 2025. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-nintendo-world-to-open-at-universal-epic-universe-in-2025-with-donkey-kong-country-and-a-mine-cart-ride">Super Nintendo World is set to open in Florida this May</a> and it includes the Donkey Kong Country expansion that’s currently exclusive to Universal Studios Japan. And Nintendo is opening its second stateside retail store when Nintendo San Francisco opens at Union Square sometime this year.  scheduled to hit theaters in April 2026 so I’m guessing we’ll get the first trailer for the sequel sometime before the year is up too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s everything we expect from Nintendo in 2025. Are you ready for the Switch 2 or are you still excited about the Switch 1 games we know about? Let us know in the comments. And for everything else Nintendo, switch with IGN.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Undanuted</em> by Osprey Games, is a series heralded as perfectly blending a deck-building game with wargaming elements. The series of games first started in 2020 with <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, and rather than start with a review of the original game, we're going to work backward from the latest game, and the only one so far set outside of the World War II setting, <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>.</p>

<p>Although we haven't covered <em>Undaunted</em> on the site before, we have covered several of Osprey Games' titles, including the brand new <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action 3rd Edition</a></em>, copublished with Warlord games, and also some of their awesome supplements for their miniatures agnostic system,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frostgrave-wildwoods-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-4.jpg?itok=OMaS-DsI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-4.jpg?itok=Rwqi5oNQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Breakers, backed up by a mining drill, have a coordianted approach against the LFA troops in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Undaunted 2200 Callisto?</h2>

<p>In <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>, players draw 4 cards from their deck each turn and then use those cards to play actions from the tokens they have on the board, such as moving and attacking. Certain cards also allow you to draw more cards from your supply, or move cards from your deck to your supply, allowing you to tailor your deck as you play. New tokens can also be added to the game board as you draw new units into your deck. Some tokens have multiple cards that can activate them, with the cards having the same unit or squad name, but representing a different individual in that unit or vehicle.</p>

<p>This card system, as well as working for actions, also controls a unique damage system. As a unit takes hits, you must discard a matching card from your hand. If you don't have a matching card in your hand, you discard one from your discard pile, and if there isn't one there too, you discard it from your deck. If you can't find the card at all, the unit is eliminated. This can put real pressure on going first in the turn and focuses you on picking your targets. If a unit you have the card for in your hand is hit, then you discard the card and you might not be able to activate it this turn. It also adds a nice hidden element as you and your opponent try to work out how many cards units have left, and which is the optimum target to hit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-5.jpg?itok=YKVtEzN8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-5.jpg?itok=t6V0aXNu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Most troops in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto&nbsp;</em>have multiple cards, representing the various troops or operators in a unit. In the image above we can see the 5 members of the huge LFA Centurion mech.</figcaption></figure><p>Introduced in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>, which wasn't in the previous games, are maps with different elevations. These are handled extremely well, with tiles that are higher than others, but also with tiles that have bridges across. If an elevated element is on the same tile, then the units on the two different elements can't engage. But if you are shooting at an adjacent tile from an elevated position, then you change from using the standard 10-sided dice (D10) to 12-sided dice (D12), and if you are shooting at an elevated position, you drop to an 8-sided dice (D8). This mechanic simulates the advantages and disadvantages of shooting from and at elevated positions well, without making things too complicated.</p>

<p>Most of the game box is taken up with 4 large double-sided game boards, of which each has 1 of the 8 scenarios printed on them. The scenarios are designed to be played through in order, increasing in map size, force size, and complexity as you move through. But you are able to play any scenario you wish. The game can also be played cooperatively 2 v 2, with each player taking one of the listed groups, or solo for which there is a separate rulebook, with 8 scenarios, with rules for playing against both of the included forces.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-3.jpg?itok=FX5pzJ3e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-3.jpg?itok=1lPZ6XDn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The highground is king in&nbsp;<em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto.&nbsp;</em>In the image above, the Stalker would roll a normal D10 to hit the Nailgunner, but would roll the better D12 against the Ripper who's on a lower elevation, and the Ripper in turn would only roll a D8 against the Stalker.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does Undaunted 2200 Callisto Have Different Factions?</h2>

<p><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em> has 2 playable forces. The&nbsp;Inter-Jovian Mining Union (IMU), known as the Breakers, who are the combined workers and unions, united against the corporation, the&nbsp;Lunar Frontier Authority (LFA), and their hired security staff. They used to work together in harmony, but poor conditions and a focus on profits over the workers and making the mining colony a reasonable place to live has led to strikes and riots, which the LFA are looking to quell.</p>

<p>The 2 forces do have slightly different playstyles. The LFA has fewer token troops and has 5 mechs that use card standee figures rather than tokens. The Breakers have more troops, and 2 vehicles, the Drill and Hauler. These slightly different forces gives the impression of the Breakers swarming the LFA, with the slightly less limited LFA troops having to support each other, especially the mechs. Both sides do feel balanced, but I would recommend giving any new players you're playing with the Breakers (unless the really want to be the LFA) as they're slightly easier to pilot.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-6.jpg?itok=EryP76Ur 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-6.jpg?itok=oLCoO4XZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both the LFA and Breakers have a unique thematic feel based on their avialable action cards in&nbsp;<em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>How Does The Blend Of Deck Building And Wargaming Feel In Undaunted 2200 Callisto?</h2>

<p>The blending works extremely well. The way damage works with removing cards, and the limited card draws each turn means there are always tactical choices to be made. You need to use a scout action before you can move into a square, so there is a chance you might get an awkward draw and not be able to move forward because you don't have a scout card, which can really hamper your mobility, especially if you're opponent really hammers down on your scouts, but it's not common, so doesn't break the game.</p>

<p>I love the damage mechanic (using your hand and deck as health is my favorite mechanic in any gaming system), but there doesn't feel like much agency to it, and I wish there was a choice of where you lost the card from, with different repercussions depending on where you lose if from. It can feel oppressive when your opponent hammers down on a unit and negates your turn because of a poor draw. Again, it doesn't happen often, but it can happen simply because of the deck mechanic. You are of course, able to do this to your opponent too, and that's what made it enjoyable for me. It's not a matter of taking out your opponent's best unit, you need to pick your targets and stop them from scoring objectives, along with limiting their movement and options.</p>

<p><i>Undaunted 2200 Callisto </i>is a very interesting blend of board, card, and wargame, which offers some great moments and some surprising narrative depth in the 8 scenarios it includes. It's not super deep, but you can feel the difference between the Breakers and the LFA, and over the campaign, you can really get behind their motives. Solo works well, although somewhat predictably as each of the enemy units has a fixed flowchart of actions it takes, which makes it feel more like a puzzle than a strategy wargame. The 4 player coop is fun and actually has a nice way of streamlining the draws with the smaller decks, rather than feeling restrictive with smaller forces. I really hope that we see an expansion to <em>Undaunted 2200</em>, either through another faction or 2, or more troops for the IMU and LFA. Even though the maps are fixed, they do offer a lot of replayability if more forces were to be added.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Undaunted 2200 Callisto?</h2>

<p><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em> has some interesting new elements for veteran <em>Undaunted</em> players, along with all the mechanics that you know and love, in a new setting. New players will find this version approachable if they're not behind the WWII theme of previous games. Wargamers might not like the randomness and control of the deck system, as it can feel extremely restrictive if you're coming from a purely wargaming background, and takes some getting used to. If you're looking for a super technologically advanced sci-fi setting, then <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em> does feel like WWII in space, even though both forces do feel thematically unique (and not like 2 countries fighting), the weapons and equipment still feel very modern, and combat feels very close.</p>

                <p>Capcom released an absolute gem of a game this year. No, I'm not talking about Dragon's Dogma 2, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, or Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection--all of which hit shelves in 2024. And you didn't miss a stealth release in the Resident Evil, Street Fighter, or Monster Hunter series. Alongside three major well-received releases, Capcom released an off-beat game filled with ghosts, Japanese tradition, and strategic job assignment: Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess. This game was released in 2024, but it feels like it was sent forward from 2004--in all the best ways.</p><p>No one is going to blame you for having missed it. To say it flew under the radar is an understatement, and Capcom said in a recent financial briefing that the game did not meet sales targets. But Kunitsu-Gami should be treated as almost a historical document, both in the way the game is designed and in its actual content.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414274-kunitsu-gami-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414274" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414274-kunitsu-gami-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414274"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414274-kunitsu-gami-02.jpg"></figure><p>As the warrior Soh, you have to protect the divine maiden Yoshiro so that she can purify the defiled mountain, freeing villagers to help you in a sort of worker-management real-time-strategy game that takes you in a zig-zag path down the mountain and through all manner of monsters and ghosts plucked from Japanese folklore.</p><p>The rhythm of the game is simple: By day, you'll rescue villagers, restore tower defense-style obstacles, and try to get Yoshiro as close to the gate as possible without bringing her so close that she becomes endangered. You'll also assign the villagers roles like Woodsman, Archer, Ascetic, Sumo, or one of many other classes. At night, you'll defend Yoshiro with the help of those villagers, managing the villagers to make them effective and keep them safe. Once you've stopped the monsters, everybody does a dance to purify the gate.</p><h3>Classic Design</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414275-kunitsu-gami-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414275" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414275-kunitsu-gami-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414275"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414275-kunitsu-gami-04.jpg"></figure><p>Many games these days are designed to appeal to as many people as possible and provide dozens or even hundreds of hours of gameplay, often advertising piles of DLC and in-game currency that costs real-world money. Kunitsu-Gami feels silent by comparison. There's one piece of DLC, and it's free even for the Game Pass players--some simple Okami-themed cosmetics, such as a charm that causes grass to grow behind you when you walk, that both looks like something straight out of the 2006 Capcom classic and that feels of a piece with the look of Kunitsu-Gami. There's nothing extra to buy, unless you count the soundtrack, which is available on Steam.</p><p>The game itself is linear, giving you an increasingly difficult playlist of stages and a growing stable of character classes to assign. You can go back and replay levels for additional rewards, but they're optional. The game is challenging, but it never asks you to fiddle around with collecting knick-knacks, clearing towers, or whatever else. It's just a strategy game, and that alone makes it somewhat harder to approach. It isn't a variation on a well-trodden set of gameplay mechanics and themes. Kunitsu-Gami asks the player to learn a new set of systems as they manage their villagers and resources, and to do that in a world of folklore that will be entirely new to many Western players.</p><p>The whole game feels like it was somehow delayed by 20 years and only just came out now, but that's not a dig on it--the opposite, in fact. Publishers similar in size to Capcom just don't make games like this anymore.</p><h3>Traditional Art</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414276-kunitsu-gami-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414276-kunitsu-gami-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414276"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414276-kunitsu-gami-03.jpg"></figure><p>Beyond feeling like a welcome trip to the gaming of days past, Kunitsu-Gami aesthetic looks backward as well, but into Japanese folklore and tradition. Many games reflect the place in which it was made, but Kunitsu-Gami takes this to another level. Kunitsu-Gami is steeped in Japanese art.</p><p>The movements of Soh, Yoshiro, and the villagers are pulled from Kagura ritual dance, including Soh's sword combat moves. You can find woodblock prints telling you about the different monsters you fight. The designs of the monsters themselves mimic traditional art of yokai (ghosts) and bakemono (monsters) in Japanese woodblock art. Where games like Nioh and Ghost of Tsushima are interested in immersing you in their worlds and making you feel like you're the guy having the adventure (a totally valid approach!), Kunitsu-Gami presents a world that feels like a diorama of a fairytale. Photorealism is the last thing on its mind.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-atP9Csjhw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B-atP9Csjhw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The music, too, finds inspiration in traditional children's songs and rhymes, and uses a combination of traditional Japanese instruments and modern Western instruments to create a fusion of sounds that feels historical without being limiting. You can present Yoshiro with traditional Japanese confections made by real confectioners. The team behind the game took those confections and scanned them into the game in extreme detail to capture the look and feel of the food. Much of the architecture and clothing also comes from physically crafted objects, all created with an eye toward authenticity to the art itself. The game may be a digital creation, but the things that inspired it are historical and physical, and so the art in the game is, too.</p><p>Just making sense of Kunitsu-Gami from an artistic perspective is a tall order, and you could spend dozens of hours studying each element and still come back with questions. It's steeped in historical Japanese culture, with such attention to detail that it might as well qualify as a piece of Japanese historical preservation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414278-kunitsu-gami-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414278-kunitsu-gami-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414278"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414278-kunitsu-gami-01.jpg"></figure><p>Even the marketing for Kunitsu-Gami reaches back into Japanese history, as Capcom partnered with a Bunraku troupe for part of the game's advertising. Bunraku (puppet) theater is one of the oldest forms of performing art in Japan.</p><p>When I think about Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess as a physical game, I don't imagine a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X label on the box. In their place is a PlayStation 2 or 3 label, or maybe even a GameCube one, and I'm in my first apartment, playing it at midnight when I have class the next morning. Despite being a new game, Kunitsu-Gami is an artifact from another time in the best way.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

<p>Alongside the countless story missions available—both in the single-player campaign and in Red Dead Online—the multiplayer mode features countless ways to earn decent money fast. You could, for instance, sift through treasure maps, take part in free roam events, earn money by completing daily challenges, take on the trader role, do delivery missions, and overall maximize efficiency to earn quick money to beat the vast majority of players economically.</p>



<h2 id="h-go-treasure-hunting"><strong>Go Treasure Hunting</strong></h2>



<p>If you’d rather not get your hands dirty as a lawless gunslinger in the Wild West or don’t feel like taking part in the often-lengthy story missions of Red Dead Online, then consider locating treasure maps and becoming a defacto treasure hunter instead!</p>



<p>You can earn treasure maps in several ways, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Leveling Up</strong> — Rockstar Games is kind enough to provide the occasional map when you level up. More specifically, every five levels. The maps are in the camp lockbox or at the local post office.</li>



<li><strong>Gang Hideout Challenges </strong>— If you finish off a gang hideout in Red Dead Online, you can earn a map by taking down the boss or via a lock box at the very end of the missions.</li>



<li><strong>Outlaw Passes </strong>— If you pay for one of the Outlaw Passes in Red Dead Online, you’ll occasionally receive maps via the Benefits page.</li>



<li><strong>Posted on Trees</strong> — While exploring the world in free roam, you may stumble upon treasure maps stuck to various trees. The tree in question will appear illuminated, and you can snag the map and find the treasure chests for yourself.</li>



<li><strong>Treasure Hunters</strong> — Scattered about the world of Red Dead Online, you’ll stumble upon other treasure hunters. These NPCs are out there earning money, sometimes very good money, and they’ll sell you a map for a few dollars. Or, you could take it at gunpoint! After all, the in-game economy works at the end of a barrel sometimes.</li>
</ul>



<p>While perhaps not the fastest way to earn money in Red Dead Online, becoming a treasure hunter can be fantastic fun, especially from a role-play perspective.</p>



<h2 id="h-become-a-bounty-hunter"><strong>Become a Bounty Hunter</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most lucrative and enjoyable ways to make money in Red Dead Online is by tackling the bounty hunter role. You can earn decent money in Red Dead Online by taking on bounty-hunting missions posted throughout the massive game world. You’ll track down targets and can even earn weekly bonuses to earn the most money.</p>



<p>It’s simple! Alongside tracking down bounties, including legendary bounties, you can earn higher rewards by looting fallen enemies to make more money faster. Then, you can buy something powerful, like a bolt action rifle. With the said rifle, you can snipe your bounty and their bodyguards from afar before moving in to loot.</p>



<p>Speaking of legendary bounties, numerous story missions are associated with the bounty hunter role in Red Dead Online.</p>



<p>But first, you’ll have to pick up the Bounty Hunter License in Rhodes. The usual cost for the role is 15 Gold Bars, though various promotions may discount the total price in Red Dead Online. Then, you can tackle bounty-hunting missions from various Bounty Posters scattered about the game world, all of which will earn you money, gold, and experience.</p>



<p>Then, if you want to acquire the Prestigious Bounty Hunter License to tackle new ranks and acquire high-level items, and new skills, you’ll have to pay 30 Gold Bars. This license will also unlock Infamous Bounty Targets, which prove more lucrative overall.</p>







<h2 id="h-loot-gang-hideouts"><strong>Loot Gang Hideouts</strong></h2>



<p>There are various rewards for completing gang hideout missions in Red Dead Redemption 2, especially if your goal is to earn huge amounts of cash. Most hideouts are completely manageable solo, meaning you can earn money through bounty hunting, then buy a few powerful weapons and clear hideouts with ease.</p>



<p>Once all is said and done, you can scoop up the cash from the fallen bodies and perhaps even complete a few daily challenges for taking down foes along the way.</p>



<p>What’s the best way to take down a hideout, you ask? Personally, I would recommend utilizing a strong weapon like the repeater. It offers an excellent range advantage along with a high rate of fire to take down numerous foes without putting yourself in harm’s way.</p>



<p>Furthermore, each time you complete a hideout, you’ll earn a treasure map from the camp’s leader. The treasure map will spawn either on the corpse of the fallen commander or via a nearby lockbox, which usually contains some cash, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-play-free-roam-events-and-missions"><strong>Play Free Roam Events and Missions</strong></h2>



<p>As a multiplayer open world, Red Dead Online features countless free-roam events, and the occasional story mission, to help players earn money fast. If making money is the end goal, then why not have fun along the way by taking part in, say, the Showdown Series or horse races event?</p>



<p>You can quick join free-roam events throughout the game to earn money fast in Red Dead Online.</p>



<p>If you’re a new player to Red Dead Online, then the Rockstar-hosted events can be quite lucrative. These often weekly events usually offer double money and gold for Free Roam Events, with rewards handed out for completing specific challenges.</p>



<p>If you play online in a party, then tackling missions and events together is the easiest way to earn money quickly in Red Dead Online. It’s also a lot more enjoyable than tracking and killing NPCs to sell their meager inventories to the traders.</p>



<h2 id="h-take-on-a-player-role"><strong>Take On a Player Role</strong></h2>



<p>Along with the Bounty Hunter role is the Specialist Role, Naturalist Role, and Moonshiner Role. These unique in-game roles in Red Dead Online can help you earn a gold bar now and then, pick up raw materials to sell, acquire a fishing rod to catch lucrative trout and other wildlife, and gain a reasonable amount of cash in the game.</p>



<p>Of the three previously mentioned roles, the Moonshiner Role proves most effective at earning cash in-game. It does take some start-up, however, as you’ll have to complete a story mission or two, along with opening the business and acquiring supplies.</p>



<p>To make the best moonshine, you’ll have to pay upfront. Once you do, that little shack will begin to earn cash fast in Red Dead Online. Along with crafting moonshine, you’ll also take part in Bootlegger Missions, which will reduce the cost of production overall. But in doing so, you will contend with other players. Someone could easily grief your efforts. Or, you could pay out of pocket, though doing so will eat away at your profits.</p>



<p>Furthermore, invest in the upgrades! More potent moonshine will earn you more money per sale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-return-of-dragons-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there's anything that I enjoy more than Dungeons… It's Dragons, so I was incredibly happy to hear that Wizkids was releasing a set of miniatures to represent the initial <em>D&amp;D 5E</em> adventure, <em>Tyranny of Dragons</em> (aka <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen </em>and <em>Rise of Tiamat</em>). <em>Wizkids Dungeons &amp; Dragons Icons of the Realms Return of the Dragons</em> features a variety of minis that will help you bring your <em>Tyranny of Dragons</em> campaign to life.</p>

<p>Much like other releases this collection is made up of a number of blind boxes, featuring a variety of minis relevant to the campaign alongside some much larger stand alone minis representing the different dragons that you'd face along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wizkids sent us eight of the blind boxes to take a look and try our chances at getting some cool minis, and cool minis we did receive. Included in this set the minis obtained ranged from stand-ins for player characters, minis for key faction members, a healthy number of dragons, and even some impressive Giant characters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-more-monsters.jpg?itok=NVRe4oJp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-more-monsters.jpg?itok=X09LwDyk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of the stranger minis we obtained</figcaption></figure><p>Inside each Blind Box you'll find 3-4 miniatures, normally one is a medium-sized mini while the others are smaller tucked in around the plastic frame.</p>

<h2>Choose Your Character</h2>

<p>From the blind boxes I obtained, I ended up with seven different generic enough characters that could become player characters. These were:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Barbarian (13/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Gnome Wizard (1/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Halfling Bard (2/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Hobgoblin Fighter (12/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Orc Fighter (10/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Orog Fighter (14/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Svirfneblin Fighter (4/44)</li>
</ul><p>While there was an interesting lead towards Fighters I was really impressed with the variety of species that was present. Players might not be familiar with an Orog (offspring of an Orc and Ogre) or might not know that Deep Gnome's proper title is Svirfneblin but it prompts players to take a playable race and see what tweaks they can make to make them more unique to the experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-player-characters.jpg?itok=y192VcW3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-player-characters.jpg?itok=Ra98pOHa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A nice assortment of minis to be any new player's first PC</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the melee characters wields an axe or sword, the wizard with their staff, and the Bard poses playing their violin ready to support the party with all kinds of magics and inspiration. While there are set names for each of these I could imagine just as easily the characters like the Hobgoblin being a Paladin, Rogue, or even a Ranger allowing it, and each of the others to fit into any table.</p>

<p>Of all of these, my favorite is the Orog, standing two heads over the Orc (even if more hunched) the comparison really allows you to understand how the Ogre blood would alter this creature. The blueish hue of its skin against its dark armor and axe makes it a very imposing figure.</p>

<h2>There Be Monsters In Them Boxes</h2>

<p>The offering of opponents for a party to fight against was also incredibly healthy. I got standard enemies – like Kobold (5/44), Bugbears (21/44), Needleblight (11/44), and a Wraith (23/44) – alongside some key members of different factions that play a larger role in the story. A Sun Elf Guard (9/44), Dragonclaw (20/44), Human Zhentarim Bandit (18/44), and a Red Wizard (34/44).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-monsters.jpg?itok=62OG_aRY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-monsters.jpg?itok=jh7nhG5j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fun fodder to throw at your party</figcaption></figure><p>Going through the blind box approach for the standard bad guys is a bit of a rough go. You'll get one or two Red Wizards, but when an encounter calls for 3, 4, or even 10 of them you're not going to want to be going to these blind boxes for the answer.</p>

<p>On top of those already mentioned other monsters that I got were the Quickling (3/44), Doppelganger (8/44), Mind Flayer (35/44), Manes (7/44), Guard Drake (22/44), and even a Ballista (19/44).</p>

<h2>Large And Up</h2>

<p>From the medium and larger monsters I received I was incredible happy. The Oni (25/44) and Pegasus (28/44) were unexpected to receive, but what I did get was a healthy amount of dragons.</p>

<p>Inside my eight blind boxes I received four different Dragons (kinda). I got the Young Blue Dragon (41/44), Young Green Dragon (31/44), Young Copper Dragon (32/44), and a Wyvern (29/44). If I was purchasing this expansion dragons of a variety would be what I was after and in that sense this expansion completely delivered.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-the-dragons.jpg?itok=SCfQKSO1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-the-dragons.jpg?itok=x_JnhSzO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even more fun to cause a low level TPK</figcaption></figure><p>On top of the range of dragons included I was most impressed by the range on their poses. The seated Copper and Green Dragons flare their brilliant wings out or keep them close respectively, while the Blue Dragon is in mid-flap allowing it to powerfully ascend.</p>

<p>Bigger than the dragons are the Hill Giant and Frost Giant (that come in two easily assembled pieces). With strange body proportions and unique armor styles both of these are incredibly eyecatching. While not as unique as some of the giants that came with the Bigby Presents collection these are going to get far more versatile use on the table.</p>

<h2>A Classic Assortment Of <em>D&amp;D</em> Minis</h2>

<p>Something that I loved so much about Tyranny of Dragons when I ran it was that it was a quintessential <em>D&amp;D</em> adventure. You have all kinds of hallmark monster encounters, dark cults, strange wizards, and a battle to stop the world being taken over by evil dragons. That same vibe is alive through the array of miniatures available in this blind box.</p>

<p>For a new DM wanting to start out their collection of higher quality minis there's a lot here that will be useful like the player characters of different races, different fodder enemies for along the way, and a few great setpiece monsters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-giants-and-beasts.jpg?itok=jw3zALYK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-giants-and-beasts.jpg?itok=Qk7FchBn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For when you want to shock them</figcaption></figure><p>As I said above you'll never have the consistency for a multi-monster encounter, but if you can even show your players what one Red Wizard looks like, while filling the rest of the ranks with a Bugbear or Bandit then it creates a more visually enticing experience.</p>

<h2><em>Wizkids Return of the Dragons</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Return of the Dragons</em>, much like the campaign it's based on, is a quintessential collection of minis that are incredibly versatile and appealing for any game you're going to be running. With a good collection of characters for players to take on, interesting yet frequently faced monsters adding repeated use, and dragons for your <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> game there's a lot here.</p>

<p>The major complaint that I have, with any blind box, is that it puts everything up to chance. For a campaign where there is a 10 Red Wizard encounter, or even one where you need 3 then you're going to have issues fielding the team.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/28/game-of-the-year-2024-best-nintendo-switch-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-the-year-2024-%E2%80%93-best-nintendo-switch-game.1070424/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/28/game-of-the-year-2024-best-nintendo-switch-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>This time next year, we’ll hopefully be talking up a storm about the delights of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, how Nintendo has handled their own cross-gen transition and the games that have straddled the generations. With that in mind, 2024 has felt like Nintendo playing for time, leaning heavily on remakes and remasters once again – trawling the GameCube and 3DS libraries for inspiration – though with a clutch of new entries in beloved series that absolutely had the capacity to delight and surprise. Notably, the princesses got to step out of the shadow of Nintendo’s leading men and have adventures of their very own.</p>

<p>One of the longest-running jokes in video games came to a head this year as Zelda finally got to star in her own adventure, with Link having to play second fiddle for once. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> could so easily have been a character transplant with Zelda picking up sword, shield and boomerang just as Link would – and Zelda has been a badass warrior, pirate, ninja and more in the past – but as is often the case, Nintendo and developer Grezzo sought to do something a little bit different.</p>
<p>Leant the ability to summon objects and creatures, and attach to them in multiple ways, everything from simply navigating the world to fighting enemies becomes a magic-infused puzzle, lending this game its own distinctive tone and style. Sure, it does fall back on classic Link combat in short bursts, but for the most part you summoning blocks of water to swim through, attaching to a spider that will then clamber up a wall or over a tree for you, setting field alight with an arsonist Zol, or simply stacking beds in gravity-defying fashion to create a set of stairs.</p>
<p>It’s thoroughly enjoyable and a wonderful surprise that has us keen to see Zelda step into the limelight much more often in future.</p>

<h2>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island –&nbsp;Runner-up</h2>
<p>So many roguelikes and dungeon crawlers place an emphasis on build-crafting, and how the emergent gameplay experience can be dished out through satisfying skill combinations or optimized weapon upgrades. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/23/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-review/">Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island</a> is a delight because your build, and your optimized run, and your upgraded gear are all affected by the environment you find yourself in and the way the elements of the game-world naturally bounce off of each other.</p>
<p>Like the chemical reactions in Breath of the Wild that cause burning grass to create flight-enhancing wind gusts, there are layered systems in this game that crash together in consistently unexpected and hilarious ways. It’s an excellent twist on the usual number-crunching ethos of the modern roguelike, and perfect for a quick commute play-session on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><em>– Miguel M</em></p>
<h2>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Nintendo’s approach to remasters and remakes has been fairly scattershot on Nintendo Switch (outside of quickly porting across all the major Wii U games in the first few years of its replacement’s arrival), but as part of that, they’ve also struck a rich vein of 20-year-old games from the GameCube era.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-review/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> transplants what is widely considered to be the very best Paper Mario game into a modern game engine, giving it a buff and polish to help it stand up alongside more modern titles on the system, and in doing so gives us a perfect reminder of why Mario RPGs are so beloved, with all the quirkiness and charm of the story and character alongside the original Paper Mario combat style.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24317154/nintendo-switch-best-games-2024-top-10-goty<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>This holiday season is the swan song for the Nintendo Switch. Nintendo told us as much when it said a long-awaited Switch successor <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">would be announced by April 2025</a>. But Nintendo thankfully didn’t get a case of senioritis as it looks to graduate to a Switch sequel, as 2024 had a litany of excellent titles come to the nearly eight-year-old console. So we’re taking a little look back at some of our favorite games on the Switch for 2024. One of the great things about this year’s offering of Switch titles is that they all should work on the follow-up to the Switch — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">since Nintendo confirmed its next generation will be backward-compatible</a>. (And hopefully any performance issues of games on the current Switch will be resolved when playing them on the next model, if we’re so lucky.)</p><p>We all have to remain patient as we continue to wait for the Switch’s successor, but these games are without a doubt worthy of playing during your current Nintendo console’s final months in the limelight.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a></h3></p><p>I know there are a handful of us on staff for which <em>Balatro</em> was our personal Game of the Year, and I don’t think any of us are gamblers or big fans of poker. That’s the beauty of this indie roguelike; you don’t have to be a stan of card games or know a thing about poker to enjoy its unique dopamine rush. From the music and sound effects to the lo-fi visuals, <em>Balatro</em> hits all the right notes to sink in its hooks and lock you in. You’re likely to find yourself muttering “just one more run” many times over. Next thing you know, it’s 3AM and the baby will be up in just a few hours — or perhaps that last part is just me.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24258654/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-edit-dungeons-links-awakening"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a></h3></p><p>Princess Zelda finally got her own game, allowing you to play as her full time in a Legend of<em> </em>actual Zelda. It <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch">may not be perfect in its execution</a>, but it’s a worthwhile adventure where Zelda solves puzzles and defeats baddies by summoning previously defeated enemies and everyday objects.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey"><em>Animal Well</em></a></h3></p><p>There’s an air of mystery about <em>Animal Well</em> that may <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey">entice you</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162572/animal-well-platforming-difficulty-bigmode">straight-up confuse you</a>. If you’re the type that loves forgoing any guides and figuring everything out on your own, there’s a really good chance you’ll love this pixelated 2D platformer. It blends a bit of <em>Mario</em>-like jumping puzzles with a Metroidvania sense of open exploration and adventure — complete with some mysterioso vibes.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Fellow Traveller Games</cite></p></div><p><h3><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173629/12-new-indie-games-play-right-now#:~:text=Hit%20%26%20Run%3F-,1000xResist%3A,-Many%20critics%20have"><em>1000xResist</em></a></h3></p><p><em>1000xResist</em> takes place in a postapocalyptic world where humanity is driven underground by the arrival of an alien race. You play Watcher, one of many clones of a young girl who is somehow immune to the mass disease brought by the alien Occupants. And of course, all is not what it seems. It’s capital-S, capital-F sci-fi for sure.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24287092/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a></h3></p><p>It’s been a big year-plus for <em>Mario</em> RPGs. But after the remake of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23960646/super-mario-rpg-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario RPG</em></a> and the remaster of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162364/paper-mario-rpg-nintendo-switch"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>, <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership </em>shows us that our favorite plumbing duo can still keep things fresh in the roleplaying space. <em>Brothership </em>has a lighthearted and playful story, fun turn-based combat, and an adorable art style. You can sum up how charming this game is with a singular, two-worded game mechanic: Luigi Logic.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24267805/neva-nomada-studio-interview-gris-devolver"><em>Neva</em></a></h3></p><p>Be prepared to feel feelings. <em>Neva</em> is the most recent indie from the developer of<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137844/gris-review-nintendo-switch-pc-gaming"><em>Gris</em></a>, and in addition to being a lovely work of visual art, it tells a story about caring for a baby fox that’s sure to make some folks weep (especially if you’re a parent).</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/marvel-vs-capcom-fc/en-us/"><em>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</em></a></h3></p><p>“I wanna take you for a ride.” And what a ride this classic fighting game collection is, encapsulating the various Marvel and Capcom crossover 2D fighters and even including <em>The Punisher </em>beat-’em-up that kick-started the long-running collaboration. This best-of compilation is worth the price of admission just to finally get <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</em> on modern consoles, complete with online play.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035933/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> was the earliest gem of 2024, coming out way back in January. Fast-forward to October, and Ubisoft sadly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277630/ubisoft-ends-future-development-on-its-best-game-in-years">disbanded its development team</a>. But <em>The Lost Crown</em> remains an amazing side-scrolling Metroidvania / Soulslike mash-up with some challenging (yet fun as hell) combat and platforming. And while the game world is quite large, with lots to explore, the game respects the player’s time by offering helpful in-game tools — like pinning screenshots to the map.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24131275/pepper-grinder-review-devolver-digital-pc"><em>Pepper Grinder</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Pepper Grinder </em>is a unique 2D platformer that has you traverse its colorful sprite-filled world with a drill, dolphin-diving into and up from the ground. The game’s key mechanic feels frenetic and extremely rewarding when you expertly traverse the world’s obstacles via the violent path of your drill and fallen enemies. It then ups the ante later by adding a grappling hook. Be still my beating heart. (No, really, the fast action gets my heart rate up at times — in a fun way, not in a concerning way.)</p><div><p><cite>Image: Annapurna Interactive</cite></p></div><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24157530/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-switch-steam"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a></h3></p><p>If you’ve ever enjoyed an escape room, you’re likely to dig <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>. Its slick black, white, and red art style and eerie setting fill the game with a sense of mystery, and its challenging puzzles are sure to tickle your brain. Just be prepared to take notes, so as not to feel overwhelmed when the game makes you think outside the box — or do basic math.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What were the highs and lows, the disappointments that left us bereft and the surprises that reignited our love for games? And, importantly, how did Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo navigate this awkward period in which all of their consoles are several years old but not quite ready to be replaced just yet? (Nintendo’s Switch successor is coming soon, the company has confirmed, but has yet to officially announce or show off the device.) Well, we’ve spent much of this past week considering these very questions. Now, for your reading pleasure, please enjoy our answers, as we all take a moment to catch our breath before we find out just what 2025 has in store.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-multiplayer-game-of-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Multiplayer games live and die by the experiences they offer — gameplay, features, and the community surrounding them. It takes something truly exceptional to shine in a crowded field. Enter Helldivers 2. Combining fun gameplay, diverse missions, and a thriving community, this game didn’t just check the boxes — it nailed them. That’s why it earned the title of Insider Gaming’s Best Multiplayer Game of 2024.</p>



<p>In a poll held on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>, the results spoke volumes. Helldivers 2 dominated, capturing 47% of the votes while Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 came in second with just 23%.</p>



<p>So, what makes Helldivers 2 the definitive multiplayer experience of the year?</p>



<h3 id="h-a-game-built-around-unity-and-chaos"><strong>A Game Built Around Unity and Chaos</strong></h3>



<p>At its core, Helldivers 2 thrives on its unparalleled sense of community. The premise is simple yet brilliantly executed: spreading democracy, one battle at a time, alongside thousands of other players working toward the same grand objectives. Whether you’re toppling robot regimes, escorting citizens to safety, or obliterating Bile Titans, teamwork is the name of the game. Success isn’t just rewarding, it’s downright euphoric.</p>



<p>And then there are the moments that keep players coming back for more. Maybe it’s the flawless execution of a mission, where everyone plays their part like a well-oiled machine. Or perhaps it’s the chaotic hilarity of failure like a teammate accidentally triggering a mine that you laid or an unexpected ambush leading to utter mayhem and friendly fire. Every session is a mix of camaraderie and comedy, making even defeat an unforgettable experience.</p>



<p>Unlike many multiplayer titles, Helldivers 2 offers a dynamic, player-driven story. There’s no predetermined ending here as your actions shape the game’s future. Each day’s decisions ripple through the universe, influencing what happens weeks or even months down the line. This evolving narrative keeps the stakes high and ensures there’s always a reason to return to the battlefield with friends.</p>



<h3 id="h-why-helldivers-2-stands-above-the-rest"><strong>Why Helldivers 2 Stands Above the Rest</strong></h3>



<p>What truly sets Helldivers 2 apart is its emphasis on connection. Arrowhead Game Studios nailed the delicate balance of making players feel like a cog in a massive, universe-spanning machine, while still letting them revel in personal and team triumphs. It’s a rare feat that few multiplayer games achieve so seamlessly.</p>



<p>Whether you’re chasing victory or laughing through chaos, Helldivers 2 delivers on all fronts.</p>

<p>Sony’s neverending success is sure to carry on in 2025 with another stacked schedule already planned. Between PS5 exclusives and major third-party releases, it’s going to be a big year, so let me take you through the biggest PlayStation games set to launch in 2025. </p>



<p>As a PS5 owner, I’m always eager to know what’s next. I’ve invested serious time into big-time PS5 titles this year: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-is-releasing-for-pc-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rise-of-the-ronins-ps5-pro-update-is-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rise of the Ronin</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a>, and more. The nature of the games industry means there’s little time to dwell though, and I’m already looking ahead to what 2025 has in store.</p>



<p>2024 was somewhat tame compared to 2023, but if the stars align, I feel 2025’s biggest games could usurp them all.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-ps5-exclusives-coming-in-2025">Biggest PS5 Exclusives Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>As it stands, there are only two major PS5 exclusives with official release dates for 2025. This can change at a moment’s notice, but we’ll go with what we know for now.</p>



<h3 id="h-ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I can already tell it’s going to be breathtaking. Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is set after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, and Sucker Punch Productions has lofty expectations to meet. The acclaimed studio has brought us Sly Cooper, Infamous, and its newest franchise is the most ambitious of the lot. Ghost of Yōtei is set to grant players more control over the narrative’s twists and turns, and the PS5 is sure to make Feudal Japan look as flawless as possible.</p>



<h3 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What bizarreness awaits this time? Credit to Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure>



<p>The only PS5 exclusive we know for sure destined for 2025 is Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. The sequel is the brainchild of Hideo Kojima again, and the Japanese visionary only knows how to conjure the weird and wonderful. Trailers and gameplay features have revealed many returning characters and various malevolent forces. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-only-30-40-complete-says-hideo-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kojima has indicated a 2025 release</a> is likely, and it could end up being one of PlayStation’s biggest exclusive launches of the year.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-2025-ps5-games">Biggest 2025 PS5 Games</h2>



<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I’m so excited. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>As a lifelong PlayStation main and DOOM lover, I was really scared for a while I’d seen the last of new DOOM software on PS5. However, due to the insistence of id Software, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> releases simultaneously on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. I don’t even need to say much about The Dark Ages itself. It’s DOOM, it’s the over-the-top FPS action we all know and love, and it has a gun that chews up skeleton heads and regurgitates them as destructive bullets. Book the day off for this one.</p>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s go, Lucia. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whereas you need to book a week off for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-about-grand-theft-auto-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft A</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-about-grand-theft-auto-6/">uto 6</a>—if it meets its rumored 2025 launch window. GTA 5 broke countless records—and continues to do so—and has made Rockstar more money than it knows what to do with. GTA 6 is expected to be bigger in every conceivable way, and it can shatter all expectations and records. IF GTA 6 comes out in 2025, it would automatically make the year when one of the best ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A PS5 release is happening. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like DOOM: The Dark Ages, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle’s future on PS5 was looking bleak. The Microsoft and Bethesda deal put the fate of many titles in doubt, but The Great Circle is getting a PS5 release. Given the title’s glorious reception and its testament to the Indiana Jones name, PS5 owners are in for a treat when it eventually comes to PlayStation 5.</p>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Action is going to be intense. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>2025 is one of the biggest years for Ubisoft in recent memory. Its 2024 was nothing short of disastrous and even catastrophic. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-xdefiant-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant is shutting down</a>, and Skull and Bones and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws bombed</a>—leading to layoffs. Meaning, the company needs a hit soon. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the first of Ubisoft’s ambitious plan to release at least two new Assassin’s Creed games a new year for the next 10 years. Here’s hoping the famed franchise can bounce back and deliver classic stealthy, sneaky, sleuth-like action!</p>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Give me bazillions of guns. Credit to Gearbox Software</figcaption></figure>



<p>The world is ready for a new Borderlands game. I’ve loyally played every single iteration—even the Tales spin-offs—and I’m not going to stop now. It’s true, the series’ staple of gun loot and gameplay is becoming stale, and I don’t think Borderlands 3 managed to replace Handsome Jack—or come close. However, one unfortunately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminally-ill-fan-played-borderlands-4-and-said-it-was-amazing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ill fan has tried out the latest sequel</a>, and it bodes well for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>. If Gearbox can reinvent the wheel, Borderlands could be back, baby.</p>



<h3 id="h-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I’m a Snake. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>The story of Naked Snake and his rise to the top begins with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. 2025 is expected to welcome the fully-fledged remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and you already know it’s going to be good. Featuring the original voice lines—including the ever-iconic David Hayter—and paying homage to the 2004 story, Delta: Snake Eater means we’re eating good.</p>

			<p>In September 2023, the existence of a new Xbox controller was <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-controller-to-feature-haptics-and-speakers-like-ps5s-dualsense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a> due to the inadvertent sharing of an internal Microsoft document as part of the FTC vs. Microsoft legal fight. The controller, codenamed Sebile, would feature improved wireless, direct-to-cloud connection, Bluetooth 5.2, new modular thumbsticks, replaceable and rechargeable batteries, and other minor improvements. The big addition, though, was the DualSense-like haptics feature.</p>
<p>Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer did not hide <a href="https://wccftech.com/dualsense-controller-praised-by-microsofts-head-of-gaming-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his appreciation</a> for the PlayStation 5 controller when it launched alongside Sony's console in late 2020. A few months later, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/dualsense-controller-praised-phil-spencer-xbox-controller-updates-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> the concept while also teasing that Xbox would have to catch up in this area. The document leak proved he was very serious about that. However, since there haven't been any official updates on the topic, there was no way to know whether the project bore fruit. After all, it could have easily been canceled.</p>
<p>Fans needn't worry too much about that. Tech4Gamers <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/microsoft-patents-movable-haptic-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> a newly published <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US444401677&amp;_cid=P22-M4Z00G-73974-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patent</a> clearly linked to the Sebile Xbox controller. The patent was originally filed in late August 2023, just before the aforementioned FTC leak. Here's the patent's abstract:</p>
<p><em>A device configured to generate haptic feedback is disclosed. The device includes a housing, a connector, and a haptic motor. The connector includes a mount end coupled to the housing and a distal end spaced away from the mount end. The haptic motor is coupled to the distal end of the connector. Activation of the haptic motor causes the haptic motor to move relative to the housing to generate the haptic feedback.</em></p>
<p>Moreover, Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-new-sebile-controller-breaks-cover-in-this-new-patent-and-we-now-know-what-that-the-weird-grippy-trousers-are-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">followed up</a> by adding that the new Xbox controller is definitely still on the way. However, it is now planned to launch alongside the next Xbox console. Microsoft chose not to invest in a mid-generation refresh like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro</a>; they are instead all-in on the forthcoming generation, which Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> would bring the biggest technical leap ever seen in a console.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are some <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wild rumors</a> that Microsoft could launch the new hardware earlier than Sony, perhaps as soon as 2026, to get an advantage over its competitor (the PlayStation 6 is currently believed to be targeting a 2028 debut). If that's the case, then the Sebile Xbox controller might not be that far off, either.</p>

<p>One of the defining traits of the ARPG genre is the abundance of loot you’ll acquire by clearing zones. Some of it proves helpful, and most of it’s junk, but a game like Path of Exile 2 also features many extras. You’ll find copious amounts of currency, cards, waystones, essences, and more. It’s too much. Sooner rather than later, you’ll need to buy the best stash tabs in Path of Exile 2 to sort your inventory!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-stash-tabs-to-buy-in-poe2">The Best Stash Tabs to Buy in PoE2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>You don’t have to spend much money to enjoy Path of Exile 2. The occasional cosmetic to help the studio with ongoing development costs certainly helps, and I’m more than guilty of buying cosmetics in PoE. Still, you’ll get your money’s worth more so from the stash tabs. A few to invest in include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Premium Stash Upgrades</strong>: You can upgrade your current stash tabs from standard to premium for relatively cheap, allowing you to customize the tab with various colors, affinities, and names to help you better sort through your copious amounts of gear.</li>



<li><strong>Currency Tabs</strong>: Path of Exile 2 features an insane amount of currencies to sift through, and having a dedicated tab allowing you to sort the general and exotic game currencies will help with crafting and upgrades in the future.</li>



<li><strong>Map Tabs</strong>: The more you play PoE2, the more areas you’ll unlock as part of the extensive end game. To ensure you can sort through all of the zones and maps, a map tab allows you to hold maps and waystones more efficiently.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-where-to-buy-stash-tabs">Where to Buy Stash Tabs</h2>



<p>The best way to buy stash tabs in Path of Exile 2 is from the in-game menu. Pause the game and open the menu, then select Microtransaction Shop. It will bring you to the store tabs, where you can find Stash Tabs as one of the top choices. Enter the category, and here you’ll find the various stashes available to you, all of which will cost money via points.</p>



<p>Before you start spending, however, keep in mind that developer Grinding Gear Games often holds sales, allowing you to buy stash tabs and other microtransactions for significantly cheaper than their going price.</p>

This option is available to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers and lets them play a large library of games across multiple devices, including tablets, phones, and TVs. However, as of 4:30 p.m. ET today, Xbox doesn’t seem to have a timetable for when streaming will be back up and running for everyone.</p><p>On December 26, about an hour after the outage started, Xbox support tweeted out that the company was “aware” that “users may be experiencing issues launching Cloud Gaming titles.” The account told people to check on the official Xbox status page for updates. Since then, things haven’t improved much. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1872673740628140318&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1872673740628140318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On December 27 at 10 a.m. ET</a></span>, the company posted a follow-up claiming that users might see a long wait time displayed when launching a game on the cloud, but that this wait time wasn’t accurate. However, checking the comments on the post and elsewhere, it still seems like people can’t even connect and play games on their phones or other devices. As of 3:30 p.m. ET, the Xbox support page states: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“We’re close to resolving the issue.”</a></span></p><p>I expect the issue will be resolved, likely a few hours after this post goes live (or sooner). But the timing couldn’t be worse. </p><p>This holiday season, Xbox really pushed the idea that its cloud streaming option <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/IYBSNQLsBKk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/IYBSNQLsBKk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could replace a console</a></span>. You didn’t need an Xbox if you were a Game Pass subscriber with phone or a smart TV. You could just stream all those games instantly. And as a result, I imagine that this Christmas season saw a lot of kids and teens get Game Pass subs so they can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cloud-streaming-owned-games-50-list-pc-1851704063?_gl=1*1le1ck1*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTMzMDI5NS4xODMuMS4xNzM1MzM0MjYyLjU1LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cloud-streaming-owned-games-50-list-pc-1851704063?_gl=1*1le1ck1*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTMzMDI5NS4xODMuMS4xNzM1MzM0MjYyLjU1LjAuMA..">stream games without their parents having to buy a pricey Xbox</a></span>. </p><p>A lot of people are probably experiencing cloud streaming for the first time this holiday season and, well, this outage is a very blunt reminder that while you can stream games on your phone, it ain’t an Xbox. An Xbox can work without an internet connection, and it can play your games offline. A phone can’t. Maybe Xbox should make that more clear in all those cute ads promoting every device as an Xbox? </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
