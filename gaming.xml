At least some of the remaining Private Division employees are expected to be laid off in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, which states that a currently unnamed company staffed by former Annapurna Interactive employees has reached a deal with private equity firm Haveli to take over the distribution of Private Division titles. Bloomberg reports and IGN can independently confirm that Haveli <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/private-division-sold-to-unknown-buyer">is the company that purchased Private Division from Take-Two Interactive last year for an undisclosed amount</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The portfolio includes both current and upcoming Private Division titles, such as Tales of the Shire, which releases March 25. It also includes Project Bloom, a AAA action-adventure game developed by Game Freak that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-bloom-pokemon-game-freak-private-division">announced back in 2023</a> with nothing more than a concept art teaser.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/pd-gf-projectbloom-conceptart-3840x2160-1683657401083-1736271759393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Concept art for Game Freak's Project Bloom, formerly published by Private Division.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bloomberg reports, Haveli's purchase of Private Division included not just the portfolio, but 20 employees who remained with the label <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division">following Take-Two-implemented layoffs last spring</a>. Remaining employees have reportedly been told to explore other employment options, with the expectation that at least some of them will be laid off as part of the deal with the unnamed new publisher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Private Division was formerly Take-Two's publishing label, which the company founded back in 2017. It was intended to support independent games that were smaller than the fare typically supported by the Grand Theft Auto publisher. Over the years, Private Division produced titles such as The Outer Worlds, OlliOlli World, and Kerbal Space Program 2, but game sales repeatedly fell short of Take-Two expectations. Early last year, we reported that Take-Two was slowly shuttering operations at Private Division, first by winding down operations at its supported studios and then by selling off the label.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new owners of Private Division's portfolio are a group of former employees of Annapurna Interactive that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/annapurnas-entire-gaming-team-has-resigned">collectively resigned last year</a> following a leadership dispute at Annapurna. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-heck-has-been-going-on-at-annapurna-interactive-an-investigation">reported last fall on the messy circumstances</a>, which left Annapurna seeking to restaff an entire publishing team to cover its numerous obligations and roughly 25 individuals seeking new employment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Parkour has been an important part of the Assassin's Creed franchise from the beginning, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will be making some adjustments to the acrobatic running style. Ubisoft has already hinted that Naoe--one of Shadows' new leading characters--can Naruto run in the game. But that's just the beginning of what she can pull off while running.</p><p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4TA6gKaTvtOC1mOjZIxCZd/assassins-creed-shadows-parkour-system-overview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared an extensive breakdown</a> of Shadow's new parkour options, as well as the revised button map for the game. One of the most notable changes is that the crouch and the dodge buttons have traded places. That will allow the player to either crouch or lie in a prone position. Naoe can even kill her targets while lying prone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTuL0Ob2EnU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uTuL0Ob2EnU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Yasuke--the game's other lead character--and Naoe can both perform dodges while crouched, but only the latter can pull off a dodge in her prone stance. The other new parkour moves that Naoe can pull off include a wall-run eject and a backward dodge, which you can see below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXehGq8UkuM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WXehGq8UkuM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Some of the parkour and climbing moves can be performed by both Yasuke and Naoe, but she's more suited for those because she's light on her feet and able to pull off a recovery roll while falling.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Yq6RcLE8Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/33Yq6RcLE8Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The developers also noted that not every wall surface in the game will be climbable for either character. The grappling hook can help players overcome some of those areas, but they will also have to be on the lookout for surfaces that have physical handholds to grab.</p><p>For players who don't want to deal with romances or branching narrative paths, Shadows will have a Canon Mode, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-can-make-all-of-the-big-choices-for-you/1100-6528401/" data-ref-id="1100-6528401">will make the big story decisions for you</a>.

A few of the details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-battle-pass-allegedly-leaks-showing-off-futuristic-and-mythological-cosmetics/1100-6527789/" data-ref-id="1100-6527789">the game's battle pass</a> have leaked online, and Ubisoft has stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-clarifies-rumors-about-animus-hub-the-new-name-of-assassins-creed-infinity/1100-6527804/" data-ref-id="1100-6527804">the rewards in the Animus Hub will be free</a>.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on February 14, 2025.</p>

            <p>
While some handheld gaming PC manufacturers are busy cornering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acer-unveils-dubiously-portable-nitro-blaze-11-handheld-gaming-pc-with-1095-inch-screen">comically large form factor market</a>, Lenovo has slipped in to announce several new - and considerably more portable - devices of its own, including the Legion Go 2 and a handheld utilising SteamOS.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the Legion Go 2, that's Lenovo's currently still-in-prototype second generation handheld gaming PC, which - alongside its built-in kickstand and ergonomically improved detachable controllers - sports an 8.8-inch OLED display with VRR support, and comes equipped with either the upcoming AMD Ryzen Z2 or Ryzen Z2 Extreme. It can also sport up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD storage, to further boost its beefy credentials.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there's no hint of a release window or price for the Legion Go 2 just yet, with Lenovo instead choosing to focus its attention on its other newly announced handheld gaming PC: the more modest, and more imminently available, Legion Go S.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
The Legion Go S offers a sleeker alternative to Lenovo's earlier Legion Go, doing away with the former's detachable controllers in favour of a more rounded all-in-one design. It features an 8-inch, 16:10 IPS LCD screen with multi-touch support (most specifically, a 120Hz variable refresh rate display running at 1920 x 1200) alongside hall-effect thumbsticks, a redesigned D-pad, and dual stage triggers.

As for the insides, Legion Go S includes either an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or Z1 Extreme processor, and can be equipped with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD. All this lives inside a 299mm x 127.6 x 22.6 shell and weighs upwards of 730g - around 90g heavier than Steam Deck. Lenovo tells <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">The Verge</a> it's targeting two to 2.5 hours of battery life for demanding games.

<p>
Lenovo's first Legion Go S model begins shipping this month, costing £649.99/$729.99 with the Z2 Go processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It'll be followed in May by a slightly lower-specced £600/$599.99 variant, featuring the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 1TB storage. Both machines utilise Windows 11, but Lenovo is also working on a SteamOS-powered Go S, making it the first authorised third-party handheld gaming device to utilise Valve's operating system. This is the cheapest of the bunch, costing $499.99 with the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 512GB storage - and The Verge reports it should also arrive in May.
</p>
<p>
For anyone with an eye on the slightly more distant future, however, Digital Foundry has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-amd-announces-next-gen-ryzen-z2-apus-for-gaming-handhelds">taken a look</a> at AMD's newly announced trio of next-gen Ryzen Z-series APUs - the kind that'll be packed into Lenovo's second generation Legion Go 2 - if you're curious to learn more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/warframe-digital-extremes-balatro-vampire-survivors-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As we’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-1999-romance-dating-tennocon-soulframe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously established</a>, <em>Warframe </em>– originally a cooperative multiplayer shooter about space ninjas – now contains just about every system known to man. Fishing? Yep. Hoverboarding? Absolutely. A full-blown dating sim? Yes, thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr30oQoKeIo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recently-released <em>1999 </em>update</a>, <em>Warframe </em>even includes that. You might examine the game’s feature list and conclude that Digital Extremes is weeping, for there are no more worlds left to conquer. But in that regard, you’d be wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>During an interview in LA last month, I asked creative director Rebb Ford about the <em>Warframe </em>team’s pie-in-the-sky system ideas. What, I wondered, are the most off-the-wall mechanics they could plausibly implement? And where do the intimidatingly bounteous sci-fi opus’ limits lie?</p><p>"I like to think that it's usually a reflection of the things I'm actively playing," Ford told Aftermath. “And because I've played so much <em>Balatro</em>, I'm prone to say something with the cards [you use to modify equipment] beyond modding would be cool. But we do pitches. We look at, like, what if the mods in <em>Warframe </em>had a playable aspect to them? You get so close to committing, and then you're like 'Well, who's this for? And why are we doing this? So let's just focus on what people play <em>Warframe </em>for.' But yeah, the temptation is always there."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ford added that there’s a “shadow of a card game” that exists in internal documents at Digital Extremes, as well as a “shadow of a <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style thing” in design director Pablo Alonso’s build of <em>Warframe</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>"But I do feel like our responsibility as custodians of <em>Warframe </em>is to make things that the audience probably came for in the first place and take, like, one risk per update – like the dating system,” Ford said. “So measure and try, because if you stray too far, you end up making no one happy."</p><figure><blockquote><p>We look at, like, what if the mods in <em>Warframe </em>had a playable aspect to them? You get so close to committing, and then you're like 'Well, who's this for? And why are we doing this?'</p></blockquote></figure><p>As for additions that are unlikely to happen on Ford’s watch, she pointed to a regularly-requested feature: overhauled PVP.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have been tempted by redoing [PVP mode] Conclave,” said Ford. “I think true PVP, done better than we do, would be very difficult for us to commit to just because there's some things we're never going to change – like our networking architecture, dedicated servers, [etc]. We can't compete with the <em>Valorants </em>of the world, and I'd rather play <em>Valorant </em>or <em>Fortnite</em>, right? I'll just go play that and then come to <em>Warframe </em>for a totally different flavor. As heartbreaking as that might be for our Conclave community – I say this apologetically, not cavalierly – I just don't see us saying, like, 5v5 team fights are on the table.”</p><p><em>Warframe</em>’s teetering tower of systems might suggest a throw-shit-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks mentality, but maintaining the game is a careful balancing act. Some modern triple-A games boast development team sizes in the thousands, but not <em>Warframe</em>; Ford estimated that around 280 people are working on the game currently. Keeping it alive 12 years and countless updates after release requires careful planning.&nbsp;</p><p>"We typically try and have unique features with each major update we do, and if it's gonna be good and people like it and it has legs, we will push it into newer stuff,” said Ford. “We plan, but we plan to adjust. We already know all of [2025's] major updates, but what isn't started is where we have to add or remove things based on reactions to <em>Warframe: 1999</em>. … One thing we haven't accounted for is reception to [the dating sim and character interaction] feature. And if it goes over well – if, I would say, more than 80 percent of people really like it – we will need to change plans for [2025]. But if it's just a cool-enough thing that added to the world, we'll do what we have to do to make other features."</p><p>This approach, Ford believes, explains a common complaint in the <em>Warframe </em>community: Not every system in the game gets the same amount of attention, and some feel like they’ve been abandoned.</p><p>"I think abandonment is a fair perspective for some features,” she said. “It's in the eye of the beholder. Like 'Oh, they abandoned PVP.' Actually, yeah, we kind of did, because none of us at the new leadership level are playing PVP games. You don't want PVP made by me. You really don't. ... I think that's a reasonable truth to share with our players, and we do. And then the [features] that we want to come back to, we only talk about when we're sure."</p><p>“It’s a big game,” Ford added. “12 years of tech debt, and everything has to work. We do our best.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck"><h3>Too Big</h3></a><p>Unless you are a giant</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SteamOS was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">always supposed to be bigger</a> than Valve’s own Steam Deck, and 2025 is the year it finally expands. Not only will Lenovo ship <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">the first third-party SteamOS handheld</a> this May, Valve has now revealed it will let you install a working copy of SteamOS on <em>other </em>handhelds even sooner than that. </p><p>Pierre-Loup Griffais, one of the lead designers on the Steam Deck and SteamOS, tells me a beta for other handhelds “is slated to ship after March sometime,” and that you might discover the OS <em>just starts working properly</em> after that happens! </p><p>Griffais and his co-designer Lawrence Yang would not confirm which handhelds might just start working, though there are some obvious candidates: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">the company confirmed to us in August</a> that it had been adding support for the Asus ROG Ally’s controls. </p><p>Also, quite a few PC gamers have also discovered that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">Bazzite, a fork of Valve’s Steam Deck experience that I loved testing on an Ally X</a> and vastly preferred to Windows, also works wonderfully on the Lenovo Legion Go. There still aren’t that many handhelds out there at the end of the day, and I would think Valve would take advantage of work the Linux gaming community has already done on both.</p><p>Speaking of Bazzite, Valve seems to be flattered! “We have nothing against it,” says Yang. “It’s a great community project that delivers a lot of value to people that want a similar experience on devices right now,” says Griffais, adding later “In a lot of ways Bazzite is a good way to kind of get the latest and greatest of what we’ve been working on, and test it.” </p><p>But he says Bazzite isn’t yet in a state where a hardware manufacturer could preload it on a handheld, nor would Valve allow that. While users can freely download and install the SteamOS image onto their own devices, companies aren’t allowed to sell it or modify it, and must partner with Valve first.</p><p>There are some non-selfish reasons for that. Among other things, Griffais explains that the Lenovo Legion Go S will run the same SteamOS image as the Steam Deck itself, taking advantage of the same software updates and the same precached shaders that let games load and run more smoothly, just with added hardware compatibility tweaks. Valve wants to make sure SteamOS is a single platform, not a fragmented one.</p><p>“In general, we just want to make sure we have a good pathway to work together on things like firmware updates and you can get to things like the boot manager and the BIOS and things like that in a semi-standardized fashion, right?” says Griffais, regarding what Valve needs to see in a partnership that would officially ship SteamOS on other devices.</p><p>Valve isn’t currently partnered with any other companies beyond Lenovo to do that collaboration — Yang tells me the company is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337913/no-valve-isnt-working-with-gpd-to-bring-steamos-to-its-handheld"><em>not</em> working with GPD on official SteamOS support</a>, despite that manufacturer’s claim. </p><p>Valve’s also not promising that whichever Windows handheld you have will necessarily run SteamOS perfectly — in a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F593110%2Fview%2F529834914570306831">new blog post</a>, Valve only confirms that a beta will ship before Lenovo’s Legion Go S, that it “should improve the experience on other devices,” and that users “can download and test this themselves.”</p><p>As far as other form factors, like possible SteamOS living room boxes, Valve says you might have a good experience trying that. And partnerships are a possibility there too: “if someone wants to bring that to the market and preload SteamOS on it, we’d be happy to talk to them.”</p><p>Valve wouldn’t tell me anything about the rumors that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">developing its own Steam Controller 2, VR headset with wands</a>, and possibly its own living room box, but did tell me that we “might expect more Steam Input compatible controllers in the future.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lenovo has announced the Lenovo Legion Go S, the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-announces-steamos-is-available-for-third-party-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-party handheld</a> gaming PC to come with SteamOS installed instead of Windows. The announcement was made on Tuesday at CES 2025.</p>



<p>Launching in May, Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS will cost $499. The <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">handheld features</a> an eight-inch 16:10 touch display at 120Hz. Internal specs include a Lenovo-exclusive AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor,16GB of memory, 512GB of storage, and a 55.5Whr battery. </p>



<p>Other features include Wi-Fi 6e support, two USB 4 ports, and a MicroSD slot for expanded storage. Regarding battery life, Lenovo says that the Legion Go S should have 2.5-3 hours on a full charge, depending on the gaming being done.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As far as what’s gone from the original Legion Go, the new device no longer features a kickstand or detachable controllers akin to the Nintendo Switch. By removing these features and making the device slightly smaller, it brings the weight of the Legion Go S down to 1.61lbs.</p>



<p>The Lenovo Legion Go S will also launch with a version that comes with Windows preinstalled for those that prefer Microsoft’s operating system. The Windows version of the device will release this month for $729.99 and include 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. As with all Windows devices, Steam can be installed as a standalone application.</p>



<p>The Windows version comes in white while the SteamOS version comes in black.</p>

                <p>Nvidia finally revealed their next-generation RTX 50-series graphics cards at CES 2025, with some big performance improvements expected thanks to the new Blackwell architecture. But since 2020 and the launch of the RTX 20 series, Nvidia has been working on and expanding its range of AI enhancements as part of its DLSS suite of exclusive features, with its latest iteration, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ray-tracing-rtx-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DLSS 4</a>, set to propel both new and older GPUs forward.</p><p>DLSS 4's biggest new feature is one that will be exclusive to the new RTX 50-series GPUs. Multi Frame Generation is the next step in the Frame Generation race that Nvidia kicked off with the RTX 40-series range. Instead of just injecting a single, AI-generated frame between two traditionally rendered one, Multi Frame Generation now offers up to four AI-generated frames to be inserted, substantially increasing a game's frame rate. Nvidia says that its new GPUs can deliver nearly eight times more performance than "brute-force" rendering, but how well each generated frame looks and how this impacts input latency has yet to be determined.</p><p>Digital Foundry was given access to an engineering sample of the RTX 5080 and limited time to test Multi Frame Generation in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and came away impressed with both the image quality and fluidity of the experience.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpzufsxtZpA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xpzufsxtZpA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Perhaps more interesting are the DLSS 4 improvements that will be supported on all of Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Nvidia has updated its transformer model that powers DLSS Super Sampling, Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA for the first time, moving away from its previous convolutional neural networks approach. What this means is that its newer model is more adept at identifying parts of a rendered image that are important and with more granularity, offering up more stable upscaling and ray-tracing quality as a result.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423817" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423817"></a><figcaption>Breakdown of DLSS 4 enhancements for various RTX GPU generations</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg"></figure><p>DLSS Super Resolution (Nvidia's AI-enhanced upscaling solution), Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA will be improving thanks to this upgrade across all RTX hardware, starting with the RTX 20 series. Nvidia is also adding the ability to switch between specific DLSS releases from within its GeForce Experience application in the near future, which previously had to be manually done for each game if you wanted to experiment with newer DLSS versions that hadn't been patched in by developers. This can potentially give some new life to older hardware, at least from an image-quality standpoint.</p><p>There's no question that the headline feature for DLSS 4 is the one that only works on Nvidia's latest and greatest hardware, which starts shipping later this month and will be supported in over 75 games and apps immediately. But unlike the update for Frame Generation with the RTX 40 series launch, there's a lot more to get excited about for the many more already on Nvidia's platform.</p>

<p>Valve has announced that SteamOS is being made available and launched for third-party devices moving forward. The announcement comes alongside the <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal of the Lenovo Legion Go S</a> at CES 2025.</p>



<p>It also comes just months after Valve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-is-bringing-steamos-support-to-rival-handhelds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed that it was working</a> on bringing the operating system (OS) to other devices</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s website</a>, Valve says that the operating system was developed to “provide a seamless user experience optimized for gaming, while retaining access to the power and flexibility of a PC.” The OS isn’t available on other handheld devices yet, but Valve says the work being done for the Lenovo Legion Go S — which comes installed with SteamOS instead of Windows — will improve the operating system’s compatibility with other handheld PCs.</p>



<p>“Ahead of Legion Go S shipping, we will be shipping a beta of SteamOS which should improve the experience on other handhelds, and users can download and test this themselves,” Valve said. “And of course we’ll continue adding support and improving the experience with future releases.”</p>







<p>It’s unclear what other devices will be “powered by SteamOS” in the future, but it appears to be only a matter of time before they are announced. There’s also the recent rumors that Valve is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-pointing-to-a-new-steam-console-from-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working on bringing back Steam Machines</a>, a decade after they were first announced and released to consumers.</p>



<p>What do you think about Valve bringing SteamOS to other handheld PCs? Do you think it impacts the future of the Steam Deck in any way?

<p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will have ship to ship combat out in the open sea and in a large coliseum, ship boarding with combat, and ship customisation. Within the Pirate Coliseum players will take part in the Tournament of Captains, as well as other events including Quick Skirmish, Madlantis Mania, and Swashbuckler Showdown.</p>

<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio previously confirmed a new release date for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, with the game now set to be released on February 21st, 2025, bringing the release date forward by a week from the original date.

			<p>Today, Marvel Games and NetEase Games officially announced the details for the first season of Marvel Rivals. The season is titled Eternal Night Falls and will be adding some familiar faces to the ever-expanding roster of heroes and villains from the Marvel universe. The first season for this new Hero-Shooter will begin on January 10 at 9 AM UTC, where the Fantastic Four will be introduced to the game as playable heroes. Thus far, the title has <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/">been incredibly successful</a>.</p>
<p>The season will span over three months and will be divided into two halves. In the first half of the season, Invisible Woman and Mister Fantastic will be released. For those wanting Human Torch and The Thing, you'll have to wait until the second half of the season. Season 1 of Marvel Rivals is doing more than just adding superheroes to the game, as there will be three new maps for players to explore and learn when playing.</p>

Like many free-to-play titles with live service elements, there will be a Battle Pass for players to dive into. Compared to Season 0, this Battle Pass has over double the amount of content and rewards to get. These rewards consist of 10 costumes, sprays, and emotes to get your hands on to add some extra flair for the battleground. To purchase the Season 1 Luxury Battle Pass for Marvel Rivals, it will cost you 990 Lattice, where you will then get 600 Lattices and 600 Units as a reward for completing the Season 1 Battle Pass.</p>
<p>Compared to other games on the market right now, the team developing this title has made it so that the Luxury Battle Passes will never expire, with Tokens purchased with Lattice being retained under specific conditions. For those interested in what these terms and conditions consist of, the developers have created both a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20241225/40954_1202068.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Diary</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNiYrOSLYD4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Vision</a>, where you can read about it or watch a video that explains it.</p>

Personally, that’s part of the appeal, having 20+ ways to play, and not all of them rely on twitch reflexes and precise aim. But still, there are folks who are going to bounce off of all 20 of those playstyles, and just have to watch their friends play and laugh and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">bitch about Jeff</a></span> from a distance. But don’t worry. It’s not like those folks are starved for options. Here’s a few options for those folks who want to make theirs Marvel, without all that pesky K/D ratio talk. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-recommend-id="image://d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel and Capcom characters are arranged in a hero image." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Marvel and Capcom characters are arranged in a hero image." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-recommend-id="image://d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel and Capcom characters are arranged in a hero image." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ll grant, this is mostly just trading one labyrinthine set of mechanics for another that’s even more likely to result in you getting pieced up in infinite combos by someone who hasn’t seen the touch of a gentle hand or the light of the day star since Obama was in office. But the magic of the <em>VS</em> titles is just how much can be had just randomly screwing around with characters and team builds, and wacky moves without ever having to take the games online. Seeing Magneto, M. Bison, and Dr. Doom get absolutely destroyed by a team composed of a Little Red Riding Hood, a Japanese schoolgirl, and The Mad Titan Thanos is just one of those innate charms that never gets old, solo or with friends. Best of all, there’s now three different flavors of experience to be had, with the announcement that some absolute maniacs have spent a preposterous amount of time and energy into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXorZjVETFQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXorZjVETFQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revamping the reviled <em>Marvel vs Capcom Infinite</em> into a respectable game</a></span>. <br></p></div><div><p>Nothing about <em>Midnight Suns</em> is my jam on paper. Card-based/deck-builder games just don’t click with my brain, <em>Balatro </em>notwithstanding, and <em>Rivals </em>aside, real talk, there’s a lot of licensed Marvel trash floating out there to be avoided at all costs. And that’s to say nothing of the fact that I was around when the <em>Midnight Sons</em> arc started back in the early 90s, trying to cash in on the dark, and edgy undercurrent running through all comics, which was the style at the time. Even being the exact age when edgy comics should’ve hit my teenage brain like a wrecking ball, these guys just didn’t do it for me.</p><p>So when I tell you that I fell head-over-heels in love with <em>Midnight Suns</em>, you know how hard that game is working to get me to care. It helps that it’s from developer Firaxis, bringing its A-game to the strategic aspects of gameplay. But there’s also some absolutely delightful deep cut Marvel lore and character work going on there between the strategy. Fighting Lillith and whatnot? Sure, I guess. Making sure Blade and Carol Danvers hook up? I will MOVE MOUNTAINS. <em>Midnight Suns</em> was apparently a huge flop for Firaxis, but it’s never too late to get more people on that deeply underrated bandwagon. </p></div><div><p>Speaking of deeply underrated. It’s hard to blame anyone for giving Crystal Dynamics’ <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> game the side-eye after Square Enix’s <em>Avengers</em> debacle poisoned the well. Anyone who’s actually spent time playing it, however, knows the truth. <em>Guardians</em> is just a damn fine third-person action title that really puts in some serious work making the <em>Guardians</em> feel like a caring-but-dysfunctional family that Star-Lord has to manage. It helps, too, that Star-Lord is an infinitely more likable, thoughtful scoundrel than Chris Pratt who, even when faced with a crucial, branching choice, finds a way to keep his family together. It helps even more that he doesn’t get himself in a scenario where all he has to do is wait till the goddamn Gauntlet is off and then he can combo up Thanos all he wants but <em>nooooo, </em>he has to get his smackdown on while everybody else is trying to save the goddamn universe from being snapped, and because of him it fails, and it’s his fault, and he is scum and you know what, I may still have anger issues about that. Let me make note of that for my therapist.</p></div><div><p> It feels like all the rizz has gone out of this one since <em>Balatro</em> took its place as the de facto card game in everyone’s hearts this year. But make no mistake, the mobile card-battler is still going strong with constant updates, and is still just as fun as it’s ever been. In fact, the game’s current season includes a crossover with <em>Rivals</em>, bringing some of that game’s character art to the deck, as well as introducing Galacta into the mix. Sure, you’ll be bitching about balancing issues here too, but it’s hard to stay mad at a game you can be done with during the fifth time that accursed Wegovy commercial they keep running on a loop on Hulu plays out. <br></p></div><div><p>Of course, if you’re looking to cross enemy lines to DC, you’ve played all the <em>Arkham</em> games, and you value your time and dignity too much to play <em>Gotham Knights</em> and <em>Suicide Squad</em>, you can actually try something a little different that won’t demand much aside from time and commitment. <em>DC Universe</em> is one of the few survivors of that time when every studio wanted their own <em>World of Warcraft</em> instead of their own <em>Overwatch</em>. No game survives this long without having something going for it, and in this case, with <em>City of Heroes</em> effectively a ghost, superhero MMOs a dying breed altogether, and the price being right–as in, <em>free</em>–to fool around in a big expansive superhero universe that, while it does have the usual MMO grind problems, does understand its assignment as a DC superhero simulator.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, they didn’t. Look at this image of an adult male human holding this thing and tell me its portable. </p><figure id="" data-id="45183ccfa0ab887a297b3a774ea2b574" data-recommend-id="image://45183ccfa0ab887a297b3a774ea2b574" data-format="jpg" data-width="807" data-height="689" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Acer / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="45183ccfa0ab887a297b3a774ea2b574" data-recommend-id="image://45183ccfa0ab887a297b3a774ea2b574" data-format="jpg" data-width="807" data-height="689" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This isn’t an image I created as a goof. This is a real image from Acer and it makes me laugh every single time I look at it. Sure, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nitro Blaze 11</a></span> has two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm audio jack, a USB- A port (nice!), and a microSD card slot. It also includes solid internal specs with an AMD Ryzen 7 8840 chip, Radeon 780M graphics, 16GB of RAM and up to 2TB of SSD storage. </p><p>But come on, <em>look </em>at that image above. This might be a powerful gaming device, but it’s not portable. I mean, I guess if your definition of portable is simply “You can technically carry it around by yourself,” then sure, the Nitro Blaze 11 counts as a portable PC. Still, I’m not sold on the idea that many people will want a Steam Deck-like device that’s bigger than a cat. It goes against one of the biggest selling points with these things: You can take them anywhere and play all your games easily. </p><p>Acer seems to understand that this is probably not a product for everyone and will also offer smaller, more Steam Deck-sized portable PCs. The Nitro Blaze 8 features similar specs but with an 8-inch screen and will be priced at $900. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-its-first-handheld-gaming-pc-the-nitro-blaze-7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-its-first-handheld-gaming-pc-the-nitro-blaze-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A slightly smaller and less powerful Blaze 7</a></span> will also be available later this year for $800. </p><p>And for those of you out there who want to lug around a desktop PC crammed into a medium-sized container, the Acer Nitro Blaze 11 and its comically massive screen will be available for $1,100. At that point, you might just want to buy an actual gaming laptop.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Honestly, I’m disappointed that he can’t even make his terrible platforms worse in an original way, instead choosing to copy Musk’s moves and parrot Trump’s talking points.</p><p>Declaring that “the recent elections… feel like a cultural tipping point toward once again prioritizing speech,” Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1525382954801931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed</a> that the company will do away with <a href="https://x.com/AngieHolan/status/1876649209081839847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-party fact checking</a> in favor of community notes, a la Twitter. “The fact-checkers have just become too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they created, especially in the US,” he said. <strong>(Update 1:40pm--</strong><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/metas-fact-checking-partners-blindsided/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a> reports that fact-checking organizations didn't know Zuckerberg intended to end their partnerships.<strong>)</strong></p><p>As part of addressing this supposed bias, Meta will also be moving its trust and safety and content teams from California to Texas, with Zuckerberg saying that “I think [this move] will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams.” Elon Musk has also <a href="https://www.chron.com/culture/article/x-twitter-hq-texas-musk-19777426.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved his companies</a> to Texas, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1813290895334383820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">citing</a> political reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta will also remove restrictions around topics like immigration and gender, with Zuckerberg echoing every right-wing pundit ever in saying, “What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it’s gone too far.” In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corporate blog</a>, Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334432/meta-trump-friendly-policy-chief-joel-kaplan-nick-clegg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joel Kaplan</a> was a bit more obvious about who Meta is following here, writing (emphasis mine),</p><blockquote><p>We’re getting rid of a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate.<strong> It’s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms.</strong>&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>In line with this, Zuckerberg also said the platforms will <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/26/1240737627/meta-limit-political-content-instagram-facebook-opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring back</a> political content, saying, “It feels like we’re in a new era now, and we’re getting feedback that people want to see [political] content again,” which he says Meta will phase back in “while working to keep the communities friendly and positive.” This might ring your memory bells; <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1875355425601999255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Musk has also claimed</a> changes are coming to Twitter to highlight more of whatever it is he considers positive given his inability to feel human joy.&nbsp;</p><p>In closing, Zuckerberg went on about global governments censoring free speech and “making it hard to build anything innovative,” noting that “it’s been so difficult over the past four years when even the US government has pushed for censorship… But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I am excited to take it.”</p><p>Zuckerberg, like other <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/13/nx-s1-5227874/trump-bezos-zuckerberg-amazon-facebook-open-ai-meta-inauguration-fund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tech industry heads</a>, has donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. Hearing his mentions of “cultural tipping point[s],” bias and censorship, foreign government interference, and being in “a new era” after “the past four years,” it feels obvious whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">narrative</a> he, and by extension his platforms, wants to take up. His <a href="https://www.404media.co/facebook-deletes-internal-employee-criticism-of-new-board-member-dana-white/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent appointment of UFC CEO Dana White</a> to Meta’s board certainly drives that home.&nbsp;</p><p>None of this is new or surprising from him, but it’s so uncreatively depressing. At least Meta’s <a href="https://www.404media.co/instagram-begins-randomly-showing-users-ai-generated-images-of-themselves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent</a><a href="https://www.404media.co/metas-ai-profiles-are-indistinguishable-from-terrible-spam-that-took-over-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> debacles</a> over <a href="https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI</a> felt like uniquely Meta fuckups, leveraging Zuckerberg’s careless obsession with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66913551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest tech fads</a> and the user-driven nature of his platforms to bring his own twist to the <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-internet-is-full-of-ai-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">degradation</a> of the internet. This is just so nakedly the party line, so obviously an attempt to curry favor, that I almost feel bad for him as I watch him swim in his oversized tshirt in front of Silicon Valley’s characterless impression of wood, reciting whatever bullshit he thinks will make the big boys like him. It’s going to be such a stupid next four years. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck"><h3>Too Big</h3></a><p>Unless you are a giant</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
