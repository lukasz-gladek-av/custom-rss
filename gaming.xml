<p>G2 Esports was the front-runner to win the Six Invitational 2025 in Boston, but then the team ran into the underdogs. That’s part and parcel of the esports industry, and from one day to the next, it remains dramatically unpredictable.</p>



<p>In the group stage, G2 put up one hell of a result, coasting through the opening portion of the Six Invitational 2025 without dropping a single map – a record that no other team could replicate. However, going into the playoffs, the team faltered, falling short in back-to-back fixtures and being eliminated from the running.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-g2-out">G2 Out</h2>



<p>In the playoffs of the Six Invitational 2025, G2 Esports met its match <strong>twice</strong>, losing first to Spacestation and then again to Oxygen Esports in the elimination bracket. The Spacestation loss was tough enough, but Oxygen was barely in the running during the group stage and only just managed to secure qualification for the playoffs.</p>



<p>This huge loss was dealt with a strong blow, too – G2 failed to secure a point against Oxygen before imploding and dropping out of the $3 million flagship tournament.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the likes of M80, Shopify Rebellion, Team Liquid, w7m Esports, DarkZero, Virtus, and CAG all departed the competition.</p>



<p>Recently, drama struck the Six Invitational as <a href="https://x.com/R6esports/status/1889027697776456021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">M80’s coach exploded</a> against DarkZero’s roster, going on a tirade and exhibiting extremely aggressive behaviour. The act earned him a two-year competitive suspension and landed M80 with a $10,000 fine. To put that into perspective, M80 walked away from the tournament with just $55,000 in earnings.</p>



<p>Only eight teams remain in the Six Invitational 2025 lineup going forward:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team BDS</li>



<li>Spacestation</li>



<li>Razah</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>Oxygen</li>



<li>Unwanted</li>
</ul>



<p>The predictions have shifted, and now Team BDS sits in the top spot and is the odds-on favourite to win the event and the $1 million grand prize.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-helped-push-shift-up-to-a-record-breaking-year-in-2024.1105569/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-record-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Stellar Blade was released in April 2024, emerging to a solid reception and strong sales on PlayStation 5. It has since remained in the minds of fans worldwide, with developer Shift Up plugging away to keep the content stream relatively well stoked. From a festive-themed update to a Nier crossover event, Stellar Blade hasn’t been forgotten just yet.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=225&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial update</a>, Shift Up revealed that Stellar Blade was a key component in the company securing record-high revenue streams in 2024. The post-apocalyptic action title generated $43.2 million in royalties, and per the financial update, it ‘continues to sell well’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-hopes">High Hopes</h2>



<p>Stellar Blade will be expanding from the confines of PlayStation this year, with a fresh version of the game landing on PC. Shift Up has already suggested that the game will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-is-releasing-for-pc-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell even better on PC</a>, giving the IP a new lease on life.</p>



<p>In the last year that the game has been on the market, it has generated more than $40 million in royalties for Shift Up. At the same time, the company’s mainstay title, Goddess of Victory: Nikke, generated around $105.4 million, making up around 70% of the studio’s income.</p>



<p>Before Stellar Blade hit the market, Shift Up started talking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-dev-already-teasing-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about its next project</a>, which was later revealed to be dubbed ‘Project Witches’. It’s set to emerge in (or after) 2027, but nothing else is known about the game.</p>



<p>In a world being driven down by layoffs and studio closures, Shift Up plans to expand, hiring around 100 people by the end of 2025. The future looks relatively bright for this South Korean studio, and I for one am excited to see what comes next from the team.</p>

<p>Riot Games has signed a three-year partnership with the Esports World Cup Foundation to bring a trio of titles to the hyper-valuable event. From this year, League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, and most importantly, <strong>VALORANT</strong> will appear at the Esports World Cup event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>This will mark the first time that VALORANT has appeared at the event, as last year during the inaugural showcase, the game failed to surface.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-cultural-impact-of-competitive-gaming">‘The Cultural Impact of Competitive Gaming’</h2>



<p>The Esports World Cup is the biggest modern event in competitive gaming. It boasts a collective prize pool worth tens of millions of dollars, and it plays host to the industry’s biggest games and most talented players. For many, it’s an immoral event seen as ‘esportswashing’ and nothing more, but for others, it’s a monumental thing that’s set to become a staple of the wider business.</p>



<p>In a recent release, it was revealed that VALORANT will appear alongside League and TFT at the Esports World Cup 2025. During 2024’s event, VALORANT didn’t appear, so this will be the first time that the game has a place at the EWC:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Riot Games has <strong>shaped the cultural impact of competitive gaming</strong>, transforming esports into a global entertainment force.&nbsp;With League of Legends’ iconic World Championship — which continues to set new standards for immersive experiences, Valorant’s cultural collaborations, and Teamfight Tactics’ community-driven events, Riot has pioneered an ecosystem far beyond the competition. </p>



<p>By bringing these titles to the Esports World Cup, we are not just celebrating elite gameplay — we are, together, expanding esports as a global entertainment movement, creating deeper connections with fans across gaming, music, and digital culture</p>



<p>– Fabian Scheuermann, Chief Games Officer at EWCF.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Riot Games representatives explained that last year was an evaluation of sorts, and that’s why VALORANT wasn’t one of the games to appear at the Esports World Cup in 2024. In a post, the team explained, <em>‘The feedback we got from players and teams who participated last year was positive. The event’s significant prize pool offered crucial financial support for them, providing stability at a time when many esports organizations were working toward a stronger future.’</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/iconic-mmo-new-class-1997-tibia-monk/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-iconic-mmo-is-getting-a-new-class-for-the-first-time-since-1997.1105560/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/iconic-mmo-new-class-1997-tibia-monk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’ve been playing Tibia since 2004 – but not <strong>consistently</strong>. I’ll dip in and out of the game around special events, but it remains my number one most-played game of all time simply because of how long I’ve been a user. Recently, Tibia’s developer, CipSoft, revealed that <span>the game is getting a ne</span>w character class –&nbsp;<strong>Monk </strong>– for the first time in almost thirty years.</p>



<p>Those familiar with Tibia’s four-class paradigm are about to have their worlds shattered.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-monk">Enter the Monk</h2>



<p>CipSoft has unveiled Monk, an all-new character class coming to Tibia later this year. This humble MMORPG was released in 1997 with four core character pillars: Knight, Sorcerer, Paladin, and Druid. That structure has remained fundamentally unchanged for almost thirty years – until now.</p>



<p>With a very short trailer posted online, the CipSoft team revealed the Monk character class:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tibia - Vocation Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMzXYOz6o7I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>This new Tibia vocation promises to be a capable hand-to-hand fighter that can use ‘mystical abilities’ to heal allies while pummeling enemies into dust. Here’s the full description of the new character type:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Monk</strong>&nbsp;will be a melee fighter capable of supporting and healing allies while using martial arts and mystical abilities to defeat enemies. The great truth seeker will have some very special features, such as&nbsp;<em>harmony</em>,<em>&nbsp;virtues</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>serene</em>.&nbsp;A&nbsp;<strong>Monk</strong>&nbsp;can be played in a very special way and, at the same time, is expected to integrate seamlessly into the Tibian world. In fact, one of our main goals was to ensure that the new vocation holds a unique position without undermining the value of others or rendering them obsolete.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From February 25, CipSoft will be holding player tests for the Monk class, and later this year, the vocation will be permanently added to Tibia, which is still going strong after 28 years on the market.</p>



<p>It’s incredible to see CipSoft pouring so much love into Tibia after all these years. It was only a couple of years ago that the developers decided to add sound to the game, implementing audio effects and a soundtrack alongside countless other updates. The core aesthetic of Tibia has remained unchanged since 1997, but the game is still evolving today.</p>



<p>To learn more about the new Monk class,  check out the full breakdown from CipSoft’s ‘Niadus’ <a href="https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=latestnews&amp;id=8215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the Tibia website</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-playstation-network-outage-psn-ps5-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, PlayStation Network – the backbone of PS5 and PS4’s online services – <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/521195/playstation-network-down-outage-psn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went down</a> for roughly 24 hours. If we’re talking video game service outages in recent memory, it doesn’t get much longer than that. You’d think that Sony would want to provide some sort of explanation for such an unprecedented halt to basic functionality. But you’d be wrong.</p><p>After enduring a day of confused clamor across social media and Reddit, Sony published <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a brief statement</a> to Twitter on Saturday, gifting PS Plus members an additional five days of service and saying that PSN had “fully recovered from an operational issue.” What kind of operational issue? Did it come from inside the house, or were hackers to blame – like during the 2011 PSN outage, so noteworthy that it has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its own Wikipedia entry</a>? Unclear! But it’s over now, so who cares. It’s yesterday’s news. Move on.</p><p>Never mind that as a result of the outage, some people lost access not just to multiplayer games, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/521519/playstation-network-outage-psn-single-player-games-not-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">singleplayer games and features</a> – a stark reminder of the fact that <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-comfortable-owning-game-prince-of-persia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we don’t own our games anymore</a>, even as price tags grow and developer headcounts shrink. This also puts into perspective Sony’s insistence on shoehorning PSN requirements into PC ports like <em>Helldivers 2</em> and <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em>, which PC players openly rebelled against for the better part of a year until Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally relented</a> just a couple weeks ago with the PC release of <em>Spider-Man 2</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>In that case, too, Sony repeatedly failed to provide a compelling explanation for its actions. In May 2024, <em>Helldivers 2</em> was <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-psn-login-steam-review-bomb-arrowhead-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">briefly removed from sale on Steam</a> in 177 countries due to the PSN requirement, and yet, the best Sony could offer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4196868529806518741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the time</a> was a claim that PSN was necessary to “protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling the banning of players that engage in that type of behaviour,” something plenty of non-PSN games have proven perfectly capable of doing. Sony’s main objective is clearly to corral PC players into PSN’s ecosystem and monopolize their attention, but it refuses to just come out and say that. So now that requirements have failed, it’s dressing up its desire with <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-game incentives</a> like early unlocks of cosmetics that can already be obtained via other means.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Just like the PSN requirement, this new incentive-based approach feels almost insultingly low effort. Why should anybody make an account for a service with an ulterior motive that offers little benefit when the best Sony can do in the face of a worrying wobble is act like it’s all business as usual? Why would anyone <em>want </em>to be assimilated into that ecosystem if they can avoid it?&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing needs to work this way. Nobody benefits from not being able to access single-player games and features when servers go down. There is no upside to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-ea-paradox-launcher-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">logging into multiple game services at once</a> that outweighs the downsides. And being left in the dark about all of it – even if the underlying cause of major issues was relatively mundane – just leads to speculation and catastrophizing. It erodes trust.&nbsp;</p><p>But, contrary to the meaning of the term, services created by companies like Sony no longer seek to serve users; they are first and foremost means of control, extensions of the attention economy. When viewed through that lens, Sony’s actions here make sense. Control is a one-way street, not a relationship. You’ll take what you’re given, and you’ll like it. You’ll enjoy your five additional days of service, and you will not think beyond them.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-lynch"><h3>Fantasy At The End Of The World</h3></a><p>A new world is possible, but only if we log off and put in the work</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Almost all the major Capcom series are here, though don't expect many new titles. The picks mostly include HD remasters and collections of classic entries in series like Ace Attorney, Mega Man, Devil May Cry, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and more. One of the only major omissions is the Monster Hunter series--likely because Fanatical recently ran a separate Monster Hunter Bundle that is unfortunately no longer available.</p><p dir="ltr">The pricing structure is like Fanatical's other build-your-own bundle deals, with the price per key dropping as you add more games to your bundle. The savings aren't as high as most Fanatical bundle deals, but you're still getting big discounts on most titles. The deal starts at $13 for two games ($6.50 per key), three games for 19 ($6.33 per key), and four games for $25 ($6.25 per key).

These games follow Raziel, a vampire-turned-wraith on a quest for revenge against his maker, the eponymous Kain, across the fantasy realm of Nosgoth. Both games feature all-new graphics--with the option to swap back to the original PS1 and PS2 graphics on the fly--gameplay tweaks, and in-game galleries full of art and behind-the-scenes materials. While the physical editions are only available for PS5 and Nintendo Switch, you can also grab the digital version on all consoles and PC.

Hopefully, that means we'll see a new single-player entry in the series soon. Either way now is a great time to be a Legacy of Kain fan. Even better, it's also a great time to get into the series if you're new to the games, too, as most of which have been re-released on modern platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">The Soul Reaver duology only represents one chunk of the overarching Legacy of Kain timeline. The franchise started with <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fblood_omen_legacy_of_kain&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen</a>, which follows Kain's transformation into a vampire, and its events serve as the basis for the rest of the series and are even revisited--and reframed--by Soul Reaver's time-hopping plot. It was followed up with <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_blood_omen_2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blood Omen 2</a>, and while it's largely disconnected from the events of Soul Reaver, it furthers Kain's characterization and Nosgoth's history.

Fair warning that it ends on a cliffhanger--which is part of why fans have been pining for a new game in the series--but it at least offers some closure on the events of the Soul Reaver arc and is worth grabbing after completing the remastered collection.

This particular model boasts a massive 25,000mAh battery capacity, 165W of total charging output, and two built-in USB Type-C cables in case you forget to bring your own. It's also attractively priced at under $100, and there's even a deal today that drops the price by another $10 to $89.99. This is a great complement to your power-hungry gaming handheld PC like the Steam Deck, Asus Rog Ally, or Lenovo Legion Go.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Release: Anker 25,000mAh 165W Power Bank</h2><div catalogid="8479891f-e34a-4cd8-951d-5230aeb5aeed" id="215024"><div id="215024" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker 25,000mAh 165W Power Bank with Two Built-In USB Type-C Cables</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Anker power bank features a 25,000mAh battery capacity, which is the second largest capacity we've seen from Anker in a compact form factor. So how much juice will that offer to today's gaming handheld PCs? A 25,000mAh battery equates to a 95Whr capacity. An 80% power efficiency rating (which is standard for power banks) means you get about 76Whr of usable charge. That means this power bank will charge a Steam Deck or ROG Ally (40Whr) from empty to completely full <strong>2 times</strong>, an Asus ROG Ally X (80Whr) <strong>1 time</strong>, and a Nintendo Switch (16Whr) about <strong>4.75 times</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Anker power bank has one USB Type-C port and one USB Type-A port. In addition, there are two built-in USB Type-C cables. One is a retractable cable that can extend up to 2.3 feet. The other is a fixed 1-foot cable that doubles up as a lanyard when not in use. Each USB Type-C port is capable of up to 100W of Power Delivery with a total 165W maximum output. That means all three USB outputs are capable of charging any gaming handheld PC at its fastest rate, including the Asus ROG Ally X, which supports up to 100W of fast charging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another feature common to Anker's other premium power banks is the digital LCD readout. It displays a wealth of information like remaining battery capacity, current charging rate, input/output wattage, battery temperature, battery health, charge cycle count, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TSA-Approved</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">TSA states that power banks must be under 100Whr in capacity for carry-on (check-in is not allowed under any circumstances). This Anker power bank is rated at 95Whr. You might get checked simply because this is a relatively hefty power bank, but you shouldn't have any problems getting it cleared.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See more power banks we've recommended</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Chapter 6 has gotten off to a pretty strong start, adding new permanent modes with Fortnite OG and Ballistic, dropping a full-sized Godzilla on the island, and ushering in the game's Hatsune Miku era. But Chapter 6 Season 2 is just around the corner, bringing with it a whole new slate of attractions. With a few days to go before Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 starts, here's everything we know so far.</p><h2>When does Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 begin?</h2><p>Season 1 is currently scheduled to come to a close on February 21 at 11 PM PT/ 2 AM ET. That would mean that Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 should begin a few hours later on the morning of Friday, February 21.</p><h2>Will Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 1 have a live finale event?</h2><p>The Jan. 31 update added some interesting items to the Fortnite game files, including many indications that Season 1 <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1885260657940971852" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will end with some sort of ambient live event</a> on the battle royale island to bring the season story to a close. What exactly the event will entail is still a mystery, but the first stage of buildup has begun--the NPC Daigo has moved on from the spot in the Nightshift Forest where he's been battling demons all season and has taken up new residence by the unused portal in the mountains above Warrior's Watch, and that is where the big finale will go down.</p><h2>Fortnite chapter 6 Season 2 battle pass and season theme</h2><p>No part of the battle pass has leaked just yet, but we've got a big hint in the form of a theme: <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1886127448703533108" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reportedly</a>, Chapter 6 Season 2 will be <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1886129502956249167" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another heist season</a>. Fortnite has had a lot of heist seasons, including two different ones in Chapter 4. Since Chapter 6 already echoes Chapter 4 with the feudal theme and a throwback version of the Japan biome from that map--Seaport City is basically proto-Mega City in terms of its layout and structure, and the surrounding areas are very similar--the return of a prominent Chapter 4 theme isn't too shocking.</p><p>Epic Games co-founder Mark Rein has the seasonal tradition of teasing each upcoming season with a single word--his word for Season 12 is <a href="https://x.com/MarkRein/status/1889054637803593935" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"pickled."</a> We don't know what all that terms entails, but it likely has something to do with the Kappa Kappa pickle factory that was added to the map last month, and all those little posters there that appear to depict a pickled version of Peely. So I'd expect a big pickle man skin in the battle pass, at least.</p><h2>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 potential collabs</h2><p>Like we said above, there aren't any confirmed details yet about Chapter 6 Season 2 cosmetics. But there are some rumored collaborations coming up that may fall into Season 2. In particular, there have been reports of <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1885257390993342568" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cosmetics based on James Cameron's Avatar, </a>and <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1885281187586822448" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a customizable Iron Man skin</a>. Both of these leaked collabs could happen during Season 1, but I think that's unlikely for the Iron Man skin specifically because there are also rumors of new cosmetics tied to Captain America: Brave New World, which is in theaters on February 14.</p><p>It seems unlikely that Marvel would undercut its own timely collab for a skin that could be released literally any time, and a customizable Iron Man skin sounds more like a battle pass thing anyway, given the lack of style options we've seen among item shop collab skins for the past year. See, for example, the Iron Man Mk. 45 skin that Epic dropped in the shop last fall, which had no style options at all.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fortnite has been advertising heavily during WWE events lately, including Monday Night RAW in January, Royal Rumble on February 1, and also the upcoming Elimination Chamber in March. But none of the existing WWE skins have even appeared in the item shop in seven months and counting, so we're overdue for some wrestling content in Fortnite.</p><h2>Other rumors and leaks for Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2</h2><p>One particularly interesting change that Epic made with Chapter 6 was to allow players to use their Festival guitars and other instruments as pickaxes and back blings, dramatically increasing the hypothetical usefulness of those cosmetics--if you like hitting things with guitars, anyway. Now, reportedly, Epic is looking at doing something similar with kicks by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1887927606747500639" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">turning the shoes that certain skins are wearing into kicks</a>--meaning, for example, that buying the Green Roots Billie skin would also grant you her green and black Air Force 1 Mids as kicks to use on any skin.</p><p>Stick around as we'll be updating this roundup of Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 news, rumors, and leaks frequently as we approach the start date.</p>

"It discriminates against individuals based on their sex and, as to some, their transgender status. It is motivated by impermissible animus.

Normally $60 at full price, it’s currently just $15 with a 75 percent discount.

Deep sea exploration adventure <em>Beyond Blue </em>and tile-based strategy sim <em>Humankind</em> are both available to claim now through February 13 on PC for anyone with an Epic account. And while the current discount on it isn’t very notable (only 10 percent off), roguelike survival sim <em>Tankhead</em> is also worth a look. The game about using junk to craft the ultimate killing machine and take down giant<em> Shadow of the Colossus</em>-style bosses has plenty of rough edges, but also some really cool ideas and a beautiful visual style. </p><p>The only real bummer is that the Epic Games Store coupon hasn’t returned with the new winter sale.

Epic’s desire to bootstrap the process of creating a meaningful rival to Steam has been expensive. The coupons perk was seemingly the latest casualty of the company cutting back on giveaways. </p><p>The good news is that you can still get 5 percent back on all Epic Games Store purchases to spend on additional games (or <em>Fortnite </em>skins). </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>2025 is shaping up to be a big year for Nintendo, as the Mario company is launching a highly anticipated new system, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>. But the company isn't going to rely only on traditional hardware and games to find success. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has opened up on why Nintendo must push "beyond video games" to encourage people to engage with Nintendo.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings report</a>, Furukawa said Nintendo is making use of theme parks, official stores, "visual content," and mobile experiences to "generate interest in our core business." In case there was any doubt, Furukawa stressed that the "dedicated video game platform business" is Nintendo's core business, and efforts outside of that are being undertaken to funnel people back there.</p><p>"Going forward, even as we transition to Nintendo Switch 2, it remains important to increase touchpoints beyond video games," Furukawa said.</p><p>The executive said content and experiences for smart phones will play a "very important" role in this effort, and Nintendo will continue to push in this area, Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo's push into the mobile market has already reached some 900 million cumulative downloads, Furukawa said, noting that some of Nintendo's success in the smartphone business has come in countries and regions that don't have support for Nintendo's traditional game consoles.</p><p>"I believe this has increased the opportunities for more people to access Nintendo IP and characters," Furukawa said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="514835619"

with Pokemon Go company Niantic. Nintendo shut down online services for Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp at the end of 2024 amid a transition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-pocket-camps-microtransaction-free-version-is-out-now-for-10-doubles-soon/1100-6528152/" data-ref-id="1100-6528152">making it a paid game called Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete.</a></p><p>"Although we cannot provide details on future application releases, we are continuing to develop new game applications," Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo also has the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-music-app-provides-the-soundtrack-for-the-wait-for-switch-2/1100-6527499/" data-ref-id="1100-6527499">Nintendo Music app</a>, which launched in 2024 and continues to get updates that add new tracks. In general, Furukawa said Nintendo's aim is to use smartphone apps to "create opportunities for consumers to come into contact with Nintendo game worlds and music even outside of dedicated game systems."</p><p>He added: "Going forward, we would like to continue to develop these types of initiatives, including integration with games, for individual titles."</p><p>Furukawa acknowledged that, for many people, their first gaming platform is not a traditional console but rather a smart device. So Nintendo is trying to meet people where they are, with the assumption being that one day they might pick up a Switch console and games, in addition to whatever they might use and enjoy on their smart phone.</p><p>"We will continue to deliberate on this topic," Furukawa said.</p><p>Even before Furukawa was named president of Nintendo, the company acknowledged that a growing percentage of people first encounter Nintendo experiences outside of a platform that Nintendo sells. For example, previous president Tatsumi Kimishima said fewer and fewer young people are finding out about Nintendo games through... games. Instead, they're discovering Nintendo and its characters through things like <a href="http://www.armandhammer.com/personal-care/kids-toothbrushes/Products/spinbrush-mario.aspx" rel="nofollow ">officially licensed Mario toothbrushes</a>. He <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-mario-toothbrushes-and-other-licensing-de/1100-6434624/" data-ref-id="1100-6434624">said in 2016</a> that people can expect these kinds of licensing deals to continue and possibly increase, and indeed they have.</p><p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released in 2023, is perhaps Nintendo's biggest non-gaming success story so far--it brought in more than $1.3 billion at the box office. It is one of the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">top 20 highest-grossing movies in history</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/highest-grossing-video-game-movies-of-all-time/2900-3968/" data-ref-id="2900-3968">No. 1 video game movie of all time</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Those waiting for the Black Hawk Down campaign for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/delta-force/" data-ref-id="5000-621469">Delta Force</a>, the modern free-to-play revival of the classic FPS series, won't have to wait much longer. Developer Team Jade, a subsidiary of Chinese gaming giant Tencent, announced the paid DLC will launch February 21.</p><p dir="ltr">Delta Force's upcoming Black Hawk Down campaign is a remake of the 2003 shooter of the same name, it in turn based on a book documenting the real events involving a US military task force during the Somali Civil War in 1993. Team Jade released a brief teaser trailer alongside the release date to give fans an idea of what to expect, showing battles through the destroyed streets of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXnHhjWNxds" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pXnHhjWNxds" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Black Hawk Down campaign for Delta Force was originally slated to arrive in January, so its new February release date is actually a delay. As for how much the campaign will cost, Team Jade has not officially said just yet. Team Jade states in the description for the campaign's launch teaser trailer that more details will be coming in the following days. In a development diary Q&amp;A from last year, Team Jade said the campaign DLC will not feature microtransactions and can be played co-op.</p><p dir="ltr">The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/delta-force-black-hawk-down/" data-ref-id="5000-4624">Delta Force: Black Hawk Down</a> was the sixth game in developer NovaLogic's Delta Force tactical FPS series, and released on PC in 2003 before being ported to PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2005.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who aren't interesting in checking out Delta Force's campaign, its free-to-play multiplayer offerings have been regularly updated in the weeks following its December 2024 release. The game has drawn comparisons to EA's Battlefield series for the large player counts and vehicle gameplay seen in its Warfare game mode, but additionally includes an extraction-style mode and a 3v3v3 squad-focused game type called Hot Zone. Though Delta Force is currently only available on PC, it is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile sometime this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of Battlefield, EA recently gave fans a first-look at gameplay for the next entry in the series alongside announcing a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">community testing program called Battlefield Labs</a> intended to help it avoid some of the pitfalls of Battlefield 2042.</p>

                <p>EA has called on fans to provide feedback on the art direction of the reimagined of Plants vs. Zombies 3.</p><p>"We ran some external tests to gather insight into which art styles sparked interest among participants in our focus groups! We’re actively gathering that data, but we also know that there’s no better feedback than yours--the passionate PvZ community," EA said in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-3/news" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new blog post</a>.</p><p>EA showed three images of the same plant punching a zombie but in three different art styles and is asking fans to share their thoughts on social media with the hashtag #PvZ3 and which one they prefer. The first one is a slightly 3D cel-shaded art direction compared to the second one.

                <p>The Order: 1886 developer Ready at Dawn pitched a sequel to Sony but was ultimately rejected. While the reason was unclear, the developer thought that had the game's critical reception been higher, there would've been a better chance.</p><p>"We really thought that with The Order, we had set up such a unique and appealing baseline that people were going to forgive some of its shortcomings," Ready at Dawn co-founder Andrea Pessino said in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFmUHo_pJJ0&amp;t=2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with MinnMax</a>. "It would've been an incredible sequel, I can tell you for a fact."</p><p>Despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-order-1886-review/1900-6416033/" data-ref-id="1900-6416033">The Order 1886's lukewarm critical reception</a>, sitting at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-order-1886/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63 on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic</a>, Ready at Dawn pitched a sequel. Pessino explained that it was actually better that Sony passed on the sequel because the budget would've been small and the studio didn't have any leverage to negotiate a better contract. However, Pessino said that the team would've taken the opportunity anyway in order to redeem The Order: 1886.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFmUHo_pJJ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rFmUHo_pJJ0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Pessnio didn't divulge any details about where the sequel would take place, as the IP belongs to Sony and not Ready at Dawn. One of the problems during the development of The Order: 1886 was the pressure to ship so content was cut--interactive elements became cutscenes and movies. "We were desperate, you know, we had to ship," he said. "We need at least one more year and we didn't get it."</p><p>Pessino didn't reveal how much The Order: 1886 sold, but thought Sony's rejection was based on critical reception rather than sales numbers. Interestingly, he said that internal mock reviews placed the game's score at around the 70s range, yet when the game was released, the critical reception ended up being lower. Had it actually scored somewhere in the 70s, then Pessino was convinced there could've been a sequel.</p><p>A sequel to The Order 1886 isn't the only one that Sony passed on. Last week, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resistance-4-was-pitched-but-didnt-work-out-says-former-boss/1100-6529337/" data-ref-id="1100-6529337">Sony passed on Resistance 4</a> when it was pitched as well. Ready at Dawn was acquired by Meta in 2020, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-and-lone-echo-developer-shuts-down/1100-6525619/" data-ref-id="1100-6525619">was shut down last August</a>.</p>
