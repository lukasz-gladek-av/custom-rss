			<p>Today, at Computex 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-125-games-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-june-more-dlss-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that NVIDIA DLSS 4 is now available in over 125 games and applications. Following the news, NVIDIA provided more details and trailers about upcoming games and existing PC games that are being updated to include DLSS 4 and other NVIDIA technologies.</p>
<p>Let's start with Portal with RTX, which was upgraded from DLSS 3.5 to the new version while also updating the Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction models to the latest and greatest versions. Additionally, the game now supports <a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Radiance Cache</a>. Taking advantage of the neural shader's capabilities to leverage AI to infer a great many rays and bounces from a limited set of indirect lights, the performance is improved even further. The flagship GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090, runs Portal with RTX at 277 average frames per second with full ray tracing enabled, according to NVIDIA tests. The RTX 5080 registers 171.5 frames per second, while the RTX 5070Ti achieves 143.7 frames per second.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, Saber Interactive will release Roadcraft, a rather unusual game where players will use construction machinery to restore sites damaged by various natural disasters. The game includes DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution (with the transformer AI model), and DLAA on day one. NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation can be enabled via the NVIDIA app overrides and will be added in-game soon. As seen in the trailer, Roadcraft runs at over 250 average frames per second with everything enabled on the RTX 5090.</p>

<p>Two days later, 1047 Games will launch SplitGate 2's Open Beta, which also features integration of the whole DLSS 4 suite: Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex.</p>
<p>On the same day, the popular free-to-play melee-focused Battle Royale game NARAKA: Bladepoint will receive the <a href="https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously announced</a> path tracing update, greatly improving its visuals. The game already supported DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, but this update will also introduce Ray Reconstruction. In the NVIDIA trailer, the game runs at around 350 average frames per second with everything enabled.</p>
<p><iframe title="NARAKA: BLADEPOINT | Full Ray Tracing &amp; DLSS Ray Reconstruction Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ElOkr-bhS2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On May 24, F1 25 launches <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-pc-specs-revealed-rtx-5080-for-path-tracing-at-1080p60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with path tracing</a> and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Reflex.</p>
<p>In early June, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Awakening</a> will be released with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation (which was not yet available in the recent beta), Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex. The NVIDIA trailer shows the game running at over 300 frames per second in some instances.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dune: Awakening | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XlYFajRAed0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The same technologies will be available in MindsEye, the single player triple-A action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-gets-june-10-release-date-pre-orders-and-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to launch on June 10</a>.</p>
<p>A week later, Remedy's <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-preview-hands-on-with-remedys-first-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a> will make its debut with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, DLAA, Reflex, and path tracing. You can check out the new showcase below.</p>

<p>On July 24, the Soulslike action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-opens-pre-orders-and-shares-pc-specs-ahead-of-july-24-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> also comes out with the full set of NVIDIA DLSS technologies (though there's no ray tracing.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFzo_o8mH8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>inZOI, the new life simulation game released in early access by KRAFTON, will receive its DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation update in August.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, NVIDIA also demonstrated the Horizon 'clone' Light of Motiram running at over 400 frames per second with Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="LIGHT OF MOTIRAM | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PgFVQ8BezLg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, Crimson Desert will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Reflex, and ray traced effects. Kyungjoon Cho, Head of Game Engine System Division, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Crimson Desert represents a major step forward for Pearl Abyss in intense action and open world design. With NVIDIA's graphics technologies, we're ensuring that players experience and explore the continent of Pywel through high-quality graphics and smooth gameplay.</em></p>
<p>Keita Iida, Vice President of Developer Relations at NVIDIA, added:</p>
<p><em>Pearl Abyss has crafted a visually spectacular and deeply immersive experience with Crimson Desert. By integrating ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Reflex technologies, they're providing players with breathtaking visuals, lightning-fast responsiveness, and exceptional frame rates that bring the game world to life.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-physint-five-six-years</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojimas-espionage-action-game-physint-still-five-or-six-years-away.1192875/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-physint-five-six-years<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Physint&nbsp;</em>creator Hideo Kojima has indicated that it's going to be quite a while before we get to play his new take on the "espionage action" genre he helped to pioneer.</p>

<p>In an interview with French cinema magazine&nbsp;<em>Le Film Francais&nbsp;</em>(thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-reveals-his-next-espionage-game-physint-is-5-6-years-away/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Kojima talks about his love of film, and he also addresses the multiple video game projects he's currently working on.</p>

<p>As well as the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">set to launch in June</a>, Kojima also named&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, which he says will "take [him] another five or six years" to make. He's previously stated that the production of the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-od-physint-strikes" rel="nofollow">heavily impacted by SAG strikes</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/physint-kojima-comments-billboard.jpg?itok=XIPMjIJH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/physint-kojima-comments-billboard.jpg?itok=DvhlVugs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hideo Kojima says he'd like to work on a movie after&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow">only revealed back in February last year</a>&nbsp;and that Kojima's games usually sport both high production values and a lot of polish, I don't think anyone was expecting to see&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>for at least the next few years. Still, knowing it's that far away is a touch disappointing.</p>

<p>After&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>are released, Kojima says he might like to try his hand at making a movie; he says he "grew up with cinema" and that he'd prefer to make a film "while still young" if he's going to do it at all.</p>

<p>As VGC points out, Kojima doesn't make any reference to&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">collaboration with filmmaker Jordan Peele</a>, but since he's promoting the Sony-exclusive&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, that might not be so strange.&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, too, was announced during a Sony event, so it may well be a PlayStation exclusive.</p>




<p>For the time being, though, Kojima will be focused on the release of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-gold-kojima-daruma-doll" rel="nofollow">went gold earlier this month</a>, prompting the filling in of the second eye on Kojima's daruma doll.</p>

<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>arrives on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>&nbsp;will, if Kojima's estimates are correct, launch somewhere around 2030-2031, thus probably making it a PlayStation 6 title at this point. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has sounded off on increasing game prices, saying he questions why people are complaining about $80 games when that price is actually a "steal" in terms of what's being offered, at least for some games. He said this in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCTm-cxuYTQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critical Hits Games</a>, stating that many products in regular life have gone up in price over the years, so it was only a matter of time before video games did as well.</p><p>"I think it was almost too late for the video game companies to start looking at the pricing structure," he said, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/former-playstation-exec-says-usd70-or-usd80-games-are-a-steal-as-long-as-people-choose-carefully-how-they-spend-their-money-i-dont-think-they-should-be-complaining/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>In the '90s, many new releases sold for $60 USD. Adjusted for inflation, that's around $80 today, which is the price that Nintendo and Xbox will charge for some games this year. Sony, for its part, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-could-get-more-expensive-as-sony-considers-plans-to-deal-with-tariff-impact/1100-6531526/" data-ref-id="1100-6531526">it might increase prices, too.</a></p><p>Not every game will become more expensive, though. Variable pricing in gaming has existed since the beginning, and it's going to continue into the future. As an example, 2K is charging $50 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reacts-to-80-games-and-explains-why-mafia-the-old-country-is-only-50/1100-6531598/" data-ref-id="1100-6531598">help the game reach the widest possible audience</a>. Yoshida said every game has a "different value [that] it provides," so a game company will decide how to price their product based on the "value that they believe they are bringing in."</p><p>He went on to say that a "really great" game that's priced at $70 or $80 would be a "steal in terms of the amount of entertainment" provided, and the quality of the experience compared to other forms of entertainment.</p><p>"As long as people choose carefully how they spend their money, I don't think they should be complaining," he said.</p><p>Nintendo defended <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>'s $80 price point by stating that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">the game is simply worth that much given what it offers</a>. MK World is the only confirmed $80 game so far, from Nintendo or anyone else, but Microsoft has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">will charge $80 for some Xbox games later this year. </a> Electronic Arts, for its part, has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-80-games-isnt-planning-to-follow-suit-yet/1100-6531352/" data-ref-id="1100-6531352">will not charge $80 for new games</a>, at least not yet.</p><p>Data shows that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to spend $80 or more on new games.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-remastered-announced-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/syberia-remastered-revisits-kate-walkers-iconic-story-later-this-year.1192839/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-remastered-announced-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microids has announced&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered</em>, a modernized remaster-slash-remake of the original point-and-click classic with revamped gameplay and improved visuals.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Syberia/status/1924150647177306347" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, Microids promises that the remaster will feature a "stunning visual overhaul", as well as "redesigned gameplay". It will, however, tell the "same unforgettable story" as the original, so don't worry; the plot details haven't been changed.</p>

<p>The remaster will see protagonist Kate Walker and her automaton companion Oscar exploring "carefully rebuilt" environments which use an art style that "stays true" to original creator Benoît Sokal's vision while also utilizing "beautifully enhanced 3D", according to Microids.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microids-syberia-remastered-train.jpg?itok=-7uZ5USf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microids-syberia-remastered-train.jpg?itok=4vGZpUCT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>​​​​​​brings gameplay and visual improvements to the 2002 adventure classic later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not that means the new game will feature pre-rendered environments in a similar way to the original isn't clear, but it does sound like Microids is overhauling the visual style completely, so perhaps you'll be able to explore a fully rendered version of Sokal's world this time around.</p>

<p>In keeping with modern design trends,&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>will offer "a fresh take" on the original's puzzles, which have been "redesigned to provide a smoother and more intuitive experience".</p>

<p>Additionally, the remaster will feature a reworked UI, as well as "improved 3D navigation", so it should be a little easier to move Kate around her environment now; the slightly clunky movement of the original sounds as though it's been addressed, which is nice.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it's still the same tale of Kate's "legal assignment" that transforms into "a profound journey of self-discovery". If you love the original&nbsp;<em>Syberia</em>, it sounds very much like this is the remaster you've been waiting for.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/syberia-remastered-town.jpg?itok=YyeEGrOu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/syberia-remastered-town.jpg?itok=Z--j6_qQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Syberia</em>'s environments have been redesigned in full 3D, by the looks of things.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Syberia&nbsp;</em>series began all the way back in 1999 with first-person adventure&nbsp;<em>Amerzone</em>, so&nbsp;<em>Syberia&nbsp;</em>is technically the second game in the series, although it's the first to bear what would become the franchise's name.</p>

<p>A sequel followed in 2004, followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-3-gets-release-date-and-revealing-trailer" rel="nofollow">another thirteen years later</a>. The latest game in the series,&nbsp;<em>Syberia: The World Before</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-world-before-release-date-set-for-march-2022" rel="nofollow">released in 2022</a>, and is the first to launch following Sokal's death in 2021 from a long-term illness.</p>

<p>With regards to the future of the series, it's not just&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>you've got to look forward to; an animated series based on the franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-animated-series-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">is also in development</a>, although we don't know when it's arriving yet.</p>

<p><em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>launches sometime later this year for PC. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660220/Syberia__Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it right now via Steam</a>.</p>

It’s a fast-firing SMG reminiscent of the Tec-9. But with such a high rate of fire comes a lack of control, which we’ll aim to resolve with the right attachments. While I’m not the best player, I can hold my own, and I know how to build a loadout to suit my purposes, especially in CQB. As proof, I offer you a sweet Ladra loadout in <em>Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Warzone </em>that saw me achieve nearly 500 kills fast!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,195618,195752" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><hr><h2 id="h440027"><a id="1"></a>Best attachment choices for the Ladra</h2><figure id="" data-id="a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-recommend-id="image://a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The attachment screen for the Ladra SMG in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The attachment screen for the Ladra SMG in Black Ops 6." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-recommend-id="image://a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The attachment screen for the Ladra SMG in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>For the Ladra, which already features a high Mobility and Handling rating, we’re focusing on increasing its Firepower and Accuracy</strong>. The latter is nothing to scoff at on the base weapon, but the goal here is to create a laser beam that’s capable for short- and mid-range engagements.</p><p>As such, I chose the following attachments:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Optic</strong>: Remuda Mini Reflex</li><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Muzzle Brake</li><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Precision Foregrip</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Heavy Stock</li><li><strong>Laser</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs </li></ul><p>You can swap the Heavy Stock for the Combat Stock at will, and, as always, your choice of Optic. I chose the Mini Reflex for its accurate sight picture and small profile, allowing for easier target acquisition in and out of ADS.</p><h2 id="h440028"><a id="2"></a>Best perks for the Ladra</h2><figure id="" data-id="32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-recommend-id="image://32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The perk and equipment loadout screen for the Ladra in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The perk and equipment loadout screen for the Ladra in Black Ops 6." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-recommend-id="image://32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The perk and equipment loadout screen for the Ladra in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With your attachments squared away, let’s focus on the rest of the build. The right equipment and perks for the Ladra can really turn the tide of a round. In this case, we’re opting for flash-and-awe tactics with the fast-firing and highly mobile SMG. With the Flashbang, you can blind an entire room and sweep and clear with a mag or two.</p><p><strong>As for the perks, we’re opting for abilities that allow us to move quickly and quietly across the map</strong>, while uncovering enemy whereabouts to get the drop on everyone.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Flashbang</li><li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li><li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: War Cry </li><li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ninja</li><li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Tracker</li><li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Vigilance</li><li><strong>Specialty</strong>: Recon</li><li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li></ul><p>You’ll note I chose War Cry instead of the Assault Pack. Typically, for this type of weapon, I’d say the Assault Pack proves most useful to replace all of that rapidly depleting ammunition. But here, speed and momentum become paramount, and War Cry’s movement buff is key!</p><hr><p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>’s Season 3 Reloaded is available right now on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>and the Chelsea Flower Show might not be the most obvious crossover you can think of, but thanks to Xbox, Bethesda, and "leading bespoke firepit designers" The Firepit Company, it's becoming a reality tomorrow.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the medieval FPS will be getting a firepit display at the Chelsea Flower Show from May 20th to May 24th, thus "seamlessly blending the game's take on medieval stylings with cutting-edge craftsmanship".</p>

<p>The display will see several elaborately-designed firepit globes set among lush greenery, with the central firepit being built around the Doom Slayer himself and a number of other globes featuring designs of "intricate demons and elaborate adversaries" from&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show-display.jpg?itok=ud_h9JOL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show-display.jpg?itok=J-kYh9RF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>is getting, of all things, a Chelsea Flower Show display.</figcaption></figure><p>The centerpiece features not only the Doom Slayer, but also a number of "dark flowers", including dark variants of the likes of Zantedeschia, petunia, and Centaurea cyanus. You'll also find a pedestal with the Slayer's symbol carved into it.</p>

<p>Bethesda communications director Steve Merrett says it's "amazing" to see how&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>has been "adapted into a centerpiece worthy of any outdoor area", while The Firepit Company's Jason Andre describes the display as "iconic" and a "pleasure" to work on.</p>

<p>If you want to see the displays, you'll be able to do so in London <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">between May 20th and 24th</a>, although tickets <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/ticket-options" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">aren't cheap</a>&nbsp;and are limited in availability at time of writing.</p>




<p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>franchise, and the third game in the reboot series, which began with 2016's straightforwardly-titled&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>.</p>

<p>A prequel to that game,&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>sees the Doom Slayer battling back the forces of Hell in order to save humanity. It introduces a number of new weapons and combat mechanics to the series, including parrying, a throwable shield that can also be used to block projectiles, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3017860/DOOM_The_Dark_Ages/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/doom-the-dark-ages" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod now available online introduces plenty of visual improvements to the game developed by Sandfall Interactive.</p>
<p>The new Ultra Plus mod, which was developed by Lazorr and can be downloaded from Nexus Mods, introduces plenty of visual improvements by fixing some visual issues as well as visual settings that can be pushed past those available in the vanilla game. Besides the improvements to Global Illumination, Shadows, Reflections, Shading, View Distance, and Texture Quality, the mod also introduces upscaled 4K resolution prerendered cutscenes, which look amazing. Unfortunately, the modder has released no comparison screenshots, though <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM3">some</a> shared by Nexus Mods users <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM4">show</a> how the mod can bring <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM5">considerable</a> visual <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODQw">improvements.</a></p>
<p>Even in its vanilla state, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a role-playing game that is more than worth experiencing for all fans of the genre. With its unique twists to classic turn-based combat, a beautiful and unique world, a compelling cast, and a moving, thought-provoking story, the game developed by Sandfall Interactive is undoubtedly one of the best RPGs of the current generation, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, the game is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

<p>The most recent episode of The Last of Us season two just aired, and in the opening moments viewers are soon introduced to a character not seen in the games: Joel's father.</p>
<p>Played by Tony Dalton, whose name you may recognise from his portrayal of Lalo Salamanca in Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul, Javier Miller is a police officer in Austin during the 80s. He is revealed to have violent tendencies towards his two sons, Joel and Tommy, having previously also been beaten by his own father.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://ew.com/the-last-of-us-tony-dalton-joel-dad-javier-miller-11737057">EW</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-six-recaptures-some-much-needed-levity-but-with-only-one-episode-left-have-the-showrunners-bitten-off-more-than-they-can-chew">the sixth episode's debut this morning</a>, The Last of Us creator and series showrunner Neil Druckmann said Dalton was his "first choice" to play Joel's father, jokingly adding the actor was "the most charming, threatening man" he had ever seen on television. Druckmann specifically highlighted his performance in Better Call Saul.</p>
<p>Thankfully for Druckmann, it was not a case of 'don't meet your heroes' with Dalton, and the Naughty Dog head was so pleased with the actor's work on The Last of Us TV series he went on to cast him in Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>
<p>"He immediately came to mind," Druckmann told the publication of Dalton's unspecified role in the upcoming game. "I just offered it to him on the spot."</p> <div>

<p>Along with Dalton, actress <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Tati Gabrielle will also star in Naughty Dog's upcoming sci-fi project for PlayStation 5</a>.

<p>Last week, Gabrielle revealed she had received preparation for her role in Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet - and specifically the online reaction to it - from Druckmann, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"What morbid force is calling you deeper into the heart of the caves?" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3004390/The_Cave_Diver/">asks the Steam page for The Cave Diver</a>. It ain't calling me, developer Ovsko. I read the opening words of your description and immediately started running away from my laptop. I'm still running, in fact. This article is being breathlessly dictated to Oisin over the phone. I'm somewhere in the vicinity of Luton, now, and hope to make it all the way to Scotland by the weekend.</p>
<p>After that, there'll be the problem of securing naval travel as I continue my headlong flight. Then I'll have to worry about frostbite as I gallop past the North Pole and begin my long traversal of the Pacific. At some point I will reach New Zealand, which - according to this handy <a href="https://www.antipodesmap.com/">antipodal mapping site</a> - is approximately as far away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-cave-diver">The Cave Diver</a> Steam page currently loaded on my laptop as I can get without venturing into outer space. I do not rule out venturing into outer space, which is notable for its complete and categorical deficit of caves.</p><!--more-->
<p>Perhaps you think I'm being hysterical. Friend, The Cave Diver is about perishing repeatedly in crawlspaces a few inches wide, deep below the surface. It's a game based on <a href="https://x.com/LostMemeArchive/status/1896898262399168898">that awful cutaway image</a> you've doubtless seen and flinched away from on social media. And also, beloved lunchbreak physics diversion <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/qwop">QWOP</a>. What kind of vile intellect turns QWOP into... <em>this</em>? I guess there's nothing for it but to roll the trailer.</p>

<p>The premise here is that you're trying to find a possibly-mythical subterranean flower that has the ability to cure your paraplegia. You move using your hands and arms and, where called for, the element of momentum. You can also scrawl signs on the rock to navigate by during your next attempt, in the quite likely event that you die. The threat of being crushed or trapped aside, the depths harbour some kind of ancient, ravenous evil. Going by the logo art, The Oesophagus Diver would have been an acceptable alternative title.</p>
<p>It's out later this year. With any luck, I'll have reached New Zealand by then and reinvented myself as a travelling hairdryer salesman who still dreams of being an astronaut. It wouldn't be the first time. If you have a grotesque fascination with caves - which to be honest, I sort of do, as long as I can stand up in them - you might also enjoy free 20-minute spookelunker <a href="https://sole-rift.itch.io/crawl">Crawl</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Despite the best efforts of all concerned, there are once again new PC games this week. See how they frolic among the days ahead, trampling all over our life commitments and need for tranquility like boisterous, fugitive oxen.

</ul>
<p>What are the denizens of the Treehouse up to this week? Well, James has been making forbidding noises about Computex 2025, the latest appalling rebirth of the Taipei, Taiwan-based tech show. Expect a few headlines with unpronounceable acronyms in them, and probably a lot of unreportable guff about genAI. Speaking of events: I'm attending Summer Games Fest for RPS in a couple of weeks, so I'm trying to clear out a few features before I'm deluged in fresh interview material.</p>
<p>Nic and Brendy are juggling various review commitments, like brilliant hell jesters on unicycles. Graham is forming terrible plans and chewing his way through another stack of freelance edits. Ollie continues his quest to write a complete instruction manual for all of existence, aka our guides section, and Jeremy is still blissfully on holiday. What are you up to this week? Playing anything fun?</p>

			<p>The Flayed Man could not be more laser targeted at me if I designed it myself. I’m a huge fan of Clive Barker’s work, with the body horror delights of Hellraiser being a seminal title for me. This appears to be a clear influence for The Flayed Man as there is a similar narrative of guilt, judgement and temptation at play here. You begin as the titular flayed man with no idea of who you are and how you got to be where you are. During the short 30 minute adventure, you’ll explore the handful of rooms in the house and find objects to solve puzzles. Fairly standard fare, but the quality of the design and the wonderful pixel art goes a long way to make it feel fresh. Oh, and this costs less than a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Flayed Man Final Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xSUI6xmV83Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike many point and click games, there is little dialogue to go through – indeed, at the beginning of the game you have no tongue or even an inner monologue to assist you. As the game progresses you regain these faculties and this means that you have to revisit rooms afterwards to learn more about your surroundings. The puzzles here are well designed and include traditional inventory management and even a timing based one.</p>


<p>The star of the show, aside from the creepiness of the setting, is the pixel art here. Everything in the game is positively dripping in gore and the feeling of playing is uncannily close to an immersive Clive Barker story. Just as Barker’s best work is his short stories, The Flayed Man benefits from being such a compact adventure as it doesn’t get lost in the main problems of larger point and click games where you end up aimlessly wandering around multiple screens looking for the next interactive object or combining every item together to try and find the solution to a problem that makes no sense outside of the game’s internal logic.</p>


<p>The difficulty for The Flayed Man, and for countless other games that are released onto Steam each day, is getting lost in the shuffle. Developer Snoring Dog Games took a novel approach of initially releasing the game for free and having a small optional paid DLC to support them and pay the artists that brought this vision to pixellated life. As of the end of last week, the game is now paid, though still only at £2.99 (currently 25% off at £2.24), and the £3.99 Supporters Pack now has a CC BY-NC 4.0 license for using the assets in non-commercial works.</p>
<p>Even with this, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3471670/view/516335345719051904">the stated goal by Snoring Dog</a> is simply to cover costs of an accountant, paying the game’s artists, and hopefully raise enough funds to allow them to make another game. Having played through the game multiple times to unlock all the endings and achievements I can highly recommend that you check it out and, if you like it, throw a few more notes the dev’s way through the DLC.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Flayed Man is a fantastic little point and click with a grotesque setting and wonderful atmosphere that deserves to reach a wider audience. Check it out and support the devs, as this taste shows that they have a massive amount of potential. The story and the aesthetics will stay with me longer than many higher priced games and it’d be a crying shame if their ambitions end here.	</p></div>

			<p>Injustice 3 might be on the way, as teased by MultiVersus dataminer MultiVerSusie. In a not-too-cryptic X post, they <a href="https://x.com/multiversusie/status/1923533288137724173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1923533288137724173%7Ctwgr%5Ecad582adc9b8e13dcbc918ed0b0eb1a538f4db0b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Finjustice-3-is-rumored-to-be-in-development-1545223%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>multiversus shutting down is an injustice, then doing it all again is another injustice</em></p>
<p><em>leaving me without any leaks is yet again another injustice</em></p>
<p>And then, just to make it even clearer:</p>
<p><em>3</em></p>
<p>Of course, it's worth taking this rumor with a big grain of salt. Still, it doesn't seem far-fetched at all. The previous Injustice games were big successes for developer NetherRealm Studios and Warner Bros. Games, selling a lot of copies and garnering widespread critical and fan acclaim. By far their most appreciated feature was the story, which featured a gritty, unique take on the DC Universe where Superman falls into darkness after being tricked by the Joker into killing his beloved Lois Lane and destroying Metropolis. Batman leads the resistance against his totalitarian regime.</p>
<p>There's no question that the Injustice games raised the bar for story and presentation in fighting games, but they were also no slouch in the gameplay department. The second game also added new features like the RPG-inspired Gear System that extended its longevity, particularly in the multiplayer modes. Injustice 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/injustice-2-justified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8.4/10 here on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>All in all, Injustice 2 is surprisingly fantastic. Combat feels very weighty and satisfying, the graphics look incredible, characters look fascinatingly detailed and even the bass-heavy sound design is top notch. DC and fighter fans should definitely be giving Injustice 2 time.</em></p>
<p>It's been eight years, though, and fans have only had the mediocre animated 2021 film since. NetherRealm has released two consecutive Mortal Kombat games, so it could well be time to switch back to the DC-branded fighting game, especially since Warner Bros. has mandated a greater emphasis on its DC franchises.</p>
<p>In fact, James Gunn (<a href="https://wccftech.com/dcu-will-connect-games-movies-and-tv-says-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head of the new interconnected DC Universe</a>) was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-for-new-dc-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> earlier this year to have met with both NetherRealm and Rocksteady about new DC games. It might be a while before Injustice 3 is announced, though, based on the DC heads' statements.</p>
