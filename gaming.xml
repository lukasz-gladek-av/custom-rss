            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ninja-gaiden-2-black-update-new-game-plus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has released an update for hack-and-slash action game&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em>, and it's bringing a New Game Plus mode, adjustments to some of the game's enemy encounters, and more.</p>

<p>The first big addition in this update is New Game Plus, which allows you to replay a difficulty level you've already finished with all of your weapons and Ninpo intact. Their levels will, however, be reset, so bear that in mind.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a photo mode that allows you to pause&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em>'s action and take snapshots, although bear in mind that this isn't&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</em>'s photo mode, so you can't essentially just wander around the level with it.</p>

Some enemies have had their HP lowered, while other encounters have had their enemy density increased.</p>

<p>Of course, the update also brings a handful of bug fixes and technical improvements. You can check out the full patch notes for this&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>is, it's a remastered version of the 2008 action game&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em>, as well as its 2009 re-release&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em>.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo's intention was to create a definitive version of the&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2&nbsp;</em>experience, and so as well as a full visual revamp using Unreal Engine 5, the game also blends <i>Sigma 2</i>'s additional content with various systems and gameplay features in the original&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em>.</p>




<p>It's all go for the&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>franchise right now. As well as <i>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</i>, you can also look forward to&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, which is currently in the works as a co-development project between Team Ninja and PlatinumGames.</p>

<p><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3287520/NINJA_GAIDEN_2_Black/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012997" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ninja-gaiden-2-black/9N51FH42VQDS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

<p>Developer Rebellion has released a brand new features trailer for the upcoming action survival game, Atomfall. In this trailer, players get a look at various settings and landscapes in the game while also learning about what to expect as you play.</p>



<p>“This slice of Northern England includes everything from open moors, rugged hills, dense woodlands and the picture-perfect English village Wyndham,” Rebellion says. “But beware, this is a dangerous and hostile landscape filled with gangs of outlaws, crazed cultists and unexplained horrors. </p>



<p>“Even the local wildlife poses an immense threat to your life. If you are to navigate this land and survive, you will need to fight for your life and scavenge resources.”</p>



<p>You can check out the full trailer for yourself below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Atomfall launches on March 27, and will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. The game will also launch Day One on Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game</a> last summer, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill touched on how interacting with the game’s characters can change your overall experience.</p>



<p>“Get too close to a faction that doesn’t trust you, and you’ll be set upon pretty quickly,” he said. “In conversations, you can choose from what might be several choices, each of which can lead a different way. If you want to be stealthier, you’ll put enemies on edge, and if you go in guns blazing, you’ll quickly draw an entire force down upon you.”</p>



<p>What do you think of the latest look at Atomfall? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>The Alters has been delayed once again by 11 Bit Studios. The announcement comes via a post on social media on Wednesday morning.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://x.com/altersgame/status/1889675839434010677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post online</a>, the game’s official account said that the planned release for Q1 2025 has been pushed to later in the year. An exact window, however, wasn’t given.</p>



<p>“While we recognize that this may not be the update you were hoping for, this additional time is being dedicated to further refining mission parameters and ensuring that all essential systems meet Ally Corp’s uncompromising standards,” the statement reads. “Furthermore, it is also allowing us to integrate new enhancements into Project Dolly, ensuring that your eventual deployment is more exciting and rewarding than originally projected.”</p>



<p>They continued: “This additional time will allow us to ensure that every aspect of Project Dolly operates at peak efficiency, leading to an outcome that benefits both the organization and, of course, yourself.”</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with the game, The Alters is a “emotional sci-fi game with a unique blend of survival, adventure, and base-building elements.” Players have to work to create alternate versions of the main character Jan Dolski in order to escape a hostile planet after he was left as the lone survivor of a space expedition.</p>



<p>The game was announced back in June 2022. When it does finally release, The Alters will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It will also be available via Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>What do you make of The Alters being delayed to later this year? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

                <p>Language-learning app Duolingo has sadly confirmed that its owl mascot has died. In a social media post, the company confirmed the expiration of Duo, the little green owl. "It is with heavy hearts that we inform you that Duo, formally known as the Duolingo Owl, is dead," <a href="https://x.com/duolingo/status/1889328809054224698" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Duolingo posted on X</a>.</p><p>Naturally, the gaming industry has taken this time to mourn Duo and possibly incriminate itself with images that'll hold up quite nicely in court once the murder case gets underway. So who is responsible for the death of Duo, a noted fan of singer-songwriter Dua Lipa? One of the suspects could be the Reaper from Vampire Survivors:</p><p>Or Keit'Ehr, the Subjugator skulking around the flagship of Oryx in Destiny 2, could also be a suspect:</p><p>Police might want to also bring in Renaissance man Ezio Auditore da Firenze in for question, as people have a tendency to suffer fatal stab wounds when they get close to him:</p><p>Or maybe Duo shouldn't have dropped into a quick game of Rainbow Six Siege:</p><p>Some conspiracy theorists have suggested that Duo has done an Elvis and isn't dead at all, or at the very least, might have been resurrected thanks to some gnarly viruses:</p><p>Meanwhile, some people think that Duo should have abstained from vigorous Just Dance sessions.</p><p>Is this what Master Chief meant by finishing the fight?</p><p>Like the case of Jimmy Hoffa, we'll probably never know what really happened to Duo or why there's a <a href="https://youtu.be/Fc24GNLlbLw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">strange lump</a> on the football field of New Jersey's Giants Stadium. We've got a few more prime suspects listed below, just to cover every angle of the crime of the century:</p><p>If you do decide to visit the Duolingo social media channels, the reality of Duo's death will be hammered home with a new app icon of a very dead-looking owl. The company says it will reveal more details this week on Duo's untimely death and the shocking truth behind it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Game Freak, best known for developing the Pokemon franchise, is working on a new smartphone RPG named Pandoland. The title is slated to arrive in late April, with pre-registration available now on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbjN6T2dRUEV0VF9pcHB4Ul9GMndWcVRZaGl2d3xBQ3Jtc0trNHctMU1qVVJEcmZqRTlOdFJCcXdzRU9GRF9sMFgxcHZWRXFQUDZwdTM5bzh2ZFRndURjSVdkei1DQ1JLbVZXRDBRdW9la2ZNRnp6T3ZwUUtHXzRWdVY0YjkzcHlQakswOFM1VVVsV0txSWw4SHUycw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid6474245208&amp;v=a4pxFJB6mDE">iOS</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWhsX0s0MV85bjR3WjFhVGZrUWNlUEFROUZVZ3xBQ3Jtc0tsU010aF9UTTdCZ0tlN1JqeS10cjI3RGlJSGxKOTYyRlJRd1BYVEVGVjBZNmozMnRqZlJQZWtxSnltTkRRUXhJQktNbVhsemxmY1pXUnhYZElpOEtVdXlWVzZNN2dzTVNrVEoxa19rMTVQRVJRNkJXbw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.pandoland&amp;v=a4pxFJB6mDE">Android</a>. Signing up can net you diamonds that can equate to 100 gacha pulls.</p><p dir="ltr">Pandoland is described as a casual-adventure RPG, seeing players search for treasures and explore dungeons. There are apparently over 500 characters and items to collect, and building a team of companions helps with exploration. The official trailer for the game--seen below--showcases a blocky art style as a group of characters set sail on the open seas aboard a ship. The boat passes by different islands and even a giant squid.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/common-side-effects-adult-swim-max-hbo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With Warner Bros. owning Adult Swim, it sometimes feels like only a matter of time before the adult-oriented animation channel gets sent to the tax writeoff mines. Which makes its new show <em>Common Side Effects</em> feel all the more refreshing and precious.</p><p><em>Common Side Effects</em> follows Marshall Cuso, an animal-loving mushroom expert who has discovered a blue mushroom that cures everything from common sickness to gunshot wounds. He reveals its existence to high school classmate Frances, whom he doesn’t know works for Reutical Pharmaceuticals as an assistant to its delightfully incompetent CEO Rick (voiced by Mike Judge, so you get to hear Hank Hill call a private jet a “PJ”). Frances offers to get the mushroom for the flailing Reutical, adding her to the list of people trying to hunt Marshall down. This includes two wonderfully deadpan DEA agents, Copano and Harrington, who have maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DyQ8X9OPOP4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best character introduction</a> ever.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Common Side Effects | OFFICIAL TRAILER | adult swim" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tdf8q2ax-Ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Marshall is a strange character, seeming in some ways like a washed-out hippie and in others like an accomplished scientist. We first meet him having a comment instead of a question at a Reutical shareholder meeting, his shirt hanging open as he drones on about fungus habitats until he’s dragged out. When he runs into Frances, he rants about a shady “them,” the “people who make tons of money just from keeping us sick, from keeping us <em>unwell</em>.” It’s conspiracy theory stuff, but in the show’s world there’s truth to it: different parties go to huge lengths to keep the miracle mushroom from the public for their own gain. There’s something risque in exploring healthcare-related conspiracy theories that turn out to be true these days, but <em>Common Side Effects</em> also takes aim at an industry many people are pretty <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fed up with</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite part of the show is the way everything is so physical; characters’ bodies are wrinkled and strangely proportioned, all of their features too small for their heads. Rooms are full of detritus, coffee cups and takeout containers and grow lights, and it makes the world feel lived-in. It all feels very real, even with the fantastical element of an immortality-granting mushroom at its center. In many ways it’s a crime thriller, but everything moves so slowly, full of characters prone to small talk,&nbsp; and this languidness brings both a humor and a calm that give it a unique feel.</p><p><em>Common Side Effects’</em> third episode just aired on Adult Swim and Max, so it’s a good time to get into it if you haven’t checked it out yet. I’m excited to see where its plot goes, but more excited just to spend time in its weird world.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/beyond-citadel-indie-retro-shooter"><h3>Beyond Citadel Is Gory, Obscene, And Almost A Masterpiece</h3></a><p>Inspired by Lucasarts' Outlaws and Bungie's Marathon, Beyond Citadel is mechanically one of the best indie shooters I have played in years and absolutely not for everyone.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-lynch"><h3>Fantasy At The End Of The World</h3></a><p>A new world is possible, but only if we log off and put in the work</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In our review, Adrian said, <em>“Ninja Gaiden 2 Black offers a comprehensive remake of Team Ninja’s finest game, rendered in beautiful modern visuals. Combat is as bombastically brilliant as it ever was, though the awful camera will put off many of those new to the game, it really hasn’t aged well. Still, as a reminder of how good Ninja Gaiden can be, this remake offers a tantalising taste of what we can all look forward to when Ninja Gaiden 4 is released later this year.”</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will launch in late May on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, publisher Bandai Namco confirmed today.</p>
<p>The co-op survival adventure developed by FromSoftware will launch worldwide on May 30th. Besides the game's Standard Edition, multiple editions of the game will also be released on the same day, including additional goodies such as Digital Artbook and Soundtrack for the Deluxe Edition and the Seekers Edition, which will also include an additional Steelbook. The real star of the Elden Ring Nightreign special editions, however, will be the Collector's Edition, which includes every goodie included in the Deluxe Edition, the same Steelbook included in the Seekers Edition, eight Nightfarer Cards, a hardcover Artbook and a ~25 cm Wylder Nightfarer statue. Die-hard fans of Elden Ring will also be able to purchase a 1:1 scale, prop-quality replica of the Wylder character helmet. Only 9,999 pieces of the helmet will be produced, so it will be a rather exclusive item. All the game's editions and the Wylder helmet replica are also available for <a href="https://it.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/shop-now?utm_campaign=Preorder-EldenRingNightreign&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_source=SM_Official" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-cross-buy-xbox-battle-net<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard and Xbox have announced that if you buy Obsidian's upcoming action RPG&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>on the Battle.net platform, you'll be able to play it on Xbox, and the reverse is also true.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24177681/avowed-breaks-down-barriers-with-cross-buy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the Blizzard website, the company grandly proclaims that the feature "breaks down barriers with cross-buy" and confirms that&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>represents the introduction of this feature between Battle.net and Xbox, suggesting more games could support it in future.</p>

<p>In short, if you buy&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>on Battle.net, then by linking your Xbox account with your Battle.net account, you'll be able to pick up where you left off on Xbox and won't need to buy the game again on that storefront.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-battle.net-xbox-xaurip.jpg?itok=ZpiOwGkD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-battle.net-xbox-xaurip.jpg?itok=vtFVgzOh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>will let you play on both Battle.net and Xbox if you buy it on either platform.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering why this is a thing, we've racked our brains here at TechRaptor Towers, and the only real benefit we can come up with is that this will technically allow you to play&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>on both Xbox and Steam Deck.</p>

<p>The Steam Deck doesn't play very nice with the Microsoft Store, but with a little fiddling under the hood, you can install Battle.net on your Deck and it'll work alright. As such, it should theoretically be possible to play&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>across Xbox (or PC) and Steam Deck.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're going to play the game on PC exclusively (for which you'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-pc-specs" rel="nofollow">probably want a pretty good machine</a>), then there's really no reason not to just pick it up on Steam, and I can't imagine any other use case where someone might find it useful to switch between Battle.net and Xbox.</p>




<p><em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>is the latest game from&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds&nbsp;</em>developer Obsidian. Appropriately enough, it looks rather like a combination of those two games, marrying the first-person action of the latter with the setting of the former.</p>

<p>Initially, it was announced that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-30fps-xbox-target" rel="nofollow">would run at 30fps</a> on Xbox Series X|S, but Obsidian has since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obisidian-confirms-avowed-60fps-mode-on-xbox-series-x-after-previously-saying-you-dont-necessarily-need-it" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that it will implement a 60fps mode for the game on consoles.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/avowed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 18th. It'll also be available on Game Pass on day one, assuming you're signed up to the PC or Ultimate tiers.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">They say you should never work for free, but in Saber Interactive's case, offering to do exactly that landed the studio a high-profile project. The news comes from an interview <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/saber-interactive-halo-anniversary-world-war-z-matt-karch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a> conducted with Saber co-founder and CEO Matthew Karch, where Karch discussed the challenges of running an independent studio and relying on royalties from working with other studios.</p><p dir="ltr">Saber's early days included work with Ubisoft that Saber made no money from, an FPS game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/timeshift-2007/">TimeShift</a> that saw lengthy delays after Activision's Vivendi acquisition, and a game called Inversion for Bandai Namco. The latter project saw Saber go for long periods of time without pay while Bandai debated about what they wanted from the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Karch said Saber's break came when he learned Microsoft wanted pitches from third-party studios interested in developing a Halo: Combat Evolved remaster for the game's anniversary. He told an unnamed Xbox executive that Saber could do it for free.</p><p dir="ltr">“I said I’d do it for free, because it’s Halo,” Karch said. “It’s the biggest franchise in the world at the time. I said: ‘It’s like putting a Harvard diploma on your wall. Everyone in the world is going to want to work with me after they see that I’ve worked on this last Halo game, and it is going to open up doors. So I’ll suck it up and I’ll do it at a loss.'”</p><p dir="ltr">His Xbox contact pushed him to name an actual price, though. Karch said $4 million, assuming the rate was lower than what other studios pitched and knowing he could pull it off in the low-cost development environment in St. Petersburg, Russia--Saber's headquarters at the time. However, Xbox honored his original pitch after all and included clauses in the Halo remaster contract that essentially meant Saber would earn no royalties for the project.</p><p dir="ltr">Karch's initial prediction, that working on one high-profile project would benefit Saber in the long-term, proved correct when Microsoft returned with another proposition. This time, they asked if Saber would remaster Halo 2 and port Halo: Anniversary Edition to Xbox One for 2014's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection/" data-ref-id="1900-6415958">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>. Microsoft forgot to send the part of the contract that covered the porting project, and Karch said he refused to sign it unless Microsoft removed the clause that reduced Saber's royalties. The company agreed, and Karch said the royalties from The Master Chief Collection earned Saber "tens of millions" of dollars.</p><p dir="ltr">"We were off and running,' Karch said. "We've watched other people make money on our work. Now we're going to make money on our own.”</p><p dir="ltr">Saber continued handling game-port projects for other studios, including putting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-nintendo-switch-review-the-last-wish/1900-6417341/" data-ref-id="1900-6417341">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on Nintendo Switch</a> for CD Projekt Red. The studio expanded its in-house development capabilities as well, with the likes of World War Z and its follow-ups, alongside popular mobile sports game Basketball Playgrounds. Embracer Group purchased Saber Interactive in 2020, but in 2024, Karch regained control of the studio after Beacon Entertainment--a company Karch set up for this purchase--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-group-and-saber-interactive-part-ways-in-deal-reportedly-worth-500-million/1100-6521842/" data-ref-id="1100-6521842">bought Saber from Embracer</a>. Saber is currently leading development on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-is-no-longer-in-development-report/1100-6519286/" data-ref-id="1100-6519286">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake</a>, though that project's status and anticipated release date are unknown.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date-revealed-for-may.1106793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>release date, and it's only a few more months before you'll get to play the survival-focused multiplayer spinoff.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1889676062071656525" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches across PC and consoles on May 30th. Pre-orders are, according to Bandai Namco, open now via the game's <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/shop-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, although I wasn't able to actually pick the game up when I checked, so you may have to wait an hour or two.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">multiplayer-focused spinoff</a> of the immensely popular 2022 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>(although just like its forebear,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>can also be played solo).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-witch.jpg?itok=dkB0RnB0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-witch.jpg?itok=SKViCQdy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is launching in May.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will take place in the parallel world of Limveld, where you and two other friends (but not one other friend, strangely enough) must battle increasingly tough waves of enemies and bosses over the course of three in-game days and nights.</p>

<p>Rather than creating your own character,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will give you the chance to play as one of eight predetermined characters, each with their own backstory and lore to discover, as well as their own skillset to utilize.</p>

<p>FromSoftware has confirmed that you will be facing enemies from both&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>series</a>, and new types of enemies will also be appearing.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>has been designed to offer a standalone experience set in the broader&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>universe, so even if you haven't played the base game or its&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC, you should find something to enjoy here.</p>




<p>Ahead of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s launch, a network test is scheduled to take place in February, giving some players the chance to try out the game's online features and spend a little time in its world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, signups for that test have concluded, but if you were lucky enough to get into the test, you'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>between February 14th and 16th across a number of set time periods.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox on May 30th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Sharkmob have punched the green light, cracked open the hangar doors and launched a public playtest for their windblown open world extraction shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exoborne">Exoborne</a>, which I would gingerly summarise as Anthem meets <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> with a touch of PUBG. From today till 17th February at 1pm GMT, 2pm CET, or 5am PST, you'll be able to get your fill of mech-o-looting via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/">Steam</a>. Here's a trailer's worth of wiggly whooshes, big bangs and exowotsits to celebrate. Mmm, exowotsits. They used to be 25p a bag in the 1990s.

If references to antique British crisp brands only leave you confused about what Exoborne actually is, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sharkmob-announce-exoborne-an-open-world-pvpve-shooter-featuring-exo-rigs-and-tornadoes">may I recommend reading my first article about the game from 2023</a>. The narrative premise is that a notional "save the environment" project called Project Rebirth has fucked the world instead, producing a landscape of renegade whirlwinds, broken cities, big sci-fi towers and lashings of loot. 
</p>
<p>
You are a "Reborn" adventurer in an exosuit with high-jumping and grappling capabilities, plus a parachute. Your job is to get in, finish quests and extract with some rad valuables before the match timer runs out, while fighting other players and NPCs. The game is built for groups of three, with a choice of exo-rigs akin to RPG classes, and there's a home hub area where you can shoot the breeze with various story characters. Hah, "shoot the breeze"! I guess that also applies to tangling with inclement weather phenomena as well: some of the game's better items are to be found inside them.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure about Exoborne so far. The idea of hook-chuting through hurricanes while gunning down robot-shouldered hooligans certainly has its charms. On the other hand, this all feels very "we smooshed a bunch of genres together in the hope of alchemising something new", and the art direction is a bit dreary. There's no release date yet - let us know if you have thoughts about the beta.

Bandai Namco announced that FromSoftware’s latest blockbuster will launch in May, and early impressions are buzzing about it being a tense hybrid of <em>Elden Ring</em> and a PVE-based battle royale. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The release date of May 30 on PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC was revealed alongside a new trailer showing off more gameplay and bosses that will be featured in <em>Nightreign</em>’s unique sandbox horde mode.

Players will have a chance to explore a randomized world map across a day and night cycle as a<em> Fortnite</em>-like circle slowly closes in on them. </p><p>It’s honestly a bonkers premise for a FromSoftware game, but early impressions of the beta test build paint a glowing picture of the <em>Dark Souls</em> studio’s  experimental genre mashup. “<em>Nightreign </em>provides a delectable hit of <em>Elden Ring</em> in a repeatable microcosm,” Ed Nightingale <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes for <em>Eurogamer</em></a></span>. “It’s got the difficulty, the levelling, the boss battles, and the sense of discovery, but all at high speed for a new type of challenge, while its grim enemy selection is like a best-of Souls mixtape I’m itching to replay.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/gaming/522325/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-network-test&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/522325/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-network-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em>’s previewer</a></span> came away similarly impressed. “In many ways it would feel more like a frantic, PvE battle royale than it would the original <em>Elden Ring</em>,” writes Austen Goslin. “What’s even more surprising is just how well all of these elements mix together into a package that feels both true to the Soulslike genre, and totally new at the same time.” He says it’s less the open invitation to new fans that <em>Elden Ring</em> was than a love letter to existing <em>Souls </em>devotees. </p><p>Unlike the 2022 GOTY hit, <em>Nightreig</em>n features faster-paced combat and  streamlined progression during each run. Leveling up happens more quickly, Sites of Grace heal you automatically as you run by, and there’s no fall damage this time around. Relics, meanwhile, provide extra stat bonuses that last in-between runs, so not all of your progress is reset each time. Combined with eight character classes, there’s potentially a lot of room to develop custom strategies and replay through the same content over and over like a classic arcade game. </p><p>I’ll have a better sense of that for myself after playing this weekend’s beta test. I was already looking forward to it and now I’m extra stoked. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

EA saw all those first and passed on all of them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking to former Activision boss Bobby Kotick, Bing said: "This is why I have double-high respect for [Kotick] saying, 'no, no, this is going to be good to own.' And then you kept the people around. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm pretty sure that some of those companies, the creative leaders, would not have stuck around [for a company other than Activision], so you did some kind of miracle of keeping them productive for long periods of time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The merger between then Blizzard owner Vivendi Games and Activision in July 2008 created the Activision Blizzard we know today. At the time, World of Warcraft was already the world's biggest subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game.

"They tried to buy us a bunch of times, we had merger conversations a bunch of times," Kotick revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gordon added: "While you were doing Blizzard, that EA passed on, and you were doing King, EA did PopCap — just stupid things."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same interview, Kotick declared <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bobby-kotick-declares-former-ea-boss-john-riccitiello-worst-ceo-in-video-games"><u>ex-EA CEO John Riccitiello "the worst CEO in video games."</u></a> Kotick also opened up about Universal's 2016 adaptation of Activision Blizzard's Warcraft, calling it "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-activision-blizzard-boss-bobby-kotick-slams-warcraft-film-calls-it-one-of-the-worst-movies-ive-ever-seen"><u>one of the worst movies I've ever seen</u></a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Atari and Jeff Minter have announced that they are working together to create a reimagining of I, Robot -- no, not the movie.</p><p>I, Robot is an Atari title from 1984 notable both for being one of the first arcade games with 3D polygonal graphics rendered in real-time and for being quite rare, as it was a financial and critical disappointment at the time of its release. Jeff Minter and Atari are giving I, Robot a psychedelic overhaul, although it retains the same core gameplay loop of players needing to flip the color of tiles in a 3D space while avoiding being destroyed by a giant eye watching them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgN3u8JtGw8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PgN3u8JtGw8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Jeff Minter is known for being an innovative game designer behind titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tempest-2000/" data-ref-id="5000-2053">Tempest 2000</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/attack-of-the-mutant-camels/" data-ref-id="5000-6499">Attack of the Mutant Camels</a>. He also developed a real version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/polybius/" data-ref-id="5000-463293">Polybius</a>, the legendary urban-myth arcade game. Atari studio Digital Eclipse profiled him for their interactive documentary <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/llamasoft-the-jeff-minter-story/" data-ref-id="5000-611898">Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story</a>, while Atari at large let him revive, reimagine, and release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/akka-arrh/" data-ref-id="5000-577442">Akka Arrh</a>, a game which Atari had canceled in the 1980s.</p><p>Games like Akka Arrh and I, Robot are part of a larger initiative by Atari to revive its classic titles. Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lunar-lander-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-593939">Lunar Lander</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/yars-rising/" data-ref-id="5000-626270">Yars</a> were reimagined with brand-new games, while this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-revisits-an-arcade-classic-with-breakout-beyond/1100-6529212/" data-ref-id="1100-6529212">Breakout</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fatal-run-2089/" data-ref-id="5000-641181">Fatal Run</a>, and I, Robot are all getting that treatment.</p><p>I, Robot will be released for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and Atari VCS in Spring 2025.</p>

            <p>Open-world extraction shooter Exoborne from former The Division developers begins its playtest today over on Steam.</p>
<p>The studio, Sharkmob, was formed in 2017 by core members of The Division team from Ubisoft, and previously created battle royale Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodhunt, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/12-months-on-battle-royale-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-is-ending-development">shut down a year after release</a>.</p>
<p>Now it's launching a new project, first revealed at 2023's The Game Awards, that sees players in Exo-Rigs battling in teams in extreme weather conditions like violent tornadoes. Check out a gameplay walkthrough in the video below.</p>
<figure>

<p>Alongside team-based extraction gameplay in this post-climate change world, Sharkmob promises an evolving narrative, dynamic public events like high-stakes missions for rewards, and plenty of Exo-Rig customisation to "harness the fierce forces of nature".</p>
<p>The public playtest will be worldwide and is accessible via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/">Steam</a>. It will run from today until 17th February (1pm UK time).</p>
<p>It's not clear how much of the game will be included in the playtest, but it's certainly a great opportunity to get to grips with the game's team-based tactical action, vertical movement, and those weather effects.</p>
<p>Though the test is PC only, the game is set for release across PS5 and Xbox Series X/S too. It's being developed in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>There's also no final release date yet, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/post-apocalypse-extraction-shooter-exoborne-announced-by-ex-division-devs">Sharkmob has confirmed it will be a premium release</a> and not free-to-play.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We scored Elden Ring top marks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/23/elden-ring-review/">10/10 in our review</a>&nbsp;back in February 2022. “Elden Ring is the game Souls fans have been waiting for,” said Jason. “From the open world design, to riding into battle on Torrent’s back, and the dark narrative woven through the world, this is a clear Game of the Year frontrunner that will have us all ensnared for a long time to come.”</p>

But he also said <em>Erdtree </em>is “about the same volume as the Limgrave part of the base game,” the starting area of <em>Elden Ring</em>, containing “slightly more content.” </p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjEwNTg1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">Elden Ring Nightreign takes a big swing at a bigger audience</a></h2><div><p>It’s inaccurate and reductive to call <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320097/elden-ring-sequel-nightreign-the-game-awards-trailer">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em> a <em>Dark Souls </em>take on <em>Fortnite</em>. And yet, if pressed for an extremely brief elevator pitch — say, the kind you’d give to your friends who are curious about soulsborne games but are put off by all the discussions of their difficulty — it’s about as best as you could do. In my hands-on time with the game, I was compelled to ask my team at the outset of our very first run, “Well… where we droppin’ boys?” as we flew over the map in the claws of spectral birds. The similarity to<em> Fortnite</em> and other battle royale games was so striking, the reference simply had to be made. But once we got on the ground, <em>Fortnite</em> took a big ol’ backseat and <em>Elden Ring</em> reemerged as the foremost game <em>Nightreign</em> compares to.</p><p><em>Nightreign</em> strips out the combat and visual aesthetics of <em>Elden Ring</em> and lays them over gameplay that combines multiplayer battle royale action with roguelike live, die, repeat mechanics. Matches will take place over three days. During daylight, players will assault a Limgrave-like map (called Limveld), either solo or in teams of three, beating regular enemies and mini-bosses for powerful weapons, accessories, and runes to level up their characters. As daylight turns to night, a destructive, HP-draining storm called Night’s Tide shrinks the map, forcing the players to a tiny arena where they’ll face a major boss. Defeat the boss to begin the next day, when the cycle repeats and the match ends by defeating the final boss on the third night.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Lo-fi beats to chill / Waterfowl Dance to.</p><p>If video game soundtracks are what you use to get through the workday, then FromSoftware has a gift for you.

Bandai Namco has seemingly heard the great hue and cry from reviewers and players alike that <em>Erdtree </em>is far too difficult. In response, the publisher <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">is implementing a “calibration update”</a> that will reduce the level of difficulty by making players stronger. According to the patch notes for this update:</p><p>The key to understanding this update is the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment">Scadutree Fragments</a>. They are DLC-specific upgrade materials that increase a player’s attack and defense. The fragments are scattered throughout the map, requiring considerable exploration to find, but the increased power they grant makes them a high-priority resource.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186473/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-difficulty-nerf">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Live-action turtle pope.</p><p>It’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> day, and Bandai Namco has released a new live-action trailer for the <em>Elden Ring</em> expansion. Crucially, the short video shows what Miriel, Pastor of Vows would look like IRL. He, too, apologizes for the unseemly state of affairs.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjM1NDk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24182462/tips-for-starting-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring">Here are some small but helpful tips for starting Shadow of the Erdtree</a></h2><div><p>Before <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> finally goes live, Bandai Namco has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178537/great-haircut-tarnished">implemented a patch</a> that adds a couple of small features and updates just in time for the DLC’s launch in a few short hours. FromSoftware also shared a new launch trailer to herald the DLC’s arrival, but it’s chockful of spoilers, so beware. The update isn’t particularly earth-shattering, but it does include some things worth keeping in mind before all you Tarnished <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">get your head beat in by the vicious monsters patrolling the Shadow Lands</a>.</p><p>Firstly, we get new hair options! I was pretty down on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s character creator <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22951205/elden-rings-character-creator-black-hairstyles">for its lack of Black hairstyles</a>. It just didn’t make sense that the character creator was so robust and detailed but lacked hairstyles that represent a good chunk of the human population. There are five new styles to choose from, with two of them being dreadlocks. I chose the loose loc option so my Tarnished can finally get rid of her abhorrent pigtails. I’m not sure if the “white hairs” option was present in the base game or a new addition with this patch, but I really like how it adds gray to my locs, reminding me of when I started picking out errant gray hairs when I had locs.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24182462/tips-for-starting-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Elden Ring has an ‘issue’ on Steam Deck right now.</p><p>“Leaving your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs,” <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427">according to the <em>Elden Ring</em> X account</a>.

According to Bandai Namco <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-107">on the game’s website</a>, the patch intends to “encourage more versatility in terms of gameplay” — if “encourage” also means “make you a nigh unkillable god in single player.” A lot of weapons and spells were buffed, very few things were nerfed, and it seems like it’s going to get a lot harder to kill your friends in PVP. The patch notes are indeed massive, but I’ve picked out a few highlights.</p><p><strong>Glintstone Pebble / Shard Spiral: </strong>increased attack power</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/13/23402616/elden-ring-dlc-patch-notes-update">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTAyMTg2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009950/elden-ring-giant-map-game-design-from-software">All hail Elden Ring’s ever-growing map</a></h2><div><p>One of <em>Elden Ring’s</em> most polarizing features is its willingness to withhold information. While it’s less arcane than earlier FromSoftware titles like <em>Dark Souls</em>, the game constantly hands you items, quests, and mechanics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954823/elden-ring-open-world-guide">with very little explanation</a>. But after 130 hours and counting in the Lands Between, I’m in love with how well it sometimes deploys that obscurity. And there’s no better example than <em>Elden Ring’s</em> map, which has transcended a simple open-world convention to become one of my very favorite pieces of the game.</p><p>If you’re still in the early areas of <em>Elden Ring</em>, you might want to skip this post because I’m going to talk about a mechanic that relies on mystery. But if you’ve played a bit of the game, you might know what I’m talking about. <em>Elden Ring’s </em>map offers a constant give-and-take of showing players new spaces to explore, then pulling back a curtain to more places that they didn’t even realize could <em>exist. </em>It withholds information only to reveal it in a way that’s delightful, satisfying, and entirely in keeping with the world’s vast scope. It’s not just an interface element — it’s a meta-game in its own right.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009950/elden-ring-giant-map-game-design-from-software">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTAzOTU2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979436/elden-ring-speedrunners-world-record-race-30-minutes">Elden Ring speedrunners race to the bottom</a></h2><div><p><em>Elden Ring</em> is just so massive and its bosses are so tough that the average player will probably take over 60 hours to beat it. But speedrunners, assisted by some traditional speedrunning tricks and the game’s own open design, have somehow managed to beat the sprawling game in under 30 minutes.</p><p>For a speedrunning enthusiast, the first days of a game’s release are extremely exciting. New techniques and optimizations are constantly being discovered, as boss behaviors and the runner’s own luck work with or against them, making almost every run a possible world record. While every runner is ostensibly competing against the clock, two runners have emerged in the <em>Elden Ring</em> speed community, each racing to post lower and lower times.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979436/elden-ring-speedrunners-world-record-race-30-minutes">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li></ul><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22955370/elden-ring-fromsoftware-open-world/archives/2"><span>More Stories</span></a></section></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a few short months, you and up to two friends will be called upon to rush a few bosses on a large, shrinking map set in the same universe as the 2022 open worlder. Is it the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-2-isnt-in-development-right-now-but-from-software-do-have-several-other-games-in-the-works">many would like</a>? No. Is it going to kindle similar feelings of frustration, despair and sporadic religious ecstasy? The omens seem good.

<p>

A recap in case you missed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-software-reveal-elden-ring-nightreign-a-three-player-co-op-spin-off">the game's announcement last year</a>: each round of Nightreign challenges you to survive three in-game days, touring the environment in search of randomised elements and events so as to level up and prepare yourself for a boss fight at sunset. Make it to day three and you'll face one of eight Nightlords, whose ranks include characters from previous From Software games. As for player characters, you don't create your own as in vanilla Elden Ring. Instead, you'll pick from upgradeable Nightfarer prefabs such as the omnipurpose Wylder, the tanky Guardian and the agile and devious Duchess.
</p>
<p>
While the game is geared for co-op, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-will-support-singleplayer-but-it-might-not-reward-it">you have the option of playing offline with bot pals</a>, and you can queue for matches either alone, in pairs or in trios. So it doesn't quite depend on you having a banger human team of seasoned Tarnished ready to go, though I imagine that'll help. There's a beta test coming this weekend, though it's only on console. It runs from Friday 14th February to Monday 17th February as a series of three hour long sessions, and gives you access to four of eight Nightfarer characters.
</p>
<p>
We may or may not have somebody checking out the console beta. I won't name the individual in question because I do not wish to publicly associate them with one of those awful Eggsbogs or StayPlaytions and Tarnish their career forever. Did you know people don't even play games on Eggsbogs and StayPlaytions while sitting at desks? No, they play them while lolling on the sofa, like disgraceful Golden Retrievers. Fie!

Reimagined in Minter’s signature assault of colors, shapes and sounds, this new take on the eclectic arcade title is built from the ground up with new challenges, new twists, and a whole lot of llamas.</p><p>The premise of <em>I, Robot</em> is simple: You take control of an ox-headed robot on a mission to outwit the all-seeing eye. In each level, you’ll navigate across tiles, flipping each tile to proceed to the next. Make sure you don’t jump while the eye’s watching, or you’ll be zapped away in a flash. If you make it across the tiles, you’ll race down a tube blasting away any enemy shapes that move into your path and try to stop you. And you have to do all this inside of the 3D space of Minter’s kaleidoscopic visualizer.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Don’t get too comfortable, Minter has also thrown in some arena levels that challenge you to pick out and blast an onslaught of lethal enemies.</p><p>At its core it is a game that only Llamasoft could have made. A cacophony of colors dazzle your eyes as the music gradually builds up based on your progress. If you want to take a break from the arcade <a title="Genres > Action [2,473 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, jump into the ungame, where you can channel your inner Jeff Minter and play around with all the sights and sounds from the game.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>55 levels with a variety of challenges to conquer in each.</li><li>Unique tube-<a title="Genres > Shooter [3,998 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> bonus stages between each level.</li><li>Llamasoft’s unique brand of mind melting visuals.</li><li>Procedural music that builds as you rack up a high score.</li><li>Earn your bragging rights in the online leaderboards.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
