            <p>The team behind Electronic Arts-published early access skateboarding game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate-2025">Skate</a> have announced that they're laying off an unspecified number of staff. Well, I say that, Full Circle have actually announced that they're "transforming as a studio", which happens to entail "making changes to our team structure" which impact some folks' jobs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’re reshaping Full Circle to better support Skate’s long-term future and focus the team on the things that matter most to you - and making those things great," is another way they put it in a short <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle">blog post</a>. As for the affected devs, the studio noted that they're "talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of Skate", adding that "this decision is not a reflection of their impact and we’re committed to supporting them through this transition."</p>
<p>As for Skate, which only arrived in early access as of September last year, the plan is for the remaining staff to keep on grinding, while being able to "move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently". How having less hands on deck is supposed to make any of that easier, I don't know.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3354750/view/502850552192829278">most recent update</a> on plans for the game, put out late last week, Full Circle announced that they'll be changing how they present info about when new additions are coming - making clear which ones are actively in development and which are just being loosely explored/discussed with no set timeline for arrival.</p><p>"We’re doing this to be clear about where things stand - and about how we work," the studio wrote. "The further out something is on the roadmap, the more room it has to shift, or sometimes, be shelved altogether. But we’d rather show you what we’re thinking, even while it’s shifting, than wait until everything is locked. That’s how we want to approach Early Access with you. For example, Open World Collection was on the last roadmap. We’ve taken it off for now so we can focus on more social features – specifically Meetups and Turn-Based Competitive Modes – which we know are high on your wishlist."</p>
<p>Solidarity to those affected by these layoffs at Full Circle. If you're looking for an interesting read about Skate, J.C. Rodriguez's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sanitisation-of-skate-reminds-me-how-far-counterculture-has-fallen-and-how-hard-it-can-be-to-stay-inspired">feature from November</a> about the game and where it sits in the wider landscape of skateboarding culture is well worth a look.</p>

<p>Space Marine 2’s update 12.0 is live now, introducing the new Techmarine class, more PvE content, a weapon, a new map, and so much more. </p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is on schedule with their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-year-2-roadmap-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 2 roadmap</a>, with the new class, missions, and cosmetics arriving with Patch 12 in Q1 2026 as announced. Many details of this update were revealed in the PTS (public test server) patch notes, and it is now officially live. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-the-space-marine-2-techmarine-update-12-0">What’s New in the Space Marine 2 Techmarine Update 12.0? </h2>



<p>Space Marine 2 update 12.0’s highlight is the new playable class, Techmarine. This class features a technician with expertise in crowd control and defense. A lot of changes have been made to the class as part of the PTS update, including fixes and balancing adjustments. The Techmarine class also features a new weapon, the Omnissian Axe, which can deal damage to single enemies as well as surrounding crowds. </p>



<p>Then players can look forward to the Tarantula Sentry Gun as part of PvE content in this update, with Techmarines able to activate Sentry Turrets in PvE missions. The new PvE Map is called Disruption, and it takes the Space Marines to the Hive City of Avarax, where they have to “reinforce the overwhelmed Cadian defenses against a massive Tyranid swarm.”</p>



<p>The latest update for Space Marine 2 introduces several new features for players. These include new PvE equipment, Restorative Stims, and Shared Heads for both PvE and PvP characters, enhancing customization options. Additionally, a new Tech feature, Siege Host Migration, has been added, along with a VO Selector. </p>



<p>The update brings 21 new battlefield conditions, a Custom Stratagems Mode for PvE, and Heroic Items. Players can also look forward to fresh DLC content from the Raven Guard Champion Pack, gameplay and balancing tweaks, new custom armor set pieces, and various fixes. Interested readers can check out the patch notes below to learn more. </p>

<p><strong>NEW FEATURES</strong></p>



<h3>New Class: Techmarine</h3>



<p><em>We are introducing a new playable class: the Techmarine! This mighty technician specialises in crowd control and area defense, handling multiple combat tasks simultaneously. This is primarily possible with his Servo-Gun ability. When activated, it locks onto enemies in a line of sight and automatically fires at them while the Techmarine continues fighting in melee or range. Furthermore, the Servo-Gun allows executing Gun Strikes without interrupting other actions.</em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Valve's Lionel Hutzes have been summoned to slide down the fireman's pole and deal with yet more legal wranglings involving the behemoth behind Steam. New York state attorney general Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against the company for allegedly violating gambling laws via the use of loot boxes in games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people," attorney general James writes in a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through">press release</a> announcing the suit's filing. "Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve’s illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers."</p>
<p>Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> are named directly in the release as games which, in the office of the attorney general's estimation following an investigation, "enable gambling by enticing users to pay for the chance to win a rare virtual item of significant monetary value".</p>
<p>"In Valve’s most popular game, the process resembles a slot machine, with an animated spinning wheel that eventually rests on a selected item," the release continues. "The randomly selected virtual items have no in-game functionality but can be sold online for money, with one item reportedly being sold for more than $1 million."</p><p>Counter-Strike gun and knife skins selling for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-casually-gut-counter-strikes-billion-dollar-skins-market-with-a-small-update">bananas real money sums</a> via third-party marketplaces is specifically mentioned further on, with the attorney general's office asserting the Valve "facilitates and even assists these third-party marketplaces in their operations". In addition to emphasising that she sees Valve's loot boxes of being "especially harmful to children", James also dips into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/academic-studies-of-violence-cause-violence">very</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-arent-we-discussing-videogame-violence">very</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/president-trump-showed-a-weird-frag-montage-in-his-video-game-violence-meeting">very</a> long-running talking point that is whether games with violent gunning in them are a factor in causing real life violent gunning.</p>
<p>"It is important to note that Valve’s promotion of games that glorify violence and guns helps fuel the dangerous epidemic of gun violence, particularly among young gamers who can become numbed to grave violence before their brains are fully developed," the attorney general alleges.</p>
<p>Overall, James' lawsuit seeks to "permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and pay fines for violating New York’s laws".</p>
<p>I've reached out to Valve for comment.</p>
<p>The lawyers of the company behind Steam certainly haven't been allowed to sit around and twiddle their thumbs in recent years. Just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-will-face-that-656m-uk-lawsuit-accusing-them-of-overcharging-steam-customers-as-tribunal-rules-it-can-go-ahead">last month</a>, a tribunal ruled that a £656 million UK lawsuit accusing them of using Steam's dominance over the PC market to act "anti-competitively", resulting in customers being overcharged, will go ahead to the next stages of the legal process.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's where to pick it up.</h2></p><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">February 27 is a special day in the Pokémon calendar, commemorating the release of the very first Pokémon games in Japan. Known to fans around the world as ‘Pokémon Day’, 2026 will be a special 30th anniversary celebration as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To celebrate, The Pokémon Company has recently dropped a 30th Anniversary Pokémon Day TCG Collection, featuring a specially stamped foil Pikachu promo card, a metallic coin featuring the 30th anniversary logo, and three booster packs from Phantasmal Flames and Mega Evolution.</p><div id="234519"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234519" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Pokémon Day 2026 Collection</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Proving a popular set, Pokémon TCG's 30th Anniversary TCG Collection is stocked at all major retailers. However, navigating the market requires a bit of strategy; prices are still fluctuating from the original launch price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the week following its release, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a07ekA?object_uuid=e35de0ab-d25e-4849-bb7b-c223bed34345&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGplayer</u></a> reported a low sale price of $18.79, but it's currently sitting at around $26-$27 market price. That’s a decent drop from the $50 pricing we were seeing earlier in the year, even if it is still slightly more than the expected $17.99 MSRP. Still, that's a significant 58.87% drop in resale value in just a month, making this all the more affordable for fans to pick up right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for the lowest "in-stock" price right now, direct from a major retailer, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Day-2026-Collection/dp/B0G2FVLXVL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=36VQRZIV3UEAJ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fpJDom5qEWmKC0FcSlN6VIskxWDbsXrw_vz63nbDXOnPWWrJIH7xP97VRCaDCHQoaTT0Ax7GTdN5nAlTKd8v0h9qirbSbiiEWD7eKZwOhLB-lNHalc47TcMFdCpXSBpPCg-DQ0-aLHK6CIw_iviZoheXuUpnyGVWClbf0bjytHgyS6KktRc0tr9vVcWTSni_lAL_vwiFH5wcas89RIfpjBp9RReM80I2BPu6NENeqB5DzDIyrVlAZKqGB5VFaoUy2icu9opjnW-xVdPVcgpB8oJ8vCyIA96S2gcHIWaaKbg.dCTp1x9Nb8Laf8Ks31TMSiKjSHnlOi-hH0k2yZJu17s&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=pokemon+pokemon+day+collection&amp;qid=1768584789&amp;sprefix=pokemon+pokemon+day+collection%2Caps%2C210&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=tcg-ign-20&amp;ascsubtag=06U9e7yJctIoHdAg4l1vnCG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Amazon</u></a> leads the pack at $38.99. That being said, we’ve seen them dip <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-day-2026-tcg-collection-is-back-in-stock-with-a-major-new-discount-at-amazon"><u>as low as $26.99</u></a> here before, so it’s up to you if you want to hold for that or opt for TCGplayer instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q45Eq4?object_uuid=e35de0ab-d25e-4849-bb7b-c223bed34345&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Best Buy</u></a> is holding firm at $49.99, albeit the listing is via a third party seller, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/aR72pE?object_uuid=e35de0ab-d25e-4849-bb7b-c223bed34345&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Target</u></a> has already been cleaned out of their $17.99 stock - you can’t be surprised at this point!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re hunting for a sub-$20 pull, it’s best to keep an eye on local inventory or set up an alert for online restocks from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg"><u>reputable resellers</u></a>. Just remember - these figures are based on US retailers, so international collectors should factor in global shipping costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to resell yourself, I’d recommend you keep looking. Given the lack of exclusive anniversary packs inside, it’s not likely the Pokémon TCG's 30th Anniversary TCG Collection will turn over a huge profit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, while the stamped foil promo card of Pikachu isn’t a unique illustration, its status as the first official 30th-anniversary product might be worth something to completionists in a few years. I’d recommend picking up two at or near MSRP if you’ve got the space - one to hold onto as an investment, one to rip.</p></div><div id="235758"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235758" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: First Partner Illustration Collection - Series 1</h3></p></div></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, the next best 30th anniversary set to keep an eye out for is the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-first-partner-illustration-collection-explainer">First Partner Illustration Collection series</a>, with the first release incoming on March 20. That will feature a Promo Booster Pack, where you can pull three of nine illustration rare-style promo cards.

<p>We had a lot of love for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> on its release. "With smart additions that move the series forward, this is the most accessible, deepest and simply very best Monster Hunter to date," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-rise-review-the-switchs-best-game-since-breath-of-the-wild">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Rise review from 2021</a>.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slime-rancher-2">Slime Rancher 2</a>, well, back in 2022 Christian Donlan called it both "glorious" and "ghastly" after he took it for a short spin.</p>
<p>"Slime Rancher 2 is absolutely gorgeous, a kind of duvet-soft archipelago filled with thick waving grass, sun-warmed rocks, and dreamy coastal vistas. It is such a pleasure to explore, I would be out there wandering even if I wasn't lured through it with the promise of slimes to capture," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-2-is-glorious-and-ghastly-and-thats-whats-fascinating-about-it">Eurogamer's Slime Rancher 2 feature</a>.</p>
<p>PGA Tour 2K25, Monster Hunter Rise, Slime Rancher 2 and The Elder Scrolls Online Collection: Gold Road will be available for all PlayStation Plus members from 3rd March. They will be on the service until Monday, 6th April.</p>

			<p>It seems like <strong>Wolfenstein 3</strong> is finally happening. It's been over eight years since the release of <strong>Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</strong>, and fans were almost losing hope that the third chapter of <strong>William "B.J." Blazkowicz</strong>'s story would actually happen.</p>



<p>Developer MachineGames <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-iii-hint-play-with-format/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had started teasing it very early</a>, just <a href="https://wccftech.com/pete-hines-confirms-wolfenstein-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a few months after the launch of the second entry</a>, but then they went quiet about it for a long time. With <strong>Arkane Lyon</strong>'s help, the Swedish studio would instead release two spin-offs, <strong>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</strong> and the VR-only <strong>Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot</strong>, in 2019. Both of them failed critically and commercially, though, and MachineGames turned to  <strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong>, based on a pitch by Bethesda's <strong>Todd Howard</strong>. I'm glad they did; <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was an amazing game</a></strong>, and it was rightfully recognized as such. That said, <strong>it's high time to finish Blazkowicz's journey</strong>. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/machine-games-reportedly-has-wolfenstein-3-r6-siege-like-multiplayer-game-on-the-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors about Wolfenstein 3 being in development were reignited</a></strong> thanks to reports from Kotaku and Windows Central. MachineGames studio director <strong>Jerk Gustafsson</strong> also chimed in a few weeks ago and, while remaining vague about the development timeline, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/it-can-be-now-it-can-be-later-but-were-not-done-with-it-machinegames-will-make-wolfenstein-3-eventually/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed that the developer wasn't done with the series</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Now, though, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-wolfenstein-3-first-story-details-unveiled-as-casting-begins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MP1st is reporting</a> that a casting call is already out, with Performance Director <strong>Tom Keegan</strong> and Casting Director <strong>Emily Schweber</strong> attached to the process. The game's codename is apparently '<strong>Valkyrie</strong>', and the casting call is for the role of <strong>Sofiya</strong>, a Ukrainian orphan aged between 8 and 11. Sofiya is said to form a bond with the main character throughout the game and accompany him on his travels alongside her adopted dog, Ralph.</p>



<p>MP1st also adds a brief overview of the character from the casting call:</p>



<p><em>While initially suspicious and traumatized by war, she blooms under the care of the resistance (possibly referring to the Kreisau Circle) as a strong-willed survivor.<br></em><br>Performance capture reportedly begins in April, and additional shooting dates are planned throughout 2026 and into 2027.</p>



<p>Still, <strong>it will likely take some time before MachineGames can show us anything of Wolfenstein 3</strong>. They were, after all, busy with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle until recently with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-a-bit-of-a-disappointment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Order of Giants DLC</a>. Perhaps 2028-2029 could be a realistic release window. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the studio <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is also working with Amazon MGM Studios on a TV adaptation</a></strong> that will air on Prime Video.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Thing</li>



<li>Person</li>



<li>Place</li>



<li>Animal</li>



<li>Work</li>



<li>Nature</li>



<li>Game</li>



<li>Concept</li>



<li>Idea</li>



<li>Food</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-26-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 26, 2026</h2>



<p>Without giving away today’s Contexto answer, here are a few helpful hints to get you thinking in the right direction:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hint 1:</strong>&nbsp;Generalising term</li>



<li><strong>Hint 2:</strong>&nbsp;Refers to plant life</li>



<li><strong>Hint 3:</strong>&nbsp;Opposite of fauna</li>
</ul>



<p>If they don’t help, then here are the nine closest words, going from tenth to second:</p>



<ul>
<li>Subtropical</li>



<li>Fern</li>



<li>Vegetation</li>



<li>Tropical</li>



<li>Endemic</li>



<li>Biota</li>



<li>Wildflowers</li>



<li>Botanical</li>



<li>Fauna</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve tried everything, and still can’t figure out today’s Contexto answer, then you can find it down below:</p>



<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Flora</p>



<p>Flora is the plants of a particular region, habitat, or geological period.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-contexto-game-after-1257">When Is The Next Contexto Game After #1257?</h2>



<p><strong>Contexto is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone, meaning the next game will start on February 27</strong></p>



<p>The Contexto schedule is very consistent, with a new game releasing at the same time every day.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The casting for Wolfenstein 3 has begun.</p>
<p>There has long been chatter that MachineGames, the team also behind the sublime Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, wasn't done with the Wolfenstein series. Towards the end of 2025, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-doesnt-sound-like-weve-heard-the-last-from-machinegames-wolfenstein-series">studio head Jerk Gustafsson said the team would like to work on a New Colossus sequel</a>. "We have a story to tell," he said during a documentary by Noclip, which was released in September.</p>

<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Then, just this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-developer-machinegames-still-plans-to-finish-its-wolfenstein-trilogy">Gustafsson told Eurogamer's sister site GamesIndustry that the "intention has always been to go back to Wolfenstein"</a>, and MachineGames "wanted to finish the trilogy". And, it seems like we are one very key step closer to that becoming a reality.</p>
<p>According to a casting call seen by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-wolfenstein-3-first-story-details-unveiled-as-casting-begins">MP1st</a>, performance capture for Wolfenstein 3 - codenamed Valkyrie - is scheduled to kick off later this year, in April. This process will allegedly run into 2027.</p>
<p>As for story details, the call is for a character named Sofiya, who is described as an orphan between the ages of 8-11 from Ukraine. She has a dog called Ralph, and the two of them form a bond with Blazkowicz. William "B.J." Blazkowicz - or, to give him his proper name Terror-Billy, the scourge of the Nazi empire - is the Wolfenstein franchise's lead.</p>
<p>"While initially suspicious and traumatised by war, she blooms under the care of the resistance (possibly referring to the Kreisau Circle) as a strong-willed survivor.," Sofiya's casting description reads.</p>
<p>Further details - such as whether Sofiya actually full on joins B.J's crew or if we can expect to see some kind of The Last of Us Joel and Ellie style surrogate father daughter relationship form - remain to be seen. What do you hope MachineGames is cooking up?</p>

</figure>
<p>As for the more immediate future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">MachineGames is set to release Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on Switch 2 later this year</a>. Like I have said, this game is brilliant, and I loved being able to whip crack my way across the globe with Indy. "Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">original five star Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wolfenstein-is-the-next-game-series-to-get-an-adaptation-for-tv">Wolfenstein TV series in the works</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Bethesda's Todd Howard is staying tight-lipped on how things are progressing</a>.</p>

<p>In a confirmation via social media, it has revealed it will bolster the post-apocalyptic experience with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-what-is-dlss-nvidias-deep-learning-super-sampling-explained">support for DLSS</a> and by also providing "additional stability improvements". This update will join the 60fps and 40fps modes, which are already in the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bethesda:</strong> Thank you to everyone who has already jumped in to explore the Commonwealth on Nintendo Switch 2!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>In addition to our current 60fps and 40fps modes we'll be adding the following in an upcoming update:<br>
- Support for DLSS<br>
- Additional stability improvements</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully this improves the overall experience and irons out any bugs present in the launch build. There's no mention about when exactly this next update will be released, but it's nice to see Bethesda at least providing players with a heads up, especially after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a>'s bumpy start on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This release of Fallout 4 on Nintendo's new hybrid hardware follows last week's update for The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, which added visual and performance modes. If you want to see both of these games in action, be sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/X9yfk_TCAUE">our YouTube channel</a>. We've also got a Fallout 4 review on the way.</p>

<p>But why?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="5c582cec1f55a"><a title="Gran Turismo 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c582cec1f55a/gran-turismo-7.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PlayStation</em></figcaption></figure><p>PlayStation's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gran_turismo_7">Gran Turismo 7</a> has apparently been linked to the Switch 2 in a wild new rumour, but it doesn't necessarily mean what you might be thinking.</p>
<p>This information comes from video game journalist Jeff Grubb, who recently responded to a fan on his show, asking a question about "the real driving simulator" and the possibility of it racing on to another platform.</p>
<p>While there was a fair amount of speculation on Grubb's end about <em>other</em> Sony franchises during this segment, in terms of Gran Turismo, he claims he's actually heard about a Switch 2 version, but doesn't expect anything to come of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jeff Grubb:</strong> "I heard recently that Gran Turismo was running on the Switch 2. I don't think it's going to come to the Switch 2, but I heard it was running on it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, why would Sony bother to get a game like this up and running on the Switch 2, but not even consider a release?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1reac3w/jeff_grubb_playstation_had_gran_turismo_7_running/">One popular theory</a> seems to be it's testing the waters <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/sony-allegedly-encouraging-devs-to-use-ps5s-new-low-power-mode-prompting-fresh-ps6-handheld-speculation?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">as rumours circulate</a> about the company potentially releasing a new PlayStation handheld. In other words, this could be research and development, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Gaming enthusiasts online have also pointed out how companies over the years <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2020/05/gears_of_war_ps3_footage_appears_online_epic_games_comments">got titles up and running on certain platforms</a>, but never went any further. If this is more than a rumour, it wouldn't necessarily be the first time we've heard about something like this.</p>
<p>As our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/for-some-reason-sony-apparently-got-gran-turismo-7-running-on-switch-2">friends at Push Square</a> further note, Switch 2's primary controllers <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-with-analogue-trigger-compatibility-that-work-with-the-gamecube-nso-controller">don't have analogue triggers</a> and the system doesn't offer "robust" steering wheel support, all of which is considered essential to experience Gran Turismo "at its best".</p>
<p>Of course, if there are any significant developments, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>

<p>Last May, an Xbox Wire post announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/ecco_the_dolphin">Ecco The Dolphin</a> would be making a comeback with a remaster of not only the first game, but also the sequel <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/ecco_the_tides_of_time">Tides of Time</a>.</p>
<p>Platforms weren't mentioned at the time, but a new two-page spread for the remaster in Famitsu this week lists the Switch - seemingly confirming the remaster is on its way to Nintendo's hybrid platform.</p>
<p>Additional details have also been shared by the series creator Ed Annunziata in this feature. As highlighted by Nintendo Everything, the plan is to include 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit versions in a single package, and allow players to swap between visual styles in "real-time".</p>
<p>The final name of this project is still being decided, but the favourite at the moment appears to be "Ecco Complete". Of course, this is all subject to localisation changes.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, these remasters will also be joined by a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/ecco-the-dolphin-is-making-a-comeback-with-remasters-and-new-game">"new, third game"</a> at some stage. More updates related to Ecco are expected to take place this April, according to an <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">official Ecco the Dolphin countdown website</a>.</p>
<p>As we've previously mentioned, the original Ecco the Dolphin game, which launched in 1992 on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis, is playable via the Switch Online + Expansion Pack.</p>

<p>New marriage candidates, pre-release footage and more</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The indie success story <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> is today celebrating its 10th anniversary. As part of this, the game's creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has announced a special video broadcast.</p>
<p>It will apparently run for "about 23 minutes", and fans can expect to see some "pre-release footage" as well as the reveal of the new 1.7 marriage candidates at the end. Barone actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/stardew-valley-creator-teases-two-more-marriage-candidates-for-update-1-7">teased this upcoming reveal</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>Here's exactly what you can expect to see and hear about during the anniversary broadcast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ConcernedApe:</strong> "I made a video for tomorrow's 10-year Stardew Valley Anniversary, it will "premiere" tomorrow at 11am PST...I go over some old builds of the game w/ commentary, briefly go over the many updates, give a special message to the players, and reveal the 2 new marriage candidates in 1.7."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What time is the Stardew Valley 10-Year anniversary video premiere?</h3>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 11am PST / 12pm MST / 1pm CST / 2pm EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 7pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 8pm CET / 9pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 4am (Thu) JST / 3am (Thu) AWST / 6am (Thu) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>To date, this hugely popular farming and lifestyle sim has now sold millions of copies worldwide and it's been updated over the years with a lot of free content.</p>
<p>Most recently, the game was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-is-now-available">made available for the Switch 2</a>. This version hasn't been released in every region just yet, but Barone mentioned last week that the Switch 2 Edition (and free upgrade for existing players) would be coming to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/stardew-valleys-new-update-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-live">European and Japanese eShop in "a few weeks"</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">What are the odds?</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The attorney general of New York Letitia James is suing Valve, alleging the platform illegally promotes gambling to children.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release issued by the attorney general's office today</a>, which states that following an investigation, the office of the attorney general "found that Valve’s video games, including Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, and Dota 2, enable gambling by enticing users to pay for the chance to win a rare virtual item of significant monetary value."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In Valve’s most popular game [Counter-Strike 2], the process resembles a slot machine, with an animated spinning wheel that eventually rests on a selected item. The randomly selected virtual items have no in-game functionality but can be sold online for money, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/counter-strike-skin-sells-for-over-1-million">one item reportedly being sold for more than $1 million</a>. The lawsuit alleges that Valve has made billions of dollars luring its users, many of whom are teenagers or younger, to engage in gambling in the hopes of winning expensive virtual items that they can cash in on. With this lawsuit, Attorney General James seeks to permanently stop Valve from continuing to promote illegal gambling in its games and to pay disgorgement and fines."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The lawsuit itself describes both the mechanics of how loot boxes work in all three games, as well as the ways in which users can "cash in" virtual items, either by selling them on the Steam Community Market, or by connecting their accounts to third-party marketplaces, the latter of which the attorney general's office says it found Valve "facilitates and even assists." The attorney general's office argues that Valve's loot box model is "quintessential gambling, prohibited under New York's Constitution and Penal Law." Gambling is illegal in New York with only some exceptions, which the attorney general says are all irrelevant here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question of whether loot boxes can or should be regulated as gambling has been ongoing for more than a decade, with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/loot-box-state-of-play-2024-another-trip-around-the-world-of-regulation" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different countries issuing various regulations around them over the years</a>. China, South Korea, and some other countries require companies to disclose odds on receiving certain items in very specific ways. In Australia, the presence of loot boxes automatically nets a game an M rating (not recommended for children under 15, albeit not legally restricted), and anything with simulated gambling gets an R18+ rating, meaning it cannot be sold to minors. Belgium has attempted to ban them entirely, though it is apparently struggling to enforce this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The New York lawsuit aims to permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, make full restitution to consumers and give up all profit its made from this practice, and pay fines for violation of New York laws. If successful, this case could have significant ripple effects on the rest of the industry, as companies are forced to confirm to an increasing array of different loot box laws in different regions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people,” said Attorney General James in a statement. “Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve’s illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to Valve for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
