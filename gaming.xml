            <p>I'm not sure it's physically or metaphysically possible to overfeed the Maw, but this week we put that desperate daydream to the test. There aren't any mega-sequels in the offing, none of yer Call Of Dutifuls, just an absolute deluge of neat and nifty originals - a deluge of such proportions I have been forced to unsheathe my HTML hammer and smash the customary single paragraph of PC game releases in twain.</p> <!--more-->
<p>On Monday 15th July, we have lunar base-builder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1465470/The_Crust/">The Crust</a>, handsome 8-bit platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1459010/Fallen_Leaf/">Fallen Leaf</a>, and gelatinous roguelike shmup <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1536620/Galactic_Glitch/">Galactic Glitch</a>. On Tuesday 16th July, there's Strange Scaffold's latest worrying oddity, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3011440/CLICKOLDING/">Clickolding</a>, in which a guy just wants to watch you use a clicker in a motel room, and the bright and breezy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flock">Flock</a>, a fluttering creature-collector from the makers of Wilmot's Warehouse. I was going to call Wednesday 17th July a day of blessed, restorative oblivion, but then I glimpsed cyberpunk noir detective game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1939970/Nobody_Wants_to_Die/">Nobody Wants To Die</a>, and folkloric metroidvania <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1614440/B_Path_of_the_Teal_Lotus/">Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus.</a>
</p><p>You'll need a day off midweek, because on Thursday 18th July, it all gets a bit "autumn 1998". In no particular order, please be upstanding for: the amphibian shadow-hopping of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/schim">Schim</a>, the alpine slaycationing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeons-of-hinterberg">Dungeons Of Hinterberg</a>, the gunpowdery sorcery of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn">Flintlock: Siege Of Dawn</a>, the mucky early access kingdom management of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norland">Norland</a>, and the immortal headshrinking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-therapist">Vampire Therapist</a>. And on Friday 19th July, finally, a colourful closing ceremony in the shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess</a>, aka <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-was-the-best-game-i-played-at-summer-game-fest">the best game I played at Summer Game Fest</a>. Oh, and catacomb-pillaging co-opper Dungeonborne. Thanks for ruining my tidy finish, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeonborne">Dungeonborne</a>.</p>
<p>Are there any important PC releases we've missed? I sincerely hope not. It may not be possible to overfeed the Maw, but it's definitely possible to give the Maw the runs, and you don't want to be within a thousand feet of that particular Altered World Event. Have a jolly week of PC gaming all.</p>

			<p>Playground Games' Forza Horizon 5 has reached 40 million players around the globe, it's been revealed.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/SnapBlastPLAY/status/1812623587011940361?t=2TWlpv2ylFRCJAxN_gEiQg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> on X by 'SnapBlastPLAY', and <a href="https://x.com/klobrille/status/1812648759278579885" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked up</a> by known Xbox insider Klobrille, Playground's most recent entry in the Horizon series was played by 40 million players across both Xbox and PC since the game's launch in 2021. Of course, this doesn't mean active players playing the racing game, but those who at least downloaded the game. More details about this stat are unknown, but it's quite impressive nonetheless. Looking at previous reached player numbers from previous years, it's clear that Horizon 5 reaches quite the amount of players each month. Back in November of 2021, shortly after the game's launch, Xbox's Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-breaks-4-5-million-players-milestone-largest-xbox-game-studios-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the game reached more than 4.5 million players. Here's what we wrote about the racing game in our launch review back then:</p>
<p>"Forza Horizon 5 is yet another step up for the series and arguably the best racing game ever made", we <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. "Offering a host of content across a fantastic representation of Mexico, its varied terrain and scenery, there's so much to explore and race. A massive roster of cars will perform all of these, each feeling different from the others, with a variety of upgrade and tuning options almost matching those of simulation titles. While there are a few minor niggles here and there, they are nearly so small as to be hardly worth mentioning. All in all, it's impossible not to recommend this for anybody, regardless of them being a fan of racing games or not, as this is that good."</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 is available now worldwide on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. The game has been available on Game Pass since day-one.</p>

		<div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Once you get over the terrifying idea that your shadow is not only alive, but also capable of wandering around on its own, SCHiM is a delightful and whimsical indie game that gently plays with your preconceptions.</p>
<p><iframe title="SCHiM - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YHSWlEFJYs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As with the best games, SCHiM’s central mechanic needs very little explanation.&nbsp; Schims are a person’s soul or spirit. They are capable of leaving their owners body – is that creators? Do we ‘create’ our spirits? – taking on the form of adorable inky frog-like creatures. These can hop from shadow to shade, but never out in the open on their own for long, with a tether to their owner ensuring that they snap back to their original location.</p>


<p>The opening of the game takes you through a person’s early life, with you and your Schim – who is fundamentally your shadow – initially riding tricycles, jumping on trampolines and generally having a good time, before steadily growing up, taking in highlights like graduation and meeting a girl, before experiencing some of the less enjoyable aspects of life like break-ups and getting fired from your job.</p>
<p>That’s when you have ‘the incident’. While running for a bus your person falls over, somehow severing the connection between him and his Schim, and on discovering that he’s somehow shadow-less, he panics and runs away. This leaves you to make your shadowy way back to your owner, hopping, bouncing and skulking through the shade.</p>


<p>All of this storytelling is done without a single line of dialogue or text, and it’s done with a clear sense of intent and purpose, as well as a playful eye for how to tell a story without words. The simple but elegant art style helps here, and the world has a solidity and a realness to it that feels utterly grounded, while the shadow creatures have an adorable Ghibli-esque charm to them. You’ll nestle in amongst other shadows as you invade their turf, and little touches such as cars’ larger, sleepier shadows eyeing you with annoyance really brings Schim to life.</p>
<p>Despite playing like a platformer, Schim is as much a puzzle game as anything else. Working out your route towards your objective can be fiendishly difficult, and there were times my sanity started to fray. You can make one expansive leap from a shadow, and if you don’t immediately land on another one you can make a drastically shorter second jump. This is often handy for making a slight correction, but no use whatsoever if you’re stuck with a large area to try and clear.</p>

<p>You can back yourself into a bit of a shadowy hole at times, and while you can restart each level, that can mean losing a bunch of progress. It doesn’t happen too often though, with a solution eventually showing itself. There’s multiple ways for your shadow to interact with the world, from bouncing on power cables to switching traffic lights, and its these that open up the path ahead. Sometimes it’s just a change of perspective you need, swinging the camera around to reveal an unseen shadow lurking behind a bin.</p>
<p>Some of the frustration is melted away by the tuneful electronic soundtrack that gently tootles along in the background. It feels especially Nintendo-like in nature, reminding me of the background noodling in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/01/51-worldwide-games-clubhouse-review/">51 Worldwide Games</a>, with an emphasis on the soothing side of things. SCHiM is a vibe, and I really bought into it.</p>

<p>While they’re utterly different games, SCHiM has the same gentle touch as Untitled Goose Game, and that’s the closest, and greatest comparison I could make. It’s not mechanical, but there’s an atmosphere and a sensation that the two titles share, not least in puzzling out the way forward, and the release of calming endorphins when you work it all out.</p>

			<p>In last month's Nintendo Direct, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-zelda-starring-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom would finally put the titular character in the spotlight nearly forty years after the franchise's first installment. However, as <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39983/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), Link will be playable, too.</p>
<p><em>This is an adventure game in which players assume the role of Zelda as she attempts to dispel rifts throughout Hyrule and rescue Link. From a ¾-overhead perspective, players explore various environments while fighting stylized enemies (e.g., humans, creatures). As Link, players use a sword and arrows to defeat enemies; Zelda can use a magic wand to summon creatures (e.g., wind-up knights, pig soldiers, slime) for battle. Some enemies can be defeated by being set on fire; other creatures dissolve into mist when defeated. Battle sequences are somewhat frenetic, with several enemies attacking/fighting at once.</em></p>
<p>It is presently unclear whether both characters will be switchable at will or not. New information will likely be shared by Nintendo soon, considering that The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is slated to launch in just over two months, on September 26. Here's an official overview of the upcoming Nintendo Switch exclusive:</p>
<p><em>Across the vast lands of Hyrule, strange rifts have appeared and have taken many people, including Link. Now alone, Zelda meets the fairy Tri,&nbsp;receives a mysterious staff called the Tri Rod, and sets off on a journey across Hyrule to save her kingdom. By waving the Tri Rod at a table she found, Zelda learned how to create an imitation of it called an Echo. Once you learn an Echo of something, you can recreate it whenever you'd like. Even if there's a wall blocking your path you can create Echoes of tables to get a leg up. You can create wooden boxes of old beds and unusual things like water blocks. How you use them separately or together is entirely up to you.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, there's a <a href="https://wccftech.com/live-action-zelda-movie-officially-in-production-nintendo-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live action The Legend of Zelda movie in production</a> at Sony Pictures Entertainment. It will be directed by Wes Ball (known for directing the Maze Runner trilogy and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes), while the screenplay will be handled by Derek Connolly, who worked on the Jurassic World trilogy, Kong: Skull Island, Pokémon: Detective Pikachu, and Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Global Gaming Revenue to Reach $300 Billion in Next Three Years]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/global-gaming-revenue-300-billion/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/global-gaming-revenue-to-reach-300-billion-in-next-three-years.927189/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/global-gaming-revenue-300-billion/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It’s no big secret that the games industry is becoming something of a cash cow. More free-to-play games laden with microtransactions are emerging every day, and over time, the cost of investing in a console and an array of games is rising. That’s inflation for you, but for all their complaining, gamers are keeping up with the flow.</p>



<p>It was recently estimated that, as a result of these trends, the global gaming industry’s revenue will reach epic proportions soon, hitting more than $300 billion by 2027.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-money-money-money">Money, Money, Money</h2>



<p>In a financial forecast <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/business/brandwagon-global-revenues-in-the-video-game-industry-to-exceed-307-billion-by-2027-says-bain-amp-company-3553679/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Bain &amp; Company</a>, it was suggested that the global gaming revenue will secure a CAGR of 9% between now and 2027. This will take the revenue cap from $199 billion in 2022 to a whopping $307 billion by 2027. The report highlighted that young gamers aged 13 – 17, a very impressionable market, now spend 40% more time playing games than engaging with other media, such as television shows.</p>



<p>With landmark investments and acquisitions taking place – such as Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision – more money is floating around than ever before. Every vertical, from esports to mobile gaming, is undergoing growth at the moment. These analysts have also been studying the rise of streamers and ‘gaming influencers’. Over time, they’re becoming multimedia superstars, pulling in millions of viewers and netting insane revenue simply for broadcasting video games online.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of money out there, and the CAGR is nuts. Before long, gaming will be more valuable and powerful than the movie, music, or television industries. As technology is only becoming more advanced, it’s only a matter of time. It helps that there are games on the horizon – like GTA 6 – that will pull in billions of dollars by themselves.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-anime-skins/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-has-anime-skins-lined-up-for-xdefiant-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.927183/</guid>

<p>XDefiant has been in the wild for almost two months, and Ubisoft continues to tweak and balance the game in response to the community’s sentiments. The free-to-play shooter blew up when it was released on May 21, but it’s no big secret that the player base has already withered somewhat. However, there’s plenty in the pipeline, according to dataminers.</p>



<p>It was recently claimed that there is a slew of anime-themed skins heading to XDefiant, with dataminers uncovering such weapon skins in the game’s files, amongst other things.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-old-trick">That Old Trick</h2>



<p>As XDefiant is a free-to-play shooter, it relies on a microtransaction-backed operating model to stay afloat. To that end, players can purchase a battle pass with each new season, as well as pay to unlock various operator skins and weapons camos. It’s a tried and tested system that’s nothing short of traditional at this point.</p>



<p>Soon, Ubisoft might be introducing a range of anime skins in XDefiant, according to dataminers. In the game’s files, examples were uncovered, such as a skin showing a ‘generic’ purple-haired anime character adorning the side of an AA-12 shotgun:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans are now wondering if these anime skins will have anything to do with ‘legitimate’ crossovers, or if they’re simply unbranded, almost AI-created characters that don’t exist outside of that skin. There are potential collaborations on the cards, but with the way XDefiant behaves, they’ll likely all be related to Ubisoft’s slew of franchises.</p>

Martin saga wrapped. During that time viewers were feted with a staggering death toll and a compendium of medieval torture methods that would make even Genghis Khan wince. No show since has come close to rivaling <em>GOT</em>’s torture porn vibes—honorable mention to<em> The Walking Dead</em>—which saw characters meet their makers in just about every conceivable way the fetid mind could conjure. (Remember Tywin Lannister’s crossbow end on the toilet? The King’s Landing version of passing in your slumber.)<br></p><p>But nature is healing, even in Westeros, and fans can be forgiven for forgetting the heat index of dragon’s breath. This summer’s return of <em>House of the Dragon</em> jolted viewers back into the butcher shop. Just how violent is the second season of the George R.R. Martin prequel series? Its premiere episode, “A Son for a Son,” featured a mother forced to play Sophie’s Choice over which of her infants would die, followed by the off-screen beheading of the tot. Visceral sound effects have always been a <em>GOT</em> superpower, and there was no avoiding the excruciating horror of the child’s fate, even if viewers didn’t actually see it. (It was bad, though apparently not bad enough for <em>Vulture</em> to declare that it “should have been nastier”.)</p><p>So what’s in store for the rest of the season, which culminates in early August? If past is prologue, grab a pillow to shove your wrenched face in, lest you catch a glimpse of the carnage, which promises to be as creative as it is excruciating. Of course, not all deaths are created equal. In our own twisted game of “Would You Rather?”, we ranked the <em>Game of Thrones</em> franchise’s worst ways to die, including <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s recent kill list. Even for the fabled Targaryens, the night is long and full of terrors.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="76399dded6efdb496b6b1217de7e226f" data-recommend-id="image://76399dded6efdb496b6b1217de7e226f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cersei Lannister in a scene from Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cersei Lannister in a scene from Game of Thrones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76399dded6efdb496b6b1217de7e226f" data-recommend-id="image://76399dded6efdb496b6b1217de7e226f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cersei Lannister in a scene from Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>GOT </em>color palette rarely deviated from mud browns and burlap taupes, save for the occasional visit from a Dornish royal and the regular spilling of blood. Which is why Wildfire proved so visually stunning. If you thought dragons were ridiculous, how about a barrel of highly explosive primordial plutonium, capable of leveling all of Flea Bottom? Cersei could have easily ordered the murder of the High Sparrow, but she required something far more baroque—a statement, if you will—to uproot the extremism that had taken hold in King’s Landing, something that would send a clear message across the kingdom: merciless kings are one thing, but charismatic cult leaders are quite another. In terms of sheer scale, there was no turning away from the spectacle of the Sept engulfed in a radioactive glow, taking with it Margaery, Loras, the High Sparrow, and countless bystanders. As far as denouements go, we can only assume it would have been (blessedly) fast for those trapped inside, though pity those on the outskirts of the blast site, forced to deal with the charry aftermath. The sheer scale of the massacre stood in stark relief to the low-key reaction of sweet, guileless Tommen who, numbed by the sight, simply jumped from a window of the Red Keep.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a6ac66253f0254e26ce00e220989e28b" data-recommend-id="image://a6ac66253f0254e26ce00e220989e28b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="King Viserys in a scene from House of the Dragon.

Apparently maesters can milk a puppy, but can’t clean a wound with soap. Go figure. In short order, an infected cut on his finger spreads like leprosy, rotting his mind and flesh. By the end of his life, he is hideous—half his face decayed, shielded by a gold mask; the other half cadaver-like, pockmarked with open sores and mangled teeth. His diseased body wasn’t just hard on the eyes, though there’s nothing quite like the humiliation of a king whose mere visage disgusts his subjects; but you could practically <em>smell</em> him through the screen as he lost control of his faculties, a cringey reminder that sometimes even a “natural death” is no relief at all.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="340a3854ea2a043d8a7c4b7103b11102" data-recommend-id="image://340a3854ea2a043d8a7c4b7103b11102" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1277" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cersei with chained-up Sand Snakes in a scene from Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cersei with chained-up Sand Snakes in a scene from Game of Thrones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="340a3854ea2a043d8a7c4b7103b11102" data-recommend-id="image://340a3854ea2a043d8a7c4b7103b11102" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1277" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cersei with chained-up Sand Snakes in a scene from Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Sand Sisters were hardly fan favorites, and killing them off ended one of the series’ more frustrating subplots. Bonus points if you can recall the names of the other sisters, let alone how they met their ends. The exception: Tyene’s death, which made for an especially haunting bookend, the ultimate revenge fantasy. Recall that Cersei’s daughter Myrcella was killed by a lethal kiss from Ellaria Sand, retaliation for the grisly death of her lover Oberyn Martell by Cersei’s henchman Gregor Clegane. We knew it wouldn’t end well for the Sands, that Cersei always gets the last laugh. Sure enough, Mama Sand and her daughter are captured by Euron Greyjoy and gifted to their archenemy, who chains them to opposite walls of a cell. While Ellaria is forced to watch, Cersei delivers the same poison-laced kiss to Tyene that killed Myrcella. Viewers were left to wonder how long Ellaria was left to molder down there, with nowhere to look but straight ahead, at the decaying body of her daughter.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3682323abbb98c842b21a9ff025c0592" data-recommend-id="image://3682323abbb98c842b21a9ff025c0592" data-format="jpg" data-width="2382" data-height="1188" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Viserys meets his excruciating demise in Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Viserys meets his excruciating demise in Game of Thrones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3682323abbb98c842b21a9ff025c0592" data-recommend-id="image://3682323abbb98c842b21a9ff025c0592" data-format="jpg" data-width="2382" data-height="1188" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Viserys meets his excruciating demise in Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>An absolute shit brother, Viserys (a descendant of King Viserys I) pimped out his sister Daenerys to the Dothraki in his quest to reclaim his birthright.

Criston is cast as a sympathetic naif, all googly-eyed for Princess Rhaenyra after they spend a night together. He thinks he’s in love, but is rebuffed—Rhaenyra will wed a closeted Laenor to fulfill her royal duty, though she wouldn’t mind keeping Criston for booty calls. He’s crushed. Who can blame viewers for rooting for him, the strapping underdog with the broken heart? But when Laenor’s lover Joffrey makes some ill-advised remarks to Criston about their shared indiscretions with the bride and groom, Criston snaps, battering Joffrey with unrelenting blows until he is dead. It’s a ghastly turn, entirely unexpected, stark evidence that it’s always the quiet ones that you need to watch out for.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="10ed97f9fd20ed0174be7c1db4b92f7a" data-recommend-id="image://10ed97f9fd20ed0174be7c1db4b92f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1277" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arya holds a knife in her hand and looks resolved to stab someone with it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arya holds a knife in her hand and looks resolved to stab someone with it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10ed97f9fd20ed0174be7c1db4b92f7a" data-recommend-id="image://10ed97f9fd20ed0174be7c1db4b92f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1277" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arya holds a knife in her hand and looks resolved to stab someone with it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There was no doubt Meryn Trant was a dead man walking once Arya Stark added him to her kill list—he’d murdered her beloved mentor Syrio Forel, after all. <em>GOT</em> usually reserved its most excruciating exits for its most heinous villains, and Trant, a particularly sadistic member of the King’s Guard, was no exception. Arya exploits his predilection for abusing young girls by disguising herself as one of his victims before revealing herself and stabbing him in the eyes. It’s a particularly horrific scene from the get-go, as Meryn whips the frightened girl and viewers brace themselves for lord-knows-what to come. (<em>GOT</em> took much flack for its depictions of child abuse and rape.) Once Arya reveals herself to him, there’s a sudden spasm of violence as she plunges daggers into his eyes, rendering him blind while she proceeds to carve him up. Trant deserved it, no question, which is partly why it’s so rarely mentioned among the series’ more violent scenes. But it’s also one of those “<em>did I just see that?</em>” moments best forgotten.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6ad9f170c6800fb203c642e992701473" data-recommend-id="image://6ad9f170c6800fb203c642e992701473" data-format="jpg" data-width="2195" data-height="1234" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joffrey is seen with his crossbow in Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joffrey is seen with his crossbow in Game of Thrones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ad9f170c6800fb203c642e992701473" data-recommend-id="image://6ad9f170c6800fb203c642e992701473" data-format="jpg" data-width="2195" data-height="1234" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joffrey is seen with his crossbow in Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We knew Joffrey was truly sick in the head, but Ros’ murder by the young king is arresting for its sheer brutality. We only catch a glimpse of the poor woman, strung up and limp, her body riddled with arrows, but it’s clear this is torture quite unlike any other. Joffrey takes a sadistic pleasure in her execution by crossbow, his new toy. <em>GOT</em> is, among other things, a paean to the depravity of men, but Ros’ murder highlights the terrifying extent of our cruelty. That horror is amplified by the fact that Ros is a relatively innocent character, playing a lethal game she never had a chance of winning. As Cersei once told Lord Baelish, the man who turned Ros over to Joffrey, “power is power.” Those without any are ultimately vulnerable playthings in the brutal world of Westeros.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8c7627e557321ed7309f7a867ca3aa5e" data-recommend-id="image://8c7627e557321ed7309f7a867ca3aa5e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A locking mechanism on the vault where Daenarys traps her victims." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A locking mechanism on the vault where Daenarys traps her victims." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8c7627e557321ed7309f7a867ca3aa5e" data-recommend-id="image://8c7627e557321ed7309f7a867ca3aa5e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A locking mechanism on the vault where Daenarys traps her victims." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are quite a few executions in <em>GOT</em> that tease viewers with only a hint of what’s to come rather than depicting what actually does. It’s a sinister gambit, inviting audiences to conjure horrific outcomes of their own. (Remember Season 3’s Sorcerer in the crate?) When Daenerys returns to Qarth after successfully retrieving her stolen dragons, she confronts Xaro Xhoan Daxos, the wealthy merchant who betrayed her in his bid to become the King of Qarth. Discovering that Daxos’s wealth is a facade and his vault is empty, Daenerys exacts her revenge by sealing him and her handmaiden Doreah, who also betrayed her, inside the vault. It’s a ruthless move that (presumably) subjects the pair to a slow, agonizing death, entombed in darkness. The takeaway: cross the Queen of the Andals at your own peril.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fea80d45d156b24226a4d9076e1ea2dd" data-recommend-id="image://fea80d45d156b24226a4d9076e1ea2dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="2716" data-height="1529" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fea80d45d156b24226a4d9076e1ea2dd" data-recommend-id="image://fea80d45d156b24226a4d9076e1ea2dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="2716" data-height="1529" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Who wasn’t rooting for Oberyn Martell, Tyrion’s charismatic proxy in his trial by combat, to whomp Gregor Clegane, the hulking ogre known as The Mountain? Things look promising for the Red Viper until The Mountain gets the better of him. In one of the series’ most graphic murders, Clegane grabs Martell’s head with his bare hands and squeezes so hard his skull actually bursts. The explicit violence—there are close-up shots and sounds of bones cracking—makes the scene particularly difficult to watch. Yet the gruesome spectacle is emblematic of not just the unpredictable and unsparing violence that marked the series, but the moral ambiguity that surrounds these deaths. From the very outset of the show, when Eddard Stark is unjustly executed, we are forced to wrestle with the senseless loss of good people, often at the hands of awful people. That helps explain the very appeal of Oberyn Martell—he’s a lover, not a fighter, with a strong sense of justice and love. Losing him is a searing reminder that Westeros is no place for the sentimental.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="efbe4e48124bb80c33f9ca23bbca2284" data-recommend-id="image://efbe4e48124bb80c33f9ca23bbca2284" data-format="jpg" data-width="2325" data-height="1309" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="efbe4e48124bb80c33f9ca23bbca2284" data-recommend-id="image://efbe4e48124bb80c33f9ca23bbca2284" data-format="jpg" data-width="2325" data-height="1309" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“I’d hate to die like your son,” Lady Olenna Tyrell tells Jaime Lannister, in her stunning Season 7 confession. “Clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood-red, skin purple.” The poison effectively choked Joffrey of oxygen, triggering violent convulsions as he unsuccessfully gasped for air. So desperate were his attempts to breathe that the blood vessels in his eyes and nose burst. Worse yet was the evident panic. Surrounded by guests at his own wedding, Joffrey would die alone, unable to even summon help. The terrified, lifeless head of the poisoned boy king is one of the show’s most enduring images.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f8af587464b022a1dd2549fa444f0bf4" data-recommend-id="image://f8af587464b022a1dd2549fa444f0bf4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1278" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cersei pours wine into the mouth of Unella in Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cersei pours wine into the mouth of Unella in Game of Thrones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f8af587464b022a1dd2549fa444f0bf4" data-recommend-id="image://f8af587464b022a1dd2549fa444f0bf4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1278" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cersei pours wine into the mouth of Unella in Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After enduring humiliation and torture at the hands of the Faith Militant, Cersei exacts her revenge on Unella, the septa who was particularly cruel to her. Chained to a table, Unella is waterboarded with wine as Cersei plies her with the same rebukes directed against her: <em>Confess! Confess!</em> Unella knows she’s doomed, and tells Cersei, “I am ready to meet the gods.” Of course, Cersei has other plans. She tells Unella she’s not going to die for a while, then summons The Mountain to the room. “This is your god now,” she tells Unella, visibly terrified. Cersei leaves the pair as Unella’s squeals of pain echo. Once again, the hint of the savagery to come is arguably more traumatic than even knowing what The Mountain will do to her.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2ab38326f1133edfbf1e3f4eef917e50" data-recommend-id="image://2ab38326f1133edfbf1e3f4eef917e50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1664" data-height="932" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A moment from the Red Wedding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A moment from the Red Wedding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ab38326f1133edfbf1e3f4eef917e50" data-recommend-id="image://2ab38326f1133edfbf1e3f4eef917e50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1664" data-height="932" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A moment from the Red Wedding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Arguably <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ most defining moment, the Red Wedding proved so shocking, so unimaginably brutal, that it instantly became a pop culture meme, shorthand for a seemingly upbeat event that takes a startling, sinister turn. (“It’s like the Red Wedding,” former President Obama joked at the 2016 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, as he noted how many Republicans were in attendance.) What begins as a celebratory feast ends in a massacre as Robb Stark, his mother Catelyn Stark, and his pregnant wife Talisa, are slain by their supposed allies, the Freys. The violence is graphic and thoroughly unexpected—after all, the Starks are the nucleus of the show, its heroes. It is a barbaric display, exceptional even for cable television, and ranks up there with “Who Shot J.R.?” as one of tv’s most eye-popping plot twists.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e60daf82821fc879401ab57bc3927ae3" data-recommend-id="image://e60daf82821fc879401ab57bc3927ae3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1277" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Innocent Shireen is seen in a moment from Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Innocent Shireen is seen in a moment from Game of Thrones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e60daf82821fc879401ab57bc3927ae3" data-recommend-id="image://e60daf82821fc879401ab57bc3927ae3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1277" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Innocent Shireen is seen in a moment from Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most enduring criticisms of <em>GOT </em>is its depictions of violence against children. No scene exemplifies that more than the disturbing death of young Shireen, the only child of Stannis Baratheon. She is the metaphorical sacrificial lamb, innocent, blameless, but nonetheless sacrificed to the so-called Lord of Light by her father to ensure his victory in the War of the Five Kings. It’s a wrenching decision. We’ve come to delight in the precocious little girl who overcame greyscale with dignity and grit. It’s virtually unwatchable: Shireen is tied to a pyre and burned alive while her parents and soldiers look on. Her screams are heart-rending, and the scene is made even more tragic by her parents’ reactions. Stannis remains stoic but is clearly tormented; Selyse initially supports the sacrifice, but breaks down in horror and regret as the reality of their actions sets in. It’s a brutal and unforgiving killing, senseless, and ultimately futile.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a86e4e9da8283a0ecf6a8ae9c33bcf98" data-recommend-id="image://a86e4e9da8283a0ecf6a8ae9c33bcf98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Viserys and a pregnant Aemma are seen in happier times." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Viserys and a pregnant Aemma are seen in happier times." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a86e4e9da8283a0ecf6a8ae9c33bcf98" data-recommend-id="image://a86e4e9da8283a0ecf6a8ae9c33bcf98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Viserys and a pregnant Aemma are seen in happier times." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Of all the deaths in the <em>Game of Thrones</em> pantheon—the beheadings, stabbings, poisonings, drownings, suffocations, flayings, suicides, burnings, beatings, explosions, and zombie attacks—very little beats the intensely traumatic, harrowing childbirth of Aemma Arryn, wife of King Viserys, in the series premiere of <em>HoD</em>. It is the most realistic of any <em>Game of Thrones</em> death, an unforgettable depiction of the brutalities of childbirth. Aemma’s labor becomes complicated, and it quickly becomes evident that both her life and that of the unborn child are in grave danger. King Viserys, desperate for a male heir to secure the Targaryen succession, faces an excruciating decision when he is informed that the only way to potentially save the baby is through a risky and primitive cesarean section, which would almost certainly result in Aemma’s death. Torn between his love for his wife and his duty as king, Viserys decides to proceed with the procedure. Needless to say, you won’t soon shake the grim sights and sounds of it all.<br></p><p>Depicted with graphic detail and emotional intensity, Aemma is forcibly held down as the maester makes the incision without anesthesia. She dies in agony, begging for her life, grimly aware of the fate that’s been chosen for her. That the baby doesn’t survive is almost beside the point (though it sets in motion the internecine war within House Targaryen). Both <em>GoT</em> and <em>HoD</em> are, if nothing else, odes to the horrors humans inflict on one another. But very little compares to the brutalities inherent in simply living. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="704636406a4ce15eab71df21b6b1c0bc" data-recommend-id="image://704636406a4ce15eab71df21b6b1c0bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1917" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ramsay Bolton in Game of Thrones" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ramsay Bolton in Game of Thrones" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="704636406a4ce15eab71df21b6b1c0bc" data-recommend-id="image://704636406a4ce15eab71df21b6b1c0bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1917" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ramsay Bolton in Game of Thrones" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Perhaps it’s the poetic justice of knowing <em>GOT</em>’s resident sadist is about to get his due; that the hounds he starved for seven days would now be sicced on him. It’s the comeuppance nobody would begrudge, yet it is sickeningly brutal, truly beyond the pale. The hungry dogs lick Ramsay’s bloody face, whetting their appetites for what’s to come. There’s no need to see what comes next. Once again, the sounds of the feeding frenzy and a screaming Ramsay lend the scene a horrific soundscape. Just how violent is it? So violent that Sansa, brutalized unremittingly and mercilessly by the man before her, can’t help but smile. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It comes with a base station that connects to two platforms at once: Xbox and PlayStation or Xbox and PC. When you power on your console, the base station comes to life and registers which platform you're using. The base station can be used to tinker with audio settings, and PC users can also take advantage of SteelSeries' Sonar Software to further customize their experience.</p><p>Fully compatible with Microsoft Spatial Sound for Xbox Series X|S and Tempest 3D Audio for PS5, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro also has active noise cancellation to tune out any ambient sounds. If you're looking to communicate, there's also a retractable noise-canceling microphone attached to the frame, which is enhanced by Sonar Software's powerful AI algorithms. The other big draw here is the battery life of this headset, as SteelSeries uses what it calls the Infinity Power System to hot-swap batteries into the Nova Pro. Charge one, use the other, and never worry about running out of juice.</p><p>The build quality is incredible. The Nova Pro both looks and feels like a high-end headset with soft, leatherette earcups and an adjustable, steel-reinforced headband. If you find a lot of gaming headsets to be uncomfortable after an hour or so of use, the Nova Pro should be of interest to you. It remains comfortable to wear throughout lengthy gaming sessions, and its sleek look and Bluetooth compatibility allow it to double as a standard pair of all-day headphones for your work day. You can even mix two audio connections at the same time, allowing you to chat with friends, listen to music, or catch a podcast while you play your games.</p><p>Even with the $75 discount, the Nova Pro is still one of the priciest headsets on the market. Though it's a solid investment that can easily last across the current generation of gaming (and probably beyond), there are a few other affordable headsets on special right now that are worth considering. The <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B0C1P7XV7V?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 4 for PlayStation, PC, and Switch is available for $90</a></strong> (was $120). The Nova 4 offers wireless connectivity via a 2.4GHz dongle and wired support via a detachable 3.5mm cable.</p><p>For something that hits the sweet spot for both quality and affordability, the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B0B15QM5LL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7</a></strong> is terrific and will cost you $138 (was $180).

<p>The Esports World Cup is in full flow in Riyadh, but several weeks remain in the super-sized competitive showcase. Today, two more champions were crowned and more than $4 million in prize money was issued. It was a huge day for mobile gaming, with Free Fire and Mobile Legends taking centre stage in Saudi Arabia.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-history">Making History</h2>



<p>Free Fire – which once held the record for the most-watched esports tournament in history – enjoyed a prolific spot at the Esports World Cup. With a $1 million prize pool, this mobile battle royale title played host to 18 top-tier teams, but by the time the dust had settled, Team Falcons stood victorious. It’s another win in the back for the Saudi-backed team, putting the organisation increasingly closer to the Club Championship’s grand prize.</p>



<p>Team Falcons netted a $300,000 prize and 1,000 Club Points, as well as qualification to the Free Fire World Series Global Finals that’ll take place in November.</p>



<p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang enjoyed a more prestigious spot at the Esports World Cup. This mobile-based MOBA had a hefty prize pool lined up worth a whopping $3,050,000 – one of the largest pots at the EWC. Following a stellar group stage and a breeze through the knockout round, Selangor Red Giants decimated Fire Flux, NIP Flash, and finally, Falcons AP.Bren. </p>



<p>The squad walked away with a cool $1 million in prize money and 1,000 Club Points.</p>



<p>That now means we’ve got our champions in ML:BB, Free Fire, Warzone, and League of Legends – there are <strong>plenty </strong>of games yet to unfold.</p>

The developer has had “significant” instability issues that none of the fixes so far have reversed, <a href="https://alderongames.com/intel-crashes">wrote Alderon founder Matthew Cassells</a> in a blog post last week.</p><p>Cassells wrote that Alderon has recorded “thousands of crashes” on gamers’ CPUs using its crash reporting tools and says the processors can also corrupt SSDs and memory. He added that in his team’s experience, 100 percent of the affected CPUs “deteriorate over time, eventually failing.” On the contrary, Unreal Engine decompression tool maker RAD Game Tools, which Cassells cites in the blog, <a href="https://www.radgametools.com/oodleintel.htm">says that</a> “only a small fraction” of the processors are affected.</p><p>Suggestions that Intel’s i9-13900K and i9-14900K CPUs are corrupting storage and memory and causing servers using them to crash is a new turn in this saga, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125036/intel-game-crash-13900k-14900k-fortnite-unreal-engine-investigation">started in April with the company investigating game crashes</a> on home computers using the chips. Motherboards with improper overclocking settings <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/intel-reportedly-blames-motherboard-makers-for-core-i9-cpu-crashes/">were cited by Intel as an apparent culprit</a> at one time, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178751/intel-raptor-lake-crash-fix-etvb-not-yet">as Level1Techs points</a> out in the above video, that doesn’t account for crashes seen on server hardware, which should be set more conservatively.</p><p>Earlier in the week, a <em>Warframe</em> developer <a href="https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1405008-instability-on-recent-intel-processors/">wrote on the game’s forums</a> that “almost all” of the crashes it recorded came from driver failures in 13th- and 14th-Gen Intel processors. He did note that failures seen on a staff member’s gaming rig stopped after he installed a recent <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/June-2024-Guidance-regarding-Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-K-KF/m-p/1607807">BIOS update</a>, even though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178751/intel-raptor-lake-crash-fix-etvb-not-yet">Intel said in June</a> that the problem it addresses isn’t the root cause of instability.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>They say good things come to those who wait, and if you've been keeping an eye out for a Final Fantasy VII Rebirth discount, you're in luck. Only a few months old, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-rebirth---playstation-5%2F20006332.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fprime-day-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-discount%2F1100-6524897%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now on sale</a> for $55 at GameStop ahead of Amazon <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a>. Normally $70, the sequel to Final Fantasy VII Remake continues the bold retelling of the beloved PS1 RPG with modernized touches and expanded content. GameStop listings default to preowned copies (which are $50), so click the "New" button if you want the $55 brand-new deal</p><p>"It's a superbly designed gameplay experience that instills a sense of freedom while also making exploration rewarding in a meaningful way," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review</a>. "Refined gameplay that makes character synergy a focal point breathes new life into the slick and satisfying combat, and all the while it reinforces the underlying themes of the story. As a game that has the unenviable task of living up to one of the strongest legacies in the medium, it is a worthy second chapter."</p><h2>More Amazon Prime Day Game Deals</h2><p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth isn't the only PS5 Final Fantasy game discounted right now. You can also check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPMTJJ6D?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy XVI</a> at its lowest price yet of $30. This entry in the mainline Final Fantasy series is a return to the swords and sorcery roots of the franchise. It's a dark fantasy story with gorgeous visuals and over-the-top boss fights, and at this price, you'll have some cash left over to grab its two digital DLC expansions.</p><p>Looking for more than just Final Fantasy?

            <p>A number of unannounced Disney projects have leaked online after 1.1TB of internal documents – "every message and file possible", according to the hackers – were reportedly compromised.</p>
<p>Whilst Disney has yet to comment formally on the alleged hack, details from various internal files – including upcoming collaborations with Epic Games' Fortnite, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/details-of-an-unannounced-aliens-fireteam-elite-sequel-have-popped-up-online">Aliens: Fireteam Elite sequel we reported on previously today</a> – have started to pop up on social media.</p>

<p>It's thought the hacking group was able to breach and download the data via Disney's Slack channels, which is also how a British teen was able to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90-gta-6-videos-and-screenshots-have-allegedly-leaked-online">access and then leak GTA 6 information ahead of Rockstar's formal announcement</a>.</p>

A little ways into the story, you are given a choice whether to continue on through the original storyline or head down an entirely different path dubbed Canon of Vengeance. Though it varies by player, Vengeance adds roughly 75 hours of new content to the SMT V experience. And if you've never played it before, you're essentially getting two games in one package.</p><p>Shin Megami Tensei V was originally a Nintendo Switch exclusive, but Vengeance brought the turn-based RPG to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.

"It's easier to connect to the narrative--having the other human characters in your party and engaging in small talk with them go a long way to making the events happening around them feel more impactful--and the various adjustments to navigation, combat, and demon-herding let you focus more on savoring the dark atmosphere and the strategies of battle. If you didn't enter the tunnel to the underworld the first time around, this is the perfect opportunity to do so--and if you're a veteran of the war for the throne, there's plenty here to bring you back."</p><p>Vengeance isn't the only role-playing game deal that's worth checking out ahead of Prime Day 2024:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Y74H4PB?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon Shining Pearl (Switch)</a> -- $30 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdragon-quest-monsters-the-dark-prince---nintendo-switch%2F402991.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fshin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6524937%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince (Switch)</a> -- $35 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8WC4ZX7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Ocean: The Second Story R (Switch, Amazon)</a> -- $30 (<del>$50)</del></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fstar-ocean-the-second-story-r---nintendo-switch%2F396515.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fshin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6524937%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Ocean: The Second Story R (Switch/PS5/PS4, GameStop)</a> -- $30 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-rebirth---playstation-5%2F404626.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fshin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6524937%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (PS5)</a> -- $55 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPMTJJ6D?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy 16 (PS5)</a> -- $30 ($<strike>50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJ3ZGM7Y?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Unicorn Overlord (Switch/PS5/Xbox)</a> -- $35 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Foctopath-traveler-2---nintendo-switch%2F351952.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fshin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6524937%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Octopath Traveler 2 (Switch)</a> -- $30 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul>

At <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8WC4ZX7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>, the deal is only available for the Nintendo Switch version at the moment.

The effect works remarkably well, creating a retro-inspired game with crisp 4K visuals. This version of the game features both English and Japanese voice acting, a newly arranged soundtrack, and several quality-of-life changes. Overall, it's a nice balance of nostalgic fun mixed with contemporary ideas, making it ideal for series veterans and newcomers.</p><p>"Star Ocean: The Second Story R is a remake that manages to not only have the retro feel of its older PS1 and PSP incarnations, but also make it feel fresh with new battle mechanics, as well as audio and visuals updates. It may not be the big break that’ll finally make the Star Ocean franchise explode in popularity, but it’s a fine Japanese RPG on its own terms," George Yang wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-ocean-the-second-story-r-review-back-to-the-future/1900-6418147/" data-ref-id="1900-6418147">Star Ocean: The Second Story R review</a>.

            <p>Details of an unannounced Aliens Fireteam Elite sequel have seemingly appeared online.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AliensFireteamElite/comments/1e2r9kj/aliens_fireteam_elite_2_leaked/">unsubstantiated report</a> on Reddit – so please take all this with the usual bucket of salt for now – the third-person co-op shooter, codenamed Project Macondo, "is a new chapter in the Aliens: Fireteam Elite" and is expected to launch Q3 2025.</p>
<figure>

<p>Aimed at "18+ core gamers", the sequel will "improve upon the mechanics, atmosphere, and excitement" of the original".</p>
<p>Interesting, unlike its predecessor, it's reported that Project Macondo "will feature fixed preset character archetypes and non-customisable characters", with each of the five archetypes – The Swift, The Deadly, The Silent, The Commander, and The Ranger – boasting their own signature weapons and special abilities.</p>
<p>"Fight through an epic new story campaign with a squad of two AI companions or live players," the slide – purportedly taken from a 2021 presentation – says.</p>
<p>"Play as members of Dagger Company, a battalion of spec-op Xenomorph hunters, each with unique abilities and weapons. Engage in a diverse array of gameplay scenarios, including NPC interactions, alternate paths, navigational challenges, and clue finding."</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AliensFireteamElite/comments/1e2r9kj/aliens_fireteam_elite_2_leaked/">Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2 Leaked</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/firemonkey11/">u/firemonkey11</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AliensFireteamElite/">AliensFireteamElite</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Players will also find themselves having to complete with "evolved enemy intelligence" as well as an all-new mode, Annihilation, which is described as "a new spin" on Horde mode.</p>
<p>Interesting, the deck suggests "no additional microtransactions are currently planned", nor "gatcha" or loot boxes. Bizarrely, although the game has the word "fireteam" baked into the very title, the sequel will reportedly not support native in-game voice or text chat – players will have to use the first party chat features on PS or Xbox consoles if they want to talk to their teammates.</p>
<p>"Aliens: Fireteam Elite is exactly what it says on the tin. Stuffed with guns, gadgets, and plentiful alien goo, it's a frenetic cooperative firefight against some of sci-fi's most iconic monsters in an all-new tale that takes us beyond the original trilogy," I wrote when I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aliens-fireteam-elite-review-throwaway-thrills">reviewed Aliens: Fireteam Elite</a> back in 2021.</p>
<p>"No, it's not the most sophisticated shooter, and no, its truncated runtime is unlikely to occupy you for more than a couple of nights, but it's an unashamedly good romp that'll hopefully satisfy your Ripley power fantasies, too."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/zenless-zone-zero-the-perfect-gacha-game-for-those-who-dont-like-gachas/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
				<main>

					

					<!--<div class="ads-container banner-ad floated p-0">
						<div data-pg-ad-spot='div-gpt-ad-wccftechcom38564' style="min-height: 280px;"></div>
					</div>-->
					
										
					<p>As someone adamant about avoiding playing Gacha games and never really enjoyed the story of Genshin Impact or Honkai: Star Rail, I was reluctant to try <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-reaches-50-million-global-downloads-hoyoverses-latest-success/">Zenless Zone Zero</a>. However, Zenless Zone Zero is everything I wanted from a Gacha game.</p>
<p>The action immediately gets going, and you are dropped into a hi-fi cyberpunk-style world full of chaos, explosions, and colorful delights. From the get-go, it reminded me of a Suicide Squad-type situation, especially as The Cunning Hares were trying to escape the watchful gaze of law enforcement after being mistaken as the bad guys.</p>
<p>Zenless Zone Zero is highly theatrical from the get-go, and I loved that aspect of the game. Starting the game with a high-speed chase in a cutscene felt like the right move, and it immediately pulled me in. The game runs smooth as butter and doesn't feel buggy. It was incredibly polished and well put together for a game so fresh on release.</p>
<p>Once through the initial cutscene, you get to play Anby Demara, who is stoic and somewhat robotic in their way of speaking. Immediately, you are thrown into the deep end and tasked with hacking and slashing your way to victory with the help of Billy Kid.</p>
<p>The dynamics between Anby and Billy are great, as she immediately doesn't trust him despite him being a comrade. When they are in battle, they have a great power dynamic as they can swap between ranged battle and up-close, fast-paced melee damage.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ZenlessZoneZero_Fight-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>My only issue with Zenless Zone Zero is its inaccessibility to disabled gamers. As someone with light sensitivity issues, especially with flashing lights, this game is incredibly headache-inducing. There are strobe lights everywhere, and the battle is terribly flashy. While it fits the game's environment and the aesthetic that <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main">miHoYo</a> was trying to achieve, it can lead to dangerous complications and health issues.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are no toggleable settings, such as turning off screen shake or motion blur, for which there is much in this game. It was disappointing to see the lack of settings for a game released in an era where developers create more accessible games.</p>
<p>While there is a warning at the beginning about turning the game off if you feel unwell, it doesn't entirely cover the amount of flashing imagery and how it's ingrained into every part of the game. As a result, I had to play the game in very short doses of approximately ten to fifteen minutes at a push. I turned my brightness down and tried to squint through the flashing to try and eliminate any headaches that would come on, but it didn't quite work.</p>
<p>Although the graphics were flashy, I really liked this game's art style. Compared to the other creations by miHoYo, I feel like Zenless Zone Zero stands out from the crowd. Additionally, the game ran very smoothly. The only little snag was when the game first booted up; there would be a mild frame drop as it loaded in shaders. Aside from that, it was a smooth experience with no big frame rate drops or lag. I tried it on my mobile phone and gaming laptop, and they both worked exceptionally well. I was pleasantly surprised about how well it ran on mobile, as most games like these struggle slightly. However, a lot of love and effort went into making sure this game was more mobile-friendly.</p>
<p>Despite this, I was determined to progress further through the game. Since pressing play, I was immediately intrigued by the Borderlands-esque game style and the constant chaos. While I don't usually play games with futuristic worlds, this was one I was keen to dive into. From the quests I did complete, I found them enjoyable and a lot of fun, especially being able to explore an open world full of exciting people to talk to and side quests to pick up from familiar faces.</p>
<p>There were some really cute characters, too. I immediately looked at Belle and Wise, loved their presence in the game, and found the Bangboos adorable. The characters had plenty of personality, which helped ease me into the world of Gacha.</p>
<p>However, the amount of resources tossed at you before you fully settled into the gameplay is overwhelming. You are introduced to the inter-knot system, Dennies, Gear Coins, and many more. It can be hard to keep track of all of these resources, and how is anyone meant to know what each and everyone does?</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/zenless-zone-zero_machinegun-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I wanted to get into this game more but couldn't due to the strobing lights. However, I unlocked a few new characters, met some friendly (and unfriendly) faces, and completed quests. Whether I'll be able to return to it remains to be seen.</p>
<p>One feature I liked was the ability to skip cutscenes or rewatch them, depending on whether you were action-oriented or preferred to get stuck in the story. I skipped most of the cutscenes, but I liked that it came with a text box afterward to fill you in on what happened during the cutscene. If you were rushing through the game or weren't interested in the theatrics, you could stay caught up on the need-to-know story while skipping the unnecessary parts.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed taking on exploration commissions and navigating pathways using TV screens. It was one of the most unique ways of traversing danger and trying to complete an objective I've seen in a game. It may seem like a relaxing journey of just going in the cardinal directions, but danger awaits around every corner. I saw a shiny box and went for it, only for an enemy to appear on the trail and quickly catch up to me. It was surprisingly intense!</p>
<p>Compared to other Gacha games, Zenless Zone Zero stands out from the crowd. It feels more like a game and less like an environment where you gamble resources to unlock cute characters. I am glad to have experienced any of Zenless Zone Zero.</p>
<p>I'm excited to see how far this live-service game will go in the future. Since it's in the early stages of release, I'm sure they have plenty planned. Already, new characters have been revealed to join the game, and it'll be interesting to see what part they play and whether they'll affect the story as a whole. Since playing it, I check in on the game daily, especially to do my daily scratch card to get rewards from the stall. Even though my eyes are sensitive to the game, I always try to finish at least one quest in the short time I play it. Whether you want to sink plenty of time in during one session or you want short, sharp bursts of playtime, there's a lot of appeal and replayability for the long term.</p>
<p>For those who want to dip their toes into the expansive world of Gacha games but are deterred by the other games currently on the market, Zenless Zone Zero is one I would genuinely recommend, despite only being able to play it in short bursts. Additionally, you'll love every second of this game if you're a fan of wild theatrics and flashy cutscenes.</p>

Discord now tells <em>Kotaku</em> that it has found an account on the gaming chat platform that appears to be associated with Crooks, but that he rarely used it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194341" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top Ten Most Played Games On Steam Deck: March 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="219" data-playlist="194341,194651,196447" data-current="194341"><div><p>The Top Ten Most Played Games On Steam Deck: March 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194341/194341_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194341/194341_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194341/194341_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194341/194341_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19799.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> “We have identified an account that appears to be linked to the suspect; it was rarely utilized and we have found no evidence that it was used to plan this incident or discuss his political views,” a spokesperson for the company wrote in an emailed statement. “Discord strongly condemns violence of any kind, including political violence, and we will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement.” </p><p>Primarily used for gaming communities and to chat while playing online, Discord differs from public social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Unlike those, Discord is a server-based messaging system where users gather in siloed communities that aren’t easily searched or shared outside of an individual servers’ active members, especially if people are using a private server to communicate. </p><p>That was the case with the gunman behind the 2022 mass shooting in Buffalo that left 10 dead.

The Switch-exclusive remake features an adorable chibi art style that gels quite well with the overall vibe of the Pearl/Diamond storyline.</p><p>It earned a 7/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl-review/1900-6417790/" data-ref-id="1900-6417790">Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl review</a>. "Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl keep enough classic elements to feel like a comfy nostalgia trip, while smoothing over enough of the rough edges that they feel relatively contemporary with other recent Pokemon games," critic Steve Watts wrote. "It can't be easy for a storied franchise to pay homage to its legacy while also modernizing in this way, but Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl strike the right balance. It's the classic Pokemon you remember, without most of the little annoyances you've forgotten."</p><p>There are numerous stellar Nintendo Switch deals ahead of Prime Day, which officially runs July 16-17.

		<p>The Apple Vision Pro’s launch in Europe this week has given those of us on this side of the Atlantic the first chance to go hands (well, face) on with Apple’s latest attempt to transform and dominate an emerging tech market. Whether you call it virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality or spatial computing, all of these headsets lean on the same fundamental components and are pulling in roughly the same direction. So, how is Apple Vision Pro now that it’s in UK English? And can it really be another step on a path to a new paradigm of computing?</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Apple Vision Pro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TX9qSaGXFyg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Our experience with Apple Vision Pro comes primarily from a 30-minute demo at an Apple retail store, first customising the headset to our particular specification and then running through a sequence of apps and experiences.</p>


<p>To be utterly reductive, it’s the retail store equivalent of popping the original PSVR on your nan’s head and loading up that shark tank demo. However, where you wouldn’t expect that one tech demo to convince your nan to rush out, buy a new console and headset, and then become an avid gamer, Apple’s more general approach and demo could have broader appeal in the long run.</p>
<p>And one thing’s certain: the first impressions of Apple Vision Pro, as carefully managed and guided as they are, are fantastic.</p>

<p>The demo starts with scanning your face using your own iPhone to get the best fit for your particular noggin, which is then prepared in the back of the store (now notably using the dual strap instead of the knitted solo loop) while you’re given a short rundown of the handful of gestures you’ll need through the 20-30 minute demo, right down to how you should pick it up.</p>
<p>Coming from other VR and AR headsets, the pass-through video for your surroundings is ridiculously good. Sure, there is some warping and distortion around the periphery because of the lenses between your eyes and the screens, but the raw video feed is incredibly high quality, the per-eye pixel density exceptional, and the way that the Vision Pro’s chips blend elements into this is almost flawless. The user interface is all about focussing on elements with your eyes, and then touching thumb to index finger to select, to grab and move, and both hands to zoom, and again, it’s impressive how good the tracking is.</p>

<p>A few key elements are highlighted by Apple, with a tour through various photos and videos that show off the raw quality of rendering them in a floating window before you, the ability to wrap a panorama around you, and to have 3D videos and photos with shifting perspectives – a little skewed, admittedly, with a video featuring a birthday cake that appears more oval than round, but it’s effective, nonetheless.</p>
<p>The effect is absolutely perfected by the other elements of the demo. The virtual immersive environment that you can blend in and out to cover up <em>just</em> the right amount of your surroundings can give a serene escape, while keeping you as grounded in reality as you need. If you want to watch TV, that can either be floated in the real world or in these spaces, and there’s a fantastic way that flashes of light can illuminate the virtual space, and be reflected in the water of the lake at Mount Hood.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-451277">There’s some fantastic effects with virtual displays casting light and reflections in Immersive Environments (Photograph by Apple)</p>
<p>While enhancing general computing is a key part of their pitch, Apple realise that entertainment will be pretty important here. A demo reel of 180° captured video runs through all manner of sports highlights, musical performances, parkour and close ups with animals in the wild. It’s the 3D TV fad taken to the next level, but with dramatically positioned angles for basketball and football, there’s a sense of presence that is exceptional for how just how unspectacular it actually feels to watch like this.</p>
<p>Arguably, they’re yet to deliver on any of that promised content, and we’re in that uncomfortable chicken and egg situation that various VR platforms have ended up in. Apple needs to get their special camera rigs placed in two or three places at every MLS stadium, every NBA court, and bring this to viewers live.</p>
<p>But as much as Apple is targeting Spatial Computing, and as high end as their approach is, it’s come at the expense of also catering to the one real niche that general consumers have latched onto: gaming. There’s a wealth of flatscreen games that you can play using their iPad versions, and a handful of games that have been adapted to play in augmented reality – What the Golf? is one such example, beaming the quirky puzzles onto your environment. However, you need to either be using a traditional gamepad or leaning purely on eyes and pinched interactions, which is inherently limiting.</p>
<p>The popular Steve Jobs adage for the iPhone was that if you saw a stylus then they’d failed, but that was an inherently limiting stance for the iPad that it took years before the Apple Pencil rectified it, turning it into an exceptional platform for artists in one fell swoop. The simple fact is that Apple Vision Pro needs to have controllers in order to be a viable VR gaming platform, and cannot simply rely on hand and eye tracking to get the job done. Having controllers, whether made by Apple or their usual close partners, won’t detract from the hand tracking that enables everything else the system does more generally and how it puts augmented reality first, but will enable and improve much broader gaming experiences that can match what’s on Quest, SteamVR and the likes.</p>

<p>Our one minimal gaming demo came with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/05/how-infinite-inside-blends-augmented-and-virtual-reality-on-quest-vision-pro-and-beyond/">Infinite Inside</a> a few weeks ago, a title that blends AR and VR into one and has minimalist direct interactions and constrained motion. Anything that needs full locomotion, though, or more complex interactions will benefit greatly from analogue sticks and button presses, not to mention greatly reduce the burden on motion tracking and hand analysis by having more precise IR tracking of the controller itself.</p>
<p>It’s often the way that Apple launches a new product and then figures out what the true purpose and appeal of it is – the Apple Watch for fitness, iPhone as a hub for apps, etc. etc. – and Apple will need to hone in on what the Vision is really for and best at. The second problem, in a period where Apple hardware has become more and more expensive, is bringing the price down far enough to make that compelling, and the third is juggling Vision Pro, the new push for Apple Intelligence in every platform, and maintaining all their other products. We don’t know what Apple’s metric for success will be here, but this will be a niche category for the foreseeable future. Hopefully they don’t lose interest, because as we often see, Apple often helps to rise the tide for their rival ships as well.</p>
