<p>Silent Hill 2 finally has a release date for when it’s coming to Xbox Series X|S, and it comes from an early update on the Microsoft Store.</p>



<p>Though the listing has seemingly been removed, it’s been revealed—h/t <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/silent-hill-2-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">True Achievements</a> for finding it first—that Silent Hill 2 will launch on Xbox on Friday, November 21, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who’ve been following, an Xbox launch has <a href="http://long been rumor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long been rumored</a> and expected. Talk even picked up more steam when the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/">officially rated for Xbox</a> by the ESRB on October 31, meaning that a launch wasn’t going to be far off. </p>



<p>Looking at the store listing, it says the game is optimized for both the Xbox Series X and Series S. It will also release for the console and PC via the Microsoft Store. However, there’s no official mention of it being a play anywhere title.</p>

<p>Silent Hill 2 first launched on PlayStation 5 (PS5) and PC via Steam on October 8, 2024. The deal for the game to be console exclusive on the PS5 was for a year, which expired early last month. As of writing, the game has a “generally favorable” rating of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">86 on Metacritic</a> from 105 reviews while the user score is even higher at 9.1 from 3,998 user ratings.</p>



<p>In addition to Xbox, there have also been rumors that it will be released on the Nintendo Switch 2. Whether it happens on the same date as Xbox remains to be seen, but it’s clear that those without a PC or PS5 will be getting to play the remake from Bloober Team in the very near future.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting, though, that neither Konami nor Bloober Team have officially announced anything yet.</p>



<p>Now that we seemingly have a release date, will you pick up Silent Hill 2 on Xbox? &nbsp;Leave your thoughts down in the comments and join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modiphius has announced a <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em> expansion for N7 Day. The tabletop publisher will be bringing new material for both <em>Mass Effect</em> fans and board game enthusiasts:<em>&nbsp;</em>more enemy miniatures and an official expansion&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em>&nbsp;Expansion Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Modiphius made several announcements regarding a <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em> expansion. The first announcement was for a new wave of miniatures. These sets will provide unpainted resin miniatures of different Mass Effect enemies to use in your game if the base experience's cardboard tokens aren't cutting it for you.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mass-effect-board-game-expansion-atlas-mech-miniature.jpg?itok=dLmQhkD_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mass-effect-board-game-expansion-atlas-mech-miniature.jpg?itok=Hwig3Axn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The line of miniatures coming in Q2 of 2026 is as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Priority Threats Delta</li>
	<li>Priority Threats Gamma</li>
	<li>Priority Threats Epsilon</li>
	<li>Battlefield Scenery Alpha</li>
	<li>Battlefield Scenery Beta</li>
	<li>ATLAS Mech and Marker</li>
	<li>YMIR Mech and Marker</li>
	<li>Brute and Marker</li>
</ul><p>The second, more notable announcement is confirmation that the studio is working on an official expansion. This will introduce six new squadmates, new loyalty missions, and new locations. At the time of writing, the exact details on the expansion's contents, release date, or price, is unknown.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect</em></a> series was created by Bioware and published by Electronic Arts in 2008. It followed Commander Shepard, a custom player character, as they explored a vast sci-fi universe with unique aliens, factions, and history. The unique selling point was that you could import your save data from each game, with your choices and partnerships having widespread consequences as the series progressed.</p>

<p>The <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em>, aka <em>Mass Effect: Project Hagalaz</em>, released last year. It is a cooperative game set during the events of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> and follows Commander Shepard and their crew on a mission involving Cerberus and The Reapers. The game was designed by Eric Lang (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Bloodborne: The Board Game</em></a>) and Calvin Wang Tze Loon.</p>

<p>The game garnered a bit of controversy at launch. Namely, a culture war spat regarding squadmates' personal pronouns being featured in the game. This led to a series of review bombing on Board Game Geek, Lang being harassed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mass-effect-board-game-designer-harrassed-over-culture-war-review-bombing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">off social media</a>, and pronouns being removed in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/czech-release-of-mass-effect-board-game-will-remove-squadmate-pronouns" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Czech version</a> of the game.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO</a> launches for the Switch and Switch 2 next week, and in case you missed it, players who purchase the Switch release will be able to update their game to play an "enhanced version" on the Switch 2 system.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco explains on its website (and in the video above) how you'll be able to do this by simply connecting your Switch 2 system to the internet and then downloading the update. After this, the characters and backgrounds in the game will appear with "improved clarity and richer detail".</p>
<p>When applying this update, certain save data - including battle replay data, edit data and online records cannot be carried over. As for battles, you'll be able to play with users on Switch 2 and other Switch players who have this same update applied.</p>
<p>Below is a look at the Switch version before the update, after the update, and how the game looks on Switch 2:</p>

<p>You can find out more about how this game will perform on the Switch and Switch 2 in our previous story <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-switch-and-switch-2-performance-and-resolution-detailed">about the performance and resolution</a>.

                <p>Earlier this week, Square Enix disclosed its ambition to drastically cut its Quality Assurance employees and use generative AI to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-wants-genai-to-automate-70-of-game-qa-by-2027/1100-6535996/" data-ref-id="1100-6535996">handle 70% of its game QA and debugging</a>. The company went on to note that it wants to "establish a competitive advantage in game development." However, Michael Douse--the publishing director of Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian--has called out Square Enix and described its plan as "stupid."</p><p>"So QA are some of the most video games engaged people in any company," Douse wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1986535697809854640" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>. "They are integral to your community teams. To publishing. They give you the real feedback.

"They are a massively advantageous vibe check."</p><p>Douse also noted that QA jobs have often been gateway positions for people looking to get into the video game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Halo Infinite is ending after four years of updates, confirms Halo Studios. However, it seems the company is putting the teams on multiple new Halo projects, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>.</p>



<p>The Halo franchise has been at the forefront of the FPS genre since its debut in 2001 on Xbox. With several entries, the series has become synonymous with gamers alike for its epic space setting and thrilling gunplay. With the 30th anniversary coming up, Halo Studios is going all in, starting with the recently-revealed Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of 2001’s Combat Evolved. Unfortunately, the most recent title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-halo-qa-tester-blames-microsofts-policies-for-halo-infinite-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Infinite</a>, is ending production, but it will lead to new projects in the works.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-studios-stopping-updates-for-halo-infinite-to-support-other-games">Halo Studios Stopping Updates for Halo Infinite to Support Other Games</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to 343 Industries</figcaption></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post from Halo Studios</a>, the team announced that <strong>Halo Infinite’s newest update</strong>, Operation: Infinite, <strong>will be its last major one</strong>. The update, set to go live on November 18th, 2025, will include new armor, maps, challenges, and 2x XP. Unfortunately, it’s the final one for the game, as, in the blog, the team states,</p>



<p>“<strong>With multiple Halo titles in development, we’ll need our whole team’s combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us</strong>,” the blog reads. “<strong>While we remain committed to supporting&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite</em>&nbsp;on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned</strong>.”</p>



<p>Fortunately, it seems the Halo Infinite team is shifting to help on other Halo games currently in the works. We only know of one, Halo: Campaign Evolved, so <strong>this does confirm more is in development at Halo Studios</strong>. There are rumors that a live-service Halo game is planning to release in 2026, so perhaps it’s one of the titles it’s working on. Of course, one can also assume the next mainline entry is in production, though no confirmation has been made for either project.</p>



<p>What do you think of Halo Infinite ending support? Are you excited to see what Halo Studios has in store? What game do you hope is next? Mainline? Multiplayer?

Eyes on the Prize, however, is one such quest that expects you to bring along a little something to help you get the job done. Let's jump in and see what's what.</p><p><strong>You'll need 3 Wires to repair the solar panel</strong> and complete Eyes on the Prize. Wires are a common resource found in Electrical-based POIs, and within a few hours of gameplay, you should've already amassed quite a collection--unless you've been selling them. Whether you're tossing them into your inventory before you head out or finding them while in the raid, just make sure you have 3 of them before you head to the secluded roof terrace for Eyes on the Prize. And make sure you toss them in a safe pocket if possible, as you never know when things could go wrong, and you don't want to lose them.</p><p>When you're ready to repair a solar panel, here's how to complete Eyes on the Prize.</p><h2>Where to find the secluded roof terrace west of the Southern Station</h2><p>The first objective in Eyes on the Prize is to find a secluded roof terrace west of the Southern Station extraction point. The quest mentions to keep an eye out for a blue tarp, but it can still be hard to spot if you're not at the right angle. With that in mind, refer to the photo below for the exact location on the map.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598921-19a6053211f29-screenshoturl.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598922-19a6051753f6-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598921,1300-4598922" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598921-19a6053211f29-screenshoturl.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598922-19a6051753f6-screenshoturl.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598921-19a6053211f29-screenshoturl.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598922-19a6051753f6-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>You'll need to be on the roof to reach the secluded roof terrace (as per the name). You'll eventually spot a blue tarp with some chairs, boxes, and an electric box. That's your destination.</p><h2>How to rewire the solar panel</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, <strong>you'll need to have brought or scavenged 3 Wires to repair the solar panel</strong> at the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace. If you didn't bring any in with you, you'll either have to recycle an electrical item like a Battery or visit an Electrical-based POI on the map to round a few up.</p><p>As long as you have the 3 Wires in your inventory, you can approach the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace and interact with it to finish your repairs like a proper electrician. With that out of the way, the Eyes on the Prize quest will conclude.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598920-19a60518a884-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598920" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598920-19a60518a884-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598920"></a><figcaption>Repair the solar panel using 3 Wires.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598920-19a60518a884-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Since you don't need to extract to complete the quest, you're now free to finish looting or shooting until you're ready to leave. The nearby Southern Station should prove to be a solid spot to extract when you're finished up, though. Just keep in mind that it tends to be an active region of the map, so don't let your guard down.</p><p>If you need to tackle more quests, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

This quick and straightforward quest sends you to Blue Gate to snag one of these honey-filled bee homes from the Olive Grove POI, and we'll tell you exactly where to get your hands on it.</p><p>You'll need to extract with the beehive in your inventory to get credit for the quest's completion, so you'd do well to bring an augment that possesses a safe pocket so that you can toss this quest item in there for safekeeping--you know, just in case some other raider decides to get fiesty with you. Don't worry--the bees won't sting, though.</p><p>When you're ready to get your hands sticky with honey, here's how to find a beehive for the Bees! quest.</p><h2>Where to find a beehive for the Bees! quest</h2><p>To collect a beehive, you'll need to visit the Olive Grove POI on the Blue Gate map. This area is located in the southern region of the map and happens to be a very active spot for raiders since Olives are a hot commodity. With this in mind, make sure you wave and ask to be friends if you don't want to catch any fire from folks while you're snagging the beehive here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598932-share_20251107_1127582.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598932" data-ratio="0.56135770234987" data-width="1149" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598932-share_20251107_1127582.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598932"></a><figcaption>Find the beehive here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598932-share_20251107_1127582.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive to the location on the map above, you'll find a little shack. If you listen closely, you can probably hear the bees swarming nearby. Look under the roof on the side of the shack to spot the beehive and plenty of little bees flying around. Interact with it to add it to your inventory.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598933-share_20251107_1127550.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598933" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598933-share_20251107_1127550.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598933"></a><figcaption>Interact with the beehive to pick it up.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598933-share_20251107_1127550.jpeg"></figure><p>With the beehive acquired, you'll need to extract and take back to Speranza to finish the Bees! quest. The Forest Airshaft is to your northwest, while the Overlook Airshaft can be visited by heading northeast. Head to whichever one is open based on how much time is left in the map, as they're both likely to be equally dangerous. Keep a lookout for rogue raiders and any patrolling ARC, hit the button, drop inside, and interact with the computer to get back to Speranza and finish things up.</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, we've compiled a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full quest list</a> for you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anyone who makes videos or podcasts for a living knows that the impact of audio comes above just about everything else. Seriously, if your sound quality is good enough, then everything else is often secondary, and that’s why having really good microphones is so important. If you’re looking for an amazing option, then you’ll want to get a good lavalier microphone, because they’re a lot more subtle in appearance while providing excellent sound quality.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon has a deal on which means that the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/">DJI Mic Mini is currently on sale with 38% off, which means it’s down to $74 for a limited time:</a>&nbsp;It’s normally $119, so that’s a decent discount for sure. Not only that, but <strong>this comes with two transmitters and one receiver</strong>, so you can even use this for duo productions.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Mic Check</h2>
<p>The microphones here are incredibly light, weighing in at only ten grams, which means that you’ll not only be able to connect them to just about any bit of clothing, but also not be weighed down by them. That means you’ll look better on camera, but it also means you can fine-tune the placement to get the perfect sound quality, no matter what environment you’re recording in.</p>



<p>They also feature amazing noise cancelling, with you being able to switch modes as needed. Basic will get rid of standard noises you’d expect, but strong can handle all sorts of sounds. It means that you’ll be getting crystal clear audio at all times, and that’s really important. The microphones have an amazing range of 400m as well, so you can set this up indoors then go outside to record as needed.</p>
<p>The battery life is also very impressive. You can keep these on for up to 10 hours in total, which means that you can record for an entire work day without any problems. That’s plenty of time for a huge number of takes, interviews, or different video or audio ideas as you need. These are small, mighty, and long-lasting microphones that are sure to make you sound better, no matter what you’re using them for.</p>
<p>This is a brilliant discount, but it’s also one that we’re not expecting to last for very long. So, if you do want to enjoy this amazing price tag, we recommend doing so soon. The $74 could run out at any time, and that means time is of the essence if you want to save big and sound good.</p>

                <p>Everyone needs a pick-me-up sometimes--maybe even more so if they're living underground after devastating losses to an army of machines. In the Espresso quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you'll need to go topside and seek out an espresso maker from a cafe in Buried City. If you're wondering where exactly to go for this caffeine fix, we've got you covered.</p><p>You'll need to extract from Buried City and return to Speranza with the espresso machine in your inventory to complete the mission, so it's smart to bring along an augment with a safe pocket to store the quest item in. A good gun and shield for protection can't hurt, either.</p><p>When you're ready to get the espresso machine, follow the steps below.</p><h2>Where to find the espresso machine in Arc Raiders</h2><p>The espresso machine is located in a cafe in Plaza Rosa in the southern portion of the Buried City map. This area is often swarming with ARC, so it can be a challenge to get in and out unnoticed, especially if you're also dealing with other raiders questing or looting in the vicinity. Don't be afraid to take things slow when approaching to stay unnoticed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598913-19a6051607696-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598913" data-ratio="0.57222222222222" data-width="1980" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598913-19a6051607696-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598913"></a><figcaption>Cafe location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598913-19a6051607696-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>The cafe is a red building with a "cafe" sign just above the door.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598918-19a60513aee38-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598918" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598918-19a60513aee38-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598918"></a><figcaption>The cafe is a red building with a cafe sign above the door.

You deserve a cup of coffee for all of that hard work.</p><p>If you're stuck on anything else, we've got plenty more quest guides in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>Lance loves to send you out looking for stuff in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, and the A New Type of Plant quest is no different. In this outing, you'll be tasked with finding a possibly toxic plant growing in the Old Battleground area of the Dam Battlegrounds map, then bringing it back to Lance at Speranza. </p><p>You'll be required to extract from the map with the quest to finish A New Type of Plant, so it's a good idea to come equipped with a loadout that you feel comfortable with--especially one with a safe pocket. Equip a decent gun (it's best to prioritize one for human opponents in this case) and make sure you've stocked up on some ammo and healing items before you head in--just in case you need to fend off any attackers while trying to extract.</p><p>When you're ready to get raiding, here's how to complete A New Type of Plant.</p><h2>Where to find the Baron Husk</h2><p>The first objective you have in A New Type of Plant is to located the Baron Husk. This giant fallen ARC can be found in the Old Battleground section on the far western side of the Dam Battlegrounds map. This husk isn't particularly hard to spot, as it's a giant metal monstrosity that has clearly seen better days.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598864-19a601d5e6289-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598864" data-ratio="0.56460044809559" data-width="1339" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598864-19a601d5e6289-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598864"></a><figcaption>Old Battleground</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598864-19a601d5e6289-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>This area isn't known for being particularly heavy on foot traffic, but it's still a good idea to keep an eye out for other raiders. A simple "don't shoot!" might stand between you and grabbing your quest item, after all.</p><h2>Where to find the toxic plant</h2><p>The toxic plant has plenty of spawns around the Baron Husk area. It looks somewhat similar to the Great Mullein plant you've already had to gather for Lance's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-doctors-orders-quest-guide/1100-6536044/" data-ref-id="1100-6536044">Doctor's Orders quest</a>, except this one has orange blooms that are rather visually striking. If you're struggling to find the plants, check for directly next to the husk until you round one up. Make sure you loot it!</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598863-19a601ce58022-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598863" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598863-19a601ce58022-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598863"></a><figcaption>Make sure to add the plant to your inventory and take it back to Speranza.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598863-19a601ce58022-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you've picked up the toxic plant, you'll need to extract. If you brought an augment with a safe pocket, make sure you toss the quest item in there to keep it safe in case you run into trouble. Either way, head east to the Central Swamp Lift. This area is often crawling with ARC and frequently camped by other raiders, so don't be afraid to take things nice and slow--and keep your wits about you. You'll be back in Speranza in no time where you can turn in your quest to Lance.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

Celeste's quest Digging Up Dirt is no different--though figuring out how to get to the dead drop she's asked you to retrieve can be a little tricky. In this guide, we'll fill you in on how to reach the dead drop inside the Santa Maria Houses so you can finish up the Digging Up Dirt quest.</p><p>For this quest, you won't need to extract to receive credit. As such, you can always enter the map using a free loadout to reduce the pain of death should some ARC or other raider put a quick end to you. The last thing you'd want is to lose a bunch of your best gear because you were just trying to get a quest done, after all.</p><p>Here's where to find the dead drop for the Digging Up Dirt quest.</p><h2>Where to find the dead drop for Digging Up Dirt</h2><p>The dead drop Celeste wants you to find is located at the Santa Maria Houses POI in the southern portion of Buried City. Luckily, it's a pretty safe area in most matches, so you aren't likely to get into too much trouble so long as you don't start any yourself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598831-19a6005a10399-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598831" data-ratio="0.56564748201439" data-width="2224" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598831-19a6005a10399-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598831"></a><figcaption>Santa Maria Houses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598831-19a6005a10399-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>The dead drop is in the interior of the building here, but getting inside won't appear possible if you're trying to approach it from the ground floor. Instead, make your way to the roof and enter the open window up there. You'll drop into the attic where you can take a zipline down into the next level of the building.</p><p>Navigate the fairly linear building until you reach a large, open room filled with sand on the ground floor. Here, directly in the center of the room, will be the dead drop. Hop down and interact with it to complete the quest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4598833-19a6005781921-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598833" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4598833-19a6005781921-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598833"></a><figcaption>Dead drop location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4598833-19a6005781921-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>With the quest for Celeste complete, you'll want to worry about extracting next. Both the Southern Station and Eastern Station are within reasonable proximity to you, so pick the one you feel most comfortable with and get the hell out of dodge before the timer runs down too much and spawns a boatload of ARC for you to fend off--or, you know, before another pesky raider comes along and causes any problems.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="468">Now that we’re in the last two months of the year, the doors are wide open for all the holiday shopping you need to take care of. If you’re still on the hunt for some gifts for a friend, family member, or loved one, you might want to consider this Fitbit Inspire 3 health and fitness tracker. It’s not even Black Friday yet, but the GPS-enabled wristwatch is already on sale with Black Friday-level prices. It normally sells for $99, but for a limited time you can pick it up on sale for 30% off: Some <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5395/">quick napkin math will tell you that’s a $30 savings, bringing the price you pay to just $69</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5395/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>


<p data-start="0" data-end="468">The Fitbit Inspire 3 is you’re own personal trainer right on your wrist, there to help you whether you’re out for a run or grinding through a session in the gym. With over 20 exercise modes to choose from, it automatically kicks into workout tracking when it senses you’re getting active. You can even connect it to your phone’s GPS to track your distance and pace when you’re outside. Want to keep tabs on your stats while lifting, kayaking, or biking? Maybe post to Strava so you can get all your precious kudos? Do it with the Fitbit Inspire 3.</p>
<p data-start="470" data-end="894">The Inspire 3 monitors your heart rate around the clock and can measure the intensity of your workouts, letting you know when you’re in the fat burn, cardio, or peak zones. This way you can fine-tune your workouts accordingly. Plus, it can help you stay on top of your health by checking for signs of irregular rhythm that could point to atrial fibrillation (AFib). It even tracks things like blood oxygen levels, skin temperature, and more.</p>


<h2 data-start="896" data-end="1274">Sleep Better, Wake Better</h2>
<p data-start="896" data-end="1274">The Fitbit Inspire 3 can gently wake you up with a vibration during your lightest sleep stage, so you start your day feeling refreshed instead of groggy. It also gives you a sleep score and breaks down your light, deep, and REM stages, along with your sleeping heart rate, to help you understand your sleep patterns and improve your habits over time.</p>
<p data-start="1276" data-end="1465">Need a little nudge to move more? The Inspire 3 has your back there too. If you’ve been sitting for too long, it’ll send a friendly buzz reminding you to stretch your legs and get moving.</p>
<p data-start="1467" data-end="1699">This wristwatch isn’t just to help you tackle physical wellness, but mental wellness too. You can see your daily stress management score, based on factors like heart rate and daily activity, and take guided breathing sessions to help you reset and relax.</p>

              <p>We’re quickly approaching the holiday season which means gift shopping season is already here. We’ve got Black Friday and Cyber Monday coming up in just a few short weeks. You can either hold out until then to find some good tech deals for all your gift shopping needs, or if you look in the right places, you can find some great tech deals right now. Amazon happens to have the Beats Studio Buds earbuds on sale for almost half off right now. For a limited time, you can grab <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4822/">these noise-cancelling earbuds for a 47% discount, bringing the price down from $149 to just $79</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4822/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Cancel the Sounds of the World Around You</h2>
<p>The Beats Studio Buds support two distinct listening modes. With Active Noise Cancelling, you’re able to turn off the distracting background noises from your environment. This is wonderful for when trying to get some work done in a chatty office or coffee shop, or when flying and you want to drown out the sounds from the plane turbine so you can focus on catching up with&nbsp;<em>50MPH — </em>an oral history podcast cataloguing the development, production and legacy of director Jan de Bont’s Oscar-winning 1994 summer blockbuster&nbsp;<em>Speed</em>.</p>



<p>When you you do need to hear your surrounding again, like for instance you’re heading out of the office and walking down a busy sidewalk in a car-centric city, then maybe switch over to transparency mode. This will allow you sounds from your environment to filter through, keeping you alert to what’s around you. Safety first.</p>
<p>Battery life is pretty solid here. With the charging case, you can listen a full 24 hours. When using just the buds, you can expect a total listening time of roughly eight hours.</p>



<p>The earbuds are sweat and water resistant, making these Beats Studio Buds ideal for working out. Whether you’re running the roads or hitting the gym, you can keep up with your favorite music, podcasts, or audiobooks while working up a sweat.</p>
<p>One small caveat is this set of earbuds doesn’t come with a charging adapter, just the USB-C charging cable. Lots of manufacturers have ceased including the brick with their stuff as a cost-cutting measure. Thankfully everything is USB-C these days so odds are, you already have a few on hand.</p>
<p>These stylish earbuds come in three different colors to choose from. Pick between the classic black, or decide to go with red or white. All three options are going for just $80 for a limited time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-the-kotaku-review.1347466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As I’ve continued to sink hour after hour into <i>Arc Raiders</i>, I keep thinking about Paintball, a sport I’ve never spent any meaningful time with but have always been attracted to, especially as a fan of video games in which you shoot other people.</p>

 <p>Specifically, I think about <a href="https://youtu.be/RJEjSddm4B8">the origins of this kind of sport</a> in which human beings willingly participate in a simulation of violent survival. In Paintball’s case, the game was sparked by an argument between a country boy, Charles Gaines, and a city boy, Hayes Noel. It became a way to settle a score between two friends: Who is better equipped to survive in the wild? It turns out the country boy fared better, as he summed up with an anecdote that almost perfectly describes a kind of interaction I’ve had a few dozen times in <i>Arc Raiders</i>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Within about 20 minutes, I came around a big maple tree and Hayes was sitting on a rock. And I walked right up behind him and put the barrel of the gun right on his neck and said “alright, I don’t wanna shoot you. Who wins?”</p></blockquote> <p>This experience inspired the duo to gather a whole bunch of other friends to play out more survival scenarios, equipped with nonlethal, though still painful, weaponry with which to defend themselves. According to Gaines, Paintball was an exciting game of “stealth, wood skills, and strategy […] the idea of running through the woods, competing and symbolically surviving, those go way back into our genetic development.”</p>

 <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>, I’m convinced, taps into similar things, lighting up a primal part of the brain that is both thrilled and terrified about entering a dangerous area to earn rewards, establish victory, and get out alive. Of course, <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ arsenal is way more diverse and, of course, mercifully free of any physical pain from getting shot.</p>

 <p>Losing though? Damn, that sting is something you still have to learn to deal with. If you’re up for the mental challenge of tolerating devastating losses baked into a thrilling set of third-person shooter encounters, <i>Arc Raiders</i> has distilled that distinctive combination into a single package like few other games out there.</p>

 <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000642206" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642206"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642206">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> is a PvPvE extraction shooter set in the late 2100s following two world-ending events: A complete ecological collapse that destroyed human civilization as we know it, and the arrival of deadly, autonomous machines that have made it all but impossible to recover from the collapse.</p>

 <p>No one knows where these machines—Arc as they’re referred to—came from. They were beaten back once before but have now returned with more sophisticated, deadlier designs. Humanity’s only option for survival is to live below the surface while brave pioneers, Raiders, venture Topside to collect resources and manage what few elements of human infrastructure remain.</p>

 <p>Players take on the role of Raiders as they accomplish quests related to the survival of the underground community known as Speranza, while also grabbing items with which to craft various weapons, gadgets, and restorative items.</p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Get ready to lose...all your shit!"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Embark Studios</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Third-person extraction shooter.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Unpredictable gameplay, engaging progression systems, fantastic stealth and shooting scenarios.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Crafting menus are cumbersome to navigate.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PCs (played).</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>October 30, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>60 hours, mostly running solo.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p>This perpetual task of gathering and crafting represents one half of the game: inventory management. Flipping through menus, breaking found items down, combining them to build an assortment of resources. These are the vegetables you have to eat before the main course of shooting and survival.</p> <p>The other part of the game, the meat and potatoes, is all the shooting and survival you have to engage in to acquire that stuff and, crucially, to hang on to what you’ve laid claim to.</p> <p>In each match, you’ll have roughly 15 to 30 minutes on one of the game’s four different maps, set in different regions of post-apocalyptic Italy. Your goal is to grab what you can and leave before the timer runs out, or before someone guns you down–be it a machine patrolling the surface, or another player looking to take your stuff.</p>

  <p>If you make it back home alive, you keep everything you found. Die, and it’s all left behind, now potentially loot for someone else.</p> <p>Other players don’t have to be your enemies, strictly speaking, but whether or not you engage in PvP isn’t entirely up to you. When two un-partied players catch sight of each other in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">prisoner’s dilemma</a> unfolds: Is this person a threat? Can they be trusted? Will you ever feel safe taking your eyes off of them? How should you split the loot you collectively find?</p>

 <p>After a healthy amount of time spent in-game, <i>Arc Raiders</i> has thoroughly won me over with its slow-paced, tactical third-person shooting and its satisfying perpetual game of collecting Things™. But it’s that social game that sparks between two random players that has become the most engaging aspect for me. I rarely hop on a mic to chat, but thankfully <i>Arc Raiders</i> has an emote system that includes a decent range of options, enough for me to get a first impression of someone and decide if I feel safe traveling with them for the remainder of the game.</p> <p>All of these unpredictable elements—what loot is available at any given time, what Arc are present and in what locations, whether other players are friendly or dangerous—combine to create a machine that generates interesting situations and memorable encounters.</p> <p>Escape sequences, tense sniper battles, close-quarters showdowns with SMGs and shotguns, stealthy infiltrations of loot-filled locales, quests to hunt and take down a tough-as-nails and well-armed Arc; these and other scenarios just spontaneously happen in a game of <i>Arc Raiders</i>. It’s all unscripted and entirely reliant on the mixture of whatever and whoever is on the map and what their agendas are, be it questing, looting, or intentionally hunting down other players.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642207" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642207"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642207">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Gone is the safety of a single-player campaign with checkpoints and forgiving Game Over screens. Gone are the prescribed rules of engagement of traditional PvP, in which you’re forced to engage in a firefight with specific win/lose conditions. Here, it’s all live and in the moment. You, by yourself or with two other squad members, are fighting, literally, to hang onto what you’ve laid claim to. You don’t just raise your gun while infiltrating an area because it looks cool, you do so because that gun is a tool for your survival and there’s no telling what’s around the next corner.</p> <p>I’m convinced this game taps into some kind of primal fight-or-flight mechanism in the brain. For some, <i>Arc Raiders</i> will always be too stressful as a result. For other kinds of sickos, it’s the thrill of third-person shooting straight from the tap.</p> <p>As I continued to sink hour after hour of my time into <i>Arc Raiders</i>, it has felt like <i>this</i> was the experience I’ve been training for by playing and loving the hell out of tactical third-person shooters for so long, especially those with a bit of a survival bent. The risk associated with losing what I’ve found triggers an adrenaline rush of a kind I think is only possible in this specific genre of extraction shooters, and <i>Arc Raiders</i> is one of the best executions of this format. Though it is also a live-service game of a sort and thus could, in time, evolve in ways that fundamentally alter its identity, as long as <i>Arc Raiders </i>remains what it is right now, I have no need for any other online shooter. It is the “sport” of third-person shooters I have long hungered for.</p> <h2>Raiders of a Lost Age</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000642208" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642208"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642208">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>As an extraction shooter, <i>Arc Raiders</i> gives you a healthy selection of maps to enter and leave, hopefully wealthier than you were when you came in. The four maps present at launch provide a smorgasbord of post-apocalyptic scenes against which a variety of violent an endless assortment of stealthy scenarios can play out. Upon successful extraction, you keep what you found and you’re rewarded with XP to invest in your skill trees, as well as “Cred” which you can use to progress the game’s battle passes, or “Raider Decks,” as the game calls them. Currently there is only one Deck available; it’s free and can reward you with both cosmetics as well as in-game items.</p>

 <p>Out in the field, you’ll encounter wide open spaces spotted with broken-down machines from a battle fought long ago, as well as abandoned buildings with winding staircases and long stretches of vacant hallways adorned with rust, peeling paint, and signs and symbols from a forgotten age. It all constitutes an endless labyrinth of faded ruin for you to traverse. Weather conditions and changes in the time of day make the maps feel varied and fresh.</p> <p>There’s loot around every corner. You frequently have to break into locked caches, which itself is risky given the amount of noise it makes and time it takes to sort through a bunch of junk with the hope of finding that one piece of rusted gear you need to improve your crafting skills back home, or to kit out a new gun that will hopefully do a better job of keeping you alive.</p>

 <p>You can also take on specific quests, some of which fill you in on a bit of lore. You learn why there are abandoned, destroyed Arc machines in certain areas, and where the community of Speranza gets its water and other resources from. You’ll often have to go out to specific locations to gather key items, or to activate essential infrastructural elements. Completing these quests will see you earn loot from the quest giver in addition to whatever you found during your trip.</p>  <p>The quests are hardly riveting on their own, and often feature vague descriptions of where you’re supposed to go which can be frustrating, but it also forces you to observe your surroundings in a refreshing way–you’re not just chasing waypoints on a HUD. <i>Arc Raiders</i> wants you to actually be observant. One quest asked me to find a room in a building with a beautiful view of the map. What does that even mean? Well, I ran around the building until finally I came upon a window that, to me anyway, looked like it offered quite a pretty view. I audibly <a href="https://youtu.be/wGY9pakwFBU?t=32">quoted a young Ellie</a>, and searched the room to find my objective. And find it I did!</p>

 <p>These quests mostly consist of the same “go here, grab this thing, flip this switch” objectives, but even that can spark thrilling encounters given the unpredictability of what can happen when you encounter another player and the randomness of which of the game’s Arc menaces might be patrolling the area at that moment.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642209" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642209"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642209">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Different points of interest on each of the maps hold the promise of greater or lesser loot. And there are a variety of keys you can find to unlock hidden areas. Naturally, the areas with better loot are often the most dangerous, either because there’s a more aggressive Arc presence in that area, or because other players like yourself are heeding the call of better loot as well.</p> <h2>Shoot (or sneak) to survive; survive to subsist on your loot</h2> <p>There’s a ton of loot and items in <i>Arc Raiders</i> and, like in many games, it’s all color coded: Gray items are at the bottom, green items are better, blue even better. Purple is sick and gold is GOAT. If we’re talking about guns, then obviously a purple gun will be more desirable than a green. And if we’re talking about crafting ingredients, green crafting items are used to build better stuff than gray ones.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642210" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642210"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642210">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In <i>Arc Raiders</i>, you’ll kit yourself out with an “Augment,” which will affect the kind of shield you can wear, as well as the size of your inventory. You’ll always have access to a free version that gives you enough loot space for a run, as well as a gun with ammo. Unless you’re specifically interested in doing so, there’s no reason to spawn onto a map with just your fists.</p>

 <p>Once you’re out on the field, <i>Arc Raiders</i> plays like many semi-realistic shooters. Characters are intentionally a little weighty and slow in how they move and shoot. Think <i>The Last of Us</i>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><i>Metal Gear Solid</i></a>, or <i>Resident Evil 4</i> and not, say, <i>Vanquish</i>, <i>Warframe</i>, or <i>Max Payne</i>. Add in the essential and finite nature of loot, and the game reminds me often of a survival horror game, just without screaming monsters (though you’ll learn to fear some of these machines for sure).</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>: The&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ enemies, specifically the computer-controlled ones known as Arc, pose a deadly threat. Many of them fly and can easily get new angles on you, and they’re equipped with weapons that can finish you off in no time.</p> <p>By having its AI antagonists serve the role of patrolmen on the field, <i>Arc Raiders </i>keeps you on edge, always on the&nbsp; lookout for their presence. But as dangerous as they are, damn, are they also fun to shoot. Metal parts fly off of them as bullets collide with their armor; the drone variety in particular satisfyingly spins and sputters when taking shots. As I’ve mentioned before, it reminds me of another IRL sport: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_pigeon_shooting">Clay pigeon shooting</a>.</p> <p>You’re not just mindlessly mowing down enemies to see damage numbers fill the screen. You have to place your shots well to destroy key parts of the Arc, while also being aware of their specific capabilities. The Leaper, for instance, can jump across vast distances and ignore difficult terrain to get to you.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642211" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642211"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642211">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Arc make for a satisfying foe. Because they’re machines, they’re not constantly repeating the same canned lines of dialogue like enemies in other shooters often do. And their patrol patterns feel believable for a force that exists solely to keep you off the map. They’re not just masked NPCs that exist to walk back and forth forever. And their behavior, which in some cases was built using machine learning, is wildly unpredictable in a satisfying way.</p> <p>Your other threats, though? Those would be your fellow human beings. They’re not just for shooting at, or for contests measuring who has the better collection of loot. They’re sometimes for forming uneasy alliances with, and the social game of determining whether to cooperate or compete with someone rarely plays out the same way twice. You might roll out on a map to do some solo looting, only to find yourself a new ally who’ll join you. Maybe they’ll even have a key to a place you haven’t been to yet. (And don’t worry if you’re mic-shy; you can ping what items are in your inventory to say things like “I have a key for this location” without ever needing to say a word.)</p> <p>Once, I grouped up with two other players who had one goal in mind: “We’re gonna take down a Leaper,” they told me. So I followed them to a bunker one of them pointed out. We dug in and opened fire on a nearby Leaper, took it down, grabbed its loot and then took down another team who tried to take advantage of us when we weren’t looking.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642212"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642212">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Another time I grouped up with a single random person on my quest to reach the Control Tower in Dam Battlegrounds, a promising location for loot. I had a key, but when we ascended the top, I found the door had been barred by a player-made Door Blocker. You can break these, but you’ll make an awful lot of noise in the process, and anyone lurking on the other end of that door will know you’re coming. I jammed my pickaxe into the door to start breaching it while my newly found comrade covered my back. We broke in to find no enemy players. Instead, a bunch of hostile Arc called “Pops” which just, well, pop with a deadly explosion right in front of you, poured down a staircase right to us. We took them out and then cautiously, room-by-room, stalked and searched the perimeter for whoever had blocked that door. Turns out they were long gone, but they did leave some decent loot for us to claim.</p> <p>And while you always want to hang on to your loot, given that <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ is an extraction shooter, dying and losing your stuff is just a standard part of the game’s inherently entropic nature. You can lose things just as easily as you found them, and guns and other items also have durability meters you need to keep an eye on.</p> <p>But if you die and your gun goes on to someone else, you’re also contributing to the economy of the game overall. That great shotgun you leveled up and kitted out? Lose it and now it’s someone else’s great shotgun that they’ll go cause some chaos with. Lately, I’ve taken to offloading my overflowing inventory by just gifting players better guns I made, which will hopefully aid them in their future fights.</p> <p>PvP in <i>Arc Raiders</i> is an endless pendulum of conflict and cooperation. Sometimes you can sway which direction it’s going in, while at other times you need to learn how to move with it or get the hell out of the way.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642213"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642213">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But when you’re not negotiating the terms of your survival with other players, or engaging in thrilling firefights with or against them, you’re back home, tinkering away with an inventory system that, as of now, is decent enough at letting you sort through your junk. But know that this is itself a time commitment.</p> <h2>The ‘joys’ of menu diving</h2> <p>Some quick back-of-the-napkin math tells me I’ve probably spent about a third of my time in <i>Arc Raiders</i> sorting through the menu system. Any engagement with this game also necessitates hours spent moving things around on a grid, combining them, breaking them down, and crafting them into new stuff. A strict cap on how much stuff you can stash away (you can level your stash up to a max of 256 items) means that you have to use your stuff rather than just hoarding all of it. If you have a tendency to be a pack mule, prepare for frequent back-and-forth to clear out enough space.</p> <p>The menu systems are serviceable, though they could stand to be improved. Crafting, for example, requires you to back out of your inventory screen to go to a specific workshop menu. It would be great if you could just craft more of a given object by right-clicking on it and selecting a “Craft” option but, at present, that isn’t there. There’s also no way to lock or mark an item to avoid accidentally selling or destroying it. Furthermore, some of the language, specifically around items whose only use is seemingly to be broken down into crafting materials, is vague. A Rusted Gear, for instance, might tell you that its only purpose is to “be recycled into crafting materials,” but you’ll soon find out that Rusted Gears are needed to upgrade your gun workshop.</p> <h2>‘It can’t be for nothing’</h2> <p>Shooting, surviving, navigating social situations with other players, hell, even collecting and crafting all present satisfying game loops that can just theoretically go on forever in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. And eventually, everyone will have access to better loot. So the nature of how lethal other players are in this game will ebb and flow. But what’s it all for?</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642214"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642214">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s <a href="https://youtu.be/fHuE5qqRPJA?t=35">not for nothing</a>. Right now, your ultimate goal in <i>Arc Raiders</i> is to invest in what it calls “Projects,” where you dedicate tons of found loot into building a caravan to send your Raider off to unknown frontiers.</p> <p>It’s a narrative wrapping for a mechanic very common in survival games and other extraction shooters: A server wipe.</p> <p>Because players can amass such incredible arsenals of weaponry and gear, a server wipe is a necessary controlled burn of its loot forest, a way to tame the lethality that will surely spiral out of control and descend into strict metas that, I’d argue, are antithetical to the experience of the game.</p> <p>But Embark Studios has chosen not to enforce a strict time for a global wipe. Instead, you opt into wiping by sending off your character, all their loot, and all of their skill tree and workshop upgrade progress. You’ll get some XP bonuses and crafting bonuses for doing so, as well as some extra points to invest in a new skill tree based on the value of what you had in your stash.</p> <p>At the time of writing, no one can send their character off. The window to do so will be a timed event.</p> <p>The game also features trials that reset every week featuring challenges like damaging certain Arc foes and searching specific loot caches. As you progress through these trials, you’ll ascend a publicly viewable leaderboard to track your global progress against that of everyone else playing the game.</p> <p>But perhaps what is most unknown right now is where the <i>story</i> of <i>Arc Raiders</i> is going. No one in-universe seems to know where the Arc came from. It is thought that some humans managed to jump ship and leave Earth as the environment fell apart, which has led fans to speculate that the Arc were actually sent here by now-extraterrestrial humans looking to mine what’s left of the planet for their own survival elsewhere.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642215" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642215"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642215">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Certain quests indicate that Arc behavior is changing, but the NPC quest givers are just as concerned with making sure everyone in Speranza has drinkable water and a decent supply of food as they are with tracking mysterious Arc behavior.</p> <p>There’s a lot of potential in <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ story, and in what future challenges it can introduce. We know from the game’s 2025 road map that a new Arc will arrive, presumably bringing with it new morsels of narrative to fuel the mystery of their origin.</p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> will naturally evolve as its various systems develop. Right now, however, it’s a stunning offering of eustress-inducing shootouts with very real consequences for failure as you take on unpredictable enemy players, cooperate with allies, and face down the cunning threats posed by the game’s excellent enemy AI. For those with an appetite for hunting and gathering, <i>Arc Raiders</i> promises an endless supply of loot to find and work with, all set in gorgeous maps brought to life with incredible sound design that conveys information as much as it entertains the ear with its satisfying sounds of clanging metal and rummaging through crates of <i>stuff</i>, as well as the compelling but terrifying digital chirps and songs of the Arc when they spot you.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642216" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642216"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642216">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But it is a punishing game. You will have to confront your own sense of failure, and the frustration that comes from getting sniped out of the blue or taken down by a sudden swarm of AI drones. <i>Arc Raiders</i> rarely eases up the pressure it puts on you. For some, that’s likely to be a dealbreaker. But if you’re game for something thrilling and you’re willing to tolerate loss, <i>Arc Raiders</i> is one of the most approachable and engaging examples of the extraction shooter yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new teaser that has surfaced online, it appears that Genshin Impact developer miHoYo has begun work on a fantasy MMO game with AI-based elements, called Genesis, utilizing Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>miHoYo is known for its work on anime-style games, with Genshin Impact being the developer’s crown jewel. Their roster includes several other games with the same art style, such as Zenless Zone Zero and Honkai Impact 3rd, among others. Now, it seems the developer will be venturing into a new world with Unreal Engine 5 and MMO elements.</p>



<h2 id="h-genesis-is-a-fantasy-mmo-with-ai-elements">Genesis is a Fantasy MMO With AI Elements</h2>



<p>Users on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mihoyo-is-working-on-new-open-world-game-mmo-pvp-ue5-ai.1346665/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hoyoverse-releases-first-tease-for-new-unreal-engine-5-fantasy-mmo-and-yes-it-uses-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) have spotted a video featuring a tease for Genshin Impact devs’ upcoming Unreal Engine 5 MMO title. The video was posted by miHoYo’s hiring department on the Chinese social media platform, Xiaohongshu. Through translations, it has been revealed that the game is being developed using Unreal Engine 5 and will be a fantasy MMO title featuring an Open World and PvP. miHoYo’s was previously using Unity Engine for games like Genshin Impact, Zenless Zone Zero, Honkai Star Rail and more. </p>



<p>Coming to the AI-based elements of the title, the translations have revealed that the title will feature “Artificial Intelligence Stimulated Eco System, All-Terrain Battle AI, and Intellectual NPC. It is difficult to determine the extent to which AI will play a role in the upcoming title, but it appears that it will be utilized in some capacity. However, as these are translations, players should treat this information with caution. </p>



<p>In other news, Genshin Impact has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genshin-impact-shut-down-playstation-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed from PlayStation 4</a>, and support will end next year. Additionally, earlier this year, Congnosphere (HoYoverse) was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genshin-impact-publisher-fined-20-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fined $20 million</a> for selling lootboxes to children and teenagers.

The game releases on November 14, but players can start preloading Black Ops 7 as early as November 10. This update for the Call of Duty HQ will also include reorganized and existing Black Ops 6 and Warzone content packs, so players will want to be aware of some additional downloads.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher says the Black Ops 7 preload will be a larger update for players with all Black Ops 6 and Warzone content installed, but they can reduce the size of the download by uninstalling content they're no longer playing, such as the Black Ops 6 campaign.</p>

<p>As we inch closer to the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on November 14, 2025, the developers continue to drop various tidbits of information for players ahead of the full launch. We recently learned all launch details for the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombies-mode-complete-launch-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies mode</a>. It seems the next intel drop was going to be about BO7’s campaign, revealing the title’s Endgame details.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-endgame-dev-talk-coming-on-november-10">Black Ops 7 Endgame Dev Talk Coming on November 10</h2>



<p>Spotted by CharlieIntel on <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1986877838310400201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Activision accidentally posted and promptly deleted a blog post early, which revealed details about the game’s campaign. Towards the end of the blog post, it was revealed that after completing the first 11 co-op missions, players will be able to unlock the Endgame for Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>The Endgame will task “JSOC with exploring the vast landscapes of Avalon, dismantling The Guild’s remaining Command Centers while battling exposure zones leaking a mysterious toxin into the city.” It seems that this blog post was intended to release on November 9, as towards the very end it was mentioned, “Expect a Dev Talk, and a Deep Dive Blog with a detailed overview of the Campaign Endgame, coming tomorrow, Monday, November 10.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>The blog post itself was intended to get players up to speed with Black Ops narrative so they are fully prepared once the co-op campaign goes live on the release date. Players can get “more insight on the major plots and players in motion at the start of the adventure” through the upcoming intel drop. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With a busy late 2026, Insomniac confirms that Marvel’s Wolverine will still release in Fall 2026, despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6’s massive delay</a>.</p>



<p>Continuing on from Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man series, Marvel’s Wolverine is going to be a more mature take on the superhero. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-gets-new-trailer-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Gameplay Trailer</a> showing off some intense gore and violence, it’s clear the game won’t hold any punches. Seeing as it’s a PlayStation exclusive, there’s already a lot of backing behind it to be a huge title for 2026. The trailer announced that the game would release in Fall 2026, but, seeing as delays are common, weren’t sure if it’d hold. Well, Insomniac stood its case with a new tweet, possibly hinting at some heated rivalry with Rockstar’s highly anticipated sixth GTA entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine-still-coming-out-in-fall-2026-despite-grand-theft-auto-6-s-delay">Marvel’s Wolverine Still Coming Out in Fall 2026, Despite Grand Theft Auto 6’s Delay</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1986894458835910839" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from Insomniac Games</a>, the company states that Marvel’s Wolverine is still coming out in Fall 2026. Wishlists for the game on the PlayStation Store are also open, letting fans get all the latest info on the game prior to release. The timing of the message does seem convenient, as Grand Theft Auto 6 was pushed from May 26th, 2026 to November 19th, 2026. </p>



<p>Seeing as many games would want to avoid releasing when GTA 6 comes out, it’s neat to see Insomniac stick to its date. Still, it wouldn’t be too surprising to see Marvel’s Wolverine come out in August or September. That way, it would get a few months of sales and time in before Rockstar’s big new title gets in on the action. Either way, we’ll hear more about both projects next year, seeing as they’ll debut then. In Wolverine’s case, we’ll learn more in Spring 2026, as announced during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last State of Play</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think about Marvel’s Wolverine keeping its Fall 2026 date? Think it’ll come out before Grand Theft Auto 6? Could it stand up against it if it releases near or on November 19th? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

                <p>Fortnite Battle Royale will return to a more typical experience once the current Simpsons mini-season ends at the end of November, according to a blog posted on the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1986889874029297835" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite Status Twitter account</a>, with the game slated to return to 100-player rounds and a much roomier island.</p><p>The launch of Fortnite's Simpsons-themed mini-season at the beginning of November introduced some dramatic changes to the rhythm of Battle Royale matches, thanks largely to the size of the map. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-simpsons-map-full-springfield-map-and-all-named-locations/2900-7204/" data-ref-id="2900-7204">new Springfield island</a> covers about half the land area that the Chapter 6 island did, with the mode temporarily supporting 80 players instead of 100. That's made the island extraordinarily dense with players, and it's been tough to land in any named location at the start of a match without bumping into an opponent trying to grab the same chest you're going for.</p><p>The blog said that fundamental shift in the flow of matches was an experiment.</p><p>"Here's something different: this season’s BR is 80 players instead of 100 on the more compact map. The vibe so far? Faster rotations, more meaningful fights, and less time running across empty fields. This is an experiment--we plan to return to 100 players next season--but we wanted to see what happens when we concentrate the action."</p><p>That wasn't the only big piece of news we got from this blog. <strong>For this Saturday and Sunday only</strong>, Epic is adding two Simpsons-themed weapons--the Deodorant Applicator, and Bart's Slingshot--to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-simpsons-season/2900-7206/" data-ref-id="2900-7206">Battle Royale loot pool</a>. This is another unusual thing Epic is trying during this mini-season, as the company debuted those weapons last weekend in Delulu mode.</p><p>Fortnite's Simpsons season is live until November 29, when Chapter 7 will begin.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-the-kotaku-review-1848159022"><em>Halo Infinite’</em>s</a> next major update, Operation: Infinite, will be the last major update the sci-fi shooter receives, as confirmed by Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) in a new blog post.</p> <p>On November 7, <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview">Halo Studios announced that after four years</a>, there would be no more large content updates for 2021’s<em> Halo Infinite.</em> The next<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and now last<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->major operation will launch on November 18. It will add some new cosmetic items and will permanently double XP progression. The devs are also doubling how many Spartan Points players receive for completing challenges as part of this upcoming update. And that’s all nice, but for folks excited for the future of <em>Halo Infinite</em>, the blog post shared on Friday made it clear that Operation Infinite was the end of an era for the FPS.</p>

 <p>“With multiple <em>Halo</em> titles in development,” Halo Studios explained, “we’ll need our whole team’s combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us. While we remain committed to supporting <em>Halo Infinite</em> on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.”</p>

 <p>To be clear: <em>Halo Infinite</em> isn’t being shut down. You’ll still be able to play the free-to-play multiplayer shooter on Xbox or PC for the foreseeable future. And Halo Studios has committed to continuing to offer new daily and weekly challenges as well as ranked seasons. But as for new guns, maps, vehicles, and so on, that’s not going to happen.<em> Halo Infinite’</em>s days as Xbox’s flagship <em>Halo</em> game are coming to a close after the November 18 update.</p> <p>In the Friday blog post, Halo Studios thanked fans for “incredible memories” and for supporting the game, and explained that the team is now shifting focus to “in-development” games, such as the previously announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved,</em> a remake of the OG game’s campaign, which will be the first <em>Halo</em> game to make the leap to PS5.</a> And according to <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951">Xbox, it won’t be the last.</a></p> <p>“As we look ahead, your feedback will continue to help us refine our goals, in hopes of exceeding expectations and delivering the best <em>Halo</em> experiences possible,” said the studio.</p> <p>“Throughout our day, we look to your suggestions, your art, and even your memes as constant reminders of our dual commitment to faithfully stewarding <em>Halo’s</em> legacy and forging its future. Since&nbsp;formally announcing&nbsp;<em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em>&nbsp;in October, we’ve been floored by the response from both longtime fans and Halo newcomers. We’re humbled by the trust you’ve placed in us, and we can’t wait to introduce new players to the iconic story of&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> for the first time in 2026.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Strange Jigsaws'</em></a><em> </em>description is simple: It's a game of strange jigsaws where you solve strange jigsaws. I started playing it recently after seeing <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hownottodraw.bsky.social/post/3m4gmqikclc2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some posts</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m4qamjr7n22h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about it</a> on social media. Created by <em>20 Small Mazes</em> puzzle master FLEB, <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> has about 50 or so puzzles—not necessarily <em>all</em> jigsaw puzzles, but using jigsaw pieces. It opens right into the chaos: "Solve jigsaws. Find the golden pieces. Open the door."&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Designer FLEB opens <em>Strange Jigsaw</em> with a chaotic mess of multiple jigsaw puzzles, signaling that this game is more than just a puzzle simulator. Pieces are everywhere, and it's prudent just to start moving pieces around to test out what they do. Among the first few puzzles, I'm to put pieces together to power a magnet and a computer, respectively, which opens up <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> puzzles even further. Then, trouble! A puzzle is on fire, and <em>Tetris</em>-shaped blocks of water are the only thing that can put them out. On the newly-powered computer, more puzzles: A clever captcha-inspired puzzle game, then a burger-building logic puzzle that reminded me of <a href="https://aftermath.site/is-this-seat-taken-impressions-indie-direct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Is This Seat Taken?</em></a><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><figure></figure><p>There are jigsaws that are highly meta, using pathways controlled by <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>' menu systems. There are darling puzzles illustrated by the designer's seven-year-old daughter, puzzles with missing pieces that must be recolored using a paint fill tool, puzzles that need a screwdriver to solve. <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> is expertly designed, but what makes it truly fantastic is the earnest playfulness of it all: FLEB loves puzzles, and that's obvious. He writes in <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>' Steam description that this game is harder than his last, <em>20 Small Puzzles</em>, and that may be true—but the puzzles here don't feel cruelly hard. Some are hard, but designed in a way to make them feel doable and intentional. I might not understand a puzzle now, but the game reassures me that I will be able to, later.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>There are so many moments in <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> that I want to talk to you about, but unfortunately for me, the person writing about this game, talking about them will sully the experience for you. <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> is just $5, so I urge you simply to try it out yourself. But if you need a taste of what designer FLEB is out, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2570630/20_Small_Mazes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>20 Small Mazes </em>is free</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, you can look to YouTube: The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FLEBpuzzles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designer FLEB has a YouTube channel</a> in which he talks about his games and others. It's just as delightful as his games. His recent videos include a retrospective on <em>20 Small Mazes</em> and a newly designed puzzle called <em>Touching Grass</em>, which is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmndrQW5AmA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naturally built out of grass</a>. Over the past 10 years—with a seven year break somewhere in there—FLEB has made videos about all sorts of different puzzles. If this doesn't convince you that FLEB knows puzzles, I don't know what will.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio"><h3>Dispatch Brings Back The Halcyon  Era Of Online Water Cooler Talk</h3></a><p>Adhoc Studio’s superhero choose-your-own-adventure feels like a fun hole-in-the-wall, word-of-mouth-recommended spot that the gaming communities haven’t had in a minute</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kodansha-studios-akira-anime-live-ation-chloe-zhao-nicolas-gonda"><h3>Somehow, The Threat Of A Live-Action Akira Refuses To Die</h3></a><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is Akira</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/solve-these-strange-jigsaws-steam-puzzle-games]]></content:encoded>

Comparing this number against collectibles such as mounts is a good metric here, with more than a thousand mounts earnable in-game and only a few dozen from the shop.”</p></blockquote></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/816714/world-of-warcraft-player-housing-hearthsteel-currency]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>No Man’s Sky</i> continues to grow and expand with the seemingly endless updates developer Hello Games continues to toss out for free. Lately, user-made ships have been all the rage. The range of options now available for a custom spacecraft has led to some <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">stunning original creations</a> as well as tributes to classic ships from other science fiction franchises. But Tosk, an <i>NMS</i> fan who’s been playing the game since launch, recently took to recreating not a ship, but a key location found in Studio Ghibli’s classic animated film, <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i>. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/KJJ8VJE3SmU">Tosk’s video walkthrough</a> of his creation here:</p>

  <p>I recently DM’d back and forth with Tosk to get a sense of the challenge of finishing a project like this in <i>No Man’s Sky</i>. Like any worthy endeavor, all it takes is time, perseverance, and, perhaps most importantly, inspiration. In this case, that was Tosk’s love of Studio Ghibli films. “<i>Totoro </i>is my favorite,” he told me. “It’s like a warm nostalgia blanket! Such a sweet innocent story of childhood wonders. It [also] has environmental themes but doesn’t hit you over the head with it.”</p>

The first challenge? Finding the right planet. Tosk scouted <i>NMS</i>’ procedurally generated universe far and wide for not just a suitable habitat, but one adorned with the right “Ghibli green,” he told me. That search alone took a month. “I did find about three or four sites that were possibilities,” he said, “but to find the right combination of color flora and a spot where I could build on flat land with a cave nearby a hill above it took a long time.” Just a random paradise planet wouldn’t do.</p>

 <p>Once he found that picture-perfect world, Tosk said it took around 100 hours to put the base together, much of it made “using free placement, so it was put together by hand, which takes a long time. It came in at just under 3000 parts, which is the build limit for uploading in <i>NMS</i>.” As it was done on PS5, no mods were used but, as he describes in the walkthrough video, there’s some “scale and color glitching” at work. He also “used the film a lot as reference for the floor plan, but the layout changed a bit from shot to shot, so I had to take a few creative liberties.”</p>

So I had to go back and rebuild a lot of it. I nearly gave up on it then, to be honest.”</p>

 <p>Thankfully, Tosk persisted. Unfortunately, due to an issue with the game right now, users can’t visit Tosk’s creation without him also being online and present in the area. But even when that issue is fixed, you’ll have to do some work to find Totoro’s location. The planet is in the Istentam galaxy, but Tosk has deliberately hidden the glyphs necessary to find it in his tour video.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">15 Amazing&nbsp;<em>No Man’s Sky</em> Ship Builds You Have To See</a></p> <p>I was curious what project is next for Tosk. “I’ve been thinking about making the floating island from <i>Laputa: Castle in the Sky</i>,” another Studio Ghibli joint. “But to be honest,” he said, the <i>Totoro</i> build “has taken so long that I might just play for a while.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">And is that... Grunt?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect fans have uncovered fresh artwork teasing the franchise's next game, which will feature the krogan race in the middle of a civil war. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clues hidden in today's blog post from series boss Mike Gamble have been decoded by fans to uncover a hidden link on BioWare's website — and on it, our first piece of new Mass Effect teaser in two years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a> artwork shows a battle-scarred krogan firing his gun, flanked by an army of helmeted krogan warriors. The title of the image is simply: "Civil War." </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/07/mass-effect-krogan-civil-war-jpg-adapt-1920w-1762543620424.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mass Effect artwork showing the krogan civil war. Image credit: <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/mass-effect/411826207">BioWare.</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect fans are already poring over the image, and there's a couple of obvious observations right off the bat. Firstly, the hero krogan in this image is <em>old</em>, the kind of old we've already seen in Mass Effect Andromeda, like your ancient krogan squadmate Drack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn't Drack, which begs the question — who are we looking at? The armor color is reminscent of Grunt, your Mass Effect 2 squadmate who was then just a youth. Though for him to be looking as old as Drack (who was over 1,000 years old!), it might suggest the next Mass Effect is similarly more than 1,000 years into Mass Effect 3's future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From what we've seen already — a lightly-wrinkled Liara — this seems a little too far. Asari and krogan both have long lifespans, but Liara looked hundreds of years older, rather than 1,000. Could this be a new character? Or... could it just be Wrex? Mass Effect 1's fan-favorite krogan squadmate was already middle-aged in the original trilogy, so with another few hundred years on top, he may now be as old as Drack was in Andromeda.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The next big question, of course, is why are the krogan in the middle of a civil war? This one is perhaps easier to answer, when considering the range of endings Mass Effect 3 offered for the krogan race.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krogan have always been portrayed as warlike and expansionist, though they have suffered from infertility due to an artifical plague which saw their numbers dwindle and homeworld left almost barren. But Shepard can choose to aid their cause and reverse the plague's effects — with results then dependent on your other choices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect 3's myriad of endings range from the krogan pursuing a peaceful renaissance, to their new-found numbers supercharging fresh calls for galactic expansion. Perhaps the next Mass Effect game will offer a storyline that caters to all of the above by suggesting two factions emerging: one which wants that expansion, and another that seeks to curb the race's worser instincts? Whatever's going on, it seems all is not well with the krogan, hundreds of years after the Reapers were destroyed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps we'll hear more of the krogan civil war within Amazon's upcoming Mass Effect TV series, which we learned today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-wont-retread-shepards-story-and-will-be-set-after-the-original-trilogy">will be set after the events of the Mass Effect trilogy to avoid rehashing Commander Shepard's story</a>. BioWare also used today to reassert that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-and-bioware-remain-committed-to-next-mass-effect-game-and-yes-romances-will-return">remained committed to developing its next Mass Effect project, with publisher EA onboard for the future of the franchise</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Rockstar Games recently delivered some difficult news for people eagerly awaiting the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>--the game has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">pushed back yet again</a>, this time to November 2026. The delay also has implications for a potential PC version that history says will follow... eventually.</p><p>After the delay was announced, people flocked to the <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official GTA 6 website</a> to see if anything was new. Players found that it had been updated to display the new release date, which is about six months later than the previously scheduled May 2026 date. With GTA 6 delayed for its currently announced platforms, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, that means the wait is getting even longer for the expected PC release to come later.</p><h2><strong>Rockstar's history of PC releases</strong></h2><p>GTA 6 is expected to release on PC, in part because of the significant business opportunity, but the PC editions of Rockstar's releases do not often release day and date with their console counterparts. This is part of how Rockstar operates. Earlier this year, Rockstar owner Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said, "Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms."</p><p>"We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/" data-ref-id="1100-6529346">he said.</a></p><p>Back in November 2024, Zelnick said PC will continue to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-on-xbox-series-s-im-not-really-worried-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527625/" data-ref-id="1100-6527625">"more and more important" for Take-Two's business going forward</a>, saying that supporting PC "isn't complicated for us."</p><p>How long does it usually take for Rockstar to bring its games to PC? It depends. For GTA V, the game had its initial release for PS3 and Xbox 360 back in September 2013. It came to PS4 and Xbox One in November 2014, and then landed on PC in April 2015. PC players waited about 18 months.</p><p>For Rockstar's next big game after GTA 5, Red Dead Redemption 2, the wait wasn't as long. The game launched for PS4 and Xbox One at the end of October 2018 and landed on PC about a year later in November 2019. The first Red Dead Redemption, meanwhile, was initially released for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2010 and didn't arrive on PC until the end of October 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-is-finally-on-pc-more-than-14-years-later/1100-6527449/" data-ref-id="1100-6527449">representing a wait of more than 14 years.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4598824-screenshot2025-11-07at3.08.55%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4598824" data-ratio="0.56102003642987" data-width="1098" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4598824-screenshot2025-11-07at3.08.55%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4598824"></a><figcaption>There it is.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4598824-screenshot2025-11-07at3.08.55%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><h2><strong>Why is GTA 6 not on PC at launch?</strong></h2><p>So why isn't GTA 6 coming to PC at launch? No one from Take-Two or Rockstar has gone on record to explain why. But a former Rockstar developer said the studio aims to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-dev-explains-why-gta-6-pc-port-isnt-coming-at-launch/1100-6519893/" data-ref-id="1100-6519893">"prioritize what sells."</a></p><p dir="ltr">"The PC version is kind of the version that's in the background, that is running the two versions and building them," former Rockstar developer Mike York said. "There's always a PC version of the game, but it's not polished and it's just kind of feeding the other games and making them work."</p><p dir="ltr">GTA 6 might not be Rockstar's next release, as the company is rumored to be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-xbox-switch-2-port-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6536035/" data-ref-id="1100-6536035">ports of Red Dead Redemption 2 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2</a>, and they could launch later this year. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">GTA 4 remaster</a> is also said to be in the works for a 2025 release.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond these rumored projects, Rockstar continues to grow and evolve GTA Online, the popular online mode for GTA 5. In fact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-now-included-with-gta-membership/1100-6535997/" data-ref-id="1100-6535997">the game was just added to GTA+</a>, so subscribers can play that game as part of their membership, and <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GTA 5 is rumored to be returning to the PS Plus game catalog soon. </a></p>
