<p>"It would be a very good business decision"</p>

<figure><a title="Tekken 8 Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1ca4b8d5119e/tekken-8-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 release schedule is already home to a bunch of ports that never would have been possible on Switch 1, and we can only assume that this will continue for the years to come. One title that's yet to be eyed for the new hybrid is <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tekken_8">Tekken 8</a>, but that's not to say that the game's director hasn't thought about it.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-switch-2">Eurogamer</a>, director Katsuhiro Harada confessed that Bandai Namco's latest fighter on Switch 2 is "an interesting option, and not totally off the table," but it sounds like it would be far from a simple port. "It would require a lot of work on the game to get it running on that hardware," Harada continued.</p>
<p>"From a business standpoint, [Switch 2] is doing quite well, so it would be a very good business decision if you're trying to get a bigger audience," the director mapped out, "but the amount of work that would have to be done on the game makes it not a very easy decision".</p>
<p>It's far from any kind of confirmation (Harada even emphasised that there is "nothing to announce" on this front right now), but it's interesting to hear these pros and cons, nonetheless. As for introducing the game to a bigger audience, that can only be a good thing for Tekken 8 at the moment. It's still under some serious heat after its <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/tekken-8-season-2-patch-notes-are-here-insane-buffs-have-fans-asking-if-its-an-april-fools-joke">Season 2 patch</a> resulted in heavy backlash and even boycotts from the fans, and the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/05/tekken-8-ps5-fans-miffed-by-latest-content-roadmap">latest content roadmap</a> didn't go down much better.</p>
<p>Maybe all that work for a Switch 2 port would be worthwhile, then? We'll just have to wait and see. The good folk over at our sister site, Push Square, gave Tekken 8 a whopping 9/10 in their <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/tekken-8">review</a>, calling it "the franchise at its bombastic best", so we sure wouldn't mind getting in on that action too...</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-franchise-could-bring-back-%E2%80%98social-stealth%E2%80%99.1269243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A popular feature from the Assassin’s Creed franchise, ‘social stealth’ could make its return in one of the next games in the series. </p>



<p>Since Assassin’s Creed: Shadows has now been released, players are already waiting for the next big game in the series. Recently, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatened to sue</a> the actor of Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag over a slip-up with the remake details. Now, the developers have revealed that an old feature hasn’t been ruled out from the franchise, which means we could see it in one of the next games. </p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-devs-reveal-why-it-didn-t-have-social-stealth">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Devs Reveal Why It Didn’t Have Social Stealth</h2>



<p>During a recent AMA segment with the devs on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/hi_were_simon_andr%C3%A9_and_luc_developers_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/assassinscreed</a> subreddit (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/ubisoft-explains-why-assassins-creed-shadows-ditched-social-stealth-but-says-its-likely-not-gone-for-good-our-stealth-team-chose-to-put-100-percent-of-their-energy-on-the-moment-to-moment-tactical-shinobi-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), the developers were asked whether “social stealth elements” could make a comeback in the future. Additionally, they were also asked why social stealth was not a part of Assassin’s Creed: Shadows. </p>



<p>The developers responded, stating that for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the stealth team had put “100% of their energy on the moment-to-moment tactical shinobi experience”, which is why there was no room to add social stealth. However, that “does not mean that Social Stealth is gone from the Assassin’s Creed franchise”. </p>



<p>For those wondering, social stealth was a feature seen in previous Assassin’s Creed games, where the protagonist could hide from his enemies and pursuers by blending in with the crowd. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-assassins-vs-templars-conflict-is-the-core-pillar-of-the-ac-series">Assassins Vs. Templars Conflict is the Core Pillar of the AC Series </h2>



<p>During the same AMA segment, the developers added that the Assassins vs. Templars conflict has always been a core pillar of the Assassin’s Creed series. With Shadows, they planned to establish their protagonist in the setting before expanding on the conflict. Now that it is done in the main game and through the Critical Role story drop, players should expect “more deep dive in this conflict in the near future.”</p>



<p>In other news, the Claws of Awaji DLC is scheduled to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release this September</a>. Additionally, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-rating-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. What are your thoughts on social stealth returning to the Assassin’s Creed franchise? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

Microsoft denied any knowledge of this use, and said it did not "build or consult" with Israel surveillance, but has reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/09/microsoft-israeli-military-azure-cloud-investigation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">opened an internal investigation</a> regardling the claims.</p><p>Arkane said it is joining an existing petition from Microsoft employees called No Azure for Apartheid, which has laid out specific demands including: termination of all ongoing or future contracts with Israeli Occupation Forces, transparent disclosure of ties to the Israeli military including an independent and public audit of its contracts and services, an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and free speech and safety for pro-Palestinian employees. Microsoft employees and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-11/microsoft-investors-prod-company-over-work-with-israeli-military?sref=uE15RiYa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shareholders</a> began pressuring Microsoft for increased transparency in spring. In May, an employee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669362/microsoft-employee-protest-build-conference-satya-nadella" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interrupted Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella</a> during a keynote with a "Free Palestine" protest.</p><p>For its part, in a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/15/statement-technology-israel-gaza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post in May</a> Microsoft claimed that it conducted both internal and external reviews and "found no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza." At the same time, though, it acknowledged that it does not have visibility into how customers use its software.</p><p>Since the start of the BDS boycott, the situation in Gaza has worsened. A <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165517" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">United Nations report</a> published in late July says that food security experts warn of a "worst-case scenario of famine" unfolding in the region, as "widespread starvation, malnutrition and disease" are driving an increase in hunger-related deaths.

            <p>Speaking to Eurogamer, producer of the new<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-6"> Virtua Fighter project</a> Riichiro Yamada revealed that there's an extraordinary level of excitement around the upcoming 3D fighting game at SEGA, especially among the company's older generation.</p>
<p>When asked about the internal mood regarding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a>'s revival, Yamada stated (through a SEGA-provided translator): "In SEGA, the upper executives are very fond of Virtua Fighter, they feel it's very special to them because it has a very long history with SEGA."</p>
<p>This extends to the chairman of SEGA Sammy, Hajime Satomi. According to Yamada, he's taken special interest in the project: "He is also very fond of Virtua Fighter. He's very high up in the company and a very important guy, so even though he participates in so many meetings he doesn't really say anything. But when it comes to Virtua Fighter meetings he actually gives detailed comments because he's very fond of the series."</p>

<p>This excitement, according to Yamada, has trickled down to even the younger folks at the company that are unfamiliar with Virtua Fighter: "There are a lot of people in upper management who are really looking forward to this. Thanks to this hype from the upper management people, the younger generation who may not have touched or been handling Virtua Fighter before, a lot of them are very interested in being involved with the new project. [I] feel with SEGA's history, Virtua Fighter holds a very special place in every [developer]."</p><p>This should come as no surprise. Virtua Fighter is a legendary video game franchise that has sadly fallen by the wayside in recent years. It was revolutionary back in the arcade days, pushing the genre forward with a no-frills simulation of hand-to-hand combat. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-in-engine-look-at-next-virtua-fighter-game-revealed">That's why the Virtua Fighter Project reveal was so exciting</a>, a technically staggering in-engine look at a game sticking to its roots.</p>
<p>In fact, Virtua Fighter only really survived in some forms in recent years thanks to the RGG games! In the Yakuza series, Virtua Fighter games could be played within the in-game SEGA arcades. This, according to Yamada, acted as a spark to get a new Virtua Fighter going.</p>
<p>"The RGG team were very good at AMD stuff, and that's why they wanted to implement those elements. But at the time, Virtua Fighter fans were a little bit sad that in order to play Virtua Fighter they had to play an RGG game. So because there was no environment where we could actually provide a Virtua Fighter game on its own to those fans, there was a feeling that we had to provide something for those fans.</p>
<p>This revival has been in discussion for a while within SEGA, but hadn't got the green light until recent years. Yamada elaborates: "The new sequel for Virtua Fighter has come up within Sega many many times, but there was approval or green light to proceed. So as for when we started to think about a new project, it's been a very long time."</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/13/turning-it-up-jackbox-party-pack-11-is-the-noisiest-bundle-yet/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After taking a year off to do other things last year and really try to find themselves, Jackbox Games is now newly revitalised and transformed with….. well, it’s Jackbox Party Pack 11. Yeah, it turns out they were pretty good already and probably just needed a bit of a break to recharge their creative batteries. Having gone hands on with the collection, Jackbox Party Pack 11 has put the smutty mags back under the mattress and is back to its usual self with five new games and a little bundle of new and experimental ideas.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Jackbox Party Pack 11 | Coming This Fall! | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/INZkUPwgB6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It starts with Doominate, a game about ruining prompts –&nbsp;think “add butts to a movie title to make it worse” but expanded into a Jackbox game. There’s multiple rounds of back and forth, first with generated prompts, then player created prompts that are passed around, and finally with a reused answer which you then have to “fix”, though you can obviously double down on the joke, because this is a laughter and popularity contest.</p>



<p>Cookie Haus is another riff on the drawing game, though this time with differently shaped cookies as your canvas, and with layers of coloured icing and sprinkles as you paint. What’s nice is that you get a choice in this, so if you’ve got a prompt and idea to paint Batman, and you get a particularly pointy cookie, you’re off to a good start already, and the ability to rotate the cookies can also bring some more creative options. Of course, you can always go route one with line art and words, if you’re bad at art or bereft of funny ideas.</p>

<p>Doominate and Cookie Haus feel like good twists on the traditional Jackbox oeuvre, but from here it starts to get a bit special.</p>

<p>The standout new concept, though, comes in the form of Hear Say. Using the microphones on your devices, it’s all about using your voice and sounds that you make to illicit a laugh from your friends. It starts from the avatar selection screen, where you get to record a little sound for your character, and it’s already amusing to have everyone making little yips, bloops and growls, seeing the duck, cloud, black void and more animate on the TV screen. The game puts a healthy dose of post-processing on any sounds you make, adding reverb, pitch shift and more to make them a little bit abnormal, or even more abnormal than you intended.</p>
<p>That’s then immediately applied to the game itself, where each prompt has you recording sounds and uttering phrases directly into your phone, and at roughly the same time as everyone else. It can lead to an absolute cacophony of sound, or a bit of recognition between people with the same prompts, and befuddlement as you hear something out of context. Voice an unpopular opinion, or shout what you would before jumping into a pool, make the clickety clack of a keyboard, or the buzzer sound for a wrong answer in a gameshow.</p>

<p>Naturally, then it’s off to compare everyone’s answers and get people to vote on their favourites, while little mini-games ramp up the noise-making chaos by having sound and volume be the input that you’re all using, but by far and away this game’s best trick is then taking those sounds and applying them to little video clips. I’ve no idea how the game did it, but seeing “But he’s literally just a dog!” applied to a clip of a lawyer, before shifting to a dachsund in prison garb being locked away saying “Well, I’m off to bed” is just… well, it’s one heck of a coincidence. It’s just as amusing to see duck noises overlaid on a rave, or a buzzer sound for someone clicking on an unsubscribe button.</p>

<p>I get the feeling that Hear Say is going to be the in-person gem of this party pack, but Suspectives is definitely the most personal and intimate, best for a group of family or friends that know each other relatively well. Before the game starts, everyone is presented with a little seven question survey, six of which are multiple choice, while one has a text field.</p>
<p>As a crime is committed, you’re then tasked with figuring out who dunnit, using those survey answers and interrogation sessions between players to try and narrow down the person. That’s best when you might have a little clue about what your playing group might think about theme parks, what their irrational fears are, and personal interests. And it means that, as the interrogation cycles around and more clues are opened up, the criminal needs to be a bit weaselly, bend the truth and answers, where their deceit could potentially be revealed, and other people’s innocence could be confirmed.</p>

<p>Rounding things out is Legends of Trivia, twisting the traditional trivia game into a co-op RPG-like adventure, where you battle enemies, gather loot and go shopping with your gotten gains. You’re off on a gallant quest with turn-based battling, but instead of picking attacks and abilities, you’re answering trivia questions to determine whether you attack or not. It’s an interesting twist, not least because it is so cooperative, where previous Jackbox trivia games have split people up individually or pitted teams against one another. Because of that, there’s more chatter about what the answers might be, strategy over potentially splitting your votes when you’re unsure and more.</p>

<p>Jackbox Party Pack 11 is sure to be on many a friend group’s wishlists for later this year, and after going hands on with the collection, this could be a really special one. There’s good twists on familiar formats, the social deduction game has real potential for close-knit groups, but for me it’s all going to about yipping and making weird noises in Hear Say.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6ceb4229de9c2/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ahead of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>'s launch tomorrow, reviews for the wheelchair basketball game have dropped, and... they're <em>pretty</em> mixed. Focusing on 3v3 matches and fully controlled using the Switch 2's Mouse Mode controls, Drag x Drive is a relatively unique multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>But, looking over most reviews of the game, that might be <em>all</em> it is. The game is currently sitting on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/drag-x-drive/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">60 Metacritic score</a>. That number will likely change over the coming days as more reviews roll in, but from day one, it looks like this isn't quite a slam dunk.</p>
<p>We had a pretty good time with the game, with the indomitable PJ O'Reilly scoring it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">7/10</a>. Essentially, online multiplayer with friends is a great time, but there's not a <em>ton</em> going on otherwise. Here's a little snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Taking everything into consideration, though, and for the not-enormous price point, there's more depth here than I expected. Drag x Drive feels like a proper attempt to give us something fresh, in the same sort of vein as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a> back on Switch 1. If you get into its groove, you will get your money's worth."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186124 @ 1755100467 -->
<p>But we're not the only voice out there, so let's see what others have to say about this mouse-controlled game.</p>
<p>Starting with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/drag-x-drive-ninendo-switch-2-review/">TheGamer</a>, who also scored the game a 7/10 (well, a 3.5/5), the outlet notes that "It’ll take some time to get used to its oddball pacing and unorthodox mechanics", but that it's a good time overall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Short match times, a small court, and precise team composition make every single round a nail-biter, and that’s mostly when playing with bots during the review period. I cannot wait to see what sort of casual and competitive communities form around this game and what tricks they’re able to pull with its mechanics that someone like me could only dream of."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving down the scale a little, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/drag-x-drive-review">IGN</a> awarded the game a 6/10, criticising the game's "drab personality" and aesthetic, but praising the actual gameplay, outside of a lack of variety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I respect the ambition to try something entirely new, even though I recognize the result is definitely not going to be for everyone. But despite its surprisingly good gameplay, Drag x Drive is pretty disappointing in terms of the content outside of its three-on-three online matches, with a lack of variety and enticing unlockables you’d expect from a game like this."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sticking with that lack of variety, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/drag-x-drive-review">Inverse</a> also scored Drag x Drive a 6/10, calling Mouse Mode's implementation "ingenious", but outside of matches, the game is lacking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unfortunately, this rock-solid foundation is underserved by some dull minigames, bland presentation, and a lack of proper single-player modes. While this dearth of content can be excused by the game’s $20 budget price-point, one can’t help but wonder what could have been."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/drag-x-drive-review/">GamesRadar+</a> feels similarly, but scored the game slightly lower at 2.5/5 — shout-out to those "Drag x Drive jeans". The game is fun, but there's "not enough to keep me competing for the long haul", comparing it (unfavourably) to ARMS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But compare Drag x Drive's fairly featureless, almost Toonami-like customizable characters with the sheer sauce on display with designs like Spring Man, Kid Cobra, or the truly iconic Twintelle and it's no contest. It doesn't help that Arms' fighting managed to carefully balance its control scheme with tactical plays that packed a punch."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/drag-x-drive">PCMag</a> also settled on a 2.5/5, highlighting that "How much you enjoy Drag x Drive will come down to how much you enjoy this design decision" and that the gameplay can suffer from "tedium":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A game like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> understands that motion controls shine when you use them to act out dramatic and exciting moments, like swinging your tennis racket or golf club. Similarly, I loved getting nothing but net when shooting the ball with Drag x Drive's motion controls. But the boring, laborious movement mechanics sully the experience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of you likely checked out the Global Jam that took place over the weekend, so you likely have a good idea of what to expect when Drag x Drive releases tomorrow. We'll have to see the kind of player base that builds up around the game and its online matches.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're excited to play Drag x Drive in the comments</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PUBG Is Ending Support for PS4 and Xbox One, Will Only Be Playable on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S after November 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/pubg-ending-ps4-xbox-one-support-only-playable-on-ps5-xbox-series-november-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pubg-is-ending-support-for-ps4-and-xbox-one-will-only-be-playable-on-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-after-november-2025.1269195/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PUBG Studios has <a href="https://www.pubg.com/en/news/9005">announced</a> that it will be ending support for the PS4 and Xbox One versions of PUBG, as it moves to only supporting the game on current-generation PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles alongside the PC version. </p>



<p>"<em>As mentioned in our 2025 roadmap, we've been preparing to transition PUBG Console to current-generation consoles,"</em> a statement on the PUBG website reads. "<em>Starting November 13, 2025, PUBG Console will be supported only on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</em>."</p>



<p>The studio calls the transition "<em>necessary</em>" as part of its efforts "<em>to provide our players with a more stable gameplay environment on console and ensure a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It weighs heavily on us to deliver this news to our console players who have enjoyed PUBG on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for so many years. We still vividly remember the epic battles, the heart-stopping moments, and the camaraderie that brought us together. We are deeply grateful for every moment you've spent with us over the past eight years. This was not a decision made lightly. It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of PUBG Console.</em>"</p>



<p>The post goes on to explain that players on PS4 and Xbox One will have their accounts preserved and secure after November 13, 2025, ready for those players when they log back in on a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S device. And thankfully, logging back in is all you'll need to do to pick up your account, with "<em>no separate transfer process required</em>."</p>



<p>PlayStation players will, however, have to download the specific, PS5-native version of PUBG to play the game, since the PS4 version will still appear as a separate app and not be playable.</p>



<p>Once the transition has been made to current-gen platforms, players on PS5 can expect to play PUBG at a base 1440p resolution and 60FPS, while PS5 Pro players will get a full 4K/60FPS experience. On Xbox Series S, both 1080p/60FPS and 1440p/30FPS will be supported, depending on the experience you want, while Xbox Series X players will enjoy a 4K/60FPS experience.</p>

            <p>Whack out your not-at-all-weird-to-own spreadsheet of teenagers with incredible left feet, a Football Manager thing has happened. Namely, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 2026</a> has been announced by developers Sports Interactive, with a quick trailer. There's no release date as of yet.</p>
<p>If you recall, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2025">Football Manager 2025</a> ended up being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2025-has-been-delayed-until-march-2025-to-avoid-compromising-our-usual-standards">delayed</a> and then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled">cancelled</a>, the studio admitting at the time that "the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be." Refunds were issued to folks who'd pre-ordered the touchline-prowling sim, and the devs shifted their focus on to Football Manager 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Cue today's announcement and trailer, the latter of which is about a minute of in-engine footage showing people doing foot-to-ball things as a Premier League match gears up for kick off. Amusingly, after multiple shots of Football Manager logos nicely stitched into seats, the various slabs of Premier League set dressing have the logo of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC</a> on them. I assume this is just for licensing reasons, but it's still a bit of a funny visual.</p>
<p>Anyway, Sports Interactive say this snippet "gives just a taster of what to expect following the move to the Unity engine", adding that "FM26 promises to take players on a journey to define their footballing destiny with our most immersive and visually rich Football Manager experience yet. The potential for storytelling is redefined by taking players closer to the heart of the beautiful game."</p>

<p>That certainly sounds a lot like the sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2025-will-be-for-the-first-time-in-decades-a-true-sequel-say-sports-interactive">massive overhaul the studio had planned to deliver with Football Manager 25</a>, so here's hoping the extra time has given them plenty of breathing room to get all the crossbars and whistles working as they should.</p>
<p>For now, all we can do is stay tuned for more updates Sports Interactive promise are coming down the line. Let's face it, probably via a spreadsheet about a defensive midfielder from the Danish second division.</p>

              <p>Good morning, or good afternoon, or good whenever you are reading this. <em>Kotaku’s</em> Morning Checkpoint is back once more to share some news and other stuff with you. Today, that includes a wild story about a gaming convention gone wrong, more information on maps in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, a new union at Blizzard, a look behind the scenes on <em>Superman</em>, and an interview with the madman who hosts Dropout’s <em>Game Changer.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>A gaming convention in Tampa, Florida was a complete shitshow</h2> <p>The National Gaming Expo, held last week, sounds like it was a horrible and mostly empty experience, according to a new <em>IGN</em> report. According to many who attended, the convention was poorly managed, had very little to offer, and inside the convention center were animals to pet instead of new games to play. Seriously. <em>IGN</em> reports that fans paid $40 for a single-day ticket or $90 for the weekend, and now everyone wants their money back. Also, the guy allegedly in charge of running the whole event has a history of putting on crappy conventions and recently got out of prison in the Dominican Republic. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-actor-says-disastrous-florida-gaming-convention-put-the-con-in-comic-con">You should read the full report because it’s truly a wild story.</a></p> <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em> dev says bigger maps are included in the full game</h2> <p>The lead producer on <em>Battlefield 6,&nbsp;</em>David Sirland, <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954994293934055475?">replied to a fan</a> complaining that the maps featured in the recent beta were too small and confirmed that the game contains bigger maps beyond what was featured in the playtest.</p> <p>“Speed is a factor of map size,” said Sirland on Twitter. “We picked these maps to make sure we hit the full-octane version of <em>Battlefield</em> on the head – and made everyone see we can handle that too. Large maps exist, and the tempo scales accordingly; you’ll be able to see soon enough!” The <em>BF6</em> beta returns August 14 for one final weekend.</p> <h2>Over 900 Blizzard developers are now unionized A new version of the <em>GTA: The Trilogy</em> arrives on Switch</h2> <div role="listitem" data-qa="virtual-list-item" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1755093591.754199" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1755093591.754199"> <div role="document" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true"> <div dir="auto" data-qa="message_content" role="presentation"> <p>Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team is the latest part of the company to form a union. <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union#:~:text=These%20workers%20will%20be%20the,industry%20after%20Microsoft%20acquired%20Activision">According to a press release</a> from the Communication Workers of America (CWA), Blizzard’s in-house cutscene creators voted “strongly in favor of union representation” with the CWA. Parent company Microsoft has already recognized the union. These devs join over 3,000 unionized workers at Microsoft-owned studios, <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">which include the <em>Overwatch 2</em> development team</a>, as well as groups within Zenimax and Raven Software.</p> <h2><em>Stalker 2</em> is upgrading to a new version of Unreal Engine 5</h2> </div> <p>On August 12, <em>Stalker 2</em> developers GSC Game World announced plans to update their popular post-apocalyptic open-world shooter to a newer version of Unreal Engine 5, which should help the game run better and be more stable on more PCs.</p> <p>“Our main mission in the near future is upgrading the game to Unreal Engine 5.5.4,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525350789598676383?l=english">said the devs in a Steam post</a>. “This will bring new features and tools to make the Zone an even better place, but more importantly, bringing the latest Unreal Engine 5 optimizations will lead to better stability and performance.” Other changes mentioned in a new road map include tweaks to the game’s “A-life System,” new missions, a reworked stamina system, and new night vision devices.&nbsp; GSC is aiming to bring these changes to <em>Stalker 2</em> by the end of the year, but admits that upgrading to a new version of UE5 could cause some delay.</p> <h2>A new version of the <em>GTA: The Trilogy</em> arrives on Switch?</h2> <p>Rockstar Games may have quietly released a new version of its controversial <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> remaster collection for the Nintendo Switch. Previously, the collection required users to download <em>Vice City</em> and some updates for<em> GTA III</em> and <em>San Andreas</em>. Now, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/gta-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-physical-release/">however, people have spotted what could be a new physical version</a> of the <em>GTA Trilogy</em> that appears to lack any warnings on the front indicating you’ll need to download the games. However, until people actually get their hands on this supposedly new version, we won’t know for sure.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-sam-reich-interview-season-7-comedy-design-2000617191">We interviewed Sam Reich, <em>Game Changer’</em>s host, about how the show creates its games</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/aol-dial-up-shut-down-youve-got-mail-sound-internet-2000617225">AOL dial-up is ending, reminding you that, hey, AOL dial-up service was still a thing in 2025</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/chuck-e-cheese-arcade-snow-day-stuck-fire-department-burbank-2000617154">A woman got her arm stuck in a machine at Chuck E.

To me, this is two people who care a lot about what they are making, who don’t agree on a point about it, and both are passionately trying to solve the problem. I love it. In a time when so many movies feel sterile, it’s nice to see some passion behind the camera.</p> </div> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>You can hardly log onto <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-concord-marathon-smoothly-2000616270">your PlayStation 5 or PS4</a> these days without seeing a banner for another massive 75 percent off sale. Sony’s latest discount event is pegged to Gamescom 2025, which kicks off next week, and it has some surprisingly decent deals. If you’ve been pining for a hundred hour RPG to whittle away the final days of summer, you’re in luck. A bunch of them are currently 50 percent off.</p> <p><a href="https://t.co/WRVXMm2mRb">The current Gamescom sale</a> is running through August 27 and, I’m guessing, will probably be refreshed after the expo gets underway, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-2024-e3-microsoft-gaming-show-1851638178">starting with Geoff Keighley’s Opening Night Live showcase</a> on August 19. In the meantime, here are the best RPG discounts that are currently part of the sale:</p> <ul> <li><em>Bloodborne</em>: $10 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em>Persona 5</em>: $10 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>: $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers</em>: $8 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Fell Seal: Arbiter’s Mark</em>: $7.50 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Valkyria Chronicles 4</em>: $10 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age</em>: $20 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Tales of Arise</em>: $20 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em>Soul Hackers 2</em>: $15 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Grandia HD Collection</em>: $20 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em>Dungeon Encounters</em>: $12 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Unicorn Overlord</em>: $24 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Star Ocean: The Second Story R</em>: $25 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em>Persona 3 Reload</em>: $32 (55 percent off)</li> <li><em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>: $27 (55 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>A couple of things to note for those picking through this list. Is <em>Bloodborne really</em> an RPG? It’s primarily an action game, sure, but you also fight things to level up your stats, so obviously yes. It’s an all-timer and deserves to be in everyone’s library, and this is about as cheap as it gets. Personally, I prefer <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> to <em>Persona 5</em>, though the latter is a bit more dense, fully-featured, and less grindy. <em>Final Fantasy XII</em> is one of my favorite late-night summertime hangs, and <em>The Zodiac Age</em> remaster is excellent. It’s structured very much like a single-player MMO, so you can mostly just run around exploring the beautiful world and its incredible soundtrack while your party does all the tedious auto-battling.</p> <p>Then there are some picks that are more borderline. I wasn’t impressed with the<em> Chrono Cross</em> remaster on the whole, <a href="https://kotaku.com/chono-cross-radical-dreamers-sale-discount-ps5-cheap-1851499822">but some updates improved things since it released</a> and at $8 it’s a perfectly good way to experience a PS1 classic with modern convenience features. <em>Fell Seal</em> is also a bit of an acquired taste. It’s one of many indie clones of <em>Final</em> <em>Fantasy Tactics</em> floating around out there, but arguably the strongest in terms of its deep, customizable job system and actually challenging combat. And at just $15, <em>Soul Hackers 2</em> is also a bargain. While not nearly as good as the rest of the Atlus RPGs on this list, there’s plenty of weird, old-school PS2 charm to admire in it. It’s a sequel to 1997’s <i>Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers</i> and, by God, does it play like it: Archaic, grindy, and repetitive. But if you want a meaty dungeon crawler with unique, stylish vibes, it hits just fine.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has revealed that two panels centered around The Division 2 will take place at Gamescom next week. The team will be hosting a meet-and-greet event alongside two presentations designed to reveal the future of The Division 2, including the ‘big Division 2 project’ that Ubisoft has just started talking about.</p>



<p>It was also noted that The Division: Resurgence, the all-new mobile game that’s in development now, will be showcased.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-big-division-2-project">What is the Big Division 2 Project?</h2>



<p>I’ve got no idea, but thanks to a new social post from Ubisoft, I know we’ll get more clues next week when Gamescom unravels.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is what the team said about what’s coming to Gamescom from Ubisoft, where The Division 2 is concerned:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Division 2 will be at Gamescom this year, with two panels and two meet-and-greets.</p>



<p>Our first panel will take a look at the creative and art direction behind Battle for Brooklyn, and we’ll also give you a small glimpse at what’s coming next for the seasons.</p>



<p>In our second panel, we’ll talk about how your feedback is shaping The Division 2, share some updates about The Division: Resurgence, and reveal more about the ‘big Division 2 project’. We’ve only just started teasing it, but we’re really excited to give you an update.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you can’t make it to Cologne (hint: we’ll all be there!), you can watch both panels online across Ubisoft’s channels.</p>



<p>Battle for Brooklyn was released earlier this year and was met with positive sentiments from the community. After more than six years, The Division 2 is still alive and well, and judging from Ubisoft’s comments, it’s about to get even better.</p>



<p>Are you going to tune in to see what Ubisoft is teasing for The Division 2? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/into-the-unwell-is-like-a-chaotic-3d-cuphead-in-roguelite-form</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/into-the-unwell-is-like-a-chaotic-3d-cuphead-in-roguelite-form.1269162/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I think fans of combat-dense action-roguelites will have to splash around when they dive Into the Unwell. Its elasticky, sometimes grim slapstick humor brings a one-of-a-kind energy to a familiar-playing game, but looks aren’t the only thing that makes it stand out. Combat has a distinctive weight that translates the old-timey animation style into gameplay well. Mix that with the myriad ways you can customize your run, from individual perks and traits for both weapons and characters, and overarching upgrades that give you a sense of overall progression, and this peculiar brawler becomes surprisingly difficult to put down. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A regular round of Into the Unwell is pretty recognizable to anyone who’s played a run-based roguelite before. You travel from zone to zone, smashing enemies and collecting loot, before moving on to a new zone to do it all again. Each zone type has its own predictable end goal, like guaranteed health bonuses or a larger than normal cache of currency (teeth here) as the prize at the end. Pass through enough zones, and you’ll meet a snarling boss primed to send you back to where you came from.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I liked the key ways that Unwell breaks up this formula a bit. For one, each zone has the potential to have small platforming puzzles for chances at extra loot. I’d look away from the path to the next fight and see a precariously tower of cans and wonder, “Can I climb that?” and the answer would be “yes” rather often. There’s also a smattering of special rooms, like a bar where you can spend your teeth on health and items, a mosquito’s shack where you can buy items with your health instead, or a slot machine where you can risk all your money for lavish rewards.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Visually, everything is teeming with a chaotic liveliness.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The most arresting and stand-out thing going on in Unwell is the way it looks and sounds, of course. The rubber hose, Fleischer Studios-style animation that had a sort of revival after 2017’s Cuphead is brought into the third dimension here, and is maybe even more evocative and energetic. From the three playable characters I could choose from – a mangy two-toned cat, a duck in despair, and Rooster that has seen better days – to the various inanimate objects given life as enemies like angry truck tires, everything is teeming with a chaotic liveliness.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Into the Unwell Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also smothered in dark humor. The overall story involves your character struggling with their mental health, and a very Satan-like creature pretending to be a doctor encouraging you to dive deeper into your consciousness, given physical form as the Unwell, to get to the root cause. The environments of the dungeon are built from and teeming with vices. Beer cans create walls and towers around the stages. Junk food makes up the bulk of the fodder you’ll brawl with. Balancing a game that's fun on top of what can be a thorny subject is a challenge that the developers find worth taking up. They told me that these characters are all struggling with something, and that struggle is often in conflict with a person who is powerful and constantly fighting with their demons to regain agency over themselves. A person can be having a tough time and still have fun and tell jokes. Unwell is sort of a manifestation of that inner struggle, and its quirky personality is a byproduct. “We want to give power to the powerless.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mid-30s style lends a sort and snap and weight to the combat of Unwell. Heavy attacks have a satisfying “stretching and pulling against gravity” feeling that adds that sense of power that makes these blows really land. Each weapon exploits this style in their own ways as well, while also falling into archetypes that will be easy to identify for avid action gamers despite being odd objects to slay your personal demons with. A big lint-covered lollipop as your sword, two pairs of fishbones as dual blades, a big creamsicle as the large great weapon, etc. Smashing enemies with these accumulates a stagger meter on them, which stops them in their tracks for a brief time when filled. They can then be kicked, either into walls, other enemies, or off of the platform and into the watery abyss below – an option I never passed up when it was available.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/12/ss-b31c88a59ce48447d19cf5425439686a1e94cc8f-1920x1080-1755042819434.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides light and heavy attack strings, weapons have unique special abilities that can really help keep the escalating numbers of baddies at bay. The mop, a normally jabby longer range spear-like number, can make a copy of itself to stick in the ground, bending and snapping itself to hit enemies in its range while you handle business elsewhere. The big creamsicle lets you spin like a depressed BeyBlade, sucking enemies into your vortex to get slapped around. All of these unique abilities can be altered or changed entirely, and passive traits can be earned during runs making each one potentially different in meaningful ways.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Enemies that spawn on each of the Unwell’s islands aren’t particularly difficult individually, but in groups they can really challenge your reflexes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Enemies that spawn on each of the Unwell’s islands aren’t particularly difficult individually, but in groups they can really challenge your reflexes. There's always one or two priority targets that you want to scramble to eliminate first while the rest of the fodder gets in your way, like a trashcan that can give its allies damage-absorbing shields or a tube of toothpaste that launches mortars from a distance. I don’t think any mob of these villains ever killed me after my first run or two, but they are relentless and very good at wearing your health down to the point where, when it's time to face the boss at the end of the run, you’re well on the back foot.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/12/ss-688c88914902ad95b89be00e59adc0a24c20d3ed-1920x1080-1755042840725.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I liked that each island is filled with not only enemies, but stuff to kick around at them. Using bundles of dynamite as ranged attacks or bear traps to hold bad guys in place was a fun tactical layer, especially since all of these little environmental traps can catch you as well. There isn’t a huge variety of these items, but the ones that do litter the ground can be useful additions to any offensive gameplan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you clear each island you get a reward – usually related to currencies, stat buffs, and perks. Perks come in a lot of forms and can help direct how you play through the run pretty dramatically, thanks to most of them being pretty impactful and smart combinations of them being truly game changing. Many of the strongest ones revolve around perfect dodges and strikes, which demand a bit of mechanical prowess to get the most out of, but lots of the more passive ones can make a noticeable difference to your run as well.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/12/ss-0330f0b51968ca3d9a0fd70e0255f34acbe51197-1920x1080-1755042852856.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The final boss of my build of Unwell was a giant bottle of hot sauce that filled the arena with fire, spawning ghost pepper minions, and sprayed gouts of flame from its top. It took me quite a few tries to nail down its patterns and to learn when I had optimum openings to strike back, but it was a great first look at how bigger battles could change the pace the game had established up to that point. I was disappointed that some of the things that I really liked about the regular monster fights weren't present at all here – there was nothing to hit the bottled bastard with beside my weapon, and the staggers I had built up didn’t stop its momentum at all. It was still a fun time but it was unclear how perk set ups built around stagger effects worked on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Standing out from the crowd won’t be a problem for Into the Unwell, whose bouncy, Felix the Cat-meets-drugs and alcohol style is quite unlike any roguelite you’ll find available right now. The magic is more than skin deep though, the springy combat can be modified in lots of ways through character and weapon selection, as well as perks and talents that can be unlocked on a run to run basis. A steady drip of platforming side paths and interesting event rooms break up combat in fun and sometimes funny ways as well, adding personality and rewarding curiosity in ways other games in the genre don’t. The slice I played was only a small piece of a bigger, grim and silly picture that I hope to see more of after it leaves Closed Beta.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/into-the-unwell-is-like-a-chaotic-3d-cuphead-in-roguelite-form]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Pearl Abyss announced today during its <a href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/pearlabyss/pearlabyss.php?c=pearlabyss&amp;y=2979" rel="nofollow ">latest earnings</a> call that its upcoming action-adventure game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crimson-desert/">Crimson Desert</a> has been delayed to Q1 2026. The game had already been delayed once before, after initially being planned for 2021 before getting bumped to the latter half of this year. During the investors call, Pearl Abyss also took the time to explain why a second delay has taken place, noting that "longer-than-expected timelines" left them with little choice.</p><p dir="ltr">"Currently, Crimson Desert has been in the process of voiceovers, while also carrying out tasks such as console certification in preparation for its release," the developer explained, noting that it still plans to feature an open-world build of the game at Gamescom and PAX West this month. It went on to say that the delay is "due to longer-than-expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voiceovers, console certification, and other launch preparations … Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at ensuring success on a meaningful scale."</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Pearl Abyss didn't have any more specific details on a release date than Q1 2026, but said that a release date reveal shouldn't be expected at Gamescom. It plans to announce a release date at a "more appropriate time based on business considerations."</p><p dir="ltr">Crimson Desert was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crimson-desert-gameplay-revealed-releases-in-2021/1100-6485399/">initially announced back in 2020</a>, conceived as a prequel to Pearl Abyss' MMO Black Desert Online, but over the course of its development it was decided it would be a single-player game instead. If you're curious about what Crimson Desert looks like in action, GameSpot attended a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crimson-desert-might-have-the-most-realistic-in-game-physics-ive-ever-seen/1100-6530297/">hands-off preview</a> earlier this year, coming away particularly impressed with its in-game physics.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Football Manager 26 Officially Revealed, Coming "Soon"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-26-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-26-officially-revealed-coming-soon.1269114/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sega and developer Sports Interactive have announced&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26</em>, the next iteration in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>series of management sims.</p>

<p>The game was revealed earlier today via a new trailer titled "Guess Who's Back", in which we get to see some footage of the Premier League trophy, as well as several players who will presumably be included in the game.</p>

<p>The trailer is pretty short, so we don't get to learn much about&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26</em>&nbsp;by its conclusion, but the game's very existence will likely be enough to get&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>fans excited, albeit tentatively given the franchise's recent history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-26-announced-premier-league.jpg?itok=D0iJeLqz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-26-announced-premier-league.jpg?itok=tSJ1whnr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Football Manager 26&nbsp;</em>is officially going ahead.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Football Manager 26&nbsp;</em>exists largely thanks to the fact that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>doesn't, at least in its current form.</p>

<p>Back in June last year,&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update" rel="nofollow">was unveiled</a>, but it was met with immediate consternation from fans regarding some of the features Sega would remove, which included the Create-a-Club system, as well as Touchline Shouts and other more minor systems.</p>

<p>Initially, <i>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</i>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date" rel="nofollow">set to launch in November</a> last year, but it was subsequently delayed following what Sports Interactive referred to as a "difficult development cycle". This drew further fan ire, since the delay would potentially mean that the game would miss the league window, which would make newer rosters and transfers irrelevant.</p>

<p>Following that, and the news that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be getting a data update</a> ahead of the&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>release, Sega eventually made the call to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">cancel&nbsp;<em>FM25&nbsp;</em>altogether</a>, instead choosing to focus on its successor.</p>




<p>We'll likely learn more about&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26&nbsp;</em>in the coming weeks, including a first look at its gameplay and (hopefully!) a timely release date as well. For now, you can keep your eyes glued to the game's <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a> for further updates.</p>

              <p>The second-best thing about being a <i>Mario </i>fan is that bad <i>Mario </i>games are exceedingly rare. But the first best thing about being a <i>Mario </i>fan is that <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> exists. Whew, what a damn game. It’s a franchise entry that manages to be both wondrously inventive and comfortably familiar, setting the bar almost insurmountably high for any platformer that dares to follow it over the next few decades.</p> <p>As of right now, <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> remains my favorite platformer of all time—and if you’ve played it, there’s a reasonably high chance you already agree. If not, however, you may be looking to see what our favorite plumber’s most ambitious game is all about. And with that comes curiosity about how long it may take to see things through. Well, I’ve got some good news for you: It’s beefy! Let’s take a look at just <i>how</i> beefy. But first, let’s talk about whether or not you can expect a better experience on the newer Switch 2.</p>  <p>We have great news for you if you’re hoping to enjoy <i>Odyssey </i>on the Switch 2. Via a free update for the Switch 2, <i>Odyssey</i> has never looked better. In its original presentation on the first Switch, handheld mode perhaps suffered the worst, with an incredibly low resolution that made for a rough image at times. The stronger hardware of the Switch 2 combined with the new update makes for a dramatically better experience. The framerate is also more reliable in the game’s busier, open-world city environments. Take a look at the game in motion here:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Switch 2 Enhanced Super Mario Odyssey: A Night &amp; Day Improvement" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x1LHbNiErbo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>How long does it take to beat <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i>?</h2> <p>Mario’s globe-spanning journey not only features an absolutely staggering amount of collectibles to find, but it also throws unique mechanics and thrilling new features at you faster than you can say “Wahoo!”</p> <p>But how much of this you want to experience is largely up to you. You won’t need to collect all 999 Power Moons or every purple coin in each world to complete <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i>, but it’s all there for you to chase down if you want to. <b>For a basic run-through, though, you’ll only need around 12-14 hours</b>.</p> <p>If you’re like me and need to earn every costume in the game (they’re all awesome) and see that Power Moon counter hit one number below a thousand, you’ve got a whole lot more game to see. <b>Fully completing </b><b><i>Super Mario Odyssey</i></b><b> can take upwards of 40 hours</b>—perhaps even longer for those who take things at a leisurely pace or struggle with some of its more challenging sequences.</p> <p>Whether you just want to check it out casually or take things all the way to 100%, you need to check out <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> right away. I give it my highest recommendation. And you can trust me. My dad works at Nintendo.</p> <hr> <p><i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> is available now on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

              <p>Oh, thank goodness! <em>Alien: Earth</em>, Disney’s megabucks TV series set just before the events of the original&nbsp;<em>Alien</em> movie, is just brilliant. Showrunner, writer, and director Noah Hawley has created something truly special: a show that feels utterly built from the DNA of Ridley Scott’s earliest vision, but with the non-stop thrills of James Cameron’s <em>Aliens</em> sequel. And crucially, unlike every other film in the franchise since the first two, it remembers that this is a story about the hearts of the characters, rather than just the events happening to them. Here are my thoughts on the first two episodes.</p> <p><em>Alien: Earth</em> makes a very interesting opening decision. You might think, given how the&nbsp;<em>Alien&nbsp;</em>sequels have all flailed under comparisons to the first two films, that Hawley would want to immediately put his own stamp on the show. The creator of the extraordinary TV series <em>Fargo</em> and <em>Legion</em> has a distinct approach, so surely the smart move is to hit that hard as we begin? But no, a far braver choice is made. The opening few minutes of&nbsp;<em>Alien: Earth</em> are an astonishing recreation of Scott’s style, complete with a cynical and tired crew bantering around a table, sniping, mocking, talking over one another. Tensions and relationships are instantly established for the beleaguered crew you already know are about to die as their research vessel containing multiple alien specimens crash-lands onto Earth. It all looks and breathes like a perfect piece of 1970s science fiction. And in achieving this, the show immediately feels <em>right</em>. This is the&nbsp;<em>Alien</em> we love, not the weirdly incongruous blandness of <i>Covenant</i> or the dreadful misfires of <em>Alien 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alien Resurrection</em>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617445">© FX / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is then put into stark contrast by the events on Earth. While the crashing ship, the Maginot, is owned and operated by the Weyland-Yutani corporation, it crashes into a towering city owned by another company called Prodigy. Because, as we learn in the show’s opening banter on board the ship, the Earth in 2120 is controlled by four corporations, and it’s soon to be five. We learn that Weyland-Yutani owns North and South America, but we’re yet to be told about the rest–although we’re quickly introduced to the new force to be reckoned with, Prodigy. Created by the youngest-ever trillionaire, Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin), Prodigy owns at least a large city in New Siam and vast research island, and is about to make a major breakthrough regarding synthetics–the androids with the gooey white blood from those first films. Kavalier has developed a way to transfer the consciousness from pre-teen children into the bodies of synths, and as we join the facility on Neverland Island, Kavalier is preparing to try it for the first time, moving the mind of terminal cancer patient Marcy Hermit (Florence Bensberg) into an adult synth body, where she renames herself Wendy (Sydney Chandler).</p>

 <p>And yes, let’s pause to address all this Peter Pan business. Eeehhh, this TV show is about as close to perfect as you could hope for, but if I had to pick at something, it’d be this. It’s wildly heavy-handed (indeed, all the names are pretty painfully on-the-nose–“Kavalier” for our move-fast-break-things trillionaire, “Hermit” for our girl about to be moved into a new shell…), to the point where clips of the Disney cartoon are repeatedly shown and we even get Kavalier reading out loud from the book. She’s Wendy, it’s Neverland… good grief, we get it. They’re children who get to live forever, I guess? Except, of course, the point of the book is they stay children, but here they’re intended to mature into adults. It feels deeply cumbersome. But honestly, that’s my only complaint.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617447" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617447"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617447">© FX / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Prodigy rapidly moves ahead with transferring a bunch of dying kids into adult bodies, all now living under the mentorship of more traditional synthetic Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant), moments before the Maginot crashes into the base of two skyscrapers in Prodigy City. A search and rescue team of Prodigy employees is instantly dispatched, including a medic who happens to be Joe Hermit (Alex Lawther), brother to Wendy. And, of course, the alien specimens got out.</p> <p>What follows is a lot of extremely good, proper&nbsp;<em>Alien</em> business, or terrified humans with guns moving through dimly lit corridors that very probably contain monsters. It’s especially enjoyable here because so much is completely unknown. We know the Maginot was carrying Xenomorphs at many phases, from egg to Facehugger to full-grown Xenomorph XX121s, but we’re also aware there’s some fucking eyeball-with-tentacles thing in there, along with various other alien species we’ve never seen before. And while we’re left in no doubt that the Xeno is still the worst of the bunch, none of them seems vaguely friendly.</p>

 <p>But this is elevated by the show’s central, most abhorrent and chilling aspect: some super-rich 20-something just put a bunch of 10 to 12-year-olds’ minds into super-powered adult bodies, and then sent them into danger.</p>  <p>The body-swap between child and adult is a beloved formula, and almost always played for laughs. From&nbsp;<em>Big</em> to&nbsp;<em>Freaky Friday</em>, the notion is wrung for humor (even if you do get something as deeply troubling as <em>Big</em>‘s 13-year-old boy losing his virginity to an adult woman). So when you first see Marcy become Wendy, there’s that jovial sense to it. Firstly, she’s not going to die as a just-turned-12-year-old any more, and that’s wonderful, but also you’ve got an adult actor acting like a kid. At one point she grabs her boobs and declares how <em>weird</em> they are, how they move around while she’s running. The program is very clearly playing with those body-swap tropes, telling us how jolly this all is. After a bunch of the kids have been put into the adult synth bodies, there’s a wonderful scene in which they’re all sitting around chatting in a common area, a room of adult actors moving and talking like children. Jonathan Ajayi especially shines at this, his leg movements incredibly familiar for anyone with a kid with ADHD, but it’s all delivered without pantomime. It feels wrong, because body-swaps always feel wrong, but we’re being told how right it is throughout.</p>

 <p>But it’s so wrong! This isn’t being done with families around them, or friends from their previous lives, and they certainly don’t have appropriate adult supervision or counselling. They’re experiments, their former terminal diagnoses and separation from their families clearly designed to make them disposable should something go wrong. Wendy’s compulsion to find her older brother once more seems to test the adults, unsure whether to prevent it for the project’s secrecy, but ultimately driven to let it play out purely for the test results. It’s grotesquely mercenary, and the second episode switches to endlessly reminding us of this, as we see these adult shells acting like utterly terrified kids in the face of alien danger.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617448"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617448">© FX / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Almost everything is shot perfectly. In fact, <em>Alien: Earth</em> feels like the final obliteration of any difference between film and television, its massive-budget movie quality and ultra-widescreen format giving it the sense of being cinematic at all times. The only sop to traditional television at any point is a peculiar flashback to Marcy’s childhood, which sticks out like a sore thumb among the rest of the format. It would be incredible to be able to go watch these weekly episodes on the big screen, and god knows, movie theaters could use the custom.</p>

 <p>What’s also so exciting is to think where this program could be going next. The claustrophobic events in the ruined ship and destroyed apartments make up most of the second episode, but clearly this is soon to head outside. There’s surely no chance of containing this incident, and it’s going to be extraordinary to see how the corporations address the outbreak. The other aspect to think about is the words from the first episode’s opening text.</p> <p>In the future, the race for immortality will come in 3 guises:</p> <blockquote><p>Cybernetically enhanced humans:&nbsp;<em>Cyborgs</em></p> <p>Artificially intelligent beings:&nbsp;<em>Synths</em></p> <p>and</p> <p>Synthetic beings downloaded with human consciousness:&nbsp;<em>Hybrids</em></p></blockquote> <p>While the program has already featured all three, and we see the terrifying capabilities of Weyland-Yutani cyborg Morrow (Babou Ceesay), there’s yet to be any sense of how the various corporations are looking to ensure their creations become the dominant force. It’s surely to come.</p> <p>In&nbsp;<em>Alien: Earth</em>, Hawley et al have done something that seemed so impossible for the last 40 years–combine the terror of <em>Alien</em> and the thrill of&nbsp;<em>Aliens</em>, while keeping humans as the focus of the story. Not even Ridley Scott could come close in his two glum prequels. But in FX’s TV show, it’s all there, with an amazing eight more hours of it to come.</p>

<p>The start date and times for the Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta are vital if you want more action. The first beta destroyed all expectations, literally, on its debut, so let’s check out the Week 2 Beta and all-new content included.</p>



<p>Well, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-impressions-battlefield-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta</a> has been worth the wait. EA and Battlefield Studios have put their blood, sweat, and explosions into BF6. The first week of the beta blew up in more ways than one by bringing in over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 players</a>—destroying CoD’s all-time Steam peak.</p>



<p>We’re not done yet, though. The Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta is back and bigger and better than before. This hub has everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-week-2-beta-start-amp-end-dates">Battlefield 6 Week 2 Beta Start &amp; End Dates</h2>

<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 beta starts on August 14 and wraps up on August 17.</strong></p>



<p>You get nearly 100 hours of pure bombastic Battlefield 6 action if you want it. The open beta might be the final chance you get to play <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> before launch.</p>



<p>Battlefield Labs can be considered the game’s alpha period. This makes August a definitive beta test. With only a couple of months to go until the official Battlefield 6 release, I’d advise you to make the most of the Week 2 Beta.</p>



<p>See you on the Battlefield—revive me if you see me! </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-week-2-beta-start-times">Battlefield 6 Week 2 Beta Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>It’s confirmed that the Weekend Two Battlefield 6 Beta starts at 08:00 UTC—the same as Week One.</strong></p>



<p>I’ve already extensively covered the nature of Battlefield 6’s Week Two beta and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when you can play it again in a separate guide</a>. It includes more specific regions and time zones to help you out.</p>



<p>But yes, it’s the same start and end times as the first BF6 open beta. This should make your life a lot easier.</p>

<p><strong>You need to have played Battlefield Labs, be an EA Play Pro member, or use the Battlefield 6 website to gain access to the Week 2 Beta.</strong></p>



<p>One of the most commonly asked questions about the BF6 beta is about how you can take part. Many mistakenly believe you need to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-have-to-pre-order-battlefield-6-to-play-the-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order Battlefield 6 to play the open beta</a>.

<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-6-weekend-2-new-content">All Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 New Content</h2>

<p>The first thing to note is that all content from Week 1 is back! Siege of Cairo, Liberation Peak, Breakthrough, etc, are all here for you to enjoy. The second week could have left it there, but Battlefield Studios has thrown more toys in the playbox.</p>
