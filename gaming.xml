<p>ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky update 1.17.0 is now live, and it introduces the new map condition, new ARC enemies, weapon buffs &amp; nerfs, and much more. </p>



<p>Some details of this update have been revealed ahead of its release, including the new map condition that introduces <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hurricane-map-condition-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hurricanes</a>. However, the update is much more comprehensive than that, adding new balancing changes for popular weapons, items, and crafting, bug fixes, and much more. Learn everything new in update 1.17.0 below.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-1-17-0">What’s New in ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky Update 1.17.0</h2>



<p>Starting with the highlights, the ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky Update 1.17.0 adds a new Hurricane Map condition, which was mentioned above. There’s a new ARC threat to look out for, with two new unique machines that players can face: the Firefly and the Comet. Additionally, there’s a new project to build a Weather Monitoring System, a Free Raider Deck: Surgeon, and a new area has been uncovered in Dam Battlegroud, the Controlled Access Zone. Lastly, the game has also added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-giving-arc-raiders-players-what-they-want/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facial hair</a> with this update. </p>



<h2 id="h-weapon-and-item-balancing-changes-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-1-17-0">Weapon and Item Balancing Changes in ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky Update 1.17.0</h2>



<p>Regarding balancing, the developers have revealed that many players reported a “shadow buff” in update 1.13. The developers fixed it in 1.13.1, but it inadvertently impacted the game’s weapon input buffers. The developers want to fix that now while maintaining some middle ground between what already exists. The developers are also looking to balance between low-tier and high-tier weapons. The balancing changes have been made to the following weapons: Stitcher, Kettle, Venator, Jupiter, and Aphelion.</p>



<p>Additionally, there are changes to Item &amp; Crafting, tons of content &amp; bug fixes, and an update to Anti-Cheat that players can check out in the patch notes below: </p>

<h2>Anti-Cheat</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>When we shared our last update about tackling unfair play, we didn’t fully convey the complexity and scale of what goes into cheat detection. Our defenses operate on multiple levels: some checks are simple and definitive, while others are behavioral and data-driven and evolve over time. We also leverage broad gameplay telemetry and machine learning techniques to spot patterns that aren’t obvious at first glance. These methods take longer to develop, must adapt as game systems change, and don’t always offer instant certainty the way blunt software detections can.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve recently taken action against different exploits and we are further tightening our rules and stepping up enforcement. Serious infractions now carry stricter consequences. Strong detections will receive permanent bans right off the bat, while others will receive a temporary suspension and a single chance to correct the behavior. Recent updates to Family Sharing have strengthened our ability to curb misconduct and streamlined the removal of bad actors from the game. We are preparing to launch a systematic manual review of ban appeals. The game is young and the volume of telemetry is enormous, but this process ensures every case is handled with care as we continue to learn quickly and invest heavily in the precision of our enforcement tools.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Shrouded Sky update for ARC Raiders is here, and there’s a lot to unpack. From the new Hurricane Map Condition to the two new ARC threats, there’s a heap of content to explore. However, one of the highlights is the brand new Project, the Weather Monitor System.</p>



<p>Shani needs you to help her build the system so Speranza isn’t caught off guard by weather anomalies like the Hurricanes in the future. Don’t worry, it’s not all done out of the kindness of your heart, as there are plenty of rewards on offer too. </p>







<p>If you want to know what items to look out for on your next raid, then you’re in the right place. Follow this guide to see every requirement and reward tied to the Weather Monitor System Project in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, along with how long you have to complete it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-the-arc-raiders-weather-monitor-system-project">How To Complete The ARC Raiders Weather Monitor System Project</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The first stage. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five stages to the Weather Monitor System Project in ARC Raiders, with each one having four requirements to fulfil.</strong></p>



<p>Frustratingly, you cannot cycle through the stages to see what you’ll need down the line, and since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shrouded Sky update</a> is so fresh, only the first stage will be viewable for many. However, some raiders are already making swift work of the Project, and they’ve shared the requirements for each stage—as well as the rewards.</p>



<p>As more stages are unveiled by the fanbase, Insider Gaming will be quick on the trigger to update the article.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hurricane-map-condition-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/hurricane-map-condition-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hurricane Map Condition, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>With that said, here’s every stage of the Weather Monitor System Project, including the requirements as well as the rewards:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Project Stage</th><th data-align="center">Project Requirements</th><th data-align="center">Project Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 1: Atmospheric Pressure</td><td data-align="center">– 25x Plastic Parts<br>– 15x Metal Parts<br>– 5x ARC Alloy<br>– 3x Oil</td><td data-align="center">– 5x Durable Cloth<br>– 5x Great Mullein<br>– 5x Antiseptic<br>– 3x Vita Shot</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 2: Sunlight</td><td data-align="center">– 1x Snitch Scanner<br>– 3x Wires<br>– 3x Sensors<br>– 1x Comet Igniter</td><td data-align="center">– 10x Processor<br>– 5x Advanced Electrical Components<br>– 3x Zipline<br>– 1x Raider Hatch Key</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 3:</td><td data-align="center">—</td><td data-align="center">—</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 4:</td><td data-align="center">—</td><td data-align="center">—</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 5:</td><td data-align="center">—</td><td data-align="center">—</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Project Completion</td><td data-align="center">Complete all 5 Stages</td><td data-align="center">– Anemometer Backpack Charm<br>– 250x Raider Tokens</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-arc-raiders-weather-monitor-system-project-end">When Does The ARC Raiders Weather Monitor System Project End?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is it worth it? Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, there is no expiry date on the Weather Monitor Display Project in ARC Raiders.</strong></p>







<p>That means that, theoretically, you can take as long as you’d like to grind through the Project and earn the rewards. It’s in line with the ongoing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy Display Project</a>, which also carries over progress between the Expedition resets. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders Map Condition Tracker</a></li>
</ul>



<p>However, that doesn’t mean that an end date won’t be added to the Project in the future. It could be months away yet, but it might be best not to leave it too late, especially if you’re interested in that bulk of Raider Tokens.</p>

            <p>Excitement around <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a>'s launch next week seems to finally be a thing, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">this weekend's "server slam" aims to convince extraction shooter enjoyers</a> on the fence. Ahead of it, Bungie has outlined a frankly impressive effort regarding networking and security features that will be implemented from the get-go.</p>
<p>On 23rd February, the Sony-owned developer <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonsecurity">shared a meaty blog post</a> that dives deep into what players can expect from the game's many layers of security and key network features. Needless to say, all of them are crucial to ensuring a smooth and fair online experience, but it's often that shooters targeting a competitive crowd don't launch in a robust-enough state.</p>
<p>First, Bungie has made Marathon's dedicated servers "fully authoritative on key combat and looting actions," meaning any "correction" of suspicious behaviour won't impact other players and their experience. It's combined with "client-side prediction and rewind" to ensure actions feel immediate. Moreover, it's promised that servers "carefully track each bullet to its target even with high packet loss." Consistent hit registration at launch in an online shooter? Imagine that.</p>
<p>When it comes to wall hacks and other cheats that might reveal the position of key items and players, a Fog of War system limits the regions of a map that individual player clients have knowledge of. "It also helps keep your position hidden from other players' clients." This isn't enough to guarantee full protection from hacks alone, but it's part of the game's arsenal to combat cheaters. On top of that, the security stack was rebuilt "from the ground up" for this game, and that will work alongside the familiar BattlEye solution.</p><p>There's also the matter of one's Internet connection going down mid-run. Each online game handles such events differently. In the case of Marathon, "you can reconnect and continue playing the run" like in other match-based shooters. "If connection recovery fails due to an issue with Bungie's server or network infrastructure, we will attempt to return the starting gear to all impacted players."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bungie</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Perhaps the biggest shocker comes near the end of the list of features, where Bungie states "anyone found to be cheating will be permabanned from playing Marathon forever." Yeah, no second chances. So, make sure you're not running anything suspicious while playing it.</p>
<p>In any case, the veteran online shooter developer, admits that "product security is never fully solved" and says it'll continue to invest in systems and infrastructure for as long as the game stays alive.</p>
<p>As an extra, we now also have confirmation Xbox players will automatically get <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-isnt-just-favouring-playstation-players-with-exclusive-cosmetics-xbox-and-steam-players-promised-bonus-loot-too">exclusive gun charms</a> when the game releases on 5th March:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Marathon players on Xbox Series X|S will automatically receive the exclusive Emerald Clutch Weapon Charm and Emerald Catch Weapon Charm when Marathon releases on March 5. <a href="https://t.co/lOpdNfle71">pic.twitter.com/lOpdNfle71</a></p>— Marathon (@MarathonTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2026099758838816820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

            <p>Not long after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-new-vegas-van-buren-remake-mod-revelation-blues-has-a-new-name-and-a-second-demo-dropping-soon">changing their project's name</a> from Fallout: Revelation Blues to Fallout: The New West, the developers behind a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> mod remaking a cancelled Fallout game have settled on a release date for their second demo. The second publicly playable taste of this attempt to resurrect Van Buren - the version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> which was in development at Black Isle Studios before being cancelled in 2003 - is slated to arrive late next week.</p>

<p>This second demo will arrive on March 5th and, unlike the Burham Springs demo the New West team <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-new-vegas-mod-revelation-blues-demo-van-buren">put out last year,</a> it sets up an alternate New Vegas start which'll serve as the intro the the full mod. Interestingly, the modders look to have pulled that Burham Springs demo offline ahead of its follow-up releasing, with its <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/91191?tab=description">Nexus Mods page</a> noting that it's "currently not supported by the author(s) and/or has issue(s) they are unable to fix yet".</p>
<p>As for the upcoming demo, it'll drop you into Tibbets prison and likely task you with negotiating your release. I'm sure the robots and AI brains in change will conduct fair parole hearings.</p>
<p>"This experience offers players a new point of entry into the Mojave, beginning as a Prisoner under the observation of our watchful staff," developer Caveman6667 wrote in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/867445710622556230/867471933725212702/1475708718787199080">Discord announcement</a> of the demo date. "Within these walls messages are screened, rivalries simmer and order is absolute. Each block is designed with purpose and every decision shapes your record. Tibbets is one vignette within a much larger world currently in development. This demo represents the opening gate. Your participation, feedback, and continued vigilance assist in its refinement."</p><p>As noted on <a href="https://falloutthenewwest.com/faq">their website</a>, the modders plans once this Tibbets demo is out are to eventually release The New West's entire first act as a vertical slice. Once complete, the mod'll tell "the same broad story envisioned by Fallout: Van Buren, but restructured and expanded to form a cohesive, playable experience". Drawing on themes and story beats from design documents for the cancelled game which have since gone public, The New West's tale will take place in an "alternate continuity that predates and reinterprets the events of Fallout: New Vegas". Its creators are also hoping to mesh together the more modern experience of playing New Vegas with some classic Fallout-esque mechanics outlined in the docs.</p>
<p>If it achieves its goals, the project sounds like it'll form a nicely funky bridge between the original two Fallouts and spiritual successor New Vegas. Now, to look up ways to convince a Protectron guard to help me hop a very tall and possibly electrified fence in preparation for March 5th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 24, 2026, Quordle is the #1491 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games because it requires you to guess four words at once correctly, and you can do so on the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You are shown four equal lines reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-quordle-daily-game">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 25.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

		<p>Naming your game after one of the tastiest foodstuffs on the planet is one way to strike a tone. Named after the beautiful Indian pancakes you’ll find at the best street food markets, it’s immediately clear that tasty treats lie at the very heart of Dosa Divas. That said, the colourful wrapper created by Outerloop Games is hiding something even more delicious inside.</p>
<p><iframe title="DOSA DIVAS - Release Date Trailer - Steam Demo Out Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bogYlMcNb80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There aren’t many games that give you the option to pout, photo modes notwithstanding, but that’s exactly what we found during the opening of our hands-on with Dosa Divas. We’re pouting because our sister Amani refuses to cook us some food, and once she gives in, that’s our first quest here. Collect some ingredients. The difference in Dosa Divas is that we’re going to do it in a mech.</p>


<p>It’s one heck of a mech, too. Goddess has the front end of a yellow Tuk Tuk, an old-school folding canopy, and at least one stick-on paper flower. It’s awesome. AND, it flaps its arms like a chicken to double jump. You can forget Gundam; this is the coolest mech of 2026.</p>


<p>Samara and Amani are the Dosa Divas, former restaurateurs turned Spirit-mech pilots, and who are able to enter the Preparation Realm to craft food and consumables through a series of mini-games. You select the ingredients – that’s a Bell Pepper here for the base, before added Basil for flavour. The pronunciation of “bay-zil” upsets me, but that’s the only wrinkle in an otherwise fun and tasty diversion.</p>
<p>The pair are about to set off on a road trip to see their parents – their first after Amani has been away for ten years – before they’re rudely interrupted by their other sibling, Lina, and her floating LinaMeals food billboard. Which she uses to insult the pair. Sam smashes the billboard up, and between that and a spot of sulking, it’s clear that a lot has happened, both in the last ten years, and between the sisters.</p>
<p>Perhaps most obviously, Lina has become a food-based overlord, controlling the populace with her LinaMeals and banning everyone else from actually cooking. She’s even got lawyers out and about to make sure everyone follows her rules. Fortunately, Samara and Amani aren’t about to let that stand, with a spot of turn-based combat coming into play whenever you’ve got someone standing in your way.</p>

<p>This is turn-based combat in the vein of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Expedition 33</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-review/">Paper Mario</a>, rewarding extra damage or defence if you can time the right button press with the action on screen. I really think that this has become my favourite feature in turn-based games, keeping you on your toes and giving you some much-needed interaction during battles.</p>
<p>The culinary influence continues into combat, whether that’s Sam using a massive Karahi wok to pummel enemies or needing to match your attacks to the enemies’ food weakness. There’s a handy readout like in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/octopath-traveler-0-review/">Octopath Traveller</a>, so you can easily remember that they’re weak to spicy or sour attacks, and just like Octopath, there’s also a boost function that lets you add extra attacks to your chosen action. It all comes together really well, and if you’re a fan of modern turn-based combat, Dosa Divas is doing it right.</p>

<p>Dosa Divas also looks and sounds absolutely brilliant. Its chunky, vibrant art style brings bags of character to the world, and everyone in it, with a real penchant for slightly off-kilter food-based visual gags and details. That’s all ramped up by funky, rock-infused riffs that are melded with more traditional Indian tones. The exceptional vibes are less surprising when you find out it’s coming from Outerloop Games, the Washington-based, minority-led team behind the incredible Thirsty Suitors and Falcon Age, and they’ve brought that same spirit to bear on Dosa Divas.</p>
<p>There aren’t many games that immediately lodge themselves in your psyche in the way that Dosa Divas has. Perfectly struck turn-based combat, killer art direction, and a sibling rivalry that’s enslaved the world set the tone for what looks to be one of 2026’s most intriguing indie releases.</p>
<p><em>Dosa Divas is launching on 14th April across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 1 &amp; 2 and PC, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4316300/Dosa_Divas_Demo/">check out a demo now on Steam</a>.</em></p>

            <guid>1444507</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Xbox</strong> founder and creator <strong>Seamus Blackley</strong> has just released <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an explosive interview to GamesBeat</a>, in which he doesn't mince words against <strong>Microsoft</strong>'s current strategy and also shares his opinion of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly appointed Xbox CEO</a>, <strong>Asha Sharma</strong>. According to Blackley, who first came up with the idea of a Microsoft console back in 1999, her mandate will be the same as a palliative doctor, ultimately sunsetting the whole division as Microsoft refocuses on its new core AI business.</p>



<p><em><strong>Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren’t the core AI business, is being sunsetted</strong>. They don’t say that, but that’s what’s happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, <strong>her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night</strong>.</em></p>



<p><em>[...] The natural consequence of the focus on AI is that AI abstracts every problem from the minds of the executives who believe in it. We’re abstracting the problem of games as well. <strong>There’s a core belief, and you can see it in what Satya said, that AI will subsume games like it will subsume everything</strong>. The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI. That’s what you’re seeing here.</em></p>



<p><em>[...] It would have been shocking if they had somebody in there in a meaningful role who was passionate about games, passionate about the creator-driven business of games, because it would be in direct conflict with everything else Microsoft is doing. <strong>Microsoft is a company that is now about enabling its customers by enabling AI to drive things. That’s at odds with the auteur model of any art, but specifically of games</strong>. Microsoft doesn’t have the problem that Apple does, or that Netflix does, where they have an auteur-driven content model to manage. Games are the only place where they have a content business.</em></p>



<p>His fears are compounded by the fact that Asha Sharma <strong>previously served as president of Microsoft's CoreAI product portfolio</strong>. It doesn't help that some gamers <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-xbox-ceo-targeted-supposedly-using-ai-bot-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have already accused her of using an AI bot to interact with followers on X</a></strong>, though she rejected those accusations, and she previously stated that she doesn't want to flood the Xbox ecosystem with "soulless AI slop".</p>



<p>Xbox gamers have been mostly worried about Microsoft sunsetting its console hardware business, <strong>which is definitely a more real concern</strong> given dwindling sales and the multiplatform strategy. At this stage, it seems a little premature to think about the whole division being axed, though of course, it could still happen at some point in the future. For now, though, Microsoft <strong>is still planning to release a new Xbox console</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">possibly next year</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>In case you missed it, Friday saw news arrive of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-gaming-head-phil-spencer-is-retiring-replaced-by-an-ai-exec-who-promises-no-soulless-ai-slop">substantial corporate reshuffle at the top of Microsoft's gaming division</a>. CEO Phil Spencer was revealed to be retiring at the same time Xbox president Sarah Bond was revealed to have resigned, leaving new boss and former president of Microsoft CoreAI Asha Sharma to don the crown of green plastic.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IkpYeERHeWF6NUwiLCJwIjoiL3RlY2gvODgzMDE1L21pY3Jvc29mdC14Ym94LW5ldy1jZW8tc2hha2V1cC1ub3RlcGFkIiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMjkwNjAwLCJpYXQiOjE3NzE4NTg2MDB9.getJ-3kspePX7CrVmely9uWHy0nEaJuj6YCKKbJMCfU&amp;utm_medium=gift-link">The Verge</a> has now offered a bit more detail as to how all this chair-switching went down, and unsurprisingly, it reads like an account from a struggling kingdom whose ruler's just announced plans to abdicate.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the report, Spencer's spitting out to whichever planet retired execs live on had been in the works since last year, with "months of careful successor planning". All that careful planning ended in chaos when the announcement leaked a few days early on Friday, leaving Microsoft playing catch-up. Hence departing president Sarah Bond's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7430753683912531968/">lengthy and bland departure post</a> not arriving at the same time. </p>
<p>As to why Bond's departed, rather than ending up as Spencer's successor, the report paints a picture of her as taking the lion's share of the blame for a much-disliked '<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">This Is an Xbox</a>' marketing push/wider strategy, which has seen Xbox emphasise their presence across multiple platforms and devices. Basically, rather than trying to herd folks towards Xbox consoles, the company have experimented with shouting that you can play Xbox games through apps on PC, handhelds, phones, and tellies.</p><p>The Verge report this campaign "offended many Xbox employees internally", and has subsequently been questioned in the face of Microsoft's decining hardware revenue. Now, we get to the bit of the report which to me reads most like the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/story/_/id/44736507/lakers-luka-doncic-not-spoken-mavs-gm-nico-harrison-says-criticism-dallas-painful-want-talk-back">sort of thing</a> sports teams put out to control the narrative if, for example, behind-the-scenes drama between execs and star players requires a public scapegoat.</p>
<p>The report cites most current and former Xbox employees as being "relieved that Bond is leaving Microsoft", with more than one source alleging she's "been tough to work with, and built a team structure that meant if you didn’t follow the vision or questioned it, you were out". That said, Bond's ability to strike up relationships with companies and devs has gotten good reviews.</p>
<p>As the report notes, Bond was implementing the 'This Is an Xbox' strategy/ads while operating under Spencer's leadership, so it's noteworthy that she appears to be taking most of the flak for it. While the clandestine nature of machinations at behemoths like Microsoft likely means we'll never truly know who had the most hand in these calls, Bond being judged in stronger terms than the retiring senior exec she was once <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-happened-to-xbox-president-sarah-bond-amid-phil-spencers-retirement-and-asha-sharmas-promotion-long-term-protg-resigns">tipped to replace</a> - amid a lot more <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/2026002196375195891">positive eulogising</a> of his time at the top, and after years of being PR-spun as a relatable gamer-boss - is a bit eyebrow-raising.</p>
<p>That's not to say Bond - who, unlike Spencer, wasn't mentioned in the corporate email memos of Microsoft big boss Satya Nadella, new boss Asha Sharma, or newly promoted exec Matt Booty - didn't have a large hand in strategy, or behave in the way the Xbox staffers cited by The Verge claim. It all just seems rather convenient to pile the outgoing regime's failures at her door, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">a rough few years for Xbox</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, new CEO Asha Sharma's reportedly facing concerns from some staff over her AI background, and whether her tenure'll see the company move away from consoles for good, with both being things she moved to reassure folks on in her email memo upon taking the gig.</p>
<p>So, there you go. A new face is on the throne. The old regime have been shown the door in whichever form was deemed acceptable to the baying crowds beyond the keep. The Microsoft gaming arm is dead, long live the Microsoft gaming arm.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/krafton-pushes-more-ai-rd-chief-ai-officer/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>South Korean developer and publisher <strong>KRAFTON</strong> announced another step toward expanding its AI R&amp;D framework: the appointment of <strong>Kangwook Lee</strong> as the company's new Chief AI Officer (CAIO). Lee has actually been at Krafton since 2022 in the role of Head of KRAFTON AI; the promotion is a sign of the company's continued investment in AI research and development. As a reminder, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-ai-first-pubg-publisher-krafton-reaches-all-time-high-2b-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company has been calling itself "AI First"</a></strong> for a while now.</p>



<p>Lee has already led major initiatives, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the collaboration with NVIDIA to develop CPCs (Co-Playable Characters)</a></strong>, AI-driven companions designed to enable real-time interaction between players and in-game teammates. Those debuted in KRAFTON's life simulation game<span>&nbsp;<strong>inZoi</strong>, featuring the so-called <strong>Smart Zoi</strong> NPCs, which can adapt to the environment and respond to events</span> around them.</p>



<p>Soon, the technology will also be introduced in PUBG with the <strong>PUBG Ally</strong> system, built on NVIDIA ACE technology and running an SLM (Small Language Model) on-device. <strong>PUBG Ally NPCs can discuss strategies with players and adapt their playstyle accordingly</strong>. The NPCs can bring over requested items, assist in reviving teammates, and make independent decisions during looting, combat, and survival situations. They also work with voice-based interaction and already support English, Korean, and Chinese, with the first tests planned early this year in <strong>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS Arcade</strong>.</p>



<p>Under Lee’s leadership, KRAFTON’s AI strategy will focus on three core areas:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Elevating gameplay:</strong> KRAFTON will continue developing AI features to enhance immersion, responsiveness, and player interaction. <strong>Technologies such as CPCs complement human-designed gameplay systems, enabling studios to maintain full creative ownership and final decision-making authority</strong>. AI will be applied where it meaningfully enhances the player experience, while preserving the handcrafted elements that define each title.</li>



<li><strong>Supporting development teams:</strong> KRAFTON is investing in AI tools <strong>to help streamline repetitive or technical tasks, enabling developers to spend more time on creative planning, storytelling, and design</strong>. The company views AI as a means of <strong>supporting its workforce by reducing friction in production workflows and empowering teams to focus on their craft</strong>. AI-driven analytics and development tools operate using authorised and responsibly managed data in accordance with applicable privacy standards.</li>



<li><strong>Exploring long-term research opportunities:</strong> Building on its experience operating large-scale physics-based virtual worlds, <strong>KRAFTON is conducting long-term research into physical AI and robotics</strong> through a newly established entity, <strong>Ludo Robotics</strong>. This entity has operations in the United States and Korea. This research is in the early stages and focuses on software intelligence, using simulation environments to test and validate complex systems. <strong>Games remain KRAFTON’s core business</strong>, though, and future research initiatives are designed to build on the company’s foundational strengths in interactive technology.</li>
</ol>



<p>Most gamers still aren't on board with this, as evidenced most clearly <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the controversy sparked by Larian's usage of AI in the development of Divinity</a></strong>, but KRAFTON appears to have chosen its lane without much hesitation. Only time will tell whether they made the right move.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>

<p>Here's the developer's notice in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Notice of Release Postponement]</p>
<p>LOLLIPOP CHAINSAW RePOP Nintendo Switch 2 Edition had been scheduled for release on March 26, 2026. However, due to the need for significant updates not only to the Nintendo Switch 2 version but also to the currently released Nintendo Switch version, we have made the difficult decision to postpone the release.</p>
<p>We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to all fans who have been eagerly awaiting this title. We will announce the new release date as soon as preparations are complete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Dragami's previous update in January, the "Upgrade Pack" for this title (at least in Japan) is set to be a paid release.</p>
<p>When the Switch 2 version does eventually arrive, it will apparently include graphical enhancements, as well as improvements to the performance. Joy-Con 2 mouse support has also been announced and will be featured in an exclusive arcade-style mode, where you'll face off against waves of zombies using Juliet's Chainsaw Blaster and a turret.</p>

<p>Following a surprise announcement at the end of last week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> from the Game Boy Advance generation are making a grand return on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of conversation online about the Switch eShop versions, which are priced at <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> each. Some trainers are ready for battle, but others are still questioning why Nintendo didn't make these classics available via the Switch Online service (or give fans both options).</p>
<p>Despite all this back-and-forth, it seems both titles are already making bank on the Switch eShop. Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/psa-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-switch-preloads-are-now-live">preorders going live last week</a>, we've now taken a look at the eShop, and at the time of writing, these GBA titles have already topped the Switch charts in the US, UK, Japan and Australia. <em>So, there's definitely some interest!</em></p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fhjrgvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As you may have already guessed, Pokémon FireRed (repping the Fire/Flying type Charizard) is leading the charge, with Pokémon LeafGreen in second place.</p>
<p>Nintendo has confirmed these Switch versions of the games will contain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">the same content as the original releases</a>, and you can expect some modern solutions for the connectivity features. Support for <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon Home</a></strong> has also been confirmed, and these titles can be played while using the GameChat feature.</p>
<p>Although these releases might be easy money for Nintendo, this doesn't necessarily guarantee we can expect to see other first-party retro titles on the eShop. According to an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">official FAQ</a>, this is a special case marking Pokémon's 30th anniversary, and there are seemingly no plans to revive "Virtual Console types of offerings".</p>
<p>Nintendo says it intends to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-seemingly-rules-out-virtual-console-revival-says-it-remains-focused-on-offering-classics-via-switch-online">remain focused on offering retro releases</a> for its Switch Online subscription service going forward.</p>

<p>April is the new March</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The noir-style cartoon detective FPS <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-p-i-for-hire">Mouse: P.I. for Hire</a> was scheduled to arrive on Switch 2 next month, but it seems there's been a slight delay.</p>
<p>Instead of its 19th March 2026 release, this title will launch for Nintendo's new hybrid system (and other platforms) on <strong>16th April 2026</strong>. In a new <a href="https://x.com/mousethegame/status/2026046752693092801">notice on social media</a>, Fumi Games &amp; PlaySide Studios says it wants to deliver the best game possible and just needs a few more weeks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As we approach the final stages of development, we want to ensure we are taking the extra time and care needed to make Mouse: P.I. for Hire an experience to remember. We remain unwavering in our goal to deliver you the best game we can, and that will take just an extra few weeks."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The same update mentions how the team is excited to share "more of the game" with followers in the lead-up to the release, so expect more updates soon! This isn't actually the first time Mouse: P.I. for Hire has been delayed. It also follows the announcement of the Switch 2 version in October last year.</p>
<p>You can find out a little more about this game in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/vintage-shooter-mouse-p-i-for-hire-blasts-onto-switch-2-in-march-2026">our previous story here on Nintendo Life</a> and an official developer "deep dive" documentary below. When it arrives, players can apparently expect "fast-paced FPS combat" and a thrilling single-player campaign with over 20 levels.</p>

<figure data-uuid="5d631628d2e1e"><a title="Super Mario Land 2 6 Golden Coins" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5d631628d2e1e/super-mario-land-2-6-golden-coins.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>After the surprise release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> Game Boy Advance album last week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> is seemingly back to its regular schedule in terms of weekly updates.</p>
<p>With this in mind, today it's added an absolute banger - it's the soundtrack for the 1992 Game Boy title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land_2_6_golden_coins">Super Mario Land 2 - 6 Golden Coins</a> starring Mario (and Wario). This album features tracks like "Mario Land" and "Star Course". It offers <strong>35 tracks</strong> and has a total runtime of 30 minutes.</p>
<p>This soundtrack was composed by the one and only Kazumi Totaka, who is known for his famous song <a href="https://youtu.be/_cfBw8cnWgg">"Totaka's Song", which appears as an easter egg</a> in many Nintendo games. He has also voiced Nintendo characters such as Yoshi.</p>
<p>Here's the full soundtrack for this latest Nintendo Music update:</p>

<p>It's a more "challenging production process"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="675381b58be4e"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/675381b58be4e/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Earlier this month, Square Enix confirmed it would be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> to the Switch 2 in June 2026.</p>
<p>Compared to the first entry, part two is a significantly larger game with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-hopes-to-share-switch-2-update-in-very-near-future">small but intricately detailed open-world zones</a>. Despite this, the target goal apparently remains the same, according to the trilogy's director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/we-ask-final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-naoki-hamaguchi-about-the-switch-2-versions-hair-problem-why-does-it-happen-and-can-it-be-avoided/">Automaton</a> recently, he mentioned how the team's engineers are targeting 30fps "wherever possible". This will apply to not only Rebirth, but also the third installment in the trilogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi:</strong> "We’re consistently aiming for 30fps wherever possible. For FFVII Rebirth and the third installment of the trilogy, our engineers are working hard on tuning to ensure stable performance at that level. I hope players will look forward to it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hamaguchi adds how the team is working hard to optimise the game so it can maintain a "stable frame rate", while also improving the visual quality "as much as possible" at the same time.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a0b673b84fe83"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a0b673b84fe83/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows some comments Hamaguchi made not long ago, when he acknowledged how the second game was a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-hopes-to-share-switch-2-update-in-very-near-future">much more "challenging production process"</a> overall but was still confident his team of engineers would be "able to deliver".</p>
<p>Hamaguchi has also confirmed both titles to follow the Remake will feature <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-remakes-sequels-will-have-exactly-the-same-gameplay-as-other-consoles">"exactly the same" gameplay experience</a> as other platforms.</p>
<p>When Rebirth arrived on the PlayStation 5 in 2024, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">our colleagues at <strong>Push Square</strong></a> thought it was a "great" sequel, but did call out the "disappointing" performance mode on this platform at the time, which <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/03/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-getting-another-patch-to-improve-performance-mode">led to a post-launch update</a>. As for our time with Remake on Switch 2, we thought it was an excellent experience, even at 30fps and with "a few minor dips" in handheld.</p>

        <p>Try to survive this cursed game with some help from an unusual cat.</p><p>This game includes scenes where information from the player’s PC environment is displayed within the game. When streaming or recording, enabling “Streamer Mode” is strongly recommended to prevent a loss of privacy.</p><p>Furthermore, we are participating in the Steam Next Fest, (starting on February 24) and a demo version is already available. Save data from the demo can be transferred to the full version, so please take this opportunity to play <em>DYPING: ESCAPE</em> and add it to your wishlist.</p><p><strong>About the Game</strong></p><p>“Let’s play a typing game. All you have to do is type what I tell you to. You don’t have to think at all.”</p><p>A pair of creepy, mysterious eyeballs is your game master. You’ll follow their instructions to progress through a typing game… but also be forced to sign a rather unreasonable contract.</p><p>Whatever you type becomes reality and is inflicted upon you. You might be asked to run programs you don’t want to, or even hack your own system in an act of self-destruction. You might have to watch in horror as your computer breaks down before your very eyes. There’s not much you can really do to fight against this, especially in a typing game… But with the help of a cat awakened from an ancient game, perhaps you can escape.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/dyping-escape-launches-march-13]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Controversy has arisen from the recent <em>Neopets</em> TTRPG playtest document. The beta playtest, released as part of Geekify's development of the tabletop game, was so full of inappropriate and unrepresentative material, that it was taken down by the owner's request.</p><h2>The Neopets TTRPG Playtest Controversy</h2><p>The <em>Neopets</em> TTRPG playtest controversy started when the document became available to the public. Over several weeks, fans and tabletop enthusiasts poured over the material, curious to see how the family-friendly web series about raising adorable digital pets would be adapted.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neopets-ttrpg-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=Dd_dGYVf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="900" height="506">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neopets-ttrpg-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=9JMkX-u- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="900" height="506">
                  

  </picture><p>The answer was not particularly well. The system was a derivative of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and was very combat heavy. This is a major departure from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/neopets-ttrpg-kickstarter-has-doubled-its-funding-goal" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter's</a> promoted original classless, point-based RPG system. Worse still, the scenario had some decidedly inappropriate subject matter for <em>Neopets</em>.</p><p>How inappropriate? According to some posts on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/infernatrixsophia.bsky.social/post/3mec3mgatyl2f" rel="nofollow">Bluesky</a>, the document had players face intoxicated/drunk bandits, gives them the option to potentially torture them for information, and contains lines with misogynistic and even homophobic connotations. There is even a section asking players their comfort levels about in-game sexual activity. In a <em>Neopets</em> RPG.</p><p>In fact, the Neopets TTRPG playtest controversy was such a debacle, the company recently released a statement addressing the issue on their website. The statement is critical of the RPG, stating that <em>Neopets</em> wasn't "a generic fantasy dungeon crawler." Furthermore, it states the document was made without their approval.</p><blockquote><p>We want to be transparent with the community: the beta playtest document that was recently made public was not approved or reviewed by our team prior to its release. Under our licensing agreement, all content bearing the Neopets name must meet our quality standards and receive our written approval before it is shared publicly. Following an internal review, Neopets has determined that the content and themes contained within the document do not align with our brand standards, values, or the expectations we hold for experiences created under the Neopets license. Although the Neopets team has been steadily reviewing the TTRPG in sections as it is submitted, none of the aforementioned submissions was included in the beta document material released. We immediately requested the document’s removal and have been in direct communication with Geekify to address the matter.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Curiously, despite the <em>Neopets</em> TTRPG controversy, the company seems committed to the game's development. The statement ends stating the company will take the time needed to ensure the project reaches its potential. But if this playtest is indicative of the attitude and approach Geekify has towards the property, it doesn't paint a nice picture for the future.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
