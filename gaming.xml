            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Valve has announced a new process for validating the age of users and comply with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/25/welcome-to-the-new-internet/">UK’s controversial Online Safety Act</a>. Thankfully, Valve’s path to confirm your age is much less intrusive than the one we’ve seen many social media companies and tech giants taking.</p>
<p>From now on, UK-based users looking to visit Steam store pages for mature rated games and their community hubs will require you to be logged into an active user account and opt-in for mature content. This does mean there’s no more blindly clicking through a quick date picker without logging in, which was useful for casually browsing.</p>


<p>Of course, this will now need a new process to verify a user’s age, and in the UK your age is considered verified so long as there is a valid credit or debit card stored on the account – while Valve stated “credit card”, banks issue different debit cards to customers who are above and below 18 years of age and perform age and identity checks for their accounts, so they should still provide the same age checks in this process.</p>
<p>This stands in stark contrast to AI-based age guesstimation using phone cameras – some of which were initially fooled by the photo mode in Death Stranding – or demands for passport and drivers licenses to validate. Steam is a storefront, so it’s reasonable to expect a payment method for validation. As excessive as the legislation is, both for the demands being imposed on companies, users and online communities and for the dampening effect this has on important kinds of speech and knowledge, this is a relatively low key approach from Valve.</p>
<p>It is, however, a shame that other options are not available. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/xbox-adds-age-verification-in-the-uk-for-the-online-safety-act/">Age verification on Xbox is to be fully enforced from early 2026</a>, and you can prove your age using government-issued ID, age estimation, mobile provider check, or credit card checks. I’d like to see Valve add mobile checks as well – you need to provide a phone number as part of adding a credit card anyway, and that’s also a decent datapoint.</p>

<p>Valve commits to processing this data in a manner that is identical to their rest of its data processing for purchases and payments, using an internal payment processing system that meets PCI-DSS standards. If, however, your given card fails the age check, you will need to contact your bank and go through a Steam support process.</p>
<p>Here’s the process for Steam users to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your Steam user account.</li>
<li>Visit the Account Details page and click the button labeled “Add a Payment method to this account”.</li>
<li>You will be redirected to a form where you are asked to enter your credit card details.<br>
Required inputs:
<ul>
<li>Credit Card type</li>
<li>Credit card number</li>
<li>CVV</li>
<li>Expiry date</li>
<li>Name and billing address</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click “Continue” to trigger a £0 authorization.</li>
<li>You will be presented with a challenge that is determined by your card issuing bank’s policies, e.g. via one-time-password (OTP) or via app.</li>
<li>If the process is successful, you can now choose to add previously unavailable mature content types on the Store Preferences page.</li>
</ol>

<figure><a title="Fear Effect" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31abc5797e520/fear-effect.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Limited Run Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Almost out of the blue, Limited Run Games' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fear_effect">Fear Effect</a> port has arrived on the Switch eShop... right now! Yep, you can go and download the PS1 classic from the eShop for just <strong>$9.99 / £8.99</strong> (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/fear-effect-for-ps5-ps4-switch-and-pc-now-available">Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>The release comes with almost no fanfare, as neither Limited Run Games nor developer Implicit Conversions (who is working with Atari and Digital Eclipse on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>) have said anything about the game dropping today at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Still, we thought it was coming as the game arrived on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/08/cult-classic-ps1-adventure-fear-effect-is-suddenly-available-on-ps5-ps4">PS4 and PS5 earlier today</a> with the same lack of fanfare — some people thought it was even a mistake.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067thyqno&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>We've actually known about this rerelease for a while, as Limited Run Games <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/acclaimed-ps1-hit-fear-effect-is-coming-to-switch-in-2025">announced it last year</a>, but it's been radio silence ever since. Now we've got the game on a Nintendo console for the first time ever.</p>
<p>In case you haven't heard of the game before, Fear Effect is a 2000 PS1 game that pioneered cel-shaded visuals and looping FMV backgrounds, which forced the game to be shipped on four discs. While the controls and gameplay received mild criticism at the time, the narrative, writing, and visuals were all lauded, and the game has become a bit of a classic for PlayStation fans.</p>

            <p>Are you sitting down, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>? It's alright. I've just got...some news I need to tell you. There's no easy way to say this. A modder's decided to put a bunch of Fortnitey emotes and dances inside you.</p>
<p>We can see the likes of dabs, the NaeNae, and even a stanky legg on the scans. They're cranking it, spanking that, and Snoop Dogging all over your internal organs too. There's nothing we could have done. That surgery which ported you from 2006 to 2025 increased the risk of this drastically, but how else were 12 year olds supposed to learn about the need to CLOSE SHUT THE JAWS OF OBLIVION?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We could rage against the cause of these symptoms, modder CosmicBoogaloo with their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/5039?tab=description">Dance and Emote Animation Pack</a>. We could curse them in the name of the divines, of the Aedra, or even the Daedra. We could subjugate ourselves before Dagon himself, calling on his lust for revolution to grant us the malign powers required to reverse this regrettable chain of events.</p>
<p>We could crusade with the fury of Pelinal Whitestrake against any and all who download the mod, and go on to press one of the keys it assigns a Fortnitey dance or emote to. We could cast their characters, mid-subtle dab or weird bottomless twerk, into the fiery pits of The Deadlands, where they'd inevitably float around going 'UGGGH', 'OOOOAGGHH', and 'NYYYYUUGGHHH'.</p>

<p>We could outlaw its 19 emotes and 20 dances, including the ability to make it rain despite the fact that this province lacks paper money and criss crosses you can dougie into a running man before movin' like Bernie. We could instruct every legion guard to stop violators of this anti-taunting legislation with deadly force. We could yell from the summit of the White-Gold Tower: 'You there in the Arena district, cease flexing those muscles and woohooing at once, or else incur the wrath of mighty Akatosh!'</p>
<p>We could do all of that, but it wouldn't matter. Those who wish to use this profane mod have likely already grabbed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/UE4SS%20for%20Oblivion%20Remastered">UE4SS</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1172">Simple BP Mod Loader</a>. </p>
<p>The dabbage is irreversible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Some of my favorite games of all time.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Labor Day weekend is a great time to get together with the family, sure, but it's also a nice little three-day window to get some serious gaming in. Assuming you don't already have a massive backlog of PC games to play, now is actually a pretty good time of year to find some video game deals. If you're looking to pick up a new game before the weekend arrives, you've got options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're in between major Steam sales at the moment, but another big PC games sale going on right now is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Dlm?object_uuid=57482acb-3f94-473a-b83a-8fac5977e551&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Humble Bundle Summer Sale</a>. There are a ton of discounted games here at prices that will last through the weekend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something great under $10, I've got some recommendations for you. Each of these games I've listed are wonderful for different reasons, but every single one of them are worth playing for hours at a time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PC Games Under $10</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">My first pick might not be for everyone, but it's one of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-of-my-favorite-pc-games-of-all-time-is-super-cheap-during-the-humble-bundle-summer-sale">my favorite gaming experiences</a> of all time. It's hard to really go too into detail without ruining some of it, but it's essentially a roguelike deck-building card game with a twist of psychological horror. If any of that sounds interesting to you, it's best to just start playing without learning more. Going in cold is the best way to play this game.</p><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227072"><div id="227072" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Inscryption</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next on this list is what has become one of the best indie games of all time. I was genuinely surprised how much I liked Hollow Knight. I don't usually like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/genre/metroidvania">metroidvania games</a>, but it has a sort of sad, dark charm that really drew me in. The gameplay is fun and the battles can get difficult, but the atmosphere of this game keeps you engaged at every turn. With the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">Hollow Knight sequel releasing next week</a>, now is a great time to jump into the original.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227443"><div id="227443" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hollow Knight</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't really feel the need to say much about The Witcher 3, because of course it's worth playing. CD Projekt Red's masterpiece is one of those rare games that I've ended up playing through multiple times. While it's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-books-reading-order">Witcher books</a> that ultimately birthed this franchise, it's really this game that made it a household name. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a> somewhere on the horizon, its as good a time as any to start your Witcher 3 journey for the first time.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227445"><div id="227445" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a PC gamer who also happens to be a Nintendo gamer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bug-fables-the-everlasting-sapling">Bug Fables</a> is one of those games that hits a very specific sweet spot. It's a turn-based RPG that has an eerily similar look and feel as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/paper-mario">original Paper Mario game</a>. It's a storybook adventure with puzzles and battles that has a fun overarching story. If you love games like Paper Mario and Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, you'll love Bug Fables.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227446"><div id="227446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My last recommendation is the cheapest and shortest game on this list. Gris is a beautiful platformer game with some fun puzzles and stunning artwork. This game tells a story of grief and loss, and these feelings unfold through an incredible use of color, music, and gameplay. You can <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/62257" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">play through the whole thing in a few hours</a>, and it's definitely worth paying $2.99 for what you'll get from it. This is one of those games that hit me surprisingly hard.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227447"><div id="227447" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gris</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">See all PC games on sale for under $10</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The games I've listed here are just some of my favorites, but there's actually a lot more in the sale that are worth a look.

<p>Today's video game consoles are hundreds of dollars more expensive than you'd expect based on historic pricing trends. That's according to an Ars Technica analysis of decades of pricing data and price-cut timing across dozens of major US console releases.</p>
<p>The overall direction of this trend has been apparent to industry watchers for a while now. Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft have failed to cut their console prices in recent years and have instead been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-raises-planned-switch-2-accessory-prices-amid-tariff-uncertainty/">increasing</a> the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/microsoft-raises-prices-on-xbox-hardware-says-some-holiday-games-will-be-80/">nominal MSRP</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/sony-joins-xbox-and-nintendo-in-hiking-playstation-5-prices-in-the-us/">many current consoles</a> in the past six months.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

<p>But when you crunch the numbers, it's pretty incredible just how much today's console prices defy historic expectations, even when you account for higher-than-normal inflation in recent years. If today's consoles were seeing anything like what used to be standard price cuts over time, we could be paying around $200 today for pricey systems like the Switch OLED, PS5 Digital Edition, and Xbox Series S.</p>
<h2>Crunching the numbers</h2>
<p>To determine the extent of today's relative console overpricing, we dug through old news reports, press releases, advertisements, and store catalogs for annual price data going back to the Atari 2600's launch in 1977. We used permanent MSRP announcements wherever possible so that temporary sales or store-specific closeouts wouldn't affect the data. If a console dropped in price multiple times in one year, we took the lowest price from that year. We then adjusted all the nominal prices for inflation to consistent July 2025 dollars using <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">BLM's CPI calculator</a>.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>Almost every classic console saw significant price drops by its second or third year on the market (and beyond).</span>
                    <span>

          </p>
  </div>

<p>The resulting trendlines can be a bit noisy from console to console. Some classic consoles saw significant, drastic price drops after just a year on the market, often before disappearing from shelves altogether shortly afterward. Others stayed at their nominal launch price for a year or three, letting inflation slowly chip away at that value of those dollars before finally dropping the price as a way to bolster lagging sales for aging hardware.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Overall, though, you can see a clear and significant downward trend to the year-over-year pricing for game consoles released before 2016. After three years on the market, the median game console during this period cost less than half as much (on an inflation-adjusted basis) as it did at launch. Consoles that stuck around on the market long enough could expect further slow price erosion over time, until they were selling for roughly 43 percent of their launch price in year five and about 33 percent in year eight.</p>
<p>That kind of extreme price-cutting is a distant memory for today's game consoles. By year three, the median console currently on the market costs about 85 percent of its real launch price, thanks to the effects of inflation. By year five, that median launch price ratio for modern consoles actually <em>increases</em> to 92 percent, thanks to the nominal price increases that many consoles have seen in their fourth or fifth years on the market. And the eight-year-old Nintendo Switch is currently selling for about 86 percent of its inflation-adjusted launch price, or more than 50 percentage points higher than the median trend for earlier long-lived consoles.</p>

    <p><span>While the data is noisy, the overall trend in older console pricing over time is very clear.</span>

<p>To be fair, today's game consoles are not the most expensive the industry has ever seen. Systems like the Atari 2600, Intellivision, Neo Geo, and 3DO launched at prices that would be well over $1,000 in 2025 money. More recently, systems like the PS3 ($949.50 at launch in 2025 dollars) and Xbox One ($689.29 at launch in 2025 dollars) were significantly pricier than the $300 to $600 range that encompasses most of today's consoles.</p>

<p>But when classic consoles launched at such high prices, those prices never lasted very long. Even the most expensive console launches of the past dropped in price quickly enough that, by year three or so, they were down to inflation-adjusted prices comparable to today's consoles. And classic consoles that launched at more reasonable prices usually saw price cuts that took them well into the sub-$300 range (in 2025 dollars) within a few years, making them a relative bargain from today's perspective.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>What’s keeping prices high?</h2>
<p>So why are today's consoles staying so stubbornly resistant to historic price-drop trends? Higher-than-normal inflation in recent years explains some of the nominal price inflexibility, but nothing close to all of it. In fact, even when you adjust for inflation, some current consoles like the Xbox Series S and PS5 Pro are <em>more expensive</em> on a real basis today than they were on launch day.</p>
<p>The uncertainty and extra import costs of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/thanks-to-new-tariffs-many-more-physical-game-discs-may-simply-not-get-made/">Trump administration tariffs</a> definitely play some part in the change, as console makers obliquely reference by citing "market conditions" or a "challenging economic environment" in their price-raising announcements. But even before recent tariffs, modern console prices weren't dropping nearly as fast as history suggested they should. In fact, Sony first raised the nominal starting price of the PS5 Digital Edition <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/redesigned-ps5-models-slim-down-one-of-the-bulkiest-consoles-ever/">back in 2023</a>, way before Trump's current trade war was even on the horizon.</p>

      </figure>

<p>Some of that earlier price drop wariness could have been due to pandemic-related chip shortages, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/nintendo-warns-global-chip-shortage-to-hit-switch-production/">console makers</a> at the time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/sony-says-ps5-could-be-difficult-to-find-into-2022/">warned</a> were keeping hardware supplies well below demand. But all indications suggest those global supply chain effects were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/sony-expects-ps5-will-still-be-in-short-supply-until-2023/">more or less ameliorated by early 2023</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/low-semiconductor-supplies-may-not-be-the-main-reason-for-ps5-shortages/">may not have been as significant as they seemed</a> from the outside.</p>
<p>Amid all those macroeconomic factors, the slowdown in Moore's Law, specifically, seems like a likely candidate for today's stubborn console pricing. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/chips-arent-improving-like-they-used-to-and-its-killing-game-console-price-cuts/">we've discussed in depth recently</a>, the rate of advancement in microchip manufacturing <a href="https://cap.csail.mit.edu/death-moores-law-what-it-means-and-what-might-fill-gap-going-forward">has slowed in recent years</a>, making it harder than it was in the past to develop cheaper and/or smaller versions of console hardware.</p>

<p>That explains why costs for hardware makers have remained higher than usual. But in the past, console makers have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/08/nintendo-wii-u-still-being-sold-at-a-loss/">shown a willingness to sell hardware at a loss</a> when needed to make the money back on software sales. Systems like the PS3, Xbox One, Wii U, and 3DS saw extremely rapid price drops after less-than-stellar launch receptions, suggesting they were slashing or eliminating hardware profits well before any manufacturing savings could be passed on to consumers.</p>
<p>The fact that we're not seeing such price cutting today could be interpreted as a sign that current console prices aren't too high for the market to bear. Back in 2022, we noted how <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/will-the-nintendo-switch-ever-see-a-price-drop/">the ahistorical lack of a Switch price drop</a> didn't seem to be dampening that system's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/nintendo-switch-crosses-100-million-mark-outsells-wii-ps1/">historically strong sales</a>. The same seems to be true of the PS5 and PS5 Pro, which are <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/ps5-shipments-top-80-3-million">selling</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-700-price-tag-isnt-hurting-ps5-pros-early-sales/">briskly</a> despite a lack of price drops. And while the Xbox hardware line <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/xbox-console-sales-continue-to-crater-with-massive-42-revenue-drop/">may be struggling for customer attention these days</a>, Microsoft also seems <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/we-run-a-business-why-microsofts-indiana-jones-will-be-on-ps5/">less interested</a> in providing the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-confirms-which-xbox-games-are-going-to-switch-playstation/">exclusive games</a> that would usually help justify the purchase of an Xbox (and perhaps more interested in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/why-microsofts-next-xbox-should-just-run-windows-already/">pivoting to Windows-based gaming hardware</a> like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally</a>).</p>
<p>In other words, console prices aren't dropping in part because the market isn't forcing them to. As long as today's console makers are satisfied with sales at their current levels, the price drops customers came to expect historically will continue to be a thing of the past.</p>

                <p>HoYoverse will soon enough be adding yet another genre to its growing list of gacha games, this time in the form of a new game called Honkai: Nexus Anima. This one might interest Pokemon fans as it is a creator collector, though it looks like it'll differ from the Nintendo series in a few key ways. And, if it takes your fancy, you can even sign up to take part in its first Nexus Bond Test.</p><p dir="ltr">First up are some of the big differences. For starters, the combat system is completely different. Where Pokemon sees you pitting your pocket monsters generally 1v1, each of them with four moves to choose, Honkai: Nexus Anima's main combat system looks closer to an auto battler like Auto Chess or Teamfight Tactics.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGfTS72aEOs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dGfTS72aEOs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">You also seemingly get to play as Anima--this game's titular equivalent to Pokemon--in varying ways. That includes a racing minigame, a minigame where you shoot at beach balls, and another where you … destroy an office building! There appears to be a range of customization options for your player character, but you can also seemingly play as different characters too. And like in more recent Pokemon games, you can ride different Anima to get around the game's world.</p><p dir="ltr">To take part in the beta test for the game, all you need to do is head to its <a href="https://hna.hoyoverse.com/en-us?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=hna_GLB_PR" rel="nofollow ">official website</a>, click the Join Test button, and log in to your HoYoverse account. You'll then be asked to fill in a questionnaire, which will ask you about the kind of device you're playing on, other games you play, and how much you typically spend on games in general.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that the test is only on iOS and PC, and will have Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean as language options--more languages are planned to be added in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">The test is live now and is running until September 12. A release date for the full game hasn't been revealed just yet.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Konami has released the first update for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater on all platforms. The patch notes mainly detail fixes for crashing issues that occur in specific situations for the stealth game, though there is a silly bug addressed that sees Snake floating in midair.</p><p dir="ltr">Metal Gear Solid Delta players could previously see Snake hovering above the ground sometimes by "transitioning from a roll into a crawl." Overall, the update for the game brings it up to <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/news/us/en/update_112_2" rel="nofollow ">version 1.1.2</a>. The patch actually rolled out yesterday, August 28, on Steam, while it's going live today on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

		<p>Rebellion has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a>: The Red Strain, the next expansion for their hit 50s Northern England disaster survival game. The new story expansion pack is set to arrive on 16th September across all platforms – PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The base game is also still a part of Game Pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall The Red Strain Teaser Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ti8cwDNGxI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Details are very thin on the ground right now, but there’s a big new robot in town, seemingly taking a smidgeon of inspiration from RoboCop by shoving a brain up into the glass jar on top, and from Doctor Who Daleks for the voice box. Intriguingly, there’s a new acronym organisation involved here, as C.O.R.E. is stamped across the front of the robot’s chest and we see an ominous looking entrance hall to the institution, as well as some reddish mists to contrast with the main game’s blueish hues.</p>
<p>This is the second story expansion for Atomfall, following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/atomfalls-wicked-isle-story-dlc-launches-on-june-3rd/">the Wicked Isle which launched back in June</a>. This took players away from Wyndham Vilage and off to Midsummer Island for another adjacent story – in our review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/24/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-review/">we did complain</a> that it followed the themes of the main game a bit too closely, so hopefully a bit more time has allowed Rebellion to inject a bit more variety for this second expansion.</p>

<p>Of the main game, though, we rather enjoyed it. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall review</a>,&nbsp;Gareth said,<em> “Atomfall is an interesting game. It might not be wholly unique in anything it does, but it combines its core ideas in a way that feels fresh. A big part of that comes through the drip feed of the underlying story, whilst another is the glorious British countryside that makes up its maps. It likely isn’t going to blow your mind, but it’s an enjoyable journey and you would still be missing out if you didn’t give Atomfall a go.”</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-age-verification-uk</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-age-verification-kicks-in-for-uk-users-credit-card-required-to-pass.1284129/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam has introduced age verification for UK users, with mature pages on the storefront now requiring valid credit card details showing that you're 18 or over to access.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new FAQ</a>, Steam's new UK age verification process has been introduced in order to comply with the country's new Online Safety Act, which has also affected other gaming-related websites <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexus-mods-age-verification-uk-eu" rel="nofollow">like Nexus Mods</a>, as well as various key sellers.</p>

<p>In order to access mature content on Steam, you'll now need to provide valid credit card information, and your account will be "considered age verified" for as long as that information is stored. If you delete it, you'll need to add another one in order to access mature pages again.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-age-verification-uk-storefront.jpg?itok=9R1luE50 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-age-verification-uk-storefront.jpg?itok=-wPvY87Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Steam will now require you to verify your age to access mature content if you're in the UK.</figcaption></figure><p>If you haven't added a card to your Steam account yet, you can do so via the Account Details page's "add a payment method to this account" option. The process is fairly straightforward; once you've been through it, you can change your store preferences to allow mature content.</p>

<p>Valve says it's using this particular method of verification because it "preserves the maximum degree of user privacy"; the data processed through verification is "identical to that of the millions of other Steam users who make purchases", according to Valve.</p>

<p>If you're concerned about not owning a credit card, I was able to add a valid debit card in order to verify my age, but it's possible that this isn't an intended verification method; in its own FAQ, Valve says individuals must be 18 to obtain a credit card, but in the UK, debit cards can be used by those as young as 16.</p>

<p>If Steam does indeed require users to specifically add a credit card to verify their age, that feels like an unfortunate oversight for the <a href="https://www.money.co.uk/credit-cards/credit-card-statistics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">roughly 36%</a> of UK adults who don't have credit cards (myself included).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nexus-mods-steam-uk-age-verification.jpg?itok=Fzh6IRuC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nexus-mods-steam-uk-age-verification.jpg?itok=FpinpH_3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other sites, like Nexus Mods, now also require age verification for UK users.</figcaption></figure><p>It looks like pages for games with mature content, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">recent release&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></a>, aren't affected; this age verification system appears only to apply specifically to adult content on Steam. That may change in the future, however.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that this new system only applies to UK users; if you're in the US, or anywhere else that doesn't have a similar law to the Online Safety Act, then you can continue using Steam just as you have been.</p>

<p>The Online Safety Act is likely to mean that more and more gaming-related sites and platforms incorporate age verification for UK users, so if you're based in the UK, you can expect this kind of thing to become more common as time goes by. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/msi-titan-18-hx-ai-review-the-ultimate-laptop-with-limits/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/msi-titan-18-hx-ai-review-the-ultimate-laptop-with-limits.1284126/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>MSI’s Titan 18 HX AI isn’t really a laptop in the traditional sense. It’s more like a full-on desktop packed into a form you can technically carry around. Of course, that’s if you don’t mind lugging eight pounds of aluminum alloy plus a hefty power brick. This isn’t something you casually throw in a backpack for a coffee shop session. It’s a machine built for people who want raw, uncompromising power in a device that still folds shut.</p>



<p>It has all the bells and whistles you could ever want, but with a hefty price tag and some frustrating design aspects,&nbsp;is it really one that you should invest in?</p>



<h2 id="h-msi-titan-18-hx-ai-review">MSI Titan 18 HX AI Review</h2>



<p>The first thing that stands out is the massive 18-inch Mini-LED display. It runs at 4K UHD+ with a 120Hz refresh rate, delivers excellent color coverage, and pushes brightness high enough for work or play in just about any environment. Whether you’re gaming or doing creative work, it’s a screen that feels built for both. And the hardware driving it has the muscle to match. </p>



<p>MSI crammed in Intel’s Core Ultra 9 285HX processor and NVIDIA’s RTX 5090 laptop GPU, which means the Titan 18 HX handles modern games at 4K with ease. Frame rates in demanding titles hold strong, and production tasks like video rendering or 3D modeling run faster than most dedicated desktops. Simply put, it does whatever you ask of it.</p>



<p>I don’t want to spend too much time going over benchmarks because, as I mentioned, this machine will do whatever you need with ease. Still, it’s worth going over a couple for the Core Ultra 9 285HX. </p>



<p>On Geekbench, it received a single-core average score of 3,169 and a multi-core score average of 22,135. Compared to the MSI Raider GE78 with an Intel Core i9-14900K (single-core: 3,000/multi-core: 18,262), and you are looking at an average increase of roughly 21% for the multi-core and 5% for the single-core. Other synthetic benchmarks from software like 3D mark also showed impressive results with it hitting a CPU profile score of 17,815 for Max Threads on stock settings and 1,311 on a single thread.</p>



<p>Moving to productivity, and I was rendering five-minute 4K videos in roughly three minutes with 1080 being done, on average, between 60-90 seconds. &nbsp;Obviously, if you are someone who uses a lot of transitions and edits, it might take a bit longer, but nothing that would become concerning.</p>

<h2 id="h-upgradeability">Upgradeability</h2>



<p>One of the big debates between laptops and desktops comes with how easy they are to upgrade and repair. Desktop machines will, likely, always have the advantage because of how easy it is for people to buy new components and swap them as they need. For laptops, that’s a bit more of a challenge.</p>



<p>Truth be told, it’s not overly difficult to access what you need inside. In fact, it’s kind of easy as long as you take your time.</p>



<p>With the Titan 18 HX, upgrading your memory and storage is pretty easy once you get through all of the screws at the bottom of your machine. But that’s really where the upgrades end, as you would expect. Swapping out the CPU or GPU just isn’t going to happen. And if you reach a point where you need to replace the display or other internal, you’ll have to have a long talk about how much you trust yourself to make a swap.  </p>



<h2 id="h-general-usage-comes-with-some-concerns">General Usage Comes With Some Concerns</h2>



<p>Typing on the Titan 18 HX is a different kind of highlight. The Cherry MX ultra-low-profile mechanical keyboard is, to me, one of the best you’ll find on a laptop, offering satisfying key travel and feedback. Long typing sessions actually feel good, which isn’t something you can always say for a gaming notebook. That said, the keyboard does tend to heat up under heavy loads, which can get uncomfortable during longer stretches of play or work. The touchpad, on the other hand, feels like a complete a miss. MSI went with a built-in haptic design that blends into the palm rest, and while it looks futuristic, it’s not always practical. Precision can be frustrating, and most people will end up relying on a mouse instead. More on that in a moment.</p>



<p>Naturally, performance at this level comes with tradeoffs. The cooling system—dual fans paired with a vapor chamber—does a solid job of keeping things in check, but when the laptop is under stress, it gets loud. The fans spin up past the point where you’ll want a headset just to drown them out. The system also pulls a ton of power, so battery life isn’t great. You can expect maybe two-to-three hours of light use and closer to 90 minutes or so when gaming, making it clear this is a machine meant to stay plugged in most of the time. </p>



<p>Portability isn’t just about battery life, though. Between the size of the machine itself and the power brick required to feed it, taking the Titan 18 HX on the go feels more like hauling around a workstation than a laptop. Yes, you can travel with it, but it’s not a device you’ll be setting up on a cramped airplane tray table. I actually tried to take it to various events throughout the summer, but quickly realized there was no way I was going to walk around for hours with it on my back. Plus, the the combined space required for the power brick and the laptop in a bag will have you lucky to fit anything else inside.</p>



<p>On the plus side, the Titan 18 HX is well-equipped for the future. It’s packed with ports—dual Thunderbolt 5, HDMI 2.1, USB-A, Ethernet, Wi-Fi 7, and even SD card support—making it ready for whatever setup you want to throw at it. The AI tuning engine MSI built in can automatically adjust performance and cooling depending on what you’re doing, and storage flexibility means you’ll be able to keep expanding as needs grow. In other words, this laptop isn’t just about today’s games and workloads; it’s built with an eye toward what’s coming next.</p>



<h2 id="h-msi-titan-18-hx-ai-verdict">MSI Titan 18 HX AI Verdict</h2>



<p>The MSI Titan 18 HX AI is a monster of a laptop. It’s loud, heavy, and not something you’ll want to really carry around for long stretches, but it delivers performance that few portable machines can match. From high-end gaming to intensive creative work, it handles everything you throw at it with ease. Sure, the keyboard can get warm, the fans are noisy, and battery life is limited, but these are the trade-offs for having desktop-level power in a “laptop” form.</p>



<p>This isn’t a device for everyone, but for creators, gamers, or tech enthusiasts who want a, somewhat, future-proof powerhouse they can move between locations, the Titan 18 HX makes a strong case. It’s a showcase of what’s possible when performance takes priority, and for those who need the absolute best, it’s hard to ignore.</p>

                <p>This week, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) announced that more than 450 developers of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo</a> team have voted to unionize under the CWA. The successful outcome of this effort means workers will now be represented by CWA Local 9510 in Irvine, California; Local 1118 in Albany, New York; and Local 6215 in Austin, Texas.</p><p>The newly formed union will represent a wide range of jobs across Blizzard, including designers, engineers, artists, and support staff. Microsoft, Blizzard's parent company, has officially recognized the union. This unionization campaign is not an isolated event at Blizzard, as earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-story-team-has-voted-to-unionize/1100-6533931/" data-ref-id="1100-6533931">the studio's Story and Franchise Development team also voted to unionize</a>.</p><p>"With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I've witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us," said Diablo producer and organizing committee member Kelly Yeo (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/450-diablo-developers-vote-to-unionize-under-cwa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>). "This is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of living in fear."</p><p>Workers also shared personal experiences that illustrate the atmosphere of uncertainty and instability driving the union effort. "The day after the third round of mass layoffs, I walked into the office, and when I tried to open the door to the cafeteria, my badge was denied. For a moment, I wondered if getting breakfast was how I'd find out I was part of that round," added designer Ryan Littleton. While Littleton's situation ended up being just a technical glitch, it doesn't help the overall cloud of uncertainty. "None of us should have to live with that constant worry that we might be let go at the drop of a hat."</p><p>Senior software engineer Nav Bhatti framed the initiative as a response to long-standing industry challenges, saying this sort of stress puts people in a fight-or-flight mode, but the union helps them to be able to "stand our ground in the industry."</p><p>CWA Local 9510 president Jason Justice pointed to California's growing role in labor movements. "What's happening here is part of a much larger story about turning the tide in an industry that has long overlooked its labor," he said. "Entertainment workers across film, television, music, and now video games are standing together to have a seat at the table."</p>

		<p>Bugbear has released Content Update 3 for their smashtastic racer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>, adding two new cars, nine new tracks and/or layouts, better AI and plenty more improvements across the Early Access game.</p>
<p>There’s also been fresh teasers of the single player campaign, modding support and more features that will be added, but for now the focus has been on fleshing out and optimising the core content of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Content Update #03" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LDq8IFt87p8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The two new cars are the Switchback American muscle car, and the Popper European “folk racing” car. You can race them both around the Cannonhill and Savolax tracks (in both directions), while there’s new layouts for the Scrapyard Speedbowl, Figure 8 and Main Circuit, a small oval at Speedway, and the Rallycross 1 circuit can be run in reverse.</p>
<p>More broadly, AI difficulty can now be set to novice, amateur and expert, there’s improved online multiplayer latency, support for telemetry for SimHub and generic systems, and plenty more.</p>

<p>Here’s the patch notes:</p>

<p>Thankfully, accessory maker Genki has you covered on both counts with two of its next Switch 2-focused products: the Force Field 2 And Energy Pack.</p>
<p>We're covering both in this dual-review.</p>
<h2>Genki Force Field 2 Review</h2>
<figure><a title="Review: Genki Force Field 2 And Energy Pack - The Ultimate Switch 2 'On The Road' Combo? 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1ffb5b3839d72/review-genki-force-field-2-and-energy-pack-the-ultimate-switch-2-on-the-road-combo-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We've already covered several of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-2-cases">best Switch 2 cases</a> on this very site, but Genki's Force Field 2 (<a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/force-field-2">£25 / $29.99 on its own, £35 / $39.99 with the Travel Cover</a>) is somewhat unique in this field; like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-case-teething-troubles-aside-this-case-is-killer">Dbrand Switch 2 Killswitch</a>, it's not a carry case you place the console inside when it's not in use, but a clip-on shell which is intended to remain in situ during gameplay.</p>
<p>The case is fashioned from smoky plastic and clips onto the back of the Switch 2 with the minimum of fuss. It's designed to offer lightweight protection during use but comes with some additional benefits – for example, there are ergonomic bulges on the back of the case that make the console easier to hold. I genuinely found that my Switch 2 was a lot more comfortable to use over prolonged periods as a result.</p>
<p>Thanks to its hinge system, the Force Field 2's sides can be opened up to grant access to the Joy-Con 2, revealing another cool feature – there's space for two game cards, one on each side. This doesn't quite make up for the fact that many other carry cases offer storage for multiple cards, but it's still a neat bonus. My only complaint is that the fit is <em>really</em> tight, and it often feels like the cartridge is going to break as you unclip it from the slot. This will almost certainly ease up over time, but it's worth mentioning nonetheless.</p>

<p>Once in place, the Force Field 2 leaves all of your buttons and ports clear, making them easy to reach – even the kickstand can be deployed without any issue as there's an aperture allowing access. It's also possible to dock your Switch 2 without removing the Force Field 2, although it's quite a snug fit.</p>
<p>The Force Field 2 is available on its own or with the optional Travel Cover. This clips over the front of the console, covering the screen and controls – as well as the shoulder triggers – preventing them from being pressed during transit. The only hole on this cover is located on the bottom, and it allows you to charge your Switch 2 while the case is in place.</p>
<p>While many people want their Switch 2 consoles to be protected by a carry case which is soft on the inside and hard on the outside, the Force Field 2 relies on a tough, unibody design to prevent damage. According to Genki, this approach "distributes force evenly during drops", but I'm not entirely sure the Force Field 2 is capable of offering the same level of protection as, say, Genki's "virtually indestructible" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects">Sleeper Case</a> – and I'm not brave enough to perform a drop test! Another thing to note is that because this isn't a 'zipped' case, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-carry-case-the-official-option-is-a-solid-one">like the official Nintendo option</a>, you're going to get dust and other gunk drifting in over time.</p>
<p>Still, it does provide some protection, at least, and has the added bonus of improving the ergonomics of the console itself. There's also an Apple MagSafe-style ring on the rear, which will lead us neatly into the second part of this double review.</p>



<h2>Genki Energy Pack Review</h2>
<figure><a title="Review: Genki Force Field 2 And Energy Pack - The Ultimate Switch 2 'On The Road' Combo? 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7ced3c513871d/review-genki-force-field-2-and-energy-pack-the-ultimate-switch-2-on-the-road-combo-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Energy Pack (<a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/energy-pack">£59 / $69.99</a>) is a 10,000mAh capacity fast-charging battery that can deliver power to Switch 2 and any other device which charges over USB-C – that includes the Steam Deck and even your smartphone.</p>
<p>It attaches to the aforementioned MagSafe ring on the Force Field 2 (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">Attack Vector</a>) and connects to your Switch 2 using the bundled USB-C-to-USB-C cable, which is the perfect length for reaching either of the console's ports. This means you can effectively triple the battery life of your Switch 2 while you're on the move.</p>
<p>Constructed from CNC aluminium and boasting a real-time "digital dashboard" which gives you information on charging speed, remaining capacity and temperature, the Energy Pack works really well with the Force Field 2. The MagSafe connection is pretty strong, and it's the easiest thing in the world to simply bolt it onto the rear of the case and hook up the cable. Having said that, it does add quite a bit of weight to the console, and, if you're not careful, you can accidentally knock it during gameplay, causing it to fall off.</p>

<p>The aluminium body helps with heat dissipation, according to Genki, and there's a rubberised texture on the top so that when you lay your console down on a table, it doesn't scratch the Energy Pack's shell.</p>
<p>Another plus is that, thanks to Qi2 wireless charging compatibility, the Energy Pack works with Apple smartphones without the need for a charging cable. You just drop it onto your phone's MagSafe connector, and it starts charging. This is a real bonus for iPhone owners, as the official MagSafe Battery Pack has a lower capacity, lacks the real-time display and cost $99 at launch (it has since been discontinued and can be picked up for less than that, however).</p>
<p>If you don't have a MagSafe-compatible case on your Switch 2, you can affix one of the three MagSafe rings included with the Energy Pack to get the same effect. This does mean you're applying the ring directly to the rear of your Switch 2's case, which might make some people feel uneasy.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-dev-put-a-lot-of-effort-into-making-the-game-hit-performance-targets-on-wide-range-of-hardware-even-minimum-specs.1284096/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A good portion of the Battlefield 6 open beta PC players were on or below minimum specs, but the game's development team made sure all players could enjoy the open beta properly, regardless of their system configuration.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-dev-says-a-significant-number-of-users-played-the-game-below-the-minimum-recommended-specs-as-ea-points-to-the-importance-of-weaker-hardware">Eurogamer</a>, technical director Christian Buhl confirmed that of the millions of players who joined the Battlefield 6 open beta, a substantial number of them were on minimum specs or below. The team, however, wasn't caught unprepared, as they went to great lengths to ensure the open beta and the game would be playable on a wide range of system configurations, making sure maps were performant enough to hit certain performance targets regardless of the hardware. "<em>Min spec is certainly one of our most important spec, it's super important from both a commercial and business perspective - we want as many people as possible playing the game,"</em> Buhl added.</p>



<p>With the rising costs of living and PC hardware, Battlefield 6 running well on low-end hardware is welcome, although it remains to be seen if the remainder of the game will run as nicely as the open beta did. Some players will get the chance to test this out themselves before the game launches in a little over a month, as another round of testing via <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battlefield-labs-playtesting-resumes/">Battlefield Labs</a> is planned to test some of the changes coming to the game based on beta feedback, new maps like Operation Firestorm, and server browsing.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on October 10 worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-luna-i</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-version-luna-i-kicks-off-a-year-long-event-in-september.1284093/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version Luna I, a brand new update that's kicking off a year-long series of events themed around the moon.</p>

<p>Version Luna I, also known as "Song of the Welkin Moon: Segue", breaks with&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>tradition by eschewing the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-58-july" rel="nofollow">numbered designations</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-57-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous updates</a>. It's due to land on all platforms on September 10th.</p>

<p>First off, Version Luna I introduces the new region of Nod-Krai, where you'll "become entangled in rising conflicts between factions", as well as meeting three new Nod-Krai natives who you'll have a chance to recruit for your team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-i-release-date-enemies.jpg?itok=9q3Eepz4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-i-release-date-enemies.jpg?itok=Ikpz3ZbA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version Luna I will bring new enemies for you to fight and more.</figcaption></figure><p>The new region will bring new enemies and boss encounters for you to take on, as well as a new elemental lifeform that acts as a way to explore Nod-Krai and surmount its traversal puzzles.</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update without new characters to recruit, and the first of three new warriors for your team in this update is Lauma, a five-star Catalyst wielder who can boost Bloom damage and transform into a new half-human, half-deer form.</p>

<p>Joining her is Flins, a five-star Electro polearm user who can unleash powerful Lunar-charged strikes and "hear the whispers of the Wild Hunt during exploration". Lastly, Aino, a four-star Hydro Claymore user, adds "playful new interactions" to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, and you can recruit her for free.</p>

<p>We also got some more information about&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s user-generated content system, otherwise known as the Miliastra Sandbox, which will allow you to create your own experiences within the game,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-style. It's coming as part of the next update after this one.</p>




<p>As always, news of the new&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update also came alongside codes you can use to get yourself some free goodies in the game, and here they are!</p>

<ul><li>LunaI0910 - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>LaumaNodKraiFlins - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>HiFiveTraveler - 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s latest update comes after developer HoYoverse announced it will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">stop supporting the PS4 version</a> of the gacha RPG next year.</p>

<p>The date of Version Luna I is also the day on which you'll no longer be able to download&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>on Sony's last-gen machine if you've never done so before, but don't worry; you can still play if you've downloaded it already, and what's more, the PS5 version will be unaffected by this change.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Battlefield 6’s open beta done and dusted and its October 10 release date in sight, developer DICE is prepping the shooter for launch across PC and console. But it is on PC specifically that EA's anti-cheat efforts have raised eyebrows, and even caused some fans to miss out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PC gamers who played the Battlefield 6 open beta might have run into the following on-screen warning: ‘Secure Boot is not enabled.’ Indeed, if you want to play Battlefield 6 on PC you have no choice but to enable Secure Boot. And based on the open beta, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-forces-pc-gamers-to-mess-about-with-their-bios-to-enable-secure-boot-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-next">some had trouble with it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enabling Secure Boot involves tinkering with a part of a computer not all PC gamers will be instantly familiar with: the BIOS (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/How_to_Enable_Secure_Boot">check out IGN's guide for more</a>). There are things like TPM 2.0 (which must be turned on) to deal with, and you need to make sure your Windows disk is GPT and not MBR (not everyone will know what these are). All this before you can even enable Secure Boot — and then you may not be able to enable it anyway, which then means you need to refer to your manufacturer for guidance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While this won’t be a problem for more experienced PC gamers, it will be an intimidating process for some. And according to DICE, it knows these anti-cheat measures will prevent some people from playing Battlefield 6 at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-really-sucks-battlefield-6-technical-director-bummed-out-about-those-unable-to-play-due-to-secure-boot-requirement-believes-anti-cheat-cat-and-mouse-game-will-never-end" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a>, Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl lamented the situation. "The fact is I wish we didn't have to do things like Secure Boot," Buhl said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It does prevent some players from playing the game. Some people's PCs can't handle it and they can't play; that really sucks. I wish everyone could play the game with low friction and not have to do these sorts of things."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/screenshot-2025-08-06-214819-1754555745386-1756471937073.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 forces players to enable Secure Boot on PC.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Buhl sounds pleased with the effectiveness of the likes of Secure Boot, which are “some of the strongest tools in our toolbox to stop cheating.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were pretty happy with how the anti-cheat performed. Obviously I'll say we can never be perfect, anti-cheat is always a cat-and-mouse game where we're constantly going back and forth and keeping on top of what the cheaters are doing. But from the beginning this was something we put a high priority on, so when we launch this game we have a really strong anti-cheat program in place."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buhl continued: “Again, nothing makes cheating impossible, but enabling Secure Boot and having kernel-level access makes it so much harder to cheat and so much easier for us to find and stop cheating."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s no secret that cheating in competitive multiplayer games is a huge problem for publishers. Activision, for example, has spent millions trying to reverse the narrative for Call of Duty, and TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are in place for Black Ops 7 on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Secure Boot caused some people problems, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-huge-queue-to-get-in-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-before-its-even-out"><u>the Battlefield 6 open beta enjoyed huge player numbers on Steam</u></a>, so it will be interesting to see how this goes at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>
PC modders have already begun optimising <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, even before Konami has released further updates.
</p>
<p>
The Metal Gear remake has been criticised for its poor performance, with videos shared on social media of jarring stuttering. In particular, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> version has come under fire.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-issues-acknowledged-by-konami-patch-on-the-way">Konami acknowledged a handful of specific issues</a> ahead of launch, though general optimisation wasn't included. In just a couple of days, though, PC modders have taken matters into their own hands.

Modder FrancisLouis, for instance, has created the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/4">Metal Gear Optimiser mod</a> on NexusMods, which "reduces stuttering by optimising shader compilation and assets streaming". FrancisLouis notes results can vary depending on hardware.
</p>
<p>
Other mods - such as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/47">Better Uncap FPS v1.2 from Mstrthief</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/46">Unlocked FPS from Hybred</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/40">Unlock FG and FPS from Velasquez</a> among others - seek to provide an unlocked framerate and other benefits
</p>
<p>
It's clear optimisation is a priority among modders, who have seemingly been able to make improvements quicker than an official patch from Konami - though of course, mods aren't always reliable.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the funniest mod for the game, though, is from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/33">Fiend</a>, which allows players to swap Snake for Metal Gear creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>.</p>
<p>Kojima has stated in interviews <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-hideo-kojima-wont-be-playing-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">he won't be playing the remake himself</a>, likely due to his acrimonious split from Konami. But that hasn't stopped players putting him in the game instead.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-ceo-blames-unreal-engine-5-issues-on-developers-but-more-support-incoming">Epic boss Tim Sweeney blamed developers for any optimisation issues when using Unreal Engine 5</a> - Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater being one such game to use the engine.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As a response to the enforcement of the UK Online Safety Act (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-requires-age-verification-in-the-uk-for-mature-game-pages/">VGC</a>), Valve has begun requesting and requiring that UK players verify their age if they want to access any content pages marked as 'mature' on the platform.</p>



<p>Unlike other age verification processes we've started to see that <a href="https://wccftech.com/youtube-tests-ai-powered-age-verification-in-the-u-s-to-safeguard-teens/">rely on AI tools</a>, Valve is taking a simpler approach, and enforcing age verification through users inputting their credit card on Steam. A <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/fr/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">support page outlining how it'll work</a> explains that this route was chosen due to UK regulations around needing to be 18 years of age to have a credit card in your name, and because "<em>this process preserves the maximum degree of user privacy</em>."</p>



<p>Users online began to notice this was in effect as of last Friday, according to VGC, though if you're over 18 with your own credit card registered to your Steam account, then you wouldn't have known the verification had begun since you would already be past its requirements.</p>



<p>"<em>In the UK, Ofcom is the independent regulator for online safety. Ofcom's guidance on the OSA states that one highly effective age assurance measure is credit card checks. This is because, in the UK, an individual must be at least 18 years of age to obtain a credit card, therefore credit card issuers are obliged to verify the age of an applicant before providing them with a credit card.</em>..<em>The data processed in the verification process is identical to that of the millions of other Steam users who make purchases or store their payment details for convenience. The verification process therefore provides no information about a user's content preferences to payment providers or other third parties.</em>"</p>



<p>Valve is one of several companies that have begun instituting age verification. Some, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-age-verification-changes-uk-eu-users/">Nexus Mods</a>, are still trying to work out how age verification will be implemented, but have confirmed that it is coming. Others, like Rockstar's <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-age-verification/">GTA Online</a> have yet to confirm that it is being implemented, but some version of verification being enforced seems highly likely. So far, these verification implementations have mostly impacted users in the UK and the EU.</p>

            <p>Are you from the UK and partial to risque adult Steam games, such as Amarillo's Butt Slapper - the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> of Butt Slapping - or the timelessly iconic MILFs of Sunville? Bad! Naughty! GO DIRECTLY TO BED. Unless you have a valid credit card. Steam have begun rolling out a requirement for all UK-based users to verify their ages, if they wish to access store pages for games rated mature.</p>
<p>You should already have done this, of course, if you've bought anything on Steam, which I'm going to assume is 90% of you, with the other 10% being GOG stopouts, holier-than-thou Itch lovers and stinky pirates. According to reports, debit cards are acceptable too.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The regulation follows the passing of the UK's Online Safety Act, which now requires a host of online platforms to impose age verification systems, so as to protect younger people from pornography (among other things). I will offer no further comment on the OSA at this stage - it's after 2pm on Friday, which is far too late in the week to have Opinions - but I'm relieved to discover that I can still google images of donkey willies on a work PC. Eurogamer's Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">a fuller write-up</a>, if you're interested.</p>
<p>Valve have a <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/fr/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">Steam blog</a> up, which explains the process for age verification and the need for a credit card in particular.</p>
<p>"In the UK, Ofcom is the independent regulator for online safety. Ofcom's guidance on the OSA states that one highly effective age assurance measure is credit card checks," it reads. "This is because, in the UK, an individual must be at least 18 years of age to obtain a credit card, therefore credit card issuers are obliged to verify the age of an applicant before providing them with a credit card.
</p>
<p>"Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons," the post continues.
</p>
<p>According to the Redditors who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1n34vzd/uk_users_must_verify_their_age_to_access_steam/">spotted all this earlier today</a> (ta, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-requires-age-verification-in-the-uk-for-mature-game-pages/">VGC</a>), debit cards appear to be acceptable at least for the time being. Which is good, because I don't have a credit card, and I'd sure hate to be unable to buy *googles random adult games again* "Ideology In Friction"? I didn't know Althusser made a porno.</p><p>Valve have had a busy few months in terms of adult-rated controversy. As you're hopefully very well aware, given that we wouldn't shut up about it, they've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">changed</a> Steam's regulations to give banks and credit card networks a say on the definition of acceptable NSFW games. A bunch of games have been delisted as a consequence. In connection to all that, Paypal recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries">pulled support for Steam purchases in certain countries</a> at the behest of one of their acquiring banks.</p>

              <p>Hit the button! The big red one. Over <em>there</em>. Fine, I’ll hit it. *LOUD MUSIC STARTS* Folks, it’s Friday! We made it to the weekend. But first, before you go off and enjoy the last work day of the week, please read today’s Morning Checkpoint. Today, we’re talking about <em>The Last of Us </em>TV show, looking at the future of S<em>pace Marine 2,</em> checking out some sales data for<em> Cyberpunk 2077,</em> and learning what Kojima thinks of AI. Someone hit that button again. It’s too loud, I can’t think.</p> <h2>Hideo Kojima thinks AI is the next big gaming revolution</h2> <p>The <em>Death Stranding 2</em> director was in the midst of his Saudi Arabia tour stop when he opined on how games are changing. “Gaming is always about technology,” he said during a panel discussion, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/hideo-kojima-nicolas-winding-refn-blur-lines-games-cinema-1235416035/"><em>Rolling Stone</em> reports</a>. “At first, the games were all 2D, about 16 colors, 16 bits…the biggest, first change was [that] games became 3D. The second is we [became] connected by [the] internet, and you could play [online]. The third is the trend right now that AI is now coming into game creation, and we have not just ChatGPT, but they learn from how the players control. And I think that you’ll take advantage of that.”</p> <p>But Kojima seems more interested in going to the movies or visiting museums than chatting with bots and playing games. “I probably just play maybe one game a year,” he said.</p>

 <h2><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Switch 2 sold far more physical copies than digital</h2> <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/75-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical/">As spotted by <em>VGC</em></a>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> developer CD Projekt revealed during the company’s latest financial results that its open-world sci-fi RPG featuring Keanu Reeves was a big hit on Switch 2. Interestingly, 75 percent of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> copies sold on Switch 2 in June were physical game cards. This is notable as CD Projekt Red opted not to use the controversial game key card system, and instead, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was one of the biggest third-party Switch 2 launch window games to ship entirely on a physical game cart.</p> <p>Considering <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was reportedly the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-set-a-us-launch-month-record-at-1-6-million-units/">best-selling third-party game on Nintendo’s new console</a>, it seems Switch 2 owners, at least for now, prefer a real physical copy over key card shenanigans.</p>

 <h2><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em> is getting a brand new class in 2026</h2> <p><em>Space Marine 2</em> launched a year ago this month. To celebrate the third-person shooter entering its second year, <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/news/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-unveils-its-year-2-roadmap-and-sets-its-anniversary-update-to-september-4">Saber Interactive has released a new roadmap</a> for it that promises a lot of new content, including a new class: The Techmarine. The studio didn’t share many details about the new class, but did confirm that Techmarines will get to wield Omnissiah Axes, a new exclusive weapon. Beyond the new class, the next year of content includes new PVE missions, PVP maps, fresh cosmetic options, and more.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Space Marine 2 - Year 2 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CxtlJ06u_lc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>New report claims Sony is planning a Switch-like PS6 handheld</h2> <p>YouTube channel and reliable tech leaker and reporter <a href="https://youtu.be/x-A3Bl2hXoQ">Moore’s Law Is Dead claims in a new video</a> to have seen multiple documents mentioning that Sony is working on a portable, handheld PlayStation 6 console that will launch alongside a more powerful, traditional machine. Notably, the channel claims that this PS6 handheld will support the ability to dock and connect to a TV, like the Switch, turning it into a more traditional home console. Moore’s Law Is Dead speculates that this PS6 portable console might cost around $500 and could ship sometime in 2027.</p>

 <h2>Bella Ramsey tells <em>Last of Us</em> TV show haters to go play the game</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-star-bella-ramsey-has-a-message-for-the-haters/1100-6534348/">As reported by <em>GameSpot</em> and <em>Culture Crave</em>,&nbsp;</a> Ellie actor Bella Ramsey talked about HBO’s <em>The Last of Us</em> and its already aired season two, as well as the upcoming season three. She discussed the death of Joel in season two and negative reactions to the show’s second year, saying:</p> <p>“There is nothing I can do about it anyway. The show is out. There is nothing that can be changed or altered [for Season 2]. There is not really any point in reading or looking at anything. People are of course entitled to their opinions. It doesn’t affect the show, it doesn’t affect how the show continues or anything, in any way, so they’re very separate things to me. So no, I just don’t really engage.”</p> <p>She also added that people who dislike the series can stop watching, explaining, “I would say, you don’t have to watch it. If you hate it that much, the game exists. You can just play the game again. You don’t have to watch [Season 3]. If you do want to watch it, I hope you enjoy it,”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/voidbreaker-fps-review-steam-pc-gamepass-titanfall-roguelike-roguelite-2000621067">The best new game you’re not playing is <i>Hades</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Portal</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Titanfall</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Battlefield</i></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003"><em>Diablo</em> developers unionized: “Passion can’t protect us from job instability”</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-woa-freelancer-world-of-assassination-roguelike-2000620985"><em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em> quietly became a lot more than just the best stealth game around</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="I Bought 100 Copies of Mario Paint for the Art" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHuQZVtzdIo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

<p>Video games can take a long time to make. Certain titles receive extensive development time—Hollow Knight: Silksong being an apt case study. Its development became one of myth and legend at one point, but Team Cherry’s carefully created baby is ready to be born into the world.</p>



<p>I played <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong at Gamescom 2025</a>. My 15-minute demo gave me instant hope that the sequel is going to live up to the fevered hype. I’ve said before that you will struggle to find an indie sequel with this much popularity and pressure resting on its nimble shoulders.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>‘s development ride has taken a few detours. Let’s revisit history and fill in some blanks for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-has-team-cherry-developed-hollow-knight-silksong-for">How Long Has Team Cherry Developed Hollow Knight: Silksong For?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hopefully, it’s worth the wait. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s estimated that Hollow Knight: Silksong’s development first began in 2018, meaning the game has been in development for seven long years!</strong></p>



<p>This means official work on Silksong began only one year after Hollow Knight was released, and a year before the general public was introduced to Hollow Knight: Silksong altogether.</p>



<p>A fascinating article was released in August 2025 detailing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why Hollow Knight: Silksong took so long to release</a>. Quite simply, Team Cherry was having too much fun crafting the game, experimenting with new ideas, and making sure Silksong was worthy of being a sequel—instead of the DLC it was originally intended as.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-was-hollow-knight-silksong-first-announced">When Was Hollow Knight: Silksong First Announced?</h2>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong was first revealed to the world on Feb. 14, 2019, through its reveal trailer.</strong></p>



<p>You can find the “Hollow Knight: Silksong Reveal Trailer” on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TeamCherry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a>‘s YouTube channel. The two-minute trailer shows off a decent amount of Silksong, and it seemed like it wouldn’t be <em>that </em>long until we got our hands on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-hollow-knight-silksong-a-sequel-or-prequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>.</p>



<p>Little did we know that it would take over six years until the game launched (and it’s still not technically out yet).</p>



<p>Check out the original reveal trailer below and see if you can spot anything from the Silksong demo or recent trailers and footage.</p>

<hr>



<p>You can throw the words myth and legend into the bin. Silksong is coming. Team Cherry’s effort should be worth the wait, and I’ll be diving into Pharloom the second it launches. I’m genuinely so excited for Silksong, but let me know your thoughts on it through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p>You should also stick around and see if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong is on the Switch or Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-hollow-knight-before-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if you need to play Hollow Knight before Silksong</a>.</p>
