			<p>CREATOR: gd-jpeg v1.0 (using IJG JPEG v62), default quality</p>		</div><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As is tradition at this point, I have played a ridiculous number of demos in readiness for the launch of the Steam Next Fest. Many of these were interesting, whilst a depressing number were either non-functional, riddled with AI slop, or, in the case of horror games, eerily repetitive due to taking place in the same Unity asset house that I’ve seen countless times before. Those negative aspects aside, there are a load of great-looking titles on the horizon and here’s my top 10 horror demos (notable titles Holstin and Tormented Souls 2 will be getting their own posts once I’ve played them).</p>
<hr>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3555980/Caput_Mortum/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Caput Mortem</a></h3>
<p>Caput Mortum is an immersive sim with an innovative control scheme and a fantastic sense of atmosphere. Your hand is controlled by the right stick while camera controls are carried out through the shoulder buttons. This takes a little getting used to and makes the combat extra challenging but the puzzle-solving potential is obvious. The 16<sup>th</sup>-century setting is an extra bonus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Caput Mortum | Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ESYEM-0cb_g?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767530/Wicked_Seed/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Wicked Seed</a></h3>
<p>Wicked Seed brings a novel fusion of traditional survival horror and JRPG in a modern third-person perspective. The generous demo contains a significant slice of the game and shows the depth of the combat and an interesting range of puzzles. Whilst a little rough around the edges, this shows immense potential.</p>


<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835690/The_Demons_Told_Me_to_Make_This_Game/">The Demons Told Me to Make This Game</a></h2>
<p>This one like a knowing horror take on the RPG/adventure stylings of Disco Elysium as you control a spirit who must possess humans to prevent a demonic catastrophe. Whilst dying is normally the end in games, here it becomes a learning opportunity as you reverse time and use your knowledge to take things in a different direction. Witty and clever, I’m keen to see how complex the time management becomes in the full version.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Demons Told Me to Make This Game - Official Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VucibRZS8xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2768030/Saborus/">Saborus</a></h3>
<p>Saborus sees you take on the role of a chicken trying to escape from a sinister meat-packing facility. Whilst the human workers are a terrifying threat in and of themselves, there is also a strange conspiracy at work trying to use genetic experimentation to create freakishly large animals to maximise production. Whilst I initially thought this was a meme game, it actually plays pretty well with your chicken being able to pick up objects in its beak and wander across computer keyboards to activate machinery.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Saborus - Announcement Trailer | Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X and Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TRAec9RGu-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975680/__Revelation_of_Decay/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Revelation of Decay</a></h3>
<p>This top-down pixel survival game is equal parts Stardew Valley and Days Gone with added co-op potential. While the demo establishes the main controls, it is obvious that this is a game that could consume you if you let it, with an absolute wealth of mechanics and content. I’m certainly keen to get my online friends involved (even if just to stop them playing the awful 7 Days to Die!)</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Revelation of Decay: A Pixel-Style Survival Video Game Incorporating Farming and Fighting Zombies" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-oSNHt2PrFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3462190/PHASE_ZERO/">Phase Zero</a></h2>
<p>A traditional Resident Evil PSX clone with graphics and controls to match. The combat is super challenging in this build, whilst puzzles are fresh but familiar enough for genre fans to appreciate. The demo takes place in a hospital, which feels perfectly on point, but there are plenty of new touches to distinguish it from the games that clearly influence it. Above all else, finishing the demo unlocks a legs-only character model, which indicates the devs have a keen sense of the absurdity of the best classic survival horror games.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="PHASE ZERO - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a1h-GV6rfgc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3197890/LURKS_WITHIN_WALLS/">Lurks Within Walls</a></h3>
<p>Lurks Within Walls is another genre fusion, in this case taking survival horror and mixing it up with classic grid-based dungeon crawling. The end result is a game that cleverly combines the best of both genres to give a real sense of fragility and claustrophobia.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="LURKS WITHIN WALLS | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SSCKJO84w4Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1645630/FEROCIOUS/">Ferocious</a></h3>
<p>Ferocious is the latest game to capitalise on the terrifying potential of dinosaurs, this time emphasising the survival part of survival horror. When you are capsized on a mysterious island, you must venture forth to find your brother. Along your path, you’ll discover ancient ruins, oversized insects, mercenary gangs and lethal carnivorous dinosaurs. The demo itself is a little too focused on human enemies, but the systems feel soli,d and the potential for prehistoric enemies in this genre is clear.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ferocious Gameplay Trailer  - Open Playtest Just Started! | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E0nB4Hf8zC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2419670/Eclipsium/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Eclipsium</a></h3>
<p>Eclipsium is one of the most visually striking games I’ve played in a while. Standard first-person exploration is elevated by a highly dithered artstyle that feels like a fever dream. This style is appropriate as the game itself appears to take place in a dreamworld and dying sees you wake up in your bedroom again only to step out of the door and find yourself back in the dream. The demo is largely focused on puzzle solving but has a fantastic sense of atmosphere to accompany the visuals.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Eclipsium Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMHF5I7p3GU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3511700/Flesh_Made_Fear_Demo/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Flesh Made Fear</a></h3>
<p>Another classic Resident Evil clone, but one that absolutely nails the atmosphere and feel of the original series. You play as one of two alternative members of the special R.I.P. squad and must track down a sinister scientist and prevent him from bringing about a catastrophe. However, it soon becomes clear that you may be too late as you face hordes of shambling zombies and other more dangerous mutations. Everything from the controls to the voice acting screams classic Resi and this sizeable demo really shows off the feel of the game.</p>

<p><em>As always, new demos are being added to the Next Fest as it begins so let me know in the comments if any other interesting horror games have caught your eye. Next up I’ll have a list of other more general games that I enjoyed!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mouse-pi-for-hire-preview-spilling-buckets-of-ink<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been following&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</em>&nbsp;for quite a while now, and it really is awesome to see a game grow into something truly special. The progress Fumi Games has made since first showing off&nbsp;<em>Mouse</em>&nbsp;is nothing short of incredible.</p>

<p>To that end, I was honored to get a hands-off look at&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</em>&nbsp;during Summer Game Fest 2025. We followed the protagonist, Jack Pepper, as he shoots his way through an Opera House in order to prevent an assassination.</p>



<h2>Taking on Big Mouse</h2>

<p>Before my presentation, I was under the impression&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</em>&nbsp;was a boomer shooter. The type of FPS that's mostly pure run-and-gun, non-stop shooting. That perception is wrong, and I'm actually glad to see it's something much more.</p>

<p>Boomer shooters are great and all, but it's quite a saturated field at this point. <i>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</i>&nbsp;may or may not have started development as a simple shooter, but it's definitely grown into its own thing.</p>

<p>It's more narrative-laden and exploration of levels also seems to be emphasized in the demo. Jack Pepper talks with several different NPCs throughout the demo, and each character has its own voice actor, too.</p>



<p>Jack Pepper is voiced by Troy Baker, so you know that his performance is going to knock it out of the park. Other characters have a squeaky, gangster-like accent which is what I'd expect from the noir vibes&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire&nbsp;</em>is going for.</p>

<p>So, our player explores ways to enter the Opera House to prevent an assassination of a mouse named Stilton. It's a bit difficult to understand the context of the story at this point, but the main thing I want to focus on is that there is definitely a goal in the story Jack is working towards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He combs his way through this Opera House, first incognito through the kitchen (staffed by cartoonish mice, of course) then through an air duct. Either way, his plans on going in quiet go awry, and it's time to take out the big guns.</p>





<p>Gunplay in&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire&nbsp;</em>looks nothing short of excellent. Every 2D element in the game is hand-drawn the old-school way, so that means guns are expertly animated, as are various NPCs, since they're all 2D too.</p>

<p>Guns have this wiggly look to them that oozes with old fashioned charm. Everything about the firing animations are exaggerated. Enemies die in the goofiest ways. Words really can't do it justice.</p>

<p>One gun, in particular, left me laughing. The Turpentine Gun melts enemies, literally. Since&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</em>&nbsp;enemies are hand-drawn, turpentine, a paint, strips their skin down to the bone. Regular guns make enemies bleed ink, which is just as ridiculous and silly.</p>



<p>After fighting through various rooms across this surprisingly large opera house, we reach the backstage and foil the assassination plot. Prima Donna, a portly mouse, drops from the ceiling and attacks Jack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A short mini-boss battle ensues. Prima Donna seems tough, but it's nothing you can't handle. Her gimmick is charging after you, so dodging and weaving is the key here. She takes more bullets than your normal enemy,&nbsp; but the turpentine gun makes short work of her.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The remainder of the demonstration involves a chaotic, mad dash to the exit of the building. The building is now burning down, and various enemies are charging after you while parts of the environment crumble away, trying to bar your path.</p>

<p>I really can't praise&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire&nbsp;</em>enough. It's a game that oozes with creativity in a genre that's already highly competitive. I would still love to get my hands on it and play it for myself, but for now, just watching it is more than enough to know I'm sold.&nbsp;</p>

Finding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P: Overture</a> a bit too hard? Don't worry, I'm not going to tell you just "get good" like those randos you see littered all over Twitter. I'm actually here to say that you're not alone on this one. The story expansion for the conceptually weirdest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> in town dropped during Geoff's Onslaught Of Generally OK Announcements (aka, Summer Game Fest) as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-overture-gets-surprise-release-right-now-so-you-can-play-it-instead-of-staring-at-geoffs-awful-shoes">surprise release</a>, and it seems like the general feedback so far has been "please make it a bit easier so Twinkocchio doesn't get battered so hard."

<p>
In a Director's Letter shared earlier today from Jiwon Choi, the game director shared that the team has been reviewing all of the feedback they've received over the past few days and are "already looking into when to implement some of your suggestions." Specifically, they'll be paying "closest attention to the combat experience.

"We identified areas that did not turn out quite as we intended. Therefore, we are reviewing various adjustments, including difficulty reduction. However, combat is one of the most fundamental experiences in Lies of P, so any modifications or changes require meticulous work and thorough testing."
</p>
<p>
Probably worth noting that this letter didn't feature any kind of window as to when the patch might be coming. Choi explained that the video was more to let P-Heads (that's what I like to call Lies of P fans) know that changes will be coming somewhere down the line.
</p>
<p>
That previously announced update that includes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-ps-upcoming-easy-difficulty-modes-have-wonderfully-unhelpful-names">new difficulty settings</a> arrived with the DLC too, allowing you to either make both it and the base game easier or harder. Feeling very thankful to have not seen any of the usual annoying discourse when it comes to such features in Soulslikes, but alas, there's always tomorrow.

<header><section>
<p>But PS5 and Xbox Series X|S have it beat</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c0fc6cf3e7b3c/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 is Nintendo's biggest console launch of all time in the UK, according to NielsenIQ data shared with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/how-a-nearly-six-hour-phone-call?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=357pt4&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">The Game Business</a>.</p>
<p>While NielsenIQ does not share specific figures, the Switch 2 has reportedly outsold the original Switch by more than 2 to 1 (though it should be noted that the Switch 1 was pretty hard to come by in those early months).</p>
<p>According to Nintendo, the Switch 1 sold over 80,000 units at launch, while the 3DS managed 113,000. So we're probably looking at around 160,000 units for the Switch 2, at least. That said, with the UK being a notoriously difficult market for Nintendo, the Switch 2 has not managed to outperform the PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the top ten best-selling console launches in the UK:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. PlayStation 5<br>
2. PlayStation 4<br>
3. Xbox Series<br>
4. Nintendo Switch 2<br>
5. PlayStation 3<br>
6. Xbox One<br>
7. Nintendo Wii<br>
8. Nintendo Switch<br>
9. Xbox 360<br>
10. Xbox One X</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also reported that the Switch 2 has sold more than 200,000 units in France, making it the biggest console launch of all time in the region, selling almost double that of the previous record-holder, the PS5.</p>
<p>Chances are Nintendo will share global sales data for the Switch 2 fairly soon. The company has forecast sales of around 15 million units for the first financial year, and it's said that the Switch 2 could well be the biggest console launch of all time.</p>

			<p>Funcom's large-scale multiplayer survival game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-surprisingly-adds-private-servers-at-launch/">Dune: Awakening</a> is now out for all players after its strong head-start weekend, with a new gameplay trailer debuted to mark the event.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening has already had a great start to its launch, with more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/">117K players at once jumping in for the head start weekend,</a> which was only available to those who had pre-ordered the game's deluxe edition. Anyone who just bought the base game is free to head to Arrakis now, but it's a credit to Funcom that the game is already hitting high concurrent numbers like that with just deluxe edition owners.</p>
<p>While Dune: Awakening is out for players on PC today, it isn't out for those looking to head to Arrakis on consoles. We've known for a while now that the game would be coming to PC first, but it looks like players on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S will have to wait until next year to play Dune: Awakening.</p>
<p>In a press release for today's launch, Funcom confirmed that the game will be out on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S "<em>sometime in 2026</em>."</p>
<p>The studio also debuted a new trailer for the full launch, which is a massive cut of previous trailers smashed together for the game's full launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening — Your Path to Awakening" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOGwZO_i-6o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just yesterday, ahead of today's launch, Funcom's chief executive and technical officer, Rui Casais, delivered a message to players, thanking those who had already jumped in for play, and their patience, as Funcom does its best to respond to any issues that come up in the course of the game's launch.</p>
<p>"<em>Believe it or not, we do look at all your feedback across social media, Discord, support tickets, and Steam reviews. And we're working around the clock to mitigate any issues you find and improve the overall experience,</em>" Casais said in his video to players.</p>
<p>He also addressed players who have expressed issues with long queue times, saying that more servers will be added for today's full launch, and that Funcom is working to make sure player distribution between servers is evenly balanced. "<em>Worry not, there is enough capacity for all of you,</em>" Casais said.</p>
<p>And though Casais expressed confidence that Funcom is on top of everything with the launch of its latest big online multiplayer game, that didn't stop him from asking players to have some patience with the studio in these early days.</p>
<p>"<em>Funcom has been making online worlds like this for 25 years, and I have been personally doing it for soon 24, and I can tell you this is my most exciting launch so far. I can't wait to see more of you enjoying the game, and would ask you to please bear with us, if not everything is silky smooth when we open the game tomorrow. This is only the beginning. We have years' worth of plans for Dune: Awakening, and I want to once again thank you all for joining us on this journey.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/684247/xbox-ally-x-hands-on-gears-of-war-reloaded<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Xbox has revealed its new handheld line, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">the ROG Xbox Ally and the Ally X</a>, made in partnership with Asus. And I got the chance to play it during Summer Game Fest. My colleague Tom Warren has already broken down <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">how the handheld works</a> with its operating system, UI, and integration with the Xbox app and third-party game stores. Meanwhile, I’ll get into the simple experience of playing the dang thing — and the biggest selling point, for me, was comfort.</p><p>Despite my best efforts, the Xbox PR reps did not let me peek at the device’s storefronts or play the much-anticipated <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. So for this brief hands-on overview, I’ll cover the game that I did get to play — <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>. </p><p>I can sum up my experience with the Xbox Ally X (as I recall, the less powerful white Xbox Ally was not available) with a few words: I need this. The Xbox Ally X felt roughly the same weight as a Steam Deck. But with its hand grips, modeled to resemble the form factor of an Xbox controller, it felt like a literal dream. </p><p>I’ve struggled with my Steam Deck for a long time because it’s not comfortable to hold. After extended gaming sessions, my hands stiffen into claws that take a moment to regain their flexibility and normal use. While I wasn’t able to spend hours playing the Xbox Ally X to test my hands’ endurance, I could already notice the difference in my fingers within moments of picking it up. It felt <em>good</em> to hold, both in weight and form factor.</p><p>As for playing <em>Gears</em>, it was a seamless experience. Microsoft had the remaster of the seminal Xbox shooter (its second remaster in the game’s 25-year history) set up across the different platforms that the game supports. I played on a regular Ally at first, then I moved over to the Xbox Ally X, and the differences were subtle but noticeable. The device’s weight felt comparable to a Steam Deck. I performed better on the Ally X, which could be a component of having already warmed up, but my shooting was tighter and more accurate. </p><p>Visually, between the Ally and the Xbox Ally X, I didn’t notice a difference, but I really wasn’t looking for one. I was so enamored with how comfortable it felt in my hands that any graphical differences seemed less important in comparison. I wish I could have seen more of the home UI to judge the ease of loading in games or jumping from Steam games to Xbox games or judge Xbox Play Anywhere games versus those streamed from an Xbox or over the cloud. But like I said, the eagle-eyed PR folks kept this to a <em>Gears </em>demonstration only. </p><p>I love the portability of my Steam Deck, Switch, and PS Portal. Those three are my preferred ways to play over my desktop and consoles. While there are still a lot of question marks around the Xbox Ally X, particularly with its interface and how it holds up over long sessions, that little bit of comfort has gone a long way to selling me on a portable Xbox.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, combat is one of the most fundamental experiences in <em>Lies of P</em>, so any modifications or changes require meticulous work and thorough testing. We are still reviewing the specific details and schedule for a patch, but we wanted to let you know as soon as possible why it’s taking our team some time, and the general direction we’re heading.”</p><p>The citizens of Krat can breathe a small sigh of relief than knowing that their slog through Overture might become a little more forgiving in the weeks ahead, though a set release date for the upcoming patch, as well as what Neowiz actually plans to change, remains pending. In the meantime, we can liberate ourselves from our Soulsborne shame and make use of the newly-introduced easier modes. </p><p>“The release of additional easier difficulties alongside the DLC almost seems like a justification for how much of a difficulty wall there is between the base game and the DLC—enemies hit stupidly hard, and have stupidly high HP,” wrote one player on Steam. “If you’re into that, great, but I found the DLC far more enjoyable when I went down a difficulty, and it felt like a far more natural progression on the base game.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-vs-is-a-brutal-bloody-3v3-tag-fighter</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/invincible-vs-is-a-brutal-bloody-3v3-tag-fighter.1214580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-vs-is-a-brutal-bloody-3v3-tag-fighter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Some things just feel right. When I first laid eyes on Invincible VS, my thoughts were something along the lines of, “Yeah, that makes sense.” If you were going to choose a comic book to adopt into a fighting game, you could do a lot worse than Robert Kirkman’s magnum opus. It’s got everything you need for a tag fighter: bone-crushing hits, a big cast to draw from, a cool art style, plenty of unique superpowers that can easily be converted into special moves, the works. But Invincible VS has a secret weapon, too: its developer, Quarter Up. That name might not be familiar to you yet – they’re a new studio – but they’re anything but rookies. Several members of the 40+ person development team played a core role in the development of 2013’s Killer Instinct, and you can feel that influence. Seeing Invincible VS is one thing, but when I sat down to play it and speak with members of the team, I knew I was among fellow sickos – and I mean that in the most complimentary way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the problems with previewing a fighting game is that you never have enough time with it to really dig into its systems. This is an incredibly complex genre; every time you sit down with a new fighting game, it’s a new experience. Some of it is like riding a bike. Hold back to block. Your assist button will also tag if you hold it. That sort of thing. But a lot of it is new. You gotta learn your button layout; you gotta figure out how combos work, what kind of defensive systems you have, what your special moves do, all kinds of stuff. If I had my way, I would have spent hours in Invincible VS’s training mode just tinkering with teams and learning how things worked. As it was, I only had about an hour. But even with such limited time, I left feeling like I knew what Invincible VS was by the time I put my fightstick down.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Invincible VS - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way: Invincible VS is still very, very early in development. It absolutely nails the look and general vibe of the show, mostly because Quarter Up is working directly with the folks who made it. There's still a lot left to do (the build I played didn't have proper lip syncing yet, for instance), but if you’re worried about whether this will honor the source material, don't be.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you’re worried about whether this will honor the source material, don't be.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible is a brutal, bloody, often shocking story, and that’s reflected in how the characters interact on-screen. If you’re the one dishing out the hurt, your character will quite literally get blood on their hands. It just isn't theirs. Meanwhile, if you’re the one getting hit, it'll be obvious. If you’ve been blocking with your face, the bruises will make sure everyone knows it. That pristine costume will look like you’ve lost a fight with a lawnmower; the rest of you will resemble a prizefighter who just went 12 rounds with a heavyweight… or just Mark himself after he’s been fighting his dad. Invincible VS is far from the first fighting game to do real-time battle damage, but it looks great, and I appreciated how I could tell who was winning without looking at the health gauge at the top of the screen,  and that it matched the show’s visual language. There’s <em>a lot</em> of blood here, folks. And hey, if you end a fight with the right special or super move (and we’ll dig into the gameplay in a second, I promise), you can pop Atom Eve’s head off or turn Bulletproof into a series of limbs missing a torso.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s not just the characters absorbing all this damage. The environments will feel the impact of these super-powered brawls, too. There’s less of a visible impact on the moon because… well, the moon is kinda empty. But in a city? You’re gonna see buildings falling down, cars getting totaled, streets getting torn up, the works. Superheroes trying to kill each other generally doesn't go well for anyone (or anything) else in the immediate area. And hey, just because you start a brawl in a city street doesn’t mean it’ll end there. You can absolutely punch somebody so hard they break orbit (or end up on another, different stage).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, so the presentation stuff is really cool, but the appeal of any fighting game is the actual fighting. I didn’t have enough time to really dig into Invincible VS’s core systems, but a fighting game can’t just have smart design choices backing it. Landing hits has to feel good, too. And Invincible VS has that part down pat. In a lot of ways, it resembles the tag fighters of yesteryear, but there are some unique twists here. You’ve got your standard light, medium, and heavy attacks, as well as a light autocombo for folks like me who were just starting out. Special moves are their own button, but Invincible VS doesn't use motion inputs. You choose your special kind of like you do in Super Smash Bros: pick a direction and press that special button.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So the core gameplay is a lot like Marvel or Dragon Ball FighterZ. Lights go into mediums, which go into heavies (though you can do things like switching between crouching and standing normals to spice things up and open up new routes), and down and heavy gets you a launcher for an air combo. You can also enhance your special moves for special properties and extra hits if you’ve got the meter, and bone-crushing, human-smushing, jaw-removing supers for when you’re ready to cash out (and see a slick animation that will likely leave your opponent getting literally scraped off the area floor; plus, they’re easy to do. Just press heavy and special at the same time, and you’re golden). Standard tag fighter stuff, but what makes Invincible VS cool are the core systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of them you’ve seen before: you’ve got a pushblock to get people off of you, snapbacks to bring a damaged backliner back in so you can keep pouring up the hurt, defensive saves where you can bring in another character to save the one getting comboed, assists for each character that isn't on the field (this is a tag game, after all), ground bounces to set up interesting combo opportunities, and the like. There are way, way too many options to dig into here, but if you’re worried that the simplified control scheme means Invincible VS might not have the juice, let me alleviate that concern for you right now. Once I got put into a high/low mixup I blockstun by Bulletproof’s rekka, I knew this was a game for degenerates (which, again, I saw as a compliment).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing I will dig into is how Invincible VS determines combo length. As you hit your opponent, you’ll see a meter build up. Fill it, and your combo will end because your opponent will fall out. This means that while basic combos in Invincible VS aren’t short, they’re not as long the ones you'll find in Marvel 3 or Dragon Ball FighterZ. You’ll be out of that combo and back in the action (or dead) before your next birthday.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While basic combos in Invincible VS aren’t short, they’re not as long the ones you'll find in Marvel 3 or Dragon Ball FighterZ. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But there is a way around that. Tag in one of your other characters, and you’ll reset part of that combo meter, allowing you to lay additional smacketh down. Getting the most out of your characters requires spending meter or cycling through your team. Neither of these concepts is new, but I appreciate what Quarter Up is doing to make Invisible VS unique. I also like how different the characters feel. The build I played only had four fighters to choose from, but Bulletproof and Thula quickly stood out to me, though neither Invincible nor Atom Eve felt bad. Part of the fun of a tag fighter is building a team that works for you; these characters already feel quite different from one another, and that’s a good thing. Thula slicing you to pieces with her hair? Rad. Bulletproof calling you a cab? Iconic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing I appreciate are the little touches, from the unique intro dialogue between the characters (this is becoming more and more rare in modern fighters) and the Dragon Ball FighterZ-style clashes when a new character comes in. These serve to reset the playing field and let you take a breath, but there’s also more ubique dialogue here, too. I love stuff like this, and I'm happy Quarter Up has embraced it wholeheartedly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I set my arcade stick down after about an hour with Invincible VS, I felt pretty good. Trying a new fighting game is a lot like driving a new car for the first time. You’ve got a general idea of what you’re getting, but the devil’s in the details. I left pretty pleased with my test drive. Quarter Up still has a lot of work to do, but I can’t wait to kick Invincible VS’s tires for real and see what she can do on the track. Fighting games are a tricky business, but it’s also easy to tell when they’re on the right track. Invincible VS has a killer team behind it, the tools and the resources they need to do the comic and the show justice, and a lot of good ideas. Let’s just hope they can pull off a superhero landing, and look good doing it.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/grounded-2-first-hands-on-preview-bigger-than-before<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a delightful surprise for Grounded fans, Obsidian took to the stage at the Xbox Games Showcase last weekend to reveal an unexpected sequel simply dubbed Grounded 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian has shared that Grounded 2 will take cues from its predecessor by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/honey-i-cant-believe-grounded-2-is-real-and-launches-in-xbox-game-preview-next-month">similarly launching into early access</a> and growing over time with the support and feedback of the community. That early access launch is soon, too; next month, to be exact. I got a chance to play a little bit of what players will be shrinking into next month at the Xbox Games Showcase in Los Angeles over the weekend. And my overall impression, which I say as a full-throated compliment, is that yup, that's a little bit bigger Grounded all right!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's admitedly hard for me to say much about the ways in which Grounded 2 differs from the first Grounded just based on the small, small snippet I played. I was given the option to jump into a later section of the game, but I opted for the tutorial to refresh my Grounded skills, which have gotten a little rusty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thus, much of what I saw through that tutorial was, pleasantly, more Grounded. It's the same kids (albeit two years older now) shrunk down to ant size thanks to the shady dealings of a company called Ominent. Once shrunk, they suffer from a touch of amnesia that leaves them with little memory of what they were doing pre-shrinking, but luckily, our teens <em>do</em> remember the gist of their <em>last</em> tiny backyard adventure, even if they must reacquire many of the skills they developed the first time around. Crafting, for instance - you'll still be analyzing every item you come across, learning new crafting recipes, and slowly building new pieces of armor, weapons, tools, and other items to help you survive. Or you'll be scrounging around the early areas for food (mushrooms, in my case) and drink (dewdrops) so you don't starve to death. Or maybe you'll be fighting bugs or other critters, poking at them nervously with a crudely-made stick spear. All the fundamentals are still in Grounded, familiar and waiting for everyone who just wanted more of what the original was selling.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's wild that the first Grounded didn't have a dodge button before now!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What's new here was a little less obvious in a short, early-game sample, but I did get a taste of some of it. You'll get a new Omni-tool, for instance, that combines all of your tools into one for easy use without taking up inventory space. I didn't get to experiment with its myriad uses much, but I did use it to hack away at some enormous grass blades in place of an axe. Another new mechanic is the addition of a dodge button in combat, which fit in so smoothly I briefly forgot dodging wasn't a part of the first game. Both of these examples are relatively small quality-of-life features, but they seem poised to smooth out some of the wrinkles in the overall experience long-term. It's <em>wild</em> that the first Grounded didn't have a dodge button before now!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest new piece of Grounded 2 that I actually got some decent hands-on time with was the Buggy system - essentially mounts. I was able to ride proudly astride a big ol' ant. It...kinda ruled? It's fun to ride a big bug? Galloping around on my ant steed aside, the Buggy actually comes with quite a few other interesting features packed in. You can sprint, or you can swap to a much slower gathering mode that will have your Buggy collect any resources it runs into as you pass them, eliminating the need for time-consuming harvesting. Buggies can also fight on your behalf, or chomp down on blades of grass or other choppable items to hack them down. At one point, I skittered through a nest of mites, gripping a glowing mushroom torch and letting my ant do the dirty work of munching away every mite that threw itself at me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was told in an interview after our preview session that it's these Buggy mounts that essentially necessitated Grounded 2, albeit alongside other factors. The first Grounded was never designed for the speed at which mounts can cover ground. As a result, the map was too small for Obsidian to ever implement Buggies as a real, useful feature for anyone. The only way to get the oft-requested rideable bugs into the game was to make the game much, much bigger.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's what I'm told has happened here. Grounded 2 takes place not in a backyard, but in Brookhollow Park, which Obsidian says is roughly three times the size of the backyard from the first game. I think I saw, like, maybe the teensiest, tiniest, earliest-gamest corner of that park - the nice, easygoing space that's intended to acclimate both new and returning players to the world of Grounded before sending them off on an ant-riding adventure into the unknown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I still have a lot more questions about what Grounded 2 is bringing to the picnic table that will justify an entirely new game as opposed to just expanding the existing Grounded. Mechanically, I'm not fully sure rideable bugs is going to sell me on it. Then again, Grounded is heavily story-focused, and Grounded 2 opens the gate to a brand new story. It lets Obsidian age up its protagonists, progress Ominent's nefarious nonsense, and expand the world. And it remains true that the first Grounded was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grounded-review">pretty dang fun just as it was</a>. So sure. I'll take more of it, plus bug riding. Ride like the wind, bugs-eye.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Early reaction to the unpatched version of the game included negative comments branding the game a "technical mess."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want everyone to experience the story the same way at the same time on day one, without bias," Build A Rocket Boy said in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-calls-on-fans-to-wait-for-official-launch-after-street-date-breaks-a-week-early-confirms-major-day-one-update-for-physical-copies">statement issued in response to early copies being played</a>. "This means waiting until the official release date to play through the game firsthand." Now, Xbox fans will have to wait a little longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mention of bias in the studio's statement sparked suggestion by some fans that the company was referring back to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments">comments made by its co-CEO Mark Gerhard</a>, who suggested there had been a "concerted effort" to "trash the game and the studio" with negative social media posts from paid accounts or bots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye">IGN subsequently put this claim to Hakan Abrak, boss of Hitman developer IO Interactive</a>, the company which is publishing MindsEye.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-rhythm-action-rival-no-straight-roads-is-getting-a-sequel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Rhythm action game No Straight Roads is set to receive a sequel across PC and consoles next year.</p>
<p>The sequel will continue the adventures of its rock star duo Mayday and Zuke, as they embark on a world tour to "climb the international charts" along with two new playable band members with unique musical and combat styles.</p>
<p>No Straight Roads first released in 2020, followed by an Encore Edition in 2021. Set in a cartoonish world where "real" rock music is overthrown by evil EDM, it fuses combat and platforming with rhythmic timing.</p>

<p>Sound familiar? Essentially, No Straight Roads walked so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Hi-Fi Rush could run three years later</a>. And while Tango Gameworks' game is a superior realisation of rhythmic action, Malaysian studio Metronomik's game is still a lot of fun.</p>
<p>For starters, No Straight Roads has an infectious soundtrack, with each song performed in both a rock and EDM style to match the genre clash of the narrative. What's more, the soundtrack dynamically shifts between genres depending on how successfully you're able to beat up the bad guys.</p>
<p>The sequel promises all-new music from previous game's composer James Landino, as well as additional musical guest stars. It will also have "revitalised" combat with collaborative link attacks, a greater focus on action, and a "huge" roster of megabosses to defeat.</p>
<p>"We are SO excited to reveal the first look at NSR2 to fans today," said Wan Hazmer, CEO and game director at Metronomik. "We're taking everything players loved about the first No Straight Roads and turning it up to 11. Expect incredible music, wacky bosses and engaging, imaginative cities to explore on Bunkbed Junction's rocketok tour across the globe! We can't wait for players to rock out with NSR2 in 2026."</p>
<p>Eurogamer described the game as "a quirky but overly simplistic action-adventure" in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-straight-roads-review-a-quirky-but-overly-simplistic-action-adventure">No Straight Roads review</a>.

			<p>It was only a couple of months ago that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/playback-warhammer-40000-space-marine/">I played through the original</a> Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine, so with that in mind it made sense to take on the new Master Crafted edition, having the freshest memories of the old game to contrast with the enhanced remaster.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7YxYLWIJfP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine tells the story of Captain Titus and his Battle Brothers Sidonus and Leandros as they fight to push back the Ork invasion of the Forge World Graia. It’s a third person shooter that, especially with the sequel launching last year, has become something of a cult classic, though definitely feels like a game from its era.</p>


<p>The Master Crafted Edition, then, is an attempt to modernise the game, bringing updated controls, 4K resolution, improved textures and character models, remastered audio, and additional lines for the Orks to shout at you. You definitely notice the better resolution and the improved textures, especially on enemy models. There was a specific enemy in the original that appeared to lack detail in the facial area, but in this newer version you get much more detail making them a bit more intimidating to look at. The level environments also look more detailed, though there is only so much you can do when a lot of the game is set in corridors with the colour palette of a muddy puddle in an abandoned warehouse. However, as the enemy models stand out more, the game looks decent across the whole campaign.</p>


<p>The modernised controls also attempt to make the game more accessible for today’s audience, but there are some issues. First the weapon selection is not as intuitive as it could be, with the weapon wheel being a bit stiff. Post-patch there is a minor improvement in that the wheel doesn’t just stay on the screen, but there are still some minor delays that can impact the flow of the Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine Master Crafted Edition. In addition, there was an odd decision to originally map the grenade throwing to the right stick. The issue here that to activate the fury meter you have to press the left stick and right stick, which led to grenades being thrown instead of the fury mode being activated which was very frustrating in some areas. Again, an update came out that seems to have addressed this but for the majority of my own playtime this was a regular issue.</p>
<p>There are some minor bugs and issues that also cropped up, including enemies getting caught on the terrain and running in place, and a couple of times where enemies did not react to my presence even when shooting at them. This only happened a couple of times, but it breaks any immersion as you watch a soldier just run against a bit of debris.</p>

<p>If you have played the original release you will be thankful to know that the gameplay remains intact, with the feeling of heavy hitting through out especially when using the hammer and jetpack. Combat can be intense especially when facing the rushing waves of enemies that will quickly swarm you, but the Master Crafted Edition felt a bit easier than the original version, though this could be down to knowing what to expect in each area having recently played through the campaign. All in all, it’s a fun six or seven hours to spend in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, revisiting this game to compare to the newer Space Marine 2.</p>
<p>There is also support for the game’s multiplayer modes, with the original modes including 8v8 play, though this wasn’t an area that we could test prior to release.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine Master Crafted looks very good with its 4k resolution, improved textures, and upgraded character models. It gives people the opportunity to play through the original story of Captain Titus, maintaining the feel of the original release. There were issues with the Master Crafted edition I do not remember experiencing when playing the Anniversary Edition including enemies getting stuck and control issues, though these will hopefully be patched out soon.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156672/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>When was the first time you played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_mans_sky">No Man's Sky</a>? For me, it was right back at its initial launch <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/no_mans_sky">in 2016</a>, a launch that, for reasons that have been recounted ad nauseam by now, left me fairly miffed overall. Here was a game that was very obviously a huge task for its small (and, as it turned out, phenomenally determined) dev team, a game that promised much — very excitedly — pre-launch, but ultimately failed to deliver in its earliest form.</p>
<p>Fast-forward through what's been <em>quite</em> the nine years since, and here we are with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>; a beefed-up, beautified, and breathtakingly bold space adventure that's got everything Hello Games promised in the first place - plus way, way more besides. It's also a free update for existing owners of the Switch version.</p>
<p>Yes, we may have gotten off to a rough start with this infinitely playable survival classic, and I think we can call it a classic by now, but boy-oh-boy has it grown into something <em>phenomenal</em> at this point. Pre-this review, my last outing with No Man's Sky was a few updates back, so it's been a little bit - and a whole lot extra has been added.</p>
<figure><a title="No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156668/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of this Switch 2 port's most exciting aspects is that it arrives alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/no-mans-sky-is-landing-a-free-nintendo-switch-2-edition-update-on-launch-day">the latest 'Beacon' update</a>. This adds a bunch of settlement management aspects, a new Autophage enemy type, base infestations, building upgrades, new base structures, and more besides. Basically, it's given us the tools to get busy actually affecting, managing, and influencing settlements and their various alien inhabitants, right down to fending off attacks.</p>
<p>It's just another great big wrinkle in what's been a procession of notable new wrinkles over the years, with flying and tameable pet pals, vehicles, improved combat, space dogfights, freighters, corrupted planets...the big additions go on and on. And during all of this, of course, the underlying game, mechanically, visually, and in terms of accessibility (Hello Games goes big on accessibility here), has gone from strength to strength.</p>
<p>Is it perfect? No, it absolutely tries to do too much all at once, and as a result you don't get the very best of everything.</p>
<figure><a title="No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156712/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat, as an example, is fine — it does the job — but it's not a match for a proper action adventure, and those who spend their time in 'serious' space sims may find the systems of commerce, space pirating, and all that good stuff a bit too simplistic. Them's the breaks when you try to fit an entire universe inside a game, I guess.</p>
<p>What the game does nail though — and all of its systems, no matter if they're a little flaky, help in this regard — is the atmosphere and vibe of being in space, a great big infinite, colourful, wild and bizarre space, where you really can get lost, explore, and exist in your own little loops of interest forever.</p>
<p>From the first moments, where you'll be walked through its tutorials (God knows how many times I've done this now), to getting your ship, taking your first flight, finding your first space station...it grows around you until you're consumed, locked in for the long haul.</p>
<figure><a title="No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156674/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The strange narrative that pushes you forward, should you choose to follow it, is beguiling, otherworldly and odd enough that it keeps me hooked, even when I'm occasionally totally overwhelmed by new things. And being overwhelmed can be an issue in the earlier parts of the game, where you unlock a whole lot of tech and have a bunch of mechanics explained to you in fairly short order.</p>
<p>It's worth sticking with, though, because once you're au fait with scanning and collecting, refining, crafting and creating, the feeling of adventure here is pretty much unmatched. Certainly on consoles, at least, and even moreso on consoles that let you play portably.</p>
<p>I've been willing the performance and visuals to be a match for the content on Switch 2, then, because as much as I enjoy No Man's Sky on Switch 1, it is held back a little by a lack of image clarity and sluggishness in combat. This is an experience that deserves to be played without such barriers, and with this Switch 2 version, we're officially in business, as it's pretty much a match for its other console counterparts. Yep, it looks that good - and runs that smoothly - in both docked and handheld, with only the very smallest of stutters (loading into new areas seems to do it) and a handful of minor visual glitches and graphical downgrades here and there.</p>
<figure><a title="No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156669/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You should note that, at the moment, it seems some players are having issues using their cross-save files from other consoles due to the fact that this version number isn't a match just yet. Of course, this will be addressed with an update in due course, so it's an annoying but somewhat understandable issue given we're in the first days of this new console.</p>
<p>We also had some bother getting into multiplayer over the first few days with the game, as it turns out this was a bug of some sort, nobody was able to access online, but it's now been remedied, meaning that, for the first time, Switch gamers are getting all of the multiplayer goodness involved in the various modes on offer. The old Switch just couldn't deal with this aspect of the package, but it's all in this time around, and from what I've played over the past day or so, it works as it does on other versions.</p>
<p>As I mentioned a little earlier, there are a ton of accessibility options here, too - you could get lost in these accessibility menus. You've got motion controls, individual Joy-Con sensitivity settings, a choice of button layouts, HUD scalings, colour filters, and adjustments for tap/hold on actions, and a whole lot more besides. Heck, you can even unlock the frame rate.</p>

<p>Indeed, I'm almost certain this is my very first Switch 2 game where I've been blessed with the option of a quality or performance setting. The game is (reportedly, I'm no Digital Foundry) 1080p/40fps and 1440p/30fps at these settings, and that seems about right in my experience. On TV, it can look a little less slick than, for example, my Series X version — which is 100% reasonable — but it's avoiding the Switch 1 issue of having its graphical excisions and cutbacks exposed when on a large screen. It's easily nice enough-looking to be acceptable on a 47-inch TV. (The same, I'm afraid, cannot be said for myself.) With regards to DLSS, I'm not sure I've noticed it thus far. It all looks very sharp, though, so I guess that means any implementation there is going on here is doing a bang-up job.</p>
<p>This really is No Man's Sky without any constraints or excisions, cuts or concessions to tech that can't keep up. And it's a majestic thing, as you'll likely know full well by now. The Beacon update adds more depth for those who want it in the base-building and management aspects, but at this stage, it really is all gravy.</p>
<p>No Man's Sky has long since become a must-play for fans of space survival adventures, and Switch 2 just got itself a bona fide banger of a port. That's all you really need to know. Now, where have I put my hydrospanner?</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition brings this excellent, constantly evolving space survival adventure to your new Nintendo console in fine style. This is an almost-perfect match for other versions of the game, barring some very minor hiccups here and there.</p>
<p>Combat is still a bit naff, especially in space, and hardcore pirates might not get all they need from the systems in place here, but other than that, this is an almost perfect port of an almighty behemoth of a game. The sky, it seems, really has no limits.</p></section>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have unleashed the latest twist in the game's Galactic War, with urban battles against the Terminids now on the cards. Rather than defending cities on Super Earth, this time the task is swatting bug invasions of population centres across multiple planets.</p>
<p>A tough assignment, but to be fair, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">successfully protecting their home planet</a> against the still-at-large Illuminate should have given players plenty experience of street fighting (not the Ryu and Chun-Li kind).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Massive Terminid outbreaks erupted simultaneously across multiple Super Earth cities," reads the latest briefing from developers Arrowhead, "This unprecedented assault of Fascism into highly-populated areas puts millions of citizens in grave danger. The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> must respond immediately."</p>
<p>The order, which dropped not long after the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516337874624317890?l=english">latest patch</a>, is shipping players off to five planets with cities that are being overrun by the bugs. Fighting's already started on Crucible and Alta V, with Volterra, Caramoor, and Inari also on the list of worlds the divers need to hold onto until the end of this order to secure a victory.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">MAJOR ORDER: The remnant Illuminate forces have evaded Justice. Some of their remote bases endure. The unprovoked Illuminate assault on Super Earth will never be forgotten. Justice for the Illuminate atrocities has not been averted—merely postponed, for a greater and more… <a href="https://t.co/WY24mVg21y">pic.twitter.com/WY24mVg21y</a></p>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1932426600030609880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>It's news that, while obviously terrible from a lore perspective, will no doubt be music to the ears of Helldivers 2 players that prefer squashing the bugs over battling the game's other enemy factions. This group, referred to in the HD2 community as "bugdivers", have caught some flak from their fellow soldiers in the past for not lending enough of a hand during non-Terminid MOs. At least this one should put that minor bickering to bed for a little while.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting the result of the last mission if you're returning to the game to fight these bugs following a bit of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-follows-up-the-battle-for-super-earth-automaton-fighting-because-bots-waiting-in-big-invasion-queue">post-battle for Super Earth</a> break. Remnants of the Illuminate, supposedly reeling from that failed invasion, were the target and proved too tough for the divers to overcome.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly given wiping the faction out totally would leave the game with just its two oldest foes, the squids were hiding more in reserve than it first seemed, so they're still kiciing around on remote bases across the galaxy.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how the usual bug swarm battles translate to the urban biomes, but this certainly explains why this morning's HD2 patch reworked stealth detection around Terminid spawners and places that kick out flying enemies.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, showrunner Craig Mazin admittedly knows just a hint of the story for the potential game, but isn't sure if it'll ever happen.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__flfZc9JCc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BAFTA</a> about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-it-cant-be-for-nothing/1900-6418351/" data-ref-id="1900-6418351">Season 2</a> of The Last of Us, Mazin said game creator and co-showrunner Neil Druckmann told him some ideas he had for a Part 3, but would be okay if the game never came into fruition.</p><p>"I am familiar with some concepts that Neil has kicked around for a potential third game. I don't know if he's zeroed in on one of them. I don't know what will happen there," he explains, adding that although he'd like Part 3 to happen, he also thinks maybe less is more. "Sometimes I think, maybe you should just be happy. Don't be sad it's over--be happy that it happened at all! I think Naughty Dog is an incredible game studio. They make beautiful art, and their ability to convey what we can do in television through animation is pretty remarkable."</p><p>He continued with how he could be selfish and beg Druckmann to make Part 3, but feels as though he would rob the studio of other potentially great games it could make instead.</p><p>"It's not like what I want is going to matter. They will do what they do, and all I know is that I'll be there on day one to play Intergalactic. If there's another Uncharted, I'll play it. If there's another Last of Us, I'll play it."</p><p dir="ltr">The most recent comments about The Last of Us: Part 3 from Druckmann himself said he's not ruling it out, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-could-happen-if-the-stars-align-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6530741/">he's not confirming it either.</a></p><p dir="ltr">"Back at Naughty Dog, we're now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, which is something we've been working on for many years. That is taking up all of our time," he said. "I am treating these projects like it's the last thing I will ever work on. So my assumption is that there will be no more [The Last of Us games]. If the stars align, and everything comes into place, who knows?"</p><p dir="ltr">Naughty Dog is currently working on multiple games. Alongside Intergalactic, a mystery second game is in development.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-launch-ever-in-the-uk-but-it-still-didnt-beat-the-ps5-or-xbox-series-x-s/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk">The Game Business</a>, data firm NielsenIQ shows that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is the biggest Nintendo console launch in the UK ever. Still, it's not the biggest console launch in the region ever, with the PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series consoles still ahead of it.</p>
<p>While the report doesn't provide a specific number, The Game Business says the Switch 2 beat out week-one launch sales in the UK for the Nintendo Switch "<em>by more than two to one,</em>" and also pointed out that the Nintendo Switch managed to sell a little more than 80K units in the UK when it launched in 2017. The Nintendo 3DS, which used to have the record for the best UK launch for a Nintendo device, sold 113K units in its launch.</p>
<p>The Game Business also listed the top-10 console launches in the UK by sales units, with the Nintendo Switch 2 now firmly in fourth place. Here's the full list, per The Game Business:</p>
<ol>
<li>PlayStation 5</li>
<li>PlayStation 4</li>
<li>Xbox Series</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2</li>
<li>PlayStation 3</li>
<li>Xbox One</li>
<li>Nintendo Wii</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
<li>Xbox 360</li>
<li>Xbox One X</li>
</ol>
<p>Reports from the PS5's UK launch claimed it sold more than <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-ps5-was-the-uks-biggest-ever-console-launch/">250K units in just two days after launch</a>, and more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-best-selling-next-gen-uk/">450K by the end of 2020</a>. So, until any actual sales numbers are reported, we know that the Switch 2 sold more than 113K units and less than 250K.</p>
<p>It didn't set the all-time record for the UK, but there's no denying that somewhere between 113-250K is a very strong launch for just one region. The Switch 2 also might've set all-time records elsewhere, as it's currently claimed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-allegedly-frances-fastest-selling-console-ever-with-over-200k-sold-so-far/">Switch 2 is now France's fastest-selling console ever</a>, and that Nintendo moved 200K units in France in the console's opening weekend.</p>
