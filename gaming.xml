            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has updated the official website for its mysterious “<a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us">Switch Online: Playtest Program</a>” today, privately revealing more information to participants about what it entails. The playtest is running from October 23rd, 9PM ET until November 5th, 8PM ET, and is only available to the roughly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266478/nintendo-switch-online-invite-application-beta-playtest">10,000 people who have already registered</a> for the program.&nbsp;</p><p>The test software is now available to download ahead of the start of gameplay, and requires 2.2GB of free space. Participants didn’t sign an NDA, but Nintendo requested in the playtest terms and conditions that users refrain from sharing any details about it — which has gone about as well as can be expected. While Nintendo has <a href="https://x.com/Ethan_ThisGuy/status/1848221882496987233">already started issuing copyright strikes</a> to take leaked media offline, screenshots and information about the playtest are still available across websites <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1848222093864731126">like X</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1g8hzis/nintendo_switch_online_playtest_program_full/">and Reddit</a> at the time of writing.</p><p><strong>Warning: spoilers ahead!</strong></p><p>This appears to be Nintendo’s attempt to develop its first MMO (massively multiplayer online) style game. According to the game description, “the goal is to work with others to fully ‘develop’ a massive, expansive planet by utilizing creativity and framed resources.” Players will encounter “new lands, enemies, and resources” as they progress, and utilize “Beacons” that create zones to develop the environment around where they’re placed. These Beacon zones are personal — players can only “move, lift, or edit items” in zones they have placed, and cannot edit anything within someone else’s Beacon.</p><p>There’s a separate social hub called the “Dev Core” where players can level up, obtain items, and interact with each other. Nintendo also describes “UGC (User-Generated Content) features” for creating and sharing custom content, but players are required to pass an in-game test “to show that you understand the importance of respectful communication” before this capability can be unlocked.</p><p>At a glance, the game shares some similarities with family-friendly MMO’s like <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Roblox</em>. The IP is either entirely new (in that it doesn’t feature any recognizable Nintendo characters) or it’s a placeholder for the game system itself — meaning it could be part of an existing franchise at release. All we know for sure is that previous speculation suggesting the playtest would bring <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/189706-nintendo-switch/80865507">GameCube titles to the Nintendo Switch Online</a> service can probably be put to rest.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Valve won't be releasing a new Steam Deck console each year because "that's kind of not really fair to your customers".</p>
<p>The handheld PC device will finally be available to purchase in Australia in November. Two of its designers from Valve, Lawrence Yang and Yazan Aldehayyat, were interviewed by <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/">Reviews.org</a> and discussed the trend of yearly hardware refreshes.</p>
<p>"It is important to us, and we've tried to be really clear, we are not doing the yearly cadence," said Yang. "We're not going to do a bump every year. There's no reason to do that. And, honestly, from our perspective, that's kind of not really fair to your customers to come out with something so soon that's only incrementally better.</p>

<p>"So we really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck. But it is something that we're excited about and we're working on."</p>
<p>Valve first released the Steam Deck in North America and Europe in 2022, which was followed by the OLED model in 2023.</p>
<p>While a Steam Deck 2 is in development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-says-technology-doesnt-exist-yet-for-full-steam-deck-20">Valve told Eurogamer last year</a> - ahead of the OLED release - that the technology does not yet exist.</p>
<p>"Obviously we'd love to get even more performance in the same power envelope, but that technology doesn't exist yet," said Aldehayyat. "That's what I think we'd call a Steam Deck 2.0.</p>
<p>"The first Steam Deck was the first moment in time where we felt like there was enough GPU performance in a portable form factor that lets you play all your Steam games. We would love for the trend of perf-per-watt to progress rapidly to do that, but it's not quite there yet."</p>
<p>It's certainly an interesting take from the company, considering Sony's forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PS5 Pro</a>. It costs £700 and includes an upgraded GPU among other features, though the improvements are incremental.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-got-a-sony-offer-for-a-timed-exclusive-but-pearl-abyss-refused/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In July 2023, Korean publications <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-reportedly-looking-to-partner-with-korean-studios-starting-with-pearl-abyss-for-crimson-desert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Sony was attempting to secure some sort of exclusivity for Crimson Desert, the upcoming action/adventure game in development at Pearl Abyss.</p>
<p>Now, the Korean developer and publisher primarily known for Black Desert has confirmed that was indeed the case. More specifically, they revealed to have received an offer from Sony for a timed exclusivity that would ban the Xbox version for a period of time. However, they decided to go with the self-publishing route after judging it would result in higher profits.</p>
<p>The news came from the recent Kiwoom Securities Corporate Day, where Pearl Abyss executives talked about Crimson Desert in great detail, as <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/vlvk1703/223609533714" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by financial blogger HPNS. The game notoriously received many delays (it was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set to launch in Winter 2021</a>); according to Pearl Abyss, this is because the developers added many gameplay features to the open world design, mainly to improve interactions with the environment and NPCs. Games like Assassin's Creed and The Legend of Zelda were referenced for the player's freedom, and Red Dead Redemption and The Witcher 3 were also huge inspirations.</p>
<p>When it comes to AI, Pearl Abyss says the NPCs have a behavior system that lets them judge the best course of action depending on the situation. For example, if they see that too many of their allies have already been slaughtered by the player, they may attempt to flee for their life. There's also a reputation system, and players can allegedly behave like a hero or a villain depending on their actions. The behaviors also change based on the day/night cycle or dynamic weather, with NPCs getting slower at night or when the temperature is freezing. Pearl Abyss also claimed having their own engine makes these features easier to implement than they would be with Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>A final interesting tidbit is that Sony reportedly gave a highly positive evaluation of Crimson Desert, which likely explains their offer. They compared it to Ghost of Tsushima for the story's quality and atmosphere, which says a lot, given that Sucker Punch's title was the most successful new IP released by Sony's PlayStation Studios.</p>
<p>For more on Crimson Desert, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shown-off-in-50-minute-gameplay-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom 2024 report</a>. In theory, the game is expected to launch in the first half of 2025, although we wouldn't be too surprised if that changed again.</p>

            <p>Earlier this month, we learned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> studio Cloud Imperium Games were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cloud-imperium-quietly-steal-star-citizen-developers-weekends-from-under-them-with-mandated-overtime-in-the-lead-up-to-citizencon">mandating overtime for employees</a> in the lead-up to their fan convention, Citizencon, which was held this past weekend. Additionally, this TOIL (time off in lieu) wouldn’t be made available until the release of<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc"> space game</a> Star Citizen’s accompanying single player campaign, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squadron-42">Squadron 42</a>.</p>
<p>At CitizenCon over the weekend, CIG head promiser Chris Roberts said that he’s “confident” that Sqorty-two will release next year, 2026, via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-dev-confident-of-releasing-standalone-single-player-story-game-squadron-42-in-2026">Ian Games</a>. CIG also released a video of the entire first hour and fifteen of the game, which you can watch below.</p>

<p>As of this May, Star Citizen had raised over $700 million in crowd-funding. I imagine a fair old chunk of that went towards rounding up at least one and half Kojima’s worth of Gr8 M8s, including Mark Hamill, Gillian Anderson, Gary Oldman, Andy Serkis, Mark Strong, Sophie Wu, and Henry Cavill.</p><p>I haven’t watched the whole video yet, but it’s got some fun aliens in it. They’ve got teeth like the Goombas from the (good) Super Mario Movie. Has that film has a proper critical re-evaluation yet? Like, I feel that bad but interesting is better than just, palatable. I’m trying to fill space here because I don’t want to start watching the video and saying things about it. It’s very impressive but it’s still vaporware until I can physically shoot some aliens and make dialogue choices that annoy Gillian Anderson. I don't want to believe it's real just yet because, context aside, it does look very good.</p>
<p>Sqorty-two was first announced in 2012, so this clip marks a decade and change since. The game was announced as “feature complete” at Citizencon last year. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wing-commander-3-heart-tiger">Wing Commander 3: Heart Of The Tiger</a> is currently on sale! at <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/wing_commander_3_heart_of_the_tiger">GOG for £2.39</a>, and you get to make Mark Hamill say dumb shit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>When the Nintendo Switch Online playtest was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-announces-open-playtest-for-undisclosed-switch-online-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on October 10, fans were extremely curious of what it could be all about. Today, the playtest became available for download to the users who had been selected ahead of the test actually going live on October 23. Alongside the download, users were also provided with plenty of information on the mysterious Nintendo Switch Online playtest, and those details have just <a href="https://streamable.com/j23wki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this is a community game about connections with which Nintendo seeks to 'test the boundaries of mass multiplayer functionality and gameplay' on its servers. Here's the Nintendo Switch Online playtest overview:</p>
<p><em>In this game, the goal is to work with others to fully "develop" a massive, expansive planet by utilizing creativity and farmed resources. As you progress across the planet, you'll discover new lands, enemies, and resources that will become essential to your journey.</em></p>
<p><em>Throughout your adventure, players will be granted special tools known as Beacons. These Beacons emit a healing light that purifies and develops the land. The higher your Beacon is placed, the wider its Beacon Zone becomes. Within your Beacon Zone, your best work can be done. Players will repeat the process until their current Planetary Block is considered fully developed.</em></p>
<p><em>The Beacons players receive will be their most valuable tool. You are the master of your Beacon Zone. Only you can move, lift, or edit items within your Beacon's light. Just as others cannot edit things within your Beacon Zone, you cannot edit things in someone else's Beacon Zone. Places outside of Beacon Zones are public areas that anyone can work in. In public areas, anyone can pick up things, place them, and edit them. To protect your builds and precious items, you'll want to store them inside your Beacon Zone for safekeeping.</em></p>
<p><em>The Dev Core is a separate space from the planet you'll be developing. Think of it as a social hub to gather with other players. At the Dev Core, you can level up your character, get items you will need for your journey, commune with others, and more. Players earn Connex Points by interacting with other players in a variety of ways. Players can use Connex Points in the Dev Core to raise their Connection Level. By increasing your Connection Level, players will have access to fun community-related items.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Every player is equipped with a special skill known as the Development Positioning System, or DPS. This allows players to see a wide array of details, including the development status of the planet and the positions of other players. With the DPS's spectate feature, players can see Beacons and other players from great distances.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch Online playtest is certainly not what we thought it would be. All the same, it's an interesting endeavor for Nintendo, and if it really helps them push the server boundaries for multiplayer, all the better. Stay tuned for any more leaks and info on it.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-physical-disc-release-on-october-21-its-claimed/</link>

<p>Not even 24 hours since Game Science teased its release, the launch date for the physical disc version of Black Myth: Wukong on PlayStation 5 (PS5) has been leaked online.</p>



<p>According to known data miner <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1848035754372677750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, physical edition of Black Myth: Wukong will launch on Monday, October 21 in the United States. The game will be available for $64.99.</p>







<p>For those in Europe, he said that it will launch “very soon” for €69.99. He didn’t have a specific date, however, at the time of writing. Nor  did he have information on other possible region launches.</p>



<p>“Destined Ones, thank you for your patience!” the studio said on Sunday about the pending release. “With the master disc for Black Myth: Wukong ready, the PS5 physical edition will be available to you very soon.”</p>



<p>If billbil-kun’s claim is accurate, an announcement should be coming within the next handful of hours after publishing. Also, for those wondering, it will be available from multiple retailers, and be an actual disc that comes with the copy of Black Myth: Wukong. It won’t just be a code in a box.</p>



<p>When it launched in August, Black Myth: Wukong became one of the most-played games in Steam history thanks to strong launch sales in China. In just its first month alone, the game sold over 20 million copies and had earned over $1 billion in gross revenue on Steam alone. </p>



<p>Just recently, it was discovered that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-esrb-xbox/">had been rated by the ESRB</a> for a release on Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up the physical disc for Black Myth: Wukong on PS5? Let us know in the comments, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations launches on October 25, but gameplay from the game has leaked online ahead of its official release. </p>



<p>A YouTuber by the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@swr.nezumi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vexi</a> managed to get a rom of the game early, and played it on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yuzu-nintendo-lawsuit-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch emulator Yuzu</a>. They then uploaded two separate six-minute videos of raw gameplay. They made sure, however, to not include any story spoilers for players.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-insomniac-gearing-up-to-show-more-from-wolverine-it-s-claimed">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-gearing-up-to-show-more-from-wolverine-its-claimed/">Insomniac “Gearing Up” To Show More From Wolverine, It’s Claimed</a></h6>



<p>Also, they made it clear in the video description for one that they pre-ordered the game in order to support the developers.</p>



<p>“[I] don’t usually upload stuff like this, but figured people might want to see it since the rom is out there now,” the description reads. “Don’t worry, I already pre-ordered the game on Steam, but I’ve been so excited to play it I wanted to check it out as soon as I could.”</p>



<p>You can check out both gameplay videos for Sonic X Shadow Generations below. It should go without saying, however, that there’s a good chance they get taken down by Nintendo in short order.

To get to the bottom of what happened at Windscale, you will need to navigate military encampments, delve through abandoned bunkers below ground, and risk your life in Pagan ruins. Your trusty metal detector will also help you uncover a few secrets buried beneath the surface! </p><p>Central to the dark mystery are the host of eccentric characters and cryptic organisations that inhabit the quarantine zone. These individuals have been cut off from the outside world for years and left to their own devices, so are anything but normal. Your interactions with them are important and will shape your journey. But be careful, they aren’t all friendly and you will need to get to grips with an array of ranged and melee weapons if you are to survive!</p></blockquote><p><em>Atomfall</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,277 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,346 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,573 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,514 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/atomfall" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/atomfall/9nc4wdl5kzbl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a> in March 2025.

<p>Rebellion has published a five-minute deep dive into Atomfall online, giving players an in-depth look at the world that they’ll be exploring in this remarkable and unique game. I played Atomfall at Gamescom and can safely say it’s one of my most highly anticipated games – and that’s not just because I’m a huge Fallout fan.</p>



<p>Check out the latest Atomfall trailer below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-atomfall">Prepare for Atomfall</h2>



<p>Atomfall <strong>feels like </strong>Fallout set in the United Kingdom, but it’s so much more than that. It’s unique enough to stand apart from Bethesda Game Studios’ post-apocalyptic series, and it all begins with Atomfall being inspired by <strong>real-world events</strong> that occurred in the 1950s.</p>



<p>It’s also not exactly a post-apocalyptic game, which you’ll come to learn a bit better when you check out the video below:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>In Atomfall, you’re left up to your own devices to explore and survive in a ‘quarantine zone’, but everything is not what it seems. From what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/">I experienced at Gamescom</a>, Atomfall is a game that encourages freedom and a multi-faceted approach, allowing users to use their wits and the game’s fundamental mechanics to overcome objectives however they see fit.</p>



<p>It’s also possible to kill absolutely everyone if you so desire, so that’s great.</p>



<p>Atomfall is set to be released in March 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series XS. It’s also coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one, which is a <strong>huge </strong>win for subscribers.</p>

<p>FlyQuest is the latest team to be eliminated from the League of Legends World Championship, falling just short against Gen.G in the quarterfinals in Paris. What started as a balanced fixture turned into a dominating finish for Gen.G, who will now move into the semifinals with the hope of taking down T1 – and Faker.</p>



<p>In an emotional post-match interview, FlyQuest’s Bwipo was seen shedding tears. This is the furthest the organisation has got at the League of Legends World Championship <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-one-gone">Another One Gone</h2>



<p>Only four teams now remain in the most prestigious tournament in esports. It has been a stellar year for League of Legends, and this tournament has been no different. We’ve seen record-breaking viewership throughout the competition thus far, and the crowning jewel of the event – the grand final – is yet to be played.</p>



<p>FlyQuest had a solid run at Worlds 2024 that led to a fifth-place finish. Historically, the organisation has made it to Worlds <strong>once</strong>, and even then, the team finished in twelfth place.</p>



<p>This year has been a remarkable one for the team, and there were straight expectations that the squad would get at least this far. It was just weeks ago that the team clutched the top spot at LCS Summer 2024, netting a $100,000 prize – the same amount that they’ve walked away from Worlds with.</p>



<p>In an emotional post-game interview, FlyQuest’s Bwipo said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s tough to stay positive but we made you guys believe. That was the goal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There will now be a hiatus lasting a few days before the two semifinal fixtures take place in Paris, France:</p>



<ul>
<li>Weibo Gaming vs. Bilibili Gaming</li>



<li>T1 vs. Gen.G Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>T1 is still the favourite to win, but Gen.G has had a phenomenal tournament thus far and hasn’t dropped a series. </p>



<p>Do you think T1 can pull off the win yet again? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>"It was tough for those couple of years before [Silent Hill 2's] release," director/producer Jacek Zieba told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloober-team-says-its-done-with-shitty-games-and-silent-hill-2-remake-wasnt-a-fluke/1100-6527269/">Gamespot</a>. "Now it's very good spirits inside [the studio]. We want to show what we can do on our own, how we can evolve our ideas."</p><p>"They recreated a legendary game," director/designer Wojciech Piejko said of the different internal Bloober team that worked on the remake. "They made the impossible possible, and it was a bumpy road because of all the hate on the internet. The pressure was big on them, and they delivered, and for the company, it's an amazing moment."</p>
<p>"We want to be a horror company," Zieba added. "We want to find our niche, and we think we found our niche, so now we just… let's evolve with it. And how that happens is more complex, but it also happens organically in a way, like with [2016's] <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a>, people in the studio were like, 'Okay, we made some shitty games before, but we [can] evolve'."</p>
<p>"We gathered a team that loves horror," Piejko added. "So I think, for us, it would not be easy to switch [to other genres], and we don't want to."</p>
<p>"Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Eurogamer's Silent Hill 2 Remake review</a>, awarding the game an impressive five out of five stars in the process.</p><p>Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">Silent Hill 2 remake has already sold a total of 1m copies</a> across both physical and digital media since its global launch on 8th October. That likely makes Silent Hill 2 Remake the best-selling Silent Hill game ever.</p>
<p>It's been almost two weeks since fans were welcomed back to Silent Hill again, but as yet, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-silent-hill-2-remake-fans-warn-of-brookhaven-hospital-progress-glitch">still no remedy for a glitch that's soft-locking some players' progress towards the end of the Brookhaven Hospital level in Silent Hill 2 Remake. Here's everything you need to know about the glitch... and how best to avoid it</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With an overwhelmingly positive community response seen by Team FOLON following the release of Fallout: London (which has been redeemed almost a million times), the developers are now saying that the newest Patch, 1.02, has significantly improved the mod. Interestingly, Team FOLON did tease about how they are working on a massive patch and were said to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-londons-next-patch-said-to-bring-huge-improvements-team-folon-drafted-extra-help-for-mod/">bring in "extra workforce"</a> to ensure that the execution is optimal this time.</p>
<p>While the patch covers several areas of problems, the primary focus was to improve the visual experience. Hence, more significant changes were performance optimization, mesh fixes, and even the implementation of collision measures to avoid inconsistent game crashes during specific scenarios. It surely is a huge update; hence, here is the changelog below, mentioning all the major improvements made by Team FOLON:</p>
<p><em><strong>Major Fixes:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unexpected broken LOD clip volumes have now been identified and removed across the board:</em><br>
<em>This should fix save corruption/save file issues in Islington world, Dump world, IWM World and St pauls world. </em><em>This requires a rework of the LOD in these worldspace. (Check 3D Section for more information)</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Previsbine (PRP) regeneration:</em><br>
<em>Previs and Precombines have been regenerated for the project. Requires further testing on completion. </em><em>This should fix various random/repeatable crashes and previsibility issues (Culling issues, Check 3D Section for more information)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There were also many other fixes for 3D art and animation in Fallout: London, such as:</p>
<p><strong><em>Over one hundred mesh fixes:</em></strong><br>
<em>Various improvements to meshes to increase performance and fix precombine crashes</em><br>
<em>Various collision meshes fixed both to improve gameplay and fix potential crashes</em><br>
<em>LOD Updates:</em><br>
<em>Identified and fixed all missing LOD materials for material swaps across all worldspaces - (Implementation still happening)</em><br>
<em>New/Missing LOD textures and materials generated</em><br>
<em>Mushroom meshes optimized for LOD</em><br>
<em>Weeping willow trees improved</em><br>
<em>Regeneration of LOD with much higher detail texture atlas (This will increase the size of the LOD files but improve visual quality and performance)</em><br>
<em>A massive rework of the "Mega meshes" is happening (These are the large meshes used to display a separate worldspaces LOD, which may be causing dump load crashes)</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout: London - Official Patch 1.02 Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANhbGzvUVnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Several other quest-related changes were made, including "tiny" fixes that aren't worth mentioning here, but it is safe to say that Patch 1.02 marks a significant milestone for Fallout: London.</p>

            <p>The team behind "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> meets Skyrim" viral hit Hawthorn are "developing this game from [their] personal pockets".</p>
<p>Earlier this month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-rpg-hawthorn-looks-like-stardew-valley-and-skyrim-had-an-adorable-baby-together">we reported</a> that several former developers from studios such as Bethesda, BioWare and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> had banded together to develop the delightful-looking Hawthorn, which you can check out below:</p>

<p>Despite popping up on <em>thousands</em> of wishlists, however, Near Studios co-founder and CEO, Heather Cerlan, has revealed that despite the fervent interest its game has sparked, the dozen or so developers responsible for bringing Hawthorn to life are still not getting paid as the studio has no funding.</p>
<p>"The fact that we are developing this game from our personal pockets was completely lost," Cerlan told to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-18/viral-new-indie-video-game-hawthorn-has-a-tragic-backstory?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a>. "We have the ambitions and the visions; we don’t however have the funding yet."</p>
<p>Near Studios was founded in 2022 but following a desperate family tragedy, Cerlan's plans were derailed and the team lost two of its original co-founders - one "because of a disagreement in direction; the other because he couldn’t get out of a previous contract". She then got in touch with former Bethesda coworker Jason Richardson, who "had been envisaging Hawthorn for many years".</p><p>This delay, however, meant the team was looking for financial backing when independent games funding had all but dried up. But although Cerlan said she tried - and failed - to secure funding for the project throughout most of 2024, the team remains "pretty determined to get this to market one way or another". If funding cannot be found, Cerlan said the studio is considering a KickStarter campaign.</p>
<p>"I had a general idea for a game, but it was never about the game," Cerlan said. "It was about building a culture, building a team I was excited about essentially retiring at.</p>
<p>"Now we're focusing on the game and the community. Our hope is everything else will come."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
