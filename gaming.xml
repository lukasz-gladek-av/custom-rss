Players step into the tiny but mighty shoes of koROBO, embarking on a thrilling and heartfelt journey that starts in Tom’s room and unfolds into a world-changing adventure.</p><p><strong>■ Story</strong></p><p>Sometimes it takes the smallest hero to fulfill the greatest destiny!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Somewhere in the borough of Brocklyn, nestled within the urban jungle of New Yock City, Tom and his mother are celebrating his 10th birthday. When a wrapped present arrives from his estranged father, Tom rips through it, excited to see what’s inside.</p><p>What he finds is not the coolest and latest in tiny household robo tech, but some knockoff model. “<em>koROBO</em>?”</p><p>But before long, koROBO is cleaning the home, helping Tom with his homework, and even playing games and reading comics with him like a brother. What will koROBO’s arrival have in store for Tom, his family and perhaps, the world?</p><p><em>koROBO</em>‘s story unfolds inside Tom’s family apartment in Brocklyn, New Yock. Players take on the role of the pint-sized hero. As koROBO, they will help out the family, perform tasks around the home, meet the many denizens that inhabit the apartment building, and defend Tom and those he loves from a mysterious enemy… that can travel through space-time?</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/koROBO_2024_07-19-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Gameplay</strong></p><p><strong>Tiny Hero, Big Adventure</strong></p><p><em>koROBO</em>‘s core gameplay involves traversing around the family’s home, cleaning up messes, and solving problems wherever they can be found–a big ask for such a tiny hero!</p><p>Be careful, though! koROBO’s battery is limited, and performing tasks will drain it even faster. While more popular robots require owners to plug into adventure, Tom has modified koROBO to bathe in some rays in order to charge the solar battery strapped to their back. Players will have to keep an eye out for patches of sunlight to make sure koROBO keeps running at peak capacity!</p><p>While exploring Tom’s apartment building, players won’t just be helping out him and his family. There’s a whole host of kooky denizens living their lives that koROBO will encounter. As koROBO, players can talk to these characters and help solve their problems to unlock some of his most powerful upgrades!</p><p><strong>Better, Faster, Stronger</strong></p><p>Players can collect items as they clean and explore to upgrade koROBO and what they can do. While koROBO will start out being able to run, jump, and glide, in time he’ll also be able to fly, swim, and even travel through time…?</p><p>But wait, there’s more! koROBO isn’t the only toy in Tom’s retinue. Players will discover new miniature friends and gain an assortment of attachments that’ll allow koROBO to adventure and sometimes even fight in new and exciting ways!</p><p>The parts players will need to find for their upgrades can be found all over the house, each with a rarity color denoting how difficult it will be to obtain them. Players should collect as many as they can to upgrade koROBO!</p><p><strong>House of Future Past</strong></p><p>While koROBO has a whole apartment to clean and explore, players will be doing much more than just merely traveling around the home while helping the family.</p><p>Eventually, koROBO will unlock the radical ability to travel through time—at the mere touch of its tiny fingertips…?</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/koROBO_2024_07-19-24_015.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ The Cast</strong></p><p><strong>koROBO “Robotic <a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>ndroid”</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/koROBO_2024_07-19-24_012.jpg"></a></figure><p>A robot gifted to Tom on his 10th birthday, and the pint-sized hero of our adventure, koROBO is given to Tom by his estranged father.</p><p>koROBO isn’t strong by any means, but he’s got a go-getter attitude and a mischievous streak. koROBO helps out by cleaning up, helping Tom with his homework, and more. But will he have what it takes to fill the void that separates Tom’s family?</p><p><strong>Tom “Ten Year-Old Tinkerer”</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/koROBO_2024_07-19-24_029.png"></a></figure><p>A homebody by nature, Tom has few friends and spends much of his time in his room making modifications to his collection of toys and machines. While he rarely sees his dad after his parents divorced, he sometimes receives toys and other tchotchkes from his dad’s travels around the world.</p><p><strong><a title="Games > Sally [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/sally">Sally</a> “The Mother of Invention?”</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/koROBO_2024_07-19-24_032.png"></a></figure><p>Originally from Japan, Sally now raises Tom on her own in their apartment in Brocklyn. Sally hates when things are in disarray, and gets frustrated with Tom when he says things that don’t seem to make sense. While she and Tom’s father enjoyed a whirlwind romance, she eventually divorced him when his lust for travel grew too strong. Strong-willed and kind-hearted, she once dreamed of becoming a singer but now works as a waitress in a cafe to make ends meet.</p><p><strong>John “Wanderlust King”</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/koROBO_2024_07-19-24_031.png"></a></figure><p>Tom’s father. Considered an eccentric by some and a genius engineer by others, John and Sally were madly in love in their youth. However, when Tom was five, John left mysteriously, leaving only a note behind that read, “I’m leaving to protect you.” Despite the distance between the two, Tom clearly gets his love of mechanics from his father.</p><p><strong>Garth Vader (Real Name: Unknown)</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/koROBO_2024_07-19-24_030.png"></a></figure><p>A suspicious figure seen wandering around the courtyard of the apartment building, plenty of rumors have surfaced about the truth surrounding Garth. Some say that he’s fallen to the dark side and is plotting to take over the world. Others suggest that he’s simply the building’s super, watering the plants, feeding the birds, and tending to the plumbing. No one actually speaks to Garth, though, so the truth remains shrouded in mystery.</p><p><strong>■ World</strong></p><p><strong>A World in Crisis</strong></p><p>It is the year 2025, and the world is dealing with a looming energy crisis. Fossil fuels are quickly becoming unreliable as a fuel source, and humanity teeters hopelessly on the edge. Even in these most dire times, however, hope springs eternal in the hearts and minds of those that believe in a better tomorrow. When the world needs it most, one pint-sized hero could be the catalyst that sets humanity on a new path, one that would change the course of history forever: koROBO!</p><p><strong>The Brocklyn Apartment</strong></p><p>While traversing a living room or kitchen might not seem like a monumental task, things look a lot different when you’re a tiny, highly-motivated robot. While well-placed book piles and a toppled over chair might offer koROBO assistance in getting to hard-to-reach places throughout the home, it would be impossible for them to get to the hardest to reach places all on their own. koROBO is going to need a little help!</p><p><strong>Tom’s Room</strong></p><p>One might look at Tom’s room and see the messy room of a lazy kid, but that’s far from the truth. If one were to look closer, one would instead see the workshop and playground of a gifted child, wildly imaginative and naturally inclined to work with electronics. Tom’s room is full of toys, tools, and electronics in various states of tinkering. One boy’s garbage is another boy’s treasure, and Tom’s room is a treasure trove for koROBO. What new treasure will be uncovered while exploring Tom’s room?</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/koROBO_2024_07-19-24_010.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ <em>koROBO</em> Crowdfunding Campaign and Message From the Developer</strong></p><p>Tiny Wonder Studio is reaching out to fans for their support in bringing <em>koROBO</em> to life.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-%E2%80%93-how-to-beat-notsugo.931557/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-how-to-beat-notsugo/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess features some intense battles against massive Seethe enemies that force players to approach these challenges differently than regular stages. While positioning continues to be key, making changes on the fly and ordering villages to defend Yoshiro or attack the boss is just as important.</p>
<p>Even among the bosses in the game, Notsugo is unique, and not just due to his massive size and wide attacks that can deal tons of damage to both villagers and Soh, but also due to its weak spot located on the head, which makes it difficult for most roles to deal damage.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240713140642_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In some ways, the battle against Notsugo in Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is closer to a regular stage than the other boss battles, as preparation and proper villager placement are way more important than making changes on the fly. Before the battle begins, assign the Marksman role to four of your villagers and place them on the left and right sides of the arena so that they can cover the vast majority of the ground below. Assign the Woodcutter role to two villagers and place them near the Marskmen to protect them from the smaller Seethe that will be summoned during the fight. The two final villagers should be assigned to the Sumo Wrestler role so that they can keep Notsugo's attention away from Yoshiro, who is placed in a very exposed position during this fight.</p>
<p>Once the fight begins, place the two Sumo Wrestlers in the area previously occupied by the poison, and focus on using your ranged attacks while dodging the Seethe's powerful attacks. Do not use the Attack and Defense commands during this fight, as that will mess up your strategy and lead the Marksmen to their deaths. Heal the Sumo Wrestlers as needed, and unleash your most powerful attacks when the boss is stunned.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240713141117_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>One risky strategy that may require a little bit of luck is to actually make Notsugo get close to the Marksmen placed to the side of the arena so that its weak point can be easily reached by Soh's melee attacks.&nbsp; This could work if the boss is almost dead and you need to deal damage quickly. Also, the Genbu's Might Tsuba Guard is extremely good in this fight, as it can stun Notsugo under every condition, giving you the chance to deal decent damage with no risk.</p>

Yukinori Amane, who is falsely accused of a crime, uses his survival skills to evade the police and uncover the real culprit.</p><p>As a wanted man known to the public, Yukinori cannot satisfy his hunger by simply “shopping.” He must survive by finding acorns on the roadside or hamburgers in trash cans. Once his health is stable, he can work to “prove his innocence.”</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_900187"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->

The survival of his companion depends entirely on the player’s ability to gather supplies.</li><li><strong>Citizen Sensor System</strong> – In Tokyo’s society of mutual surveillance, citizens (NPCs) are sensitive to strange behavior.

Once branded as an outcast and socially excluded, life is over. Despite this harsh reality, the two stand up and try to overcome it. Will they reach heaven or hell? Only the player can watch over their fate.</li><li><strong>Detailed Pixel Art Depicting Real Tokyo</strong> – The game intentionally removes cyberpunk elements to create pixel art that reflects the “real Tokyo.” It portrays authentic Tokyo, not just Shinjuku or Shibuya, in a way only Japanese people can.</li><li><strong>Fusion of a Veteran <a title="Platforms > Anime [316 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/anime">Anime</a> Studio and Indie Developer</strong> – This work is a collaboration between Toei Animation, with 70 years of history in anime production, and Nestopi, a Japanese indie developer known for challenging game systems with a small team.

Word has it that you may also find more than just bike parts, to make your Red Hare… more than a bike?</li><li><strong>Spectacular Tactics and Special Attacks</strong> – Tactics are emblematic of the Three Kingdoms warfare lore. Of course the Fire Tactics is still in the game, sending fiery arrows into the stage, and so is the Water Tactics that will wash away any enemies who come at you. But this time, we have added a new Tactics that summons generals who helped you in the past, to fight by your side. Use your Special attacks and Tactics to clear out stages the way generals used to (or did they?)!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-limit-hands-on-preview-can-a-wicked-cool-art-style-set-this-soulslike-apart<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Pretty pixels go a long way.</h2></div><section><p>The thing that immediately stands out when roaming derelict buildings and creepy aqueducts in AI Limit is just how stylish and crisp everything looks, and as it turns out, that killer presentation goes quite a long way. Sure, it’s yet another soulslike with the same old bonfire checkpointing system, punishing combat encounters, and super gross bosses that really need to take a chill pill, but I’ve gotta admit, the anime-inspired, sleek and cartoonish art style really won me over, and I could see this becoming my next sweaty fascination – y’know, maybe as a nice chaser in between Shadow of the Erdtree sessions.</p><p>Like countless genre peers, AI Limit makes no apologies about its inspiration; this is a soulslike through and through. You’ll gather materials from fallen enemies to spend on stat upgrades, find weapons and equipment in every monster-filled corridor to customize your fighting style and abilities, and, of course, die a whole heck of a lot when some tanky boss with serious anger management issues uses your face as a doormat. Classic soulslike stuff!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>AI Limit Screens</h3></div></output><p>And at least in the hour-long demo I played, AI Limit seems content to follow that blueprint to a tee, offering pretty much no novel tweaks on the formula or reasons to play this one over the piles of games like it. With one notable exception, that is: the endlessly impressive and hard to look away from art style. </p><p>That might not sound like enough of a differentiator to keep one’s interest, and yet I found it to be the primary reason I was so eager to claw my way through each deadly zone to see what awesome-looking thing awaited me in the next area. In the same way the Persona series follows the traditional JRPG playbook very closely but sets itself apart by oozing style and unrivaled swagger, AI Limit really did stand out to me in many of those same ways. Whether it was the sleek and interesting UI or combat animations that made me feel like I was the main character in an action-packed anime as I cut down the enemy with ease, I found myself nodding my head in appreciation even when every other aspect was fairly by the numbers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m definitely intrigued by its fantastic presentation enough to add it to my list of soulslikes I’m excited to play.</p></div><p>I will say though, it's a bit surprising that, despite all the style AI Limit has going for it, the protagonist, at least in the demo, is woefully inexpressive. With no dialogue and a deadpan look on her face at all times, there’s not much beyond some neat looking outfits and sweet combat animations for me to go on. She doesn’t even make any kind of noise when she takes damage or dies, which just feels odd. I mean, I get that this lady’s supposed to be a robot, but why even give her a human appearance if you aren’t going to give her any humanity? Here’s hoping these details merely didn’t make it into this early build of the game.</p><p>The demo confined me to an early area that seemed pretty clearly intended as an introductory tutorial zone, but even so I managed to find some new weapons to try out and outfits to try on, and fooled around with one of AI Limit’s precious few unique mechanics, the Sync Rate meter, which is charged up by attacking things and loses power when you take hits or use special abilities that consume it, like firing an electric railgun I found lying around. Most importantly, the Sync Rate meter also determines how much damage your weapons do, rewarding you for keeping the meter full, and punishing you for depleting it, which made for a pretty interesting tradeoff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>AI Limit might not be immediately groundbreaking at first blush, but I’m definitely intrigued by its fantastic presentation enough to add it to my list of soulslikes I’m excited to play. With a release date planned for later this year, it seems I won’t have to wait too much longer.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft revealed last week that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24195312/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase-standard-subscription">increasing PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate prices</a>, and planning to launch a new Game Pass Standard tier soon without day one access to first-party Xbox games.</p><p>The FTC calls this new Game Pass Standard tier a “degraded product,” because new Game Pass users won’t be able to sign up to the $10.99 Game Pass for Console, which includes day one game access. Instead, Xbox Game Pass Standard will be priced at $14.99 and won’t include day one games, but will include online multiplayer.</p><p>“Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation — combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs — are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger,” says FTC in a filing today. “Product degradation — removing the most valuable games from Microsoft’s new service — combined with price increases for existing users, is exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged.”</p><p>The filing is part of an ongoing appeal lodged by the FTC against a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768244/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-case-news-announcements">district court’s decision not to block</a> Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition last year.

            <p>
Paramount+ has officially cancelled its divisive live-action Halo television series, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramount-releases-halo-tv-show-second-season-trailer">recently broadcast second season</a> set to be its last on the service.
</p>
<p>
Season 1 of Paramount+'s Halo series aired back in 2022, nearly a decade after the project was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spielberg-to-produce-a-halo-tv-show">first announced</a>. It launched to a mixed reception, however, drawing criticism for its writing, inconsistent tone, uneven plotting, and pacing. Halo fans also didn't love the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramounts-halo-reveals-master-chiefs-face">show Master Chief's face</a> just episodes in, or the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-revealing-master-chiefs-face-the-halo-tv-series-has-now-shown-his-nude-bum">show his bum</a> after that. And by the time he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cortana-just-watched-master-chief-have-sex">having sex in front of Cortana</a>, even Halo's co-creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-co-creator-marcus-lehto-shares-thoughts-on-divisive-tv-adaptation">admitted</a> he was "confused".
</p>
<p>
Despite these concerns, initial audience numbers were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-tv-show-sets-a-new-viewership-record-for-paramount">good</a>, and Paramount+ made the decision to forge ahead with a second season, albeit this time under the watch of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-tv-show-will-reportedly-lose-its-showrunner-after-season-one-is-over">new show runner</a>. And improvements were promised: Master Chief actor Pablo Schreiber (who also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-tv-show-star-says-master-chiefs-romantic-relationship-was-a-huge-mistake">wasn't a fan</a> of some of the first season's more controversial choices) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-season-two-will-better-than-the-first-master-chief-actor-promises">said</a> there was "no question" Season 2 was "far stronger" ahead of its airing this February.

<p>
Unfortunately, it seems those promises weren't enough to get viewers back on board. Paramount+ has now <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-1236075994/">confirmed to Variety</a> that its Halo TV show is officially cancelled, saying it "will not move forward with a third season on the service".
</p>
<p>
However, it seems there's still a chance the show might live on elsewhere if creators Xbox, Amblin TV, and 343 Industries get their wish. Citing an "individual with knowledge of the situation", Variety says all three will now attempt to shop the series around to other outlets, so perhaps don't write the Halo TV show off quite yet.

            <p>
Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm Studios has been hit by layoffs according to affected members of staff, with the majority of job losses said to be from its mobile team.
</p>
<p>
News of the layoffs first surfaced after NetherRealm quality assurance analyst Tony Lazzara <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tony-lazzara-83b00319_opentowork-activity-7219362131924672513-snus/">posted to LinkedIn</a>, writing, "Unfortunately, yesterday NetherRealm's mobile team was shut down. A ton of very talented people were put out of work."
</p>
<p>
"We had live services on multiple titles such as Mortal Kombat Mobile, Injustice 2, and Mortal Kombat Onslaught," Lazzara continued. "I was also affected."

<p>
Following Lazzara's post, a number of other NetherRealm employees have confirmed they were also affected by job cuts at the studio. "It hurts me to announce I’ve been laid off from NetherRealm Studios after about 10 years of working there," Elizabeth Ramirez <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elizabeth-ramirez-nava-2b303317_it-hurts-me-to-announce-ive-been-laid-off-activity-7219209713945604096-VZZV/">wrote</a>. "I will be seeking new opportunities as an animator for games or film.
</p>
<p>
Software engineer Antonio De Francesco also added their voice to those confirming they were no longer employed by NetherRealm. "I am sad to share that I am looking for a new role," they <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219144299609829378/">posted on LinkedIn</a>, "and would greatly appreciate your support."
</p>
<p>
NetherRealm has yet to publicly comment on reports of layoffs at the studio, so there's no official confirmation of how widespread the job losses might be. However, Insider-Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-developer-netherrealm-studios-hit-with-mass-layoffs/">claims</a> at least 50 members of staff have been impacted by the studio's cuts.
</p>
<p>
Word of lay offs at NetherRealm follows parent company Warner Bros. Discovery's admission it was bracing for a "tough year" back in February, after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">revealed</a> sales of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League had failed to meet its expectations. The cuts also appear to be a part of wider job losses at Warner Bros. Discovery, which <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-lays-off-1000-employees-finance-max-1236074169/">reportedly</a> laid off nearly 1000 employees this week.
</p>
<p>
2024 continues to be a devastating year for games industry employees, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">over 10,000 people</a> having lost their jobs so far. That's compared to the 10,500 games industry workers who were laid off across the entirety of 2023.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-2024-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is still on track for 2024, according to information shared with developers earlier this week.</p>
<p>A new report posted today on<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-2024-release/"> Insider Gaming</a> provides some clarification on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-2024/">a tweet</a> shared by Tom Henderson yesterday, which seemed to hint at a possible 2025 release for the mid-generation refresh console by Sony. According to the insider, developers can submit their applications supporting the PlayStation 5 Pro to CertOps (Platform Certification &amp; Operations) on July 30th, a date that was finalized as far back as 18 months ago. Additionally, all applications for the PS5 on games that will be released after September 15th will be required to support the PS5 Pro. This information was shared with developers earlier this week, so it seems like the system is still on track to be released later this year, possibly in the second half of November 2024.</p>
<p>Despite all this, several sources are apprehensive about the PlayStation 5 Pro's release later this year due to the limited number of first-party games that will use its features. However, nothing in the documentation seen by Tom Henderson implies that the system has been delayed.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially announced. We will update you on the system as soon as more information becomes available, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

For everyone else, this standard edition gets you the base game for Nintendo Switch and nothing more.

The visual novel will follow a private investigator as they unravel the murder of a student who is said to have been slain by Emio. The original protagonist from The Missing Heir, Ayumi Tachibana, also appears to be a playable character for part of the game.</p><p>If you want to check out the previous games in the series, The Girl Who Stands Behind and The Missing Heir, consider picking up <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1848262376826990935%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Femio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club%2F1100-6525119%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Two-Case Collection</a> at Best Buy for $60.

The result is that only the Game Pass Ultimate subscription, which is now $20 a month, will include access to all Game Pass games. </p><p>“Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs, see FTC’s February 7, 2024, Letter—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24852374-24-07-18-ftc-letter-re-microsoft-game-pass-price-increases&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24852374-24-07-18-ftc-letter-re-microsoft-game-pass-price-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the FTC writes</a></span>. It also points to a statement Microsoft made in its filings during the trial last summer suggesting Game Pass wouldn’t get more expensive just because Activision Blizzard’s games were added to it. </p><p>“Here, the acquisition would benefit consumers by making [<em>Call of Duty</em>] available on Microsoft’s Game Pass on the day it is released on console (with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition),” the company wrote at the time.

It’s not clear when a final decision in the appeal will be issued, and it’s hard to fathom what the consequences would be if Microsoft ended up losing. It would no doubt be even messier and more confusing than its Game Pass overhaul. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Paramount has canceled the Halo TV series on Paramount+ after two seasons; it has been announced.</p>



<p>The announcement came earlier today (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-2-seasons-1235952581/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Holly Reporter</a>), with Paramount+ offering a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work,” they said. “We wish everyone the best going forward.”</p>



<p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, its sources say that Xbox and 343 Industries will look to land the series at another outlet for a third season if possible.</p>



<p>“We deeply appreciate the millions of fans who propelled the&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>&nbsp;series to be a global success, and we remain committed to broadening the&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>&nbsp;universe in different ways in the future,” reads a statement from 343 Industries. “We are grateful to Amblin and Paramount for their partnership in bringing our expansive sci-fi universe to viewers around the world.”</p>



<p>The Halo TV Series was received as a mixed bag by those who watched the show. Season 1 was generally poorly due to the show moving away from its source material, while Season 2 improved ratings slightly.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear where Xbox and 343 Industries could take the Halo TV series next, but Amazon Prime could be a strong contender following the success of the platform with the Fallout TV series.</p>



<p>Where do you think Halo will go? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

            <p>
As Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion inches ever-closer, Blizzard has shared first gameplay and details for its new Spiritborn class during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjVUD8eLCFY">lengthy deep-dive livestream</a>.
</p>
<p>
In lore terms, the Spiritborn comes from the jungles of Sanctuary's Nahantu and is described as "an apex predator with a deep connection to the spirit realm". From a gameplay perspective, though, the Spiritborn is a dexterity focused class built around a spirit-infused martial arts move set - combining aspects of Muay Thai, taekwondo, karate, kickboxing, and boxing - that promises to make for Diablo 4's "fastest, most aggressive" class yet.
</p>
<p>
It has multiple gap-closers built into its basic attacks, several movement skills with "very high damage", plus various ways to upgrade its evades - and all its abilities are themed around four god-like Spirit Guardians that it summons during battle. There's a jaguar representing courage and ferocity; a massive centipede embodying balance and persistence; a giant eagle reflecting awareness and finesse, plus a gorilla that's a manifestation of protection and strength.

<p>
Breaking these down further, jaguar skills are all about speed and piling on constant pressure, and they generate a new stacking buff known as Ferocity through use. Ferocity increases the attack speed of all skills as it stacks, but also further enhances jaguar skills so they can be used more often.
</p>
<p>
The Ravager skill, for instance, has a passive effect that maintains Ferocity at a minimum level, but it can be activated to generate additional attacks when players hit something. Rushing Claw, meanwhile, is all about mobility, enabling the Spiritborn to dash and slash through targets over and over again, while the The Hunter is an ultimate skill that summons the jaguar onto the battlefield, destroying everything in the vicinity as it lands. This can even be upgraded for a chance to reset its cooldown after a kill to keep that kill streak growing. 
</p>
<p>
As for the gorilla, it offers a tankier skill set based around protection and defence. Its core mechanic is damage reduction through active blocking, all tied to the Resolve stacking buff, which reduces damage but falls off whenever a player is hit. Example skills include Crushing Hand, essentially two separate attacks that overlap in the middle and can smash enemies to bits, and Payback - which does increased damage the more something hits a player. Its ultimate brings in the gorilla itself, creating a large area on battlefield that grants protection while a player is in it, with the gorilla smashing enemies that stray inside.

<p>
Moving onto the giant eagle, its skills are all about freedom of movement, letting players tactically reposition themselves anywhere on the battlefield, increasing evade skills, even extend attacks into pseudo-ranged style moves. Soar, for instance, takes the Spiritborn up and out of battle for a second, then allows them to pick a descent position, amplifying damage to anything within it on landing. Then there's Razor Wings, essentially a boomerang-style throw attack, and The Seeker. This ultimate summons the eagle to a selected position, whereupon it'll charge up and unleash an upgradeable blast of energy. It's also the first ultimate with multiple charges, so it can be used back-to-back.
</p>
<p>
And finally, there's the centipede. This Spirit Guardian's skills are built around things like damage over time poisoning and crowd control, combined with sustaining elements such as the ability to leach life from enemies. Stinger, for instance, is a core skill that does a large amount of damage within a small area - but that damage also echoes out to poisoned enemies elsewhere on the battlefield. Scourge, meanwhile, adds fear, slow, and poison to enemies, and the Devourer ultimate summons the centipede to unleash a massive poison laser beam - which can be upgraded to instantly annihilate a poisoned enemy.
</p>
<p>
Notably, all these different skills can be mixed and matched for greater flexibility - although players can go down a single Spirit Guardian route if they'd prefer to specialise. This works through the new Spirit Hall class mechanic, enabling players to choose a starting Spirit Guardian as a primary bonus that'll boost all skills of that type, while also adding that spirit's tag to their entire skill kit for additional benefits. Later, it's possible to unlock three more bonuses so players can infuse more Spirit Guardian elements into their chosen playstyle.
</p>
<p>
And that's only the basics. Blizzard's deep-dive also showcases a few examples of Spiritborn itemisation, promising a large suite of legendaries and uniques for the new class - but you'll find a load of additional information in <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24107497/awaken-the-ferocity-of-a-new-class-spiritborn">the developer's accompanying news post</a>. Expect more details on Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion ahead of its launch on 8th October.

Rather than wait until September, those attending Gen Con 2024 can buy a copy of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Player Handbook early. Furthermore, the books sold are limited-run commemorative editions; a must-have for collectors.</p>

<p>According to an official press release, Wizards of the Coast will be providing 3,000 early copies of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Player Handbook to Gen Con 2024. This as part of their year-long celebration of the 50th anniversary of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, marking it as one of the oldest foundational fantasy TTRPGs ever.</p>

Each book will be embossed with the 50th-anniversary logo in gold foil, featuring a "Gen Con 2024" bookplate. This distinguishes these copies from other first-run copies while celebrating fifty years of history and stories around the table.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The energy at Gen Con is always electric. Being able to put copies of the 2024 Player’s Handbook, fresh from the printer, directly into players' hands on the floor of the convention is something truly special,” said Jess Lanzillo, VP of D&amp;D Franchise and Product at Wizards of the Coast. “We can't wait to see the excitement as our fans dive into the possibilities contained within!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are attending Gen Con 2024 and want to secure your copy of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player Handbook, </em>here's what you need to know. The books will be sold at the Lucas Oil Stadium, Northwest Concourse. They will be sold on August 1 between 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM EDT and August 2-4 between 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM EDT.</p>
<p>Each copy will be sold at an MSRP of $49.99 plus tax. At 7:00 AM EDT on each day, attendees can reserve an opportunity to pick up a copy. One simply needs to redeem a digital ticket for an event titled "D&amp;D 2024 <i>Player’s Handbook </i>Early Release Sale." Once it's secured, go to the line at the time and hours specified and wait to make your purchase.</p>
<p>Since only 3,000 copies are available, the books will be sold on a first come first serve basis.</p>
