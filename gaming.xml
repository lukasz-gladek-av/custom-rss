<p>It's not too long now until we finally get our hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> on Switch 2, with that <strong>2nd November</strong> release date rapidly approaching.</p>
<p>To sate our appetites in the interim, Nintendo has dropped a new teaser trailer showing off Koei Tecmo's very slick-looking Musou action featuring all of your favourite lunatics from the Zelda series. Oh, and Zelda herself, who is shown kicking seven shades out of huge armies in gameplay footage that, as a big Warriors franchise fan, this writer is incredibly excited about. It's all so smooth, so 60fps, so crystal clear and beautiful. Hold me, Tingle!</p>
<p>Now, beyond the excitement of finally getting a 60fps Musou game in the palm of our hands (and one that happens to look incredible, to boot), the trailer above also unveils some goodies to be nabbed for players who have a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and/or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a> save on their system.</p>
<p>Tears of the Kingdom data nets you a <strong>High Guard's Sword</strong> to be used in the game, whereas Age of Calamity nets you a <strong>High Guard's Claymore</strong>. Nothing groundbreaking, but welcome nonetheless.</p>

<p>If November is too far away, remember that the previous entry in the Hyrule Warriors series is playable on Switch 2 with a much improved, now-stable frame rate - one of various games to get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/33-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">unnannounced, 'secret' updates</a> thanks to the newer hardware's grunt. If the frequent dips put you off on your Switch 1, now's a good time to catch up.</p>
<p>And if that's not enough Musou for you, remember that Koei Tecmo is bringing Omega Force's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> to Switch 2 in January, too. Plenty of hacking and/or slashing to be getting on with, then!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have announced that the Lasombra and Toreador clans will now be included as part of the Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 base game, following strong criticism of the previous plans to have them be premium DLC and for pricier editions of the game. In their place two Story Packs will be created and launched in 2026 as part of an Expansion Pass available separately or with the Premium Edition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> has a release date confirmed for 21st October 2025 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>


<p>“Thanks to our community for the frank feedback on Bloodlines 2 and the Premium Edition. That feedback made it clear: Lasombra and Toreador belong in the base game, so that is what we are doing,” said Marco Behrmann, White Wolf Executive Vice President and Bloodlines 2 Executive Producer. “We’d also like to thank The Chinese Room for their quick turnaround on the concepts for the post-launch Story Packs. We’re constantly impressed by their creativity and skill in weaving enticing narrative threads that expand on the main story in Bloodlines 2.”</p>
<p>This change now means that there will be six clans available to all players – the Banu Haqim, Brujah, Lasombra, Toreador, Tremere and Ventrue – which are equivalent to character classes in other RPGs.</p>
<p>The two new stories are Loose Cannon, which will give players Brujah Sheriff Benny’s perspective and let them experience his story of relentless pursuit, set for Q2 2026, and <b><i>The Flower &amp; the Flame, which follows</i></b> Toreador Primogen Ysabella’s path to creating her dark magnum opus in Q3 2026.</p>

<p>Both story packs can be purchased separately for $14.99/£12.99/€14.99, and there’s also Santa Monica Memories cosmetic pack with decor items inspired by the original cult classic Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines to feature in Phyre’s in-game apartment for $11.99/£9.99/€11.99. They’re bundled into the $34.99/£28.99/€34.99 Expansion Pass or as part of the Premium Edition $89.99/£74.99/€89.99. Deluxe Edition ($69.99/£58.50/€69.99) is now worse value, as they get the Santa Monica Memories included, but there doesn’t seem to be a cheaper Expansion Pass option for them.</p>
<p>Physical Day One and limited Premium Editions are to be released in collaboration with PLAION, including character cards, a journal, and a steelbook case.</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2 is a game that’s evoked plenty of strong opinions amongst fans of the 2004 original, and the Vampire: The Masquerade setting in general. First announced back in March 2019 with Seattle-based developer Hardsuit Labs, the game’s development struggled to the extent that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/23/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delay-release-date-2021-hardsuit-labs-cancelled-developer/">Paradox made the decision to pull the project from Hardsuit Labs</a> and, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/14/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-cancelled-instead-of-getting-a-new-developer/">after considering cancelling it outright</a>, brought in The Chinese Room to reboot the game.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/04/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-developer-is-the-chinese-room-coming-in-2024/">Bloodlines 2 was re-revealed</a> in September 2023, the pitch and overarching story for Bloodlines 2 shifting compared to the originally revealed version of the game.</p>
<p>Still set in Seattle, the narrative has shifted away from casting you as a freshly fledged vamp and you are instead Phyre, an Elder Vampire who is known for being a harbinger of tumult and sudden change. That, for some, detracts from the fantasy of the setting, even if you are still able to tap into the abilities of a clan of your choosing and role play through the world. At the same time, it could be more accessible as an entry point for those unfamiliar with the TTRPG or original game.</p>
<p>We’ve been hands on with the opening couple hours of the game in the run up to Gamescom, and there’s an intriguing blend of characters, dire situations and powerful vampire types. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/fangs-on-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-opening-hours-and-the-lasombra-clan/">Check out our preview here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Development footage of what appears to be upcoming superhero action game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise Of Hydra</a> has exploded upon the internet like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Black Panther</a> clawing his way into a seedy Parisian bar and flinging himself at alt-fascist soldiers in a whirlwind of kicked chairs and bursting bottles. This also being the content of said video. 
</p>
<p>
Assuming the leaked goods are the Real McCoy, they suggest that the game will be a fast and furious brawler with a fair amount of environment destruction, which is probably what you're expecting from a game with Azzuri and Steve Rogers on the poster. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The <a href="https://streamable.com/ka4jm7">footage</a> comes to us via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/first-look-gameplay-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-surfaces">MP1st</a>, who attribute it to "a developer who worked on the game", and say it was created between 2022 and 2023, but do not link to the portfolio that originally contained it. 
</p>
<p>
They've also found <a href="https://imgur.com/a/jF1GGSk#oHzWJeF">a selection of images</a> that show various possible Marvel 1943 environments, including a plush lamp-lit hallway, a vast cavern entrance with dangling stalactites, a bunch of building-top areas with glass conservatory roofs, and a hazy nocturnal view of searchlights over what is presumably Paris.
</p><p>
Assuming it's the Genuine MacGyver, the leaked Black Panther video is very clearly WIP. The fixed camera perspective suggests that it's an internal test, knocked together to illustrate the flow of a typical Marvel 1943 fight scene. As such, we should be careful about reading too much into it. But I have to say, I do enjoy the 5am cat energy here. 
</p>
<p>
If you live with a younger feline, you'll be familiar with that time of day when they Catch The Crazy and start zipping about, striking amateur ninjitsu poses and climbing every nearby human bodypart/piece of furniture. I'd love it if Black Panther had a Zoomies mode that caused him to spontaneously sit on Captain America's face. I'd love it if he had a special terrain execution that consisted of hiding under the sofa and slashing people's feet off. "D'awww," the abbreviated sturmtruppen of Hydra would coo, clutching their bloody stumps. "What on Earth is going through his ickle head."
</p>
<p>
Developed by Skydance New Media and published by Plaion, with former Naughty Dog scribe Amy Hennig on-board to produce and co-write, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is the story of Captain America and the Panther fighting Hydra in occupied France, though part of it is set in Wakanda. It's inspired by the comicbook series Captain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uncharted-directors-black-panther-and-captain-america-game-revealed-as-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-out-2025">Announced in 2024</a>, the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-release-date-pushed-to-early-2026-for-polishing">slated to land in early 2026</a>. Which is not that far away, and Plaion have shown us little of the game beyond a couple of 'cinematic' trailers. I'll ask them if they have any comment on this footage, and when we can see more of the game.

            <p>Dark Math Games, a new studio of former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> developers, have announced a change to their forthcoming debut project, which will now be a third-person RPG.</p>
<p>The studio is one of many that have risen from the shattering of Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">years of legal threats</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-details-allegations-of-toxic-behaviour-ip-theft-at-disco-elysium-developer">accusations of toxic behaviour</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>While ZA/UM still exists and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zero-parades-is-the-next-game-by-disco-elysium-dev-zaum-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live">working on a new project</a>, other rival studios have formed to create their own spiritual successor to the isometric detective RPG.</p>

<p>Perhaps that's why Dark Math Games has now shifted perspective. Formerly XXXNightshift, the studio's forthcoming project is now known as Tangerine Antarctic and will be a third-person RPG instead of isometric.</p>
<p>"Set at the World's End ski village at Mount Hope, British Antarctica, Tangerine Antarctic is the name of the in-game hotel, designed by renowned Estonian architect Kaur Stőőr, where most of the games' action takes place," explained Timo Albert, founder and art director of Dark Math Games (formerly at ZA/UM).</p>
<p>"This is where you are stuck because of the blizzard and must solve the mysterious murders. And Tangerine Antarctic is one of the important characters of this true detective's RPG."</p>

</figure>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">Dark Math Games first revealed its formation and project in October</a> last year. Simultaneously, other former developers announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-in-development-from-leads-of-cancelled-sequel">formation of their studio Longdue</a>, while others still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">announced Summer Eternal</a>.</p>
<p>There's plenty of rivalry going on, then, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-staff-say-rival-projects-from-former-colleagues-are-friendly-competition">ZA/UM told Eurogamer earlier this year it's all "friendly competition"</a>.</p>
<p>"For us, always we think it's friendly competition," said principal writer Siim (Kosmos) Sinamäe. "We're not going to really think about what the other writers are doing, or the studios... how can I be better at my own craft? We're competing essentially against ourselves in this way of can we take it further? Do we have to make any compromises? I think it absolutely sets us apart."</p>

<p>With a heavy discount for current owners</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/touryst">The Touryst</a> was a delightful little game from developer Shin'en Multimedia, and the company has now revealed that its official re-release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/touryst-deluxe">The Touryst: Deluxe</a>, will launch on the Switch 2 next week on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are available now at <strong>19.99€ / $19.99</strong>, though current owners who purchased The Touryst from the Switch eShop can bag the re-release at a heavily discounted price of <strong>4.99€ / $4.99</strong>.</p>
<p>The game will run at 4K resolution with frame rate set at 60fps; it's worth mentioning here that the game already ran at 60fps on Switch, albeit at a max resolution of 1080p. 120fps won't be supported at launch, but this might be something Shin'en could explore at a later date.</p>
<p>Several other graphical enhancements have been applied, but players can also look forward to brand new content, including new locations and quests, and even a playable arcade spin-off of the <strong>FAST</strong> racing series.</p>
<p>Let's take a peek at everything new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Resolution is now 4k (from 1080p) at 60fps<br>
- Added new locations, new items, new quest<br>
- Added new Arcade Cabinet (featuring FAST ZERO racing game)<br>
- Added Global Illumination for many locations<br>
- Added Voxel waves on the beach shores<br>
- Added dynamic Ambient Occlusion<br>
- Added Anti-Aliasing<br>
- Much improved Rain effect<br>
- Much improved Depth of Field effect<br>
- Improved controls<br>
- Import your save game from the Nintendo Switch 1 version</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now let's see how The Touryst: Deluxe is shaping up, along with a couple of comparison shots with the Switch original:</p>


<p>Shin'en Multimedia also launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> as a launch title for the Switch 2 to critical acclaim, earning a well-deserved score of 9/10 from us. It's since received a free update to add more performance options and content.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-fights-back-on-light-of-motiram-lawsuit-says-horizon-devs-acknowledged-it-wasn%E2%80%99t-original-in-the-first-place.1301139/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ever since Light of Motiram was <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> in November 2024, it was immediately obvious to everyone (us included) that it looked very, very similar to Guerrilla Games' Horizon Zero Dawn/Forbidden West, from the animal-like machines down to the red-haired protagonist dressed in tribal gear.</p>



<p>In July 2025, Guerrilla Games' owner Sony Interactive Entertainment <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/" target="_blank">sued Tencent</a>&nbsp;(the parent company of Light of Motiram developer Polaris Quest) in the state of California, alleging copyright and trademark infringement and adding that Tencent reps had reached out to Sony in 2024 about the possibility of making</span> a mobile Horizon game. Sony assumes that when talks failed, Tencent went ahead and made its own Horizon-inspired title anyway.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Tencent officially fought back with a motion to dismiss on a 'myriad of flaws', including but not limited to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lack of actual jurisdiction over Tencent Holdings, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and headquartered in China and merely the parent company of the actual entities developing the game, which the motion says haven't been served yet in the case: '<em>Sony’s threadbare, conclusory allegations improperly lump these Defendants together with the foreign companies alleged to be responsible for the core conduct at issue. Sony’s vague allegations against ‘Tencent’ or ‘Defendants’ generally cannot substantiate the claims it brings against Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S., or Tencent Holdings specifically</em>.</li>



<li>For the time being, the claims amount to speculation as the game's release date (which has conveniently been set just now to Q4 2027 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>) is far away and the alleged infringements haven't happened and may never happen.</li>



<li>Lastly and perhaps more interestingly, the motion to dismiss labels Sony's lawsuit as a clumsy attempt to secure a corner of popular culture for themselves. </li>
</ul>



<p>In this regard, Tencent's motion goes as far as including actual quotes from Guerrilla Games, specifically from Lead Artist Jan-Bart van Beek, who mentioned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tLcD1r-6w&amp;t=859s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a NoClip documentary</a> that when pitching Horizon, the developers initially shelved it because of its similarities to Ninja Theory's 2013 game Enslaved: Odyssey to the West:</p>



<p><em>Enslaved basically featured a post-apocalyptic world, a female protagonist, machines that were slumbering that would be awakened. So I myself went to Hermen and I said like, I don't think we should do this, it touches too much of these other points. And Hermen, he sort of was very reluctant. He said like okay, well, I think it's a bad idea to do this, but you know, we'll can it for now and maybe we'll look at it later.</em></p>



<p>That's exactly what happened. For some time, Guerrilla worked on another pitch, a shooter set in an alternate history steampunk setting loosely in the vein of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Unbeknownst to the Dutch studio, though, Ready at Dawn was already doing something not too far from that with The Order: 1886. Eventually, Studio Technical Director Michiel van der Leeuw asked Studio Head Hermen Hulst to reconsider the Horizon pitch, and Guerrilla switched back to that.</p>



<p>Tencent's point is clear-cut: </p>



<p><em>By suing over an unreleased project that merely employs the same time-honored tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after Horizon—like Enslaved, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Far Cry: Primal, Far Cry: New Dawn, Outer Wilds, Biomutant, and many more—Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions.</em></p>



<p>However, it should be noted that Tencent, or at least its developers who are actually making the game, have made several changes in the description and the screenshots of Light of Motiram to distance themselves from the Horizon IP. The red-headed protagonist who looked a lot like Aloy is nowhere to be seen, for instance. </p>



<p>To be fair, the actual game is probably going to play quite a bit differently. It will have survival mechanics such as base building. It also supports online cooperative play, which is missing from the Horizon games (although Guerrilla is now working <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-is-guerrillas-next-big-game-with-horizon-3-a-ways-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Horizon Online</a>).</p>



<p>As to the lawsuit, we'll see how Sony responds to this motion to dismiss. We'll report any noteworthy updates on the lawsuit, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>The local release will be published by NIS America, but we don't have a release date just yet. On a more positive note, a Switch 2 version (and Game-Key Card physical release) has also been confirmed. It's arriving in Japan alongside the Switch, PlayStation and PC release.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067somwri&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This title was previously targeting a 2025 launch, after it was delayed in September 2024. So hopefully the wait will finally be over early next year. If we hear any updates about the local release date or window, we'll let you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> Remember how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_tactics_i_b_ii_cosmos"><strong>R-Type Tactics I • II Cosmos</strong></a> by Granzilla was meant to be coming to the Switch this year? Well, it's now been delayed (again).</p>
<p>In an update during a live stream, the developer announced the title would be arriving on Nintendo's hybrid system in <strong>2025</strong> instead of Fall 2024. No reason was attached to this delay, but the developer has apologised once again.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, this package will contain the turn-based strategy tactical RPG's <strong>R-Type Tactics</strong> (Command in the West) and <strong>R-Type Tactics II: Operation Bitter Chocolate</strong>. You can find out more about these releases in our existing coverage.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> games are back with not only a new movie but also an updated package for the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>If you're not sold on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> just yet, Nintendo has now released a new seven-minute overview trailer which outlines not only the gameplay but also the new content and updates. In case you did miss it, this includes enhanced resolution, improved UI, extra storybook chapters, the new assist mode, amiibo support, and more!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>With enhanced resolution (1080p on Nintendo Switch/4K* on Nintendo Switch 2), improved UI, extra Storybook Chapters, a new Assist Mode, and more, Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 are now out of this world!"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, this trailer has only been released in Japan, but there's still enough on display to get an idea of what's on the way. When an English version of the trailer is released (or a similar trailer is made available), we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>One other thing that's been spotted in this overview is two new storybook pages. Although it's all in Japanese, it seems <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/52980-two-new-rosalina-s-storybook-pages-from-super-mario-galaxy-2-revealed">they've already been translated</a>. Nintendo will also be releasing a physical version of Rosalina's Storybook, but it's worth noting, the new chapters and pages <em>won't</em> be included.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the storybook and the updated versions of the Galaxy games in our previous coverage:</p>

<p>Two Namco games join 'Nintendo Classics'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has today announced it will be expanding its Switch Online + Expansion Pack service with two more games for the Game Boy Advance library.</p>
<p>They include the Namco titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mr_driller_2">Mr. Driller 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/klonoa_empire_of_dreams">Klonoa: Empire of Dreams</a>, and they'll be arriving next week on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>. The puzzle title Mr. Driller 2 started life in arcades and was then ported to the GBA for the system's Japanese launch.</p>
<p>The puzzle-platform title Klonoa: Empire of Dreams debuted on the GBA in 2001 and allows you take control of Klonoa as you take down enemies, solve puzzles and jump your way through 40 incredible stages. Here's Nintendo's official description these titles:</p>
<h3>KLONOA Empire of Dreams</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The ruler of a distant empire suffers from a serious case of sleepless nights. In his torment, Emperor Jillius passes a law forbidding his loyal subjects from ever dreaming again! One morning, our hero Klonoa and his friend Huepow find themselves in front of the emperor, charged with dreaming of<br>
adventure. As punishment for their crimes, they must defeat the four monsters that plague the lands.</p>
<p>Play as Klonoa and take down enemies with the ever-trusty Wind Bullet. Solve puzzles and collect helpful items like stars as you jump your way through 40 incredible stages! Help Klonoa in his journey to redeem himself and find out just why dreams have become so taboo...</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Mr. Driller2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Join Susumu and Anna as a mysterious outbreak of Blocks threatens the world's existence once more. Armed with a mighty drill, dig deep through multicolored blocks until you reach safety. Not all blocks will be breakable, so be careful that the blocks you break don't cause others to fall on you or cut off your Air Supply! Scramble to grab air capsules for a recharge, and you'll be just fine to reach your goal. How deep can you dig underground? Drill to your heart's content in three modes: Mission Driller, Endless Driller, and Time Attack Driller!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Japan will receive the same two titles next week. And as usual, these games come with modern benefits such as the ability to save and load on the fly, and even rewind your gameplay.</p>
<p>The GBA app was also recently updated to Version 3.0.0 (alongside the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/magical_vacation">Magical Vacation</a> in Japan). It includes button remapping options and even 1080p support in handheld mode on the Switch 2. You can find out more about this update in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/switch-onlines-gba-app-has-been-updated-version-3-0-0">our previous story</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be revisiting these GBA games on Nintendo's subscription service next week? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>The arcade-style beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a> is on its way to the Switch and Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p>Ahead of release, Dotemu and Tribute Games have slowly been revealing new playable characters. This week, a new trailer has dropped for Black Panther and Cosmic Ghost Rider. An official description for both of these characters has also been shared:</p>
<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"King T’Challa, the Black Panther and stalwart leader of Wakanda, dashes into battle wielding his vibranium-enhanced suit and sonic daggers. With peerless martial arts skills and strength, he’ll pounce on any threat or foe foolish enough to challenge him!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>Cosmic Ghost Rider</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"After Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, Cosmic Ghost Rider can’t let that go unpunished. Atop his Hell cycle, this wild incarnation of the Rider roars across the spaceways. Beware: this Spirit of Stellar Vengeance punishes by wielding both hellfire and the Power Cosmic!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the previous character reveals include heroes like Silver Surfer and Beta Ray Bill, with the rest of the roster made up of Marvel classics like Captain America, X-Men characters, and Spider-Man. Together they'll travel from "New York City to the depths of the Negative Zone" to fight for the future of the universe.</p>

Who knew there was so much treasure to be found there?! By comparison, only 487,585 items were looted from trashcans, which apparently means there's more to be gained from going into an outhouse than digging through a normal trash receptacle. Players also looted 1,811,970 items from boomboxes, beer coolers, and grills. However, red chests comfortably took the top slot with 14,814,296 items looted in the first weekend.</p><p>Getting all of that treasure didn't happen without a price; 2,034,399 players suffered an unfortunate end by barrel. Grenade fatalities were even higher with 4,563,416. Although deaths by toxic goo were much smaller with 349,734, those are the ones that looked like they hurt the most.</p><p>Among the game's vehicles, exactly 16,220,852 were destroyed, although the stat doesn't break it down by vehicle. Players attempted 62,718,658 boss battles, and 55,403,323 bosses fell in defeat. However, there were 16,220,852 failed boss encounters that left the players on the losing end.</p><p>Additionally, Gearbox shared a code for the Break Free Pack and two ECHO-4 drone skins: JS63J-JSCWJ-CFTBW-3TJ3J-WJS5R.</p><p>Although Borderlands 4 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">had primarily positive critical reviews</a>, PC players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-getting-clobbered-on-steam-with-negative-reviews/1100-6534683/" data-ref-id="1100-6534683">have been very vocal on Steam</a> about performance and optimization issues. Gearbox Studios CEO Randy Pitchford has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">disputed players' accounts</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/randy-pitchford-remains-defiant-about-borderlands-4-pc-issues/1100-6534798/" data-ref-id="1100-6534798">remained defiant about the issue</a> while also offering optimization tips.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher 3 is one of the best-selling and most acclaimed video games of all time, yet for all the countless play-hours that have been poured into its narratives and subsystems, there’s one in particular that stands out: Gwent. This is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/Gwent_Card_Game">mini-game </a>within the game which sees the player collecting cards from diverse sources, building a deck and seeking out opponents, sometimes for money, often just for fun. Players loved it, swapped tips on where to get the best cards, how to beat the hardest foes, spent entire sessions just playing Gwent instead of furthering the game’s main plot and innumerable side-quests. Perhaps inevitably, it has now arrived in a stand-alone, physical version.</p><div catalogid="82044c57-cd8b-4820-bee8-5264c6ed6bfd" id="228172"><div id="228172" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gwent: The Legendary Card Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For clarity, there are actually two different versions of Gwent. There’s the one from The Witcher 3 game and a separate video game called <a href="https://www.playgwent.com/en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwent: The Witcher Card Game</a>, which is run by the gaming platform GOG and differs considerably from the original, leveraging online matchup play to let players go head to head. This physical card game is a faithful replication of the original Witcher 3 version, not the GOG version. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What’s in the Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as the protagonist, Geralt, collects cards to play Gwent in the video game, so Gwent: The Legendary Card Game, is a box full of cards. It’s important to note that it contains versions of all the cards from the video game, plus its downloadable content, which amounts to almost 450 cards in total. They’re also very similar to the ones you’ll see on-screen, using the same layout, artwork and iconography.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is a little frustrating – some cards have explanatory text, which is very helpful, while others just have icons even though there’s room on them for a description – it does allow you to admire the art. Among the gorgeous polygons on the video game, it’s easy to overlook how good and how varied the card art for Gwent is. Here, it’s front and center, and it’s delightful, full of life and detail, and every card is different, even if they’re functionally identical copies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the cards, there’s a tiny punchboard of tokens and a paper play mat to organize your cards during the game. These are both terribly disappointing, flimsy and prone to wear and tear. The play mat doesn’t lie flat easily, and the creases make the cards slide. Among the tokens is a score tracker and it’s often easier just to use that and organize the cards during play yourself.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gwent is actually a pretty weird game, although you might not immediately pick that up from scanning the rulebook, which is overly terse and offers little in the way of examples. It’s played over three rounds and the first player to win two wins the whole match. At the start of the first round, you draw 10 cards and – this is the odd and critical bit – that’s all you get for the entire game. You don’t draw any more cards in rounds two or three. Your initial 10 has to last you the whole match, and learning when to dole them out and when to retain them is a central plank of the game’s strategy.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gwent is actually a pretty weird game, although you might not immediately pick that up from scanning the rulebook.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Your play area is divided into three rows, for melee, missile, and siege units. Most cards have a symbol indicating which row they’re played into. Playing a card is often as simple as placing it into its marked row. Such cards generally have a strength value, and you’ll add that value to your growing total of strength in play. This continues until one player passes instead of playing a card, whereupon their opponent can carry on playing cards until they, too, pass. Then, the player with the highest strength total wins the round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this sounds simple, it immediately throws down some challenges for the players. In the first round, either player can likely win if they just keep on playing cards, but doing so leaves them less likely to win the other two rounds and thus the game. So, you’re trying to read each other, considering the cards in your hand and deciding when to pass and when to push. There’s a Poker-like element to this, muddied by the fact that there’s no statistics to rely on in terms of predicting what your opponent is holding, which means there’s no real bluff element. In fact, if they’ve built the deck themselves, you might have no information at all. There’s a definite thrill of venturing into the unknown with each decision, but your choices to pass or play are being made in a frustrating vacuum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To combat this, the game offers various cards with special abilities, which are denoted by an icon on the card rather than text, a minor speedbump to overcome while learning the game. They’re mostly very simple. Tight Bond multiplies the strength of the card by the number of other cards on your side with the same name. Cards with the Spy ability are played into your opponent’s half of the field, adding their strength to their side, but allowing you to draw two new cards in return. A Medic lets you retrieve and play a card from your discard, and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These muddy the waters somewhat. You won’t want to play a Medic on the opening turn, for a simple example, as there probably won’t be any discards available. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to unit cards are various categories of special cards. The easiest to handle are heroes, which behave largely as units do but are immune to special abilities, making them harder to destroy or nullify. Weather cards are played to the side of the board and affect both sides, reducing the strength of all cards (except heroes) in one of the three areas to one. These can produce huge swings, as can some other special cards like Commander’s Horn, which doubles the strength of all cards on its row, or Scorch, which sends the highest-strength cards in the game to the discard pile. These add to the excitement and anticipation of the pass-or-play mechanic and also give some tactical structure to play around. If your opponent is laying down ranged combat cards and you’re holding a Fog weather card that’ll reduce that row to strength 1, you can save your own ranged cards for next round and hope to spring a nasty surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the full span of card types and powers do make your turn to turn decision making more interesting, and up the stakes considerably given that some of them can be game changing, you’re still very much making decisions in the dark. That Fog card, for instance: the strategy is pretty basic, and isn’t actually all that useful if your opponent only has one ranged card in hand and it’s useless if they also have a Clear Weather card to counter it. You have no way of knowing what’s in their hand or deck. Gwent is an exciting game, but it’s not a particularly strategic one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is, however, a deck construction game, and deck construction games mostly draw their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> from deciding which cards you’re going to include in your deck before you play. There are various rules about what you can include. A legal deck includes a single leader, who offers a special ability you can use one time during play, at least 22 unit cards, and up to 10 special cards like heroes and weather. There are five factions included in the game, each of which has a particular play style and set of powers, and you can only build with cards from your own faction. Nilfgaard, for example, specializes in card draw while the Skellige deck includes berserkers that can be triggered and replaced with much more powerful alternatives. And since you have all the cards from the video game at your disposal, you have a lot of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building</a> options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trouble is that, however you choose to construct your deck, the game is eternally held back by that sense of randomness. You can put all the work you want into your carefully-curated cards but if your opponent just happens to have a card that counters your best abilities, you’re probably screwed. Or not, if they just happen to play it at the wrong time because they’re as clueless about what you’re holding as you are about their hand. Worse, it seems fairly clear that some cards and factions are better than others. That 10-card limit over the entire game is so brutal that the two extra cards drawn by a spy can be absolutely game-changing. Thus, factions that are good at generating card draws – Northern Realms, Nilfgaard, and Monsters – are better than those that don’t. And within those factions, you’ll generally want to include abilities that draw cards over those that don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, there’s a considerable frustration around tracking the game state. You’re given counters to mark your strength total in tens and ones, which is fiddly to start with. But as soon as you get effects like commander’s horn and tight bond, strength totals can rise and fall explosively, and there’s no way to mark this other than recalculating your total strength with each and every card play. In the original video game this was all done automatically, making it easy, but here’s it’s a right royal pain, especially given the way card effects can pile on card effects, making it easy to miss something and calculate a wrong total.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5X0V5?object_uuid=64692f53-b742-449a-bb4f-8f058839a218&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://store.ign.com/products/the-witcher-gwent-the-legendary-card-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get it at IGN Store</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/98Ppl2?object_uuid=64692f53-b742-449a-bb4f-8f058839a218&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Hachette Boardgames</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrwkq?object_uuid=64692f53-b742-449a-bb4f-8f058839a218&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at No Loading Games</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 17, 2025 10:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Inside the original whole of a video game, Gwent was great. Chasing down the cards you wanted was fun and addictive, it offered a pleasing change of pace from the main role-playing narrative, and the game was fast and smooth. As a stand-alone physical game, it’s rather less engaging, clumsy to administer and highlighting its lack of tactical and strategic depth. It’s not without its charms: it’s still fairly quick, and it builds tension nicely through play and counterplay, even if your ability to plan and react are severely limited by your card draw. Ironically, in a neat illustration of the power of collectible card games, releasing all the cards in a single set might actually have been the game’s undoing, robbing it of the pleasure of slowly upgrading and refining your ultimate deck.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/gwent-the-legendary-card-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/2xko-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2xko-review-in-progress-closed-beta-impressions.1300953/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t think there’s ever been a fighting game that I have played more of so long before release than 2XKO. Between three Evo demos and two “alpha lab” tests, Riot’s exciting League of Legends-themed 2v2 tag fighter has repeatedly popped into my life for a couple days, then faded from existence until the next time I get to throw down with my buddies Ekko and Ahri. But finally, with the recent closed beta, 2XKO is here to stay (if not fully available to everybody yet), which means it's time for some extended thoughts on why I’ve been looking forward to this exciting tag fighter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a whole lot to unpack, so let’s start with the focus on simple controls. Unlike most fighting games that offer at least the option of using traditional command inputs for special moves (like those dating back to the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat’s arcade cabinet days), 2XKO simplifies all of its special and super moves to single or simultaneous two-button presses. So instead of doing a quarter circle forward motion for a fireball, all you have to do is press the S1 button; If you wanna do a super, you press an attack button and one of the special buttons at the same time; and if you want to do your ultimate attack, you press both special buttons at the same time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a double-edged sword, because while it does make it a little easier for a complete newcomer who has trouble with quarter-circle or Dragon-Punch inputs, it also turns what should be a four-button game – with light, medium, and heavy attack buttons, plus a tag button – into a six-button game, at minimum. Most people will be using a dash and parry macro as well, putting every single button on a standard controller to work. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, I’ve felt my hands getting lost on my controller in 2XKO moreso than any other fighting game I’ve played because my brain has to parse which special move is tied to which special button, and which direction I had to hold for it. Ultimately, it’s just easier for me – someone who has committed thousands of hours to train my muscle memory on how fighting games have always worked – to compartmentalize a punch or kick related special move input to the punch or kick button than it is to try and remember whether they’re arbitrarily placed on S1 or S2. It’s a learning curve that I was eventually able to overcome, but one that nonetheless made me yearn for a classic/modern control scheme split like what Street Fighter 6 uses. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The second big thing is that 2XKO uses an active tag system much like what’s been used in games like BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle and Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid. The idea is that every character has two assist moves that they can be called in to execute, and once they finish the attack they’ll remain in a pose for a few seconds before retreating back off screen. At any point while the assist character is on screen, you can press the tag button to swap control to them. This opens the door for potential tricky mix-up opportunities, especially when you’re able to sandwich your target between your assist and point characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That system works incredibly well here in 2XKO, especially since so many of the characters have special moves that seemed designed specifically around it. Vi and Ekko for instance, both have specials that allow them to cross to the other side of their opponent, with the downside being that they are typically punishable. But if you cover them with an assist, not only do you make the crossover safe, but you get a free left/right mix-up opportunity by swapping to the other character. This is just a basic example and, once you start digging deep into the tech of some of these characters, you can find some absolutely dirty stuff that you can do to your opponent. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Experimenting with each fuse to find which fits my playstyle has been a lot of fun.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And all of that is before even bringing fuses into the mix. Much like Grooves in the Capcom vs SNK series, Fuses are an extra little bonus that you take with you into a match that allow you to break one of the established rules. For example, typically, once you use your super, your combo is over. But with Double Down you can do a super, then tag in your partner character for them to do <em>their</em> super to add on extra damage, and switch characters in the deal. You normally are only allowed one active tag per assist call, but with the Freestyle fuse you can call in your assist, active tag to them, do a couple of hits, and then active tag again back to the point character. These Fuses can totally change your approach to how you use your team and spend your meter, and experimenting with each to try and find which one fits my playstyle and my team best has been a lot of fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t want to learn two characters and instead just want to focus on one, there are also two Fuses that allow you to do just that. Juggernaut and Sidekick both have you playing as only one character with just one life bar, but to make up for that they have increased health, higher defense, start with two bars of super instead of one, and can have a maximum of five bars of super instead of three.</p><div id="2xko-character-community-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">2XKO Character Community Tier List</h3><h3>2XKO Character Community Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Juggernaut also has the added advantage of being able to forcibly swap an opponent’s character to focus on the one with less health and prevent them from regaining gray life, while Sidekick gives you the ability to reduce the amount of damage you take by timing button presses with enemy attacks. You can also charge up your assist moves by holdingthe tag button, letting them travel a distance before actually committing to their attack. You do lose the ability to do active tags, which is one of the most fun aspects of 2XKO, but nonetheless, I love it when tag fighters find ways to let us just focus on mastering a single character instead of having to be equally good with two or three. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the best unique feature of 2XKO, though, is the fact that it’s a fighting game that can be played cooperatively with a friend. In Duos mode, each person controls their own character, with the off-screen player being the one that can call the assist, and the other being the one that has to do the active tag to give up control to their partner. It works both as a fun way to experience a fighting game with a similarly skilled friend that doesn’t involve having to beat each other up, and also as a way to introduce someone new to the genre and be able to give them real time feedback. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If there's one glaring weakness of 2XKO's beta right now, it's the slim roster size.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s one glaring weakness of 2XKO right now, it is its slim roster size. There are currently only nine characters, and Riot has promised just one more to be added for launch. Ten isn’t even a lot even for a 1v1 fighter, but even worse for a tag fighter where you need to find two characters that fit your playstyle (unless, again, you decide to go with Juggernaut or Sidekick as your Fuses). And while that does suck, and leads to a lot of repetition where you’re fighting against the same characters and the same teams over and over again, it is a blow that is at least softened by the excellent design of that handful of characters. Whether it’s Ekko and his tricky clone mind games, Yasuo’s wild combo routes that have him stance-cancelling his way into bouncing his opponent all over the screen, Vi’s insane movement and whiff-punishing ability, or Illaoi’s tentacle set ups, these are some of the most fun fighting game characters I’ve ever played around with. And the beauty of it is that due to the flexibility of 2XKO’s combo and Fuse systems, rarely do I ever see any of these characters being played exactly the same way by two different people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that said, It’s still too early to call this a proper review of 2XKO because of all that we haven’t seen yet. There’s ranked mode, for instance, and that final tenth character on the launch roster – and I’ll definitely want to see how the free-to-play progression feels once the shops are more fully populated with cosmetics to purchase with in-game currency. But for now, 2XKO is shaping up to be one of the most exciting fighters on the horizon, during a time when there are <em>a lot </em>of exciting fighters on the horizon. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Fighting Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is a senior guides producer at IGN.

Windows enthusiasts have discovered a way to enable this new Xbox mode early in Windows 11, thanks to the latest 25H2 update to the operating system.</p><p>The method, which involves installing a Release Preview version of Windows 11 and lots of tweaks, works on a variety of handheld gaming PCs — including MSI’s Claw devices and Asus’ ROG Ally range. I’ve been trying it out on the original ROG Ally today, and it allows the device to ignore Asus’ own software in favor of Microsoft’s Xbox app at boot.</p><p>The new Xbox full-screen experience doesn’t load the full Windows desktop or a bunch of background processes, freeing up more memory for games. It’s essentially not loading the Explorer shell and saving around 2GB of memory by suppressing all the unnecessary parts of a typical Windows 11 installation.</p><p>You launch straight into the Xbox PC app instead, which includes all of your PC games from the Microsoft Store, Battle.net, Steam, and other storefronts. There’s a Game Bar for navigating around, and a new task view that’s a lot more handheld-friendly.</p><p>You can also still swap into a Windows desktop mode, or access Windows apps and games directly in this full-screen Xbox mode. Microsoft warns that you’re exiting to the Windows desktop and that you should use touch or a mouse and keyboard “for the best experience,” and it’s the exact same Windows experience that exists on multiple devices right now.</p><p>If you want to try this out for yourself, it’s a relatively easy process to get going. But be warned, fiddling with registry settings or the Windows Feature Store (known as Velocity) could result in system instability. If you’re willing to risk some issues that might need rolling back or require a reinstall of Windows, there’s a handy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1niwsfi/guide_for_enabling_the_full_screen_experience_on/">guide on Reddit</a> for all the settings required.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780388/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-mode-windows-11-handheld-leak#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/780388/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-mode-windows-11-handheld-leak]]></content:encoded>
