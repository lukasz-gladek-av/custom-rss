            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Split Fiction has had a "<em>hugely successful launch</em>" according to <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">EA</a>, as the latest co-op adventure from Hazelight Studios nears&nbsp;<strong>4 million copies sold</strong>. The game was highlighted by EA in its wrap-up report for its 2025 fiscal year, and counted as a key part of what led to a "<em>strong finish</em>" for the year alongside EA Sports FC 25.</p>
<p>Hazelight Studios followed up the news from the financial report with a post on its official <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1919852640189456892">X</a> account, saying "<em>4 million sold! So many of you have picked up Split Fiction already, it's amazing...Seeing the fun you have with our game and the love you show for Mio, Zoe and each other warms our hearts here at Hazelight. And so many hot dogs made...</em>"</p>
<p>Hazelight's previous title and game of the year winner in 2021, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/">It Takes Two,</a> surpassed <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/it-takes-two-sold-over-20-million-copies-and-won-goty-but-hazelights-josef-fares-says-all-the-numbers-looked-really-really-bad-before-the-co-op-studio-became-this-really-big-developer/">20 million copies sold in March 2025</a>. Split Fiction has a long way to go to reach that milestone, but it certainly seems like it's on its way there.</p>
<p>Just last week, we learned that the previously announced Split Fiction movie will star Sydney Sweeney as one of the two female leads. It's not yet known which of the two she will play or who will join her as a co-star. Wicked director Jon M. Chu has signed on to direct the adaptation, with Deadpool &amp; Wolverine writers Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese penning the script.</p>
<p>Along with confirming the sales milestone for Split Fiction, EA's wrap-up report for its 2025 fiscal year confirmed that the next <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">Battlefield</a> game will be revealed this summer and that it will release sometime before April 2026. The next Skate game is also set to release during that same period.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/be-careful-what-you-read-about-an-elden-ring-movie.1182735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/662200/elden-ring-movie-nexus-point-news-be-careful<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Tuesday, a publication called <em>Nexus Point News</em> published a headline for what looked to be a major piece of entertainment news: “EXCLUSIVE: Alex Garland Set To Direct ‘Elden Ring’ Film For A24.” The article claimed that <em>Elden Ring</em> “is expected to be Garland’s next film” and that shooting is expected to start in 2026.</p><p>But don’t get your hopes up: soon after the article was published, <em>Nexus Point News</em> pulled it, and the publication won’t say why. How this article made the rounds is an interesting case study in the way news travels on the internet.</p><p>We first saw the <em>Nexus Point News</em> article from a Wario64 post on X. Generally, Wario64 is a great account to follow to see breaking news in video games almost as soon as it happens. And the account is quite popular, with more than 1 million followers on X. But none of us at <em>The Verge</em> had ever heard of <em>Nexus Point News</em>, let alone recognized it as a place that reliably breaks entertainment news, so something didn’t seem right.</p><p>(Another recent <em>Nexus Point News</em> “exclusive” includes a potential cast member “being eyed” <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-dacre-montgomery-is-being-eyed-to-join-star-wars-starfighter">for one of the male leads</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/651695/star-wars-starfighter-date-ryan-gosling"><em>Star Wars: Starfighter</em></a>, but the article includes an update that says “a LucasFilm spokesperson has denied this reporting.”)</p><p>So I messaged Wario64, asking why he reposted it. He said that the person who posted a thread on the gaming forum ResetEra claimed the site was reliable and that “I guess I’m sharing cause I too think it’s absurd lol.”</p><p>That thread appears to be <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/">this one</a>, where the poster says, in a reply to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/#post-139592964">somebody asking</a> “bro what the fuck is this source lmaooo,” <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/#post-139593192">that</a> “Nexus point news is pretty reliable, they are breaking more and more news before the traditional trades.”</p><p>Soon after, I refreshed the <em>Nexus Point News</em> story and saw that it had been taken down. I told Wario64 that we were looking into the story on our end and about its removal. Soon after, Wario64 posted <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1919831651968024694">about the removal</a> and deleted the original tweet.</p><p>Then, I emailed <em>Nexus Point News’</em> press line to see if somebody could say what was going on. Demet Koc, the publication’s editor-in-chief, replied two minutes later but declined to comment.</p><p>A24’s Sophia Shin also declined to comment on the record.</p><p>The possibility of an <em>Elden Ring </em>adaptation seems likely. FromSoftware said in early 2022 that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22981060/fromsoftware-elden-ring-franchise-intellectual-properties-future-expansion">hoped to</a> expand the franchise “beyond the realm of games.” George R.R. Martin, who provided <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643950/elden-ring-preview-fromsoftware-george-rr-martin">the “mythos”</a> for the world of <em>Elden Ring</em>, hinted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/1/24189979/george-r-r-martin-on-a-potential-elden-ring-adaptation">last year</a> that some kind of adaptation might be in the works. And FromSoftware is about to release <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, a multiplayer-focused spinoff, so announcing a film around now would make some sense. But for the moment, there’s nothing official about an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie.</p><p>A ResetEra admin locked the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/page-2#post-139593882">thread</a> about the article and another one. “For a site no one’s heard of, they sure have a lot of exclusives,” <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-point-news-alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182531/#post-139593768">the admin said</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Last month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> would be coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, which is wonderful for that plumber guy, but mostly meant piss all for us PC people. The thing is, this version of the game actually comes with some new stuff, and I like new stuff, and publisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco</a> only vaguely said all the new bits would be coming to "other platforms". But! I bring good news, as yes, the Switch 2 Tarnished Edition extras are coming to PC as part of a Tarnished Pack DLC.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This comes from the first FromSoftware Games Event Spring 2025, held earlier today, which <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/41423">Famitsu</a> covered and <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/17375-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-will-add-2-new-classes-among-others">RPG Site</a> kindly extrapolated details from. Now, to be clear, there aren't many details, but something is better than nothing. For one, there'll be a total of four new armour sets to acquire. On top of that there's two new starting classes, Knight of Ides, and Heavy Armored Knight, both of which are, you guessed it, knights! Not particularly exciting given that there's already some knight options, but what can you do? These two knights make up two of the four new armour sets.
</p>
<p>
You'll also have a total of three new looks for your trusty steed Torrent, which I suppose is more than the none you could choose from before. Apparently some more weapons and skills are being added into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> too. At the very least, FromSoftware did say that the DLC pack will be cheap for those not on Switch 2, though I am a bit surprised this isn't just coming in the form of a free update.
</p>
<p>
Now all we need to do is cross our fingers that that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">Not Bloodborne 2 But It's Basically Bloodborne 2 Except It's An Online Game game The Duskbloods</a> comes to PC eventually too.

Also, said cars, due to a cheeky little settings modification, moved at a million miles per hour. The central challenge made itself clear within several seconds of the beginning of any stream or video: avoid the titular autos at all costs.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="I finished GTA 4 with all the cars at 9999x speed." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tn04UwfKk9o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>"I get the idea in my head that I will defeat stupid challenges that don't matter pretty often,” Walker <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-iv-fast-traffic-stream-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Aftermath last year</a>. “To me one of the most human things you can do is commit yourself to a challenge that doesn't matter, that only you care about and that you could stop doing at any time. If life is suffering, why not choose more suffering – and more life?"</p><p>Walker kept at it for the better part of a year, actually completing his run in late 2024, but only just now uploading the final fruits of his labor to YouTube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65s6_9-Gh30&amp;list=PLI_N-KSDRamydGIKwJDLcLcC_VRH0g0-I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The complete saga is a ride</a>, and I can’t recommend it enough. You’d think that after witnessing a two-ton death trap emerge seemingly from nowhere to splatter a hapless career criminal over a thousand times, it’d stop being funny. And yet!</p><p>Toward the end of his run, Walker battled not just every single car in Liberty City, but also conflicting emotions. Getting one ending didn’t feel as revelatory as he’d hoped, so he went back and got the game’s other, darker ending in which Niko’s cousin, Roman, dies. What ensued was peak cinema, with Walker hunting down the game’s final foe as his health meter flashed red, fully aware that a single stray bullet would force him to restart an arduous multi-part mission he’d already attempted several times. He took a deep breath and urged himself to calm down. Then he rounded a corner, squeezed the trigger, and that was that.</p><p>"I hate that the last message I saw in the chat before I got this was 'You've got this, kitten,'" he said immediately afterward.</p><p>The video ends with what is all at once a promise from Walker to the audience and a threat from Walker to Walker: “FAST GTA WILL RETURN.” &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-soundtrack-interview"><h3>How Clair Obscur’s Composer Created An Incredible Soundtrack</h3></a><p>Lorien Testard dropped eight hours of straight heat for those who come after</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>EA announced in its latest <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">financial report</a> for Q4 of its 2025 fiscal year that the next Battlefield game will be fully revealed sometime this summer and will launch before the end of its 2026 fiscal year, ending April 2026. It also confirmed that the highly anticipated return of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-skate-game-wont-be-playable-offline-to-support-its-multiplayer-skateboarding-sandbox/">Skate</a> will arrive sometime in this fiscal year ending April 2026.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer Andrew Wilson highlighted the release and reveal of Battlefield, calling it "<em>a pivotal step</em>" as the company moves forward in this fiscal year.</p>
<p>"<em>As we look to the future, we're confident in our ability to execute across a deep pipeline</em>," Wilson said. "<em>Beginning this summer with the highly anticipated reveal of Battlefield, a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment</em>."</p>
<p>Later in the report, EA states that it expects its revenue for its 2026 fiscal year to be driven by "<em>the EA Sports portfolio, The Sims, and the launches of Battlefield and Skate.</em>" Previously, EA announced that the new Skate game will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-in-early-access-next-year/">released in early access sometime this year</a>. We've yet to see an official release date.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-will-add-more-players-to-battlefield-labs-playtesting-this-month-across-europe-north-america-and-asia/">EA provided a development update</a> for the new Battlefield game and its Battlefield Labs playtesting, where it confirmed that players in Asia will begin to be invited, and that the playtest will grow in scale over May to invite more players to participate and introduce new content.</p>

In addition to the upcoming showcase, he confirmed the game will be out within the current fiscal year, a window that’s become much more open since <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> was pushed back to May of 2026. </p><p>Wilson previously suggested that Rockstar Games’ juggernaut was a factor in its launch window calculus. “We believe the game will be great and ready at that time, but if we got close to that timeframe and believed that this wasn’t going to be a great window for us, then we would take a look at what an alternate window might be that would give us the appropriate time, energy, and player acquisition opportunity for this <em>Battlefield</em> to be all that it needed to be,” he said earlier this year. </p><p>Is it possible we now see the game arrive earlier than expected and go head-to-head with the next <em>Call of Duty </em>this fall? And will we see the next <em>Battlefield</em> stick to the current $70 price point or hop on the Microsoft bandwagon and target $80 along with certain other releases this holiday season? Those will be some of the questions facing EA as it tries to restore <em>Battlefield</em> to its former glory after a series of missteps in recent entries. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-leaks-gameplay-bf4-bf3-fps-ea-labs-drag-1851769188&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-leaks-gameplay-bf4-bf3-fps-ea-labs-drag-1851769188">So far the buzz is positive</a></span>. Player tests and ongoing leaks around the next <em>Battlefield</em> have been getting some long-time fans excited that the franchise might be finding its footing again while also returning to its roots. It would be nice to have <em>Battlefield </em>back in the multiplayer mix, even if the live service market is getting more competitive than ever. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/all-time-wrestling-all-or-nothing-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pile drivers, clotheslines, and – time travel? In the board game All Time Wrestling: All or Nothing, an immensely wealthy wrestling fan from the future uses the power of time travel to bring together some of the most iconic wrestlers from the past, present, and future to compete against one another. The game, designed by Mohamed Al Qadi and Jad Yammine and published by Cation Arts, offers players a fun time, whether or not you're familiar with pro wrestling and its pantheon of characters.</p><div catalogid="d55f387f-9d55-466a-a73e-98f67d3532b9" id="218897"><div id="218897" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>All Time Wrestling: All or Nothing Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone who grew up in the ‘90s like I did knows the WWF (as it was called back then, before the World Wildlife Fund won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE#Lawsuit_and_renaming_(2002)" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trademark dispute</a>) was all the rage among kids. So, while I opted to get my spandex fix with Power Rangers, I still had enough folks in my circle to know who the Macho Man and the British Bulldog were. While ATW’s subject matter may not be a big selling point for me, its balancing act of managing your resources and knowing when to push your luck kept me coming back round after round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In ATW, much like in actual wrestling, players attempt to exhaust and weaken each other, with the end goal being to pin their opponent and take home the win. Each selectable wrestler – including legends like Macho Man Randy Savage and the British Bulldog, alongside ATW original characters – features unique abilities and varying levels of health and stamina, which adds some lovely variety to the game and helps keep matches exciting from one to the next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat plays out with the player holding “initiative” playing cards from their hand and rolling dice to deal damage. Successful hits push the Momentum Track in that player’s favor, replicating the crowd hyping up the wrestler. The higher the momentum, the easier it becomes to land hits and gain other bonuses, which incentivizes continued aggression. Initiative only switches when an attack misses, the defender blocks, the defender uses their once-per-game “Reversal” ability (which instantly stops the combat), or the attacker voluntarily passes to regain some stamina and cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the different attack bonuses and the ability to combo cards together, there is a pleasant amount of depth and strategy in ATW without being overly complex. What I found most interesting, though, is how <em>initiative</em> is handled – it's done in a way I haven’t encountered in other games before. I really enjoyed this “press your luck” approach, and it made managing my hand of cards, stamina, and momentum more exciting. It often left me with a tough choice: do I push hard and risk leaving myself in rough shape for a chance to cinch a pin, or do I pass and forfeit the attack to try and weather the next assault, hoping I’ll be in a better position to strike back?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of cards, this is perhaps where my biggest issue with ATW lies. Instead of relying on text, the game heavily uses symbols and icons to denote things like damage, stamina requirements, special attributes, and other modifiers. As a general rule of thumb, if a game <em>can</em> employ icons, it should – so long as they are both readable and not overwhelming. Luckily, I never found there to be too many icons to decode in ATW, but the readability leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action cards, which you use the most, feature colorful artwork of various wrestlers performing everything from jabs and punches to German suplexes and signature moves. However, this can make picking up on all the symbols more of a hassle than it should be – especially if you're on the receiving end and viewing them upside down or from a distance. More than a few times I encountered situations where finishers or dice modifiers were missed, or cards were mistaken for others, due to duplicate artwork being used for attacks with different stats. Perhaps it’s because of my long history with games like Magic: The Gathering, but I wish the information was presented atop a slightly opaque background, rather than directly over the art. It’s not a finisher on the game, but it’s certainly a bit of a jab to the chin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The core game box offers players plenty of value and flexibility, providing not only standard 1v1 matches but also a tag-team-based 2v2 mode, a cage match variant with new rules, and a solo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign</a> mode that lets you improve your wrestler as you progress. The automated systems in solo mode are fine, but admittedly, as someone who has never quite gotten into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board games</a>, I spent far more time playing against others than diving into ATW’s campaign.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I personally prefer the more intense, head-to-head two-player experience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for tag mode, the inclusion of specialty partner abilities and the ability to tag in my friend to continue combos added an extra layer of choice and strategy. Still, it didn’t quite hit as hard as the core 1v1 mode. Even with the new tag mechanic, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this mode simply adds more players at the expense of having more downtime, since only one attacker and one defender are active at any given time, with partners outside the ring. It’s still fun and led to some awesome team-up moments with friends, but I personally prefer the more intense, head-to-head two-player experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those wanting to dive even deeper into the All Time Wrestling universe, the creators continue to release new expansions – fully compatible with existing content – that add legends like Sgt. Slaughter and the Junkyard Dog, alongside new game modes like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four-player</a> free-for-alls and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three-player</a>-specific Triple Threat matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All Time Wrestling is one of those games worth checking out even if the wrestling theme doesn’t grab you. With games clocking in at under 30 minutes for two players and around 45 minutes for tag teams, it's a great filler during game nights or something compact enough to take to a bar. I’d love to see this system adapted for other themes – like a shonen anime (think Dragon Ball Z) or something Power Rangers-inspired. There’s a surprising amount of depth here, while still being approachable for players of varying board game experience – even those coming to it purely for a love of wrestling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With All Time Wrestling, Cation Arts delivers a dramatic and faithful representation of the wild history of wrestling in a package that will delight fans of head-to-head games, regardless of whether you know what a DDT stands for or not.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX2mge?object_uuid=1d3f2b21-42ca-46ea-a29d-eca2d1e54d62&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1e3g?object_uuid=1d3f2b21-42ca-46ea-a29d-eca2d1e54d62&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Cation Arts</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJpeE?object_uuid=1d3f2b21-42ca-46ea-a29d-eca2d1e54d62&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at The Wrestling Collection</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 6, 2025 7:15 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">All Time Wrestling is one of those games worth checking out even if the wrestling theme doesn’t grab you.

            <p>
Starbreeze Studios has acquired the publishing rights to its beleaguered heist sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>, insisting the move will enable it to "accelerate content development and pursue broader business opportunities" for the franchise "as a whole".
</p>
<p>
Payday 3 got off to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-likens-launch-to-being-a-rock-band-when-the-whole-stage-collapses-and-everyone-leaves">disastrous start</a> when it launched in September 2023, struggling with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-players-endure-second-consecutive-day-of-server-issues-preventing-them-from-playing">serious matchmaking issues</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-requires-an-always-on-online-connection">unpopular online-only requirements</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-much-delayed-first-patch-is-finally-here">repeatedly delayed first major patch</a>. Its player count quickly plummeted and has been consistently dwarfed by its predecessor since then, with Starbreeze last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-seeks-long-term-success-after-disappointing-launch">admitting</a> numbers were "at significantly lower levels than [it] would like". Just a month later, CEO Tobias Sjögren was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starbreeze-ceo-tobias-sjogren-ousted-by-board-following-payday-3-flop">ousted by the board</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-gets-new-creative-leads-as-player-numbers-still-dwarfed-by-decade-old-predecessor">new Payday 3 creative leadership team was brought in last December</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's in that context Starbreeze has now "reached a mutual agreement" with former Payday 3 publisher Plaion that'll enable the studio to fully acquire the publishing rights to the game. To finance the transaction, Starbreeze has <a href="https://www.starbreeze.com/news/starbreeze-enters-into-agreement-regarding-the-publishing-rights-for-payday-3-and-carries-out-a-directed-share-issue-of-class-b-shares-amounting-to-sek-33-million/">announced it's issuing new shares worth SEK 33m</a>, with SEK 29m of the proceeds (approximately £2.3m) going toward repaying Plaion under the previous Payday 3 agreement, and "settling certain outstanding claims".
</p>
<p>
In a statement accompanying the news, board member Thomas Lindgren said Starbreeze's Payday 3 acquisition would enable it to "significantly accelerate [its] content development roadmap, and pursue broader strategic opportunities for the Payday franchise as a whole."
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Starbreeze - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">currently also working on a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a> - has suggested more Payday could be on the way, despite the latest instalment's struggles. "While this agreement marks the conclusion of the current publishing arrangement," the studio wrote in its announcement, "it also lays the groundwork for a long-term partnership between Starbreeze and Plaion on future Payday franchise projects."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-review">awarded Payday 3 three out of five stars in 2023</a>, calling it a "shallow shooter that doesn't offer anywhere near enough bang for your ill-gotten buck."

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Minecraft’s</em> official support for virtual reality and mixed reality devices is over. Mojang announced last year that Minecraft would stop supporting VR headsets after March 2025, and per today’s <em>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</em> 1.21.80 Update <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-bedrock-edition-1-21-80">patch notes</a>, that support has been removed, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2773555/minecraft-officially-kills-support-for-vr.html">as reported by <em>PCWorld</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>When Mojang announced the end of support for VR <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278397/minecraft-virtual-reality-support-end-2025">in October</a>, it said that you’ll still get updates on your PC, you’ll still be able to play without a VR / MR device, and that you’ll be able to continue building worlds or use any Marketplace purchases. At the time, Mojang’s reasoning for removing support <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-40-bedrock-changelog">was that</a> “our ability to support VR / MR devices has come to an end.”</p><p>However, there are still ways to play <em>Minecraft</em> on a VR headset, if you’d like. If you have the Java version of the game for PC, you can use a mod like <a href="https://www.vivecraft.org/">Vivecraft</a>, which works on many VR platforms, or <a href="https://questcraft.org/">QuestCraft</a>, a port specific to Meta Quest headsets.</p><p>Still, I’m a little sad to see official VR support ending for <em>Minecraft</em>, especially if you, like me, can remember the incredibly impressive <em>Minecraft</em> demo for HoloLens from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7868363/minecraft-hololens-microsoft-freecell">way back in the day</a>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Alright, look, I get it. There's a lot of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sims</a> already. There's even the odd anime inspired farming sim here and there. But <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-seikyu">Tales of Seikyu</a>, which fits into that second camp, is different, I promise, because it has dating - and I think you can date an anthropomorphic otter man. I'm not talking queer slang here to be clear, though the character does kind of fit that meaning too. I'm talking about a man that looks like an otter, who walks around on two legs.
</p>

<p>
Now, I'm not entirely sure if he is romanceable or not, because a press release notes there's only six romanceable characters. He does appear on the splash screen for dateable characters during the game's early access release date trailer (we'll get to that in a minute), though more than six characters can be seen there. I'll just have to cross my fingers and hope that you can when the game launches into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2340520/Tales_of_Seikyu/">early access on Steam</a> this May 21st (see, I told you we'd get there).

The game has got a bit more going for it than the usual farming sim stuff too. Yes, you can grow your own veggies and such, the difference is that you use the powers of a yokai to do it. Sometimes you might turn into a water sucking slime, other times a speedy flying crow person. It's pretty cute!
</p>
<p>
There's some action elements too, you can go off on little adventures and discover Seikyu's "secrets." I'm not going to say that the game looks mind blowing, there really are just so many farming games these days, but there's enough going for me vibes wise to say I'm prospectively into it. Dating the otter man will cinch the deal though, ACE Entertainment, so consider that if you want my money.

                <p dir="ltr">Mike Dailly, one of the designers for the original GTA and a co-founding member of Rockstar North, said Rockstar made the right decision to delay <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> after seeing the upcoming game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">most recent trailer</a>. Dailly made the comments on Bluesky, where he also praised the development team for not giving into greed and releasing a game that the studio knew could be improved.</p><p dir="ltr">Dailly said Rockstar undoubtedly knew GTA 6 would've sold exceptionally well even if it launched in a less-than-ideal state and called the studio's choice to delay it for extra polish "impressive."</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Now that's more like it," Dailly said in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mdf200.bsky.social/post/3loj4u37kk22r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his post</a>. "That environment is lovely, and things are moving much better… Even if they'd released it broken, it'd still have sold hugely. So it's even more impressive they took the decision to delay it. Kudos."</p><p dir="ltr">"Many of us are old enough to remember the debacle that Frontier: Elite II had on the PC, where greed got in the way," Dailly continued.</p><p dir="ltr">Frontier: Elite II launched in 1993, and while the space combat simulator received universal critical praise, it suffered from multiple, often game-breaking bugs on PC. Even those who remember it fondly recall how some of its essential features didn't work correctly, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/u9kerg/frontier_elite_ii_anyone_else_still_get_utterly/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">autopilot or rendering a planet</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Rockstar didn't publicly give a reason for GTA 6's delay after the announcement. However, as Dailly noted, the most recent version of Vice City looks crisper, and its inhabitants, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/" data-ref-id="2900-6537">GTA 6's major characters</a> to seemingly unimportant NPCs, move more naturally--in the in-game cutscenes, at least--compared to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-breakdown-easter-eggs-references-and-teases/2900-4973/" data-ref-id="2900-4973">first time Rockstar showed the game off</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">GTA 6's new release date</a> is May 26, 2026, for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.

Marathon might be the Bungie game getting all the attention <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">following last month's big reveal</a>, but the studio's keen to remind everyone <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> is still a thing - and a thing it's planning to support for a good long while. To that end, it's now revealed Destiny 2's next major multi-year story arc, which'll include a paid Star Wars expansion before the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
Bungie first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-announces-major-changes-for-destiny-2-two-medium-expansions-coming-a-year">teased a major shake-up of Destiny 2's release model last September</a>, saying it would be ditching its traditional large-scale annual expansions and instead releasing two "medium-sized" paid expansions a year. And now, thanks to its latest developer stream, we've got a much clearer idea of what that'll look like when the plan takes effect this July.
</p>
<p>
With Destiny 2's decade-spanning Light and Dark Saga now officially concluded, Bungie has unveiled its next major story arc, the Fate Saga. It begins on 15th July with the Year of Prophecy and the launch of a new paid expansion, The Edge of Fate. "[This] is the start of a long journey," the studio <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/year_of_prophecy_reveal_recap">writes in its announcement post</a>, "and we are taking our time to tell a new story that for now will leave you with many unanswered questions. Each expansion will help answer some, so having two a year will allow us to deliver those beats at a faster pace than before."

<p>
Starting with The Edge of Fate, it takes players to a new destination known as Kepler, said to be inspired by "the puzzle-solving and pathfinding challenges of Destiny 2's dungeons and destination design which encourages deep exploration, mystery, and player-driven discovery." There's talk of a new raid, plus new enemies, weapons, gear, and "destination-specific" abilities. The latter includes the Matterspark ability, enabling Guardians to change forms to navigate the terrain - with one of those forms looking a lot like Metroid's Morph Ball.
</p>
<p>
The Edge of Fate also marks the start of new season, Reclamation, and is accompanied by a free "core game update" for all players. This introduces the likes of new events and challenges, alongside a range of new features. There's a new activity selection screen known as The Portal, for instance, which is intended to provide easier access to Fireteam Ops, Pinnacle Ops, Crucible Ops, and Solo Ops activities. It arrives alongside Destiny 2's Armour 3.0 rework and a new tier system, with a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-7On9pcEoY">permanent shooting range</a> - enabling raid groups to test out their tactics on different enemies and bosses - coming later down the line.

<p>
More free content arrives on 9th September under the banner Ash &amp; Iron (Bungie hasn't said much about this yet beyond the fact it's a "major update" with an associated Rewards Pass) and that's followed by the weirdest part of today's announcement, Renegades, on 2nd December. It's unclear how this Star Wars themed second paid expansion is supposed to fit into Bungie's new story arc, but the studio says it'll be "integral" to the Fate Saga as it merges "Destiny's distinctive storytelling and gameplay with themes and elements drawn from the iconic sci-fi franchise". It includes a new dungeon, plus "new Destiny characters, innovative activities, and evolved mechanics designed to surprise and delight players."
</p>
<p>
Finally, Destiny 2's Year of Prophecy gets its fourth and final release - another free "major update" titled Shadow &amp; Order - on 3rd March next year. And if either of this year's paid expansions appeal, Bungie has opened pre-orders - for each individual expansion as well as a number of Year of Prophecy bundles - on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC. More details can be found in its <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/year_of_prophecy_reveal_recap">announcement post</a>.

Oh, and we can't forget about the tease of Darkwing Duck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot of exciting info was unveiled for Disney Lorcana, and we're here to break it down to ensure you don't miss a thing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fabled Will Add Iconic and Epic Cards, A Goofy Movie, and Rotating Cards for Competitive Play</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/dlc-fabled-a-goofy-movie-image-1746510989873.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While we still have more to learn about Fabled, the teases given by the Disney Lorcana team are making the wait until pre-release on August 29 and wide release on September 5 just that much harder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Goofy Movie cards will be one of the biggest additions to Disney Lorcana with Fabled, but the team wasn't ready to share exactly which cards will become available. They did share, however, that Mickey and Minnie will be the very first Iconic Cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iconic Cards will be the rarest cards in all of Lorcana, as only two will appear in each set going forward, and beautiful cards of Mickey and Minnie on a carousel will serve as the Iconic Cards all players will be chasing for their sets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Iconic Cards will be Epic Cards, which are rarer than Legendary but not as hard to get as Enchanted and Iconic. These cards will also feature special artwork and foil treatments and will give players even more chances to score a special card like a new Elsa (Snow Queen) one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big change in Fabled is that it will mark the first time Lorcana will be rotating out certain cards and making them illegal for competitive play. Top-level competitive play is called Core Constructed and will not allow players to use any cards from the first four sets of Lorcana. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana Fabled Cards and Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of older cards shouldn't worry too much though, as there will be plenty of ways to play your older cards, including in a new format called Infinity Constructed. Furthermore, Fabled will introduce reprinted cards from earlier sets - like Winnie the Pooh (Hunny Wizard) - and those will be fully usable in competitive play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To keep the competitive game thriving, rotating out older cards to encourage new strategies and fresh deck designs is a really important part of the next chapter,” said Ryan Miller, Brand Manager and Co Designer of <em>Disney Lorcana</em> <em>TCG</em> at Ravensburger. “But because we know there are cards in those early sets that are important to a lot of fans’ deck-building strategies, and we know not everybody got the cards they wanted the first year, we’re re-printing some cards from those first sets in <em>Fabled</em>. Including Enchanted versions of some fan favorites!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are new to Lorcana and all of these new sets sound enticing and wonderful, the team has announced a new way to jump into this trading card game with the Collection Starter Set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This set includes four Fabled booster packs, a Tinker Bell (Giant Fairy) "Glimmer Foil" Promo Card, one card portfolio with Mickey Mouse (Brave Little Tailor) on the front, and one collector's guide.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/collection-starter-set-1746511057724.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Reign of Jafar Offers Aladdin and Bambi Cards Alongside a New Co-Op Adventure</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As we previously mentioned, Reign of Jafar is Lorcana's eighth set and it will be available in pre-release on May 30 and wide release on June 6. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reign of Jafar will continue the ongoing story in Lorcana that stars the Disney villain, and the Lorcana team has given a summary of what fans can expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Jafar now possesses the Hexwell Crown and, with it, he has corrupted Archazia’s Island to his wicked will," the official description reads. "Traps and illusions abound in <em>Reign of Jafar</em>, and glimmers like Jasmine – Steady Strategist and Rapunzel – High Climber will need to band together to steal back the crown and defeat the evil vizier."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana Reign of Jafar Cards and Sets</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Reign of Jafar, fans will be able to jump into Illumineers' Quest: Palace Heist, which is a new "co-op experience-in-a-box" that will allow four players to team up and take on Jafar and his minion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the cards, fans will be able to try to get Bambi (Prince of the Forest), Flower (Shy Skunk), Thumper (Young Bunny), Jafar (High Sultan of Lorcana), Magic Carpet (Phantom Rug), Aladdin (Vigilant Guard), and much more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Teases of the Future Include Whispers in the Well and Darkwing Duck</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/dlc-whispers-in-the-well-set-art-1746511073170.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the presentation, Disney revealed that the set after Fabled will be called Whispers in the Well and it will arrive in Q4 2025. The team didn't share much, but a key art revealed Mickey, Ariel, and the likely addition of Disney Gargoyles into Lorcana. Oh, and that there is a new type of Glimmer abound. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Farther out, the team finally answered many fans' calls for Darkwing Duck to be added to Lorcana as it was confirmed he will be joining the game in 2026.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Get Ready For the Disney Lorcana World Championship</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The competitve scene in Lorcana is heating up as the Disney Lorcana World Championship will take place on June 28 and 29 in Walt Disney World. This major tournament will see players from around the world competing for the envious title of the first annual Disney Lorcana TCG World Champion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans not in attendance will be able to follow along live on Twitch.TV/DisneyLorcana with a team of casters that includes Rebekah (<em>RebekahQuests</em>), Baker (<em>LorcanaVillain</em>), Liam (<em>The Illumiteers</em>), Brandon (<em>Bsquared24</em>), and JD (<em>JDZ Quest</em>). Additionally, there will be a chance to obtain a non-foil 'A Whole New World' promo card during this time, but more details will be given in the future.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/dlc-promo-a-whole-new-world-1746511087140.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tcgs">what other TCGs alongside Disney Lorcana are worth getting into</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-first-impressions-of-the-new-tcg-expansion">our impressions of Lorcana's Archazia's Island expansion.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Have a tip for us?

                <p>The new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> trailer illuminated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">many new details about the highly anticipated open-world game</a>, including the fact that main character Jason is absolutely shredded. The trailer opens with a shirtless Jason climbing down off the roof after doing some repairs. A close-up of Jason reveals he's got cannons for arms, a built back, and some impressive chest gains.</p><p>But how much can Jason bench? A sequence later in the trailer shows Jason on the beach, throwing up some impressive weight. In the trailer, we see Jason benching what appears to be 275lbs. Using weight plates from the amazingly fictional brand "GAINZ," we can see the outer-most plate is 25lbs. The inner ones look like 45-pound plates, so all of that weight combined with the bar (we are assuming it's the standard 45 pounds) and that comes to a mighty 275 pounds.</p><p>No matter what anyone says, a 275-pound bench is <em>impressive</em>. In gym and lifting culture, a bench press of 225 is the standard for what aspiring lifters hope to achieve. Given Jason's general buff-ness, I'm not surprised to see him putting up more, and having a well-rounded physique in general.</p><p>Also worth noting here is Jason's bench press form--it is very good. He takes the bar all the way down to his chest in a slow, controlled manner, making sure to not flare his arms out but keep the tight to his body. He also seems to not drop the weight in a straight line down to his chest. We could learn a thing or two from Jason's form.</p><p>Now, we can't say for sure what Jason's <em>best</em> bench is. It's possible Jason is not maxing out here but instead pumping for volume and muscle stamina. We do hear him grunt a little, but that doesn't mean he's struggling. He gets the weight up pretty easily, after all--earning the attention of a couple women nearby, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4489449-screenshot2025-05-06at10.38.24am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489449" data-ratio="0.52233009708738" data-width="1030" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4489449-screenshot2025-05-06at10.38.24am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489449"></a><figcaption>Jason is getting after it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4489449-screenshot2025-05-06at10.38.24am.png"></figure><p>What I don't like to see here is Jason lifting all this weight without a spotter, or without a rack that has spotter arms. It's dangerous and unsafe to do this. But given Jason's line of work or robbing and shooting people as a drug-runner, it might be one of the safer activities he engages in.</p><p>Jason might be a gym bro, but we also see him in another sequence crashed out on the couch in the middle of the day with beers on his coffee table, so he clearly enjoys partying as well. Another scene shows Jason and Lucia at a club having a grand time. Remember, it's all about balance (minus the crime).</p><p>It's likely pumping out sets at the beach could be an activity in GTA 6, as Rockstar is known to allow players to do much of what they see in trailers for their games. Also, GTA 5 allowed players to hurl some weight around at an <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Muscle_Sands_Gym" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">outdoor gym by the water</a> as well, so it would be in keeping with tradition.</p><p>GTA 6 launches on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.

        <p>Feels like they're forcing this one</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> is obviously quite busy presumably stressing over lukewarm responses to its next game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, they're still working on a bunch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> stuff. The studio revealed a plethora of expansions today, all of which are building up a new "multi-year saga" called the Fate Saga. We'll get to it in a moment, but one of these expansions might raise an eyebrow, as it is quite literally a Star Wars crossover, but is also described by narrative designer Alison Luhrs as one that will push the Fate Saga "forward in important ways and introduce characters that we're going to spend time with for years to come."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Anyway, let's talk about the first expansion, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIAAxlbFujk&amp;ab_channel=Destiny2">The Edge of Fate</a>. This one's out quite soon, July 15th, where you'll be heading to a planetoid called Kepler to "redefine our future." You'll be facing off against Fallen Corsairs and Vex Kobolds on Kepler, and you can get new abilities by binding your guardian to dark matter. On top of that, there's a bunch of new modifiers, armour is getting an update to include set bonuses and reworked stats, and gear can progress up to five tiers.

<p>
Then, there's the second expansion, Renegades. Here you'll find the Star Wars stuff, which includes you rocking a lightsaber, alongside some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJUdSgTuSMs/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, and General Grievous cosmetics</a>. Honestly, this one stinks a bit. I'm a bit sick of Star Wars by now, and I already think that Destiny having any crossovers at all ruins the vibe, but for it to be a whole, important expansion that'll inevitably get vaulted? Come off it. If you're not as put off as I am, this one is due out December 2.

<p>
After that there's a couple more expansions to come too, one called Shattered Cycle out summer 2026, and the other being The Alchemist in winter 2026. You might notice that that's two expansions a year, which certainly is a lot, but there's big questions as to whether that'll be enough to bring people back. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> has struggled quite a bit in recent years, not to mention the fact that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">down by a lot of staff</a> compared to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-devs-bungie-are-the-latest-big-video-game-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">couple of years ago</a>, so this certainly feels like a push to get back on track. Fingers crossed for the team more than anything else.

Though it may lack the polish of many of the games it borrows ideas from, it provides compelling enough gameplay that genre fans may find it worth their time to see how things play out for main character Zoe and her little drone, Koby. But how much time will you need to invest exactly? Let’s take a look at how long it takes to beat <em>Steel Seed</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197554" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="113" data-playlist="197554,197551,197550" data-current="197554"><div><p>GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23078.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h45655"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>Steel Seed</em>?</h2><p><em>Steel Seed</em> is a pretty linear game with <strong>a clear and focused campaign that should take the average player somewhere between 10-12 hours to complete</strong>. That game length doesn’t take into account finding its many collectibles, buying every upgrade, and other optional tasks.</p><p>And yeah, there is a decent amount of extra stuff to do in <em>Steel Seed</em> if you want to go for full completion. For those who enjoy collecting everything in this type of game, though, that won’t be a bad thing, especially since it’s all relatively straightforward.</p><p>You’ll need to buy every upgrade in the game from each of the three skill trees. You’ll also need to find all 114 glitch crystals, as well as various health modules, drones, notes, and more as you explore levels. In other words, you’ll have plenty to look for when you’re not engaged in the game’s stealth and action gameplay. You should expect a completionist run to add another two or three hours.</p><p>If you’re going for every trophy or achievement in <em>Steel Seed</em>, you’ll definitely have to do all of the above—and then some. You’ll need to eliminate a certain number of specific enemy types, ensure you kill 50 enemies using your drone, and even play a couple of melodies on a piano at some point in the game. </p><p>Whether you want to do everything in the game or simply see the campaign through, you can pick up <em>Steel Seed</em> now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For other games, a publisher might begin preorders after confirming a release date and posting a flashy trailer to capitalize on the hype. But no, that's not the case for GTA 6.</p><p>Although we now know GTA 6 is set for release on May 26, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, retailers are not yet taking preorders. You should avoid any retailer currently trying to take your money to reserve the game, as it's likely a scam.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Rest assured, when Rockstar announces preorder details for GTA 6, we'll report back with all the details. In addition to a standard version, it's expected Rockstar will offer premium-edition versions of the game, just like it did with GTA 5.</p><p>For comparison, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o349k552573918/grand-theft-auto-v-now-officially-available-for-preorder.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preorders for GTA 5 opened in November 2012</a>, which was after the first trailer arrived in November 2011. GTA 6, meanwhile, has already had two trailers, the first of which was released in December 2023; the second debuted on May 6, 2025.</p><p>In addition as to when GTA 6 preorders will open, another major unanswered question is how much GTA 6 might cost. With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">some AAA games jumping from $70 to $80</a>, many are wondering if GTA 6 will follow suit or even potentially go higher, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">like $100</a>, as some believe might happen. GTA 5 launched in 2013 priced at $60; that's about $80 in 2025 with inflation factored in.</p><p>Take-Two, many might recall, was the first major publisher to raise prices for AAA games from $60 to $70 with NBA 2K21.

"Is there light at the end of the tunnel?," he asked. "Is there a reason to think, is there a factor that would occur that would cause those losses to come down and when would that be? But maybe more importantly, what is going to cause those losses to come down?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In response, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg claimed Reality Labs is focused on becoming more efficient but also needs the capacity to "distribute and grow very quickly" as new technologies—such as its AI-powered smart glasses—gain traction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you look at some of the leading consumer electronics products of other categories, by the time they get to their third generation, they’re often selling 10 million units and scaling from there. And I'm not sure if we’re going to do exactly that, but I think that that’s like the ballpark of the opportunity that we have," he added.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ncsoft-invests-in-austin-based-studio-emptyvessel" target="_self" data-discover="true">NCSoft invests in TX-based studio founded by id, Naughty Dog alums</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"And that's something that I think we're kind of focused on scaling to that and then scaling beyond that for the generations after that. So I think some of the effort that we're doing is going to—we're going to get more efficient in some parts of the work that we do. But then as a bunch of the products start to hit and start to grow even bigger than the number that I just said is just sort of like the near-term milestone, then I think we’ll continue scaling in terms of distribution."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Layoffs, losses, and dwindling hardware sales dominate Reality Labs discourse">Layoffs, losses, and dwindling hardware sales dominate Reality Labs discourse</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking at the performance of Reality Labs' product slate, Q1 revenue fell by 6 percent year-on-year to $412 million due to lower sales of Meta Quest hardware.
