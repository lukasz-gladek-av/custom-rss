            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-exs-randomizer-mod-now-lets-you-pet-the-dogs-and-cats<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>It's said that every time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> is mentioned, someone reinstalls it. If that's true and you read RPS, it's possible you've reinstalled Deus Ex around six hundred times by now. 
</p>
<p>That's where the comprehensive Randomizer mod comes in, which remixes the immersive sim's levels to make the experience fresh every time. It's also just received a major update which, among several other additions, lets you pet the game's dogs and cats. 
</p>

<p>I'm long over the 'can you pet the dog'-ification of video games, but this is a good excuse to mention the Randomizer mod. Here's the trailer for this new version:

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3mTcG6xeq4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>It lets you randomise almost every interactive element in a Deus Ex level, from enemies to passwords, repair bots to starting locations, weapon stats to augmentations. All of these randomisations are tweakable by the player, and can take into account other settings like the selected difficulty.
</p>
<p>You might wonder what petting animals has to do with randomisation. The Randomizer mod also contains several quality-of-life improvements to the base game, including auto-fill for passwords you've discovered, an aug selection wheel, and a speedrun mode. Several of these improvements, by reducing the need for a keyboard, make the game much nicer to play on Steam Deck.
</p>
<p>You can head over to the <a href="https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/releases/tag/v3.0.0">Deus Ex Randomizer page on Github</a> for a full set of patch notes. That's also where you'll find download links to the mod, including an installer that makes it straightforward to setup even if you're new to using Deus Ex mods.</p>

            <p>
After a long (and in my case, slightly impatient) wait, Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse - the third and regrettably final season of Telltale Games' episodic point-and-click adventure series - will be getting the remaster treatment on 14th August this year.
</p>
<p>
Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse originally released back in 2010, wrapping up Telltales' Sam &amp; Max adventures in style, following the release of 2006's Sam &amp; Max: Save the World and 2007's Sam &amp; Max: Beyond Time and Space.
</p>
<p>
For their third and final Telltale outing, the irrepressible crime-fighting dog and bunny duo - originally created by cult comic book artist Steve Purcell - faced down Eldritch gods, alien warlords, and more in a battle to control an ancient, otherworldly power.

<p>
As for this year's Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse Remastered (which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sam-max-the-devils-playhouse-remastered-is-coming-in-2023">originally due in 2023</a> before getting a bit of a delay), it's once again being handled by developer Skunkape Games - which acquired the rights to Telltale's Sam &amp; Max adventures in 2018 after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-year-at-telltale-a-story-cut-short">studio shut its doors</a>, with many of the team having worked on the original games back in the day.
</p>
<p>
"When Max stumbles upon a mysterious toy that allows him to glimpse the future," explains the official blurb, "the Freelance Police unwittingly arouse the attention of a host of villains hellbent on acquiring the magical Toys of Power. To prevent the Devil's Toybox from falling into the wrong hands, Sam &amp; Max must face their most frightening adversary yet: the power of Max’s mind."
</p>
<p>
Skunkape hasn't shared much in the way of specifics about its remastering work for The Devil's Playhouse, but it seems reasonable to assume it'll include most of the improvements seen in the studio's lovingly handled remasters of Save the World and Beyond Time and Space.
</p>
<p>
Expect the likes of enhanced graphics and audio, dynamic lighting, improved lip syncing, revised character models more in keeping with Steve Purcell's original designs, new acting and camerawork, new music from original composer Jared Emerson-Johnson, a new user interface, controller support, and more.
</p>
<p>
Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse Remastered will be available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2648050/Sam__Max_The_Devils_Playhouse/">Steam</a> and GOG) when it launches on 14th August. And if you wouldn't mind making a brand-new Sam &amp; Max game next Skunkape, that'd be grand.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-4-cheats-codes">The Sims 4</a> is continuing its efforts to represent all the worst parts of modern living. The last expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-4-will-finally-let-you-be-a-predatory-landlord-or-a-tenant-dying-from-mould">added predatory landlords and mould-soaked apartments</a>. The next expansion will add the ability to create dating app profiles for your sims. It's called Lovestruck and it'll launch on July 25th.

<p>Lovestruck adds the Cupid's Corner app, on which players can create a profile for their sim, define what sort of partner they're looking for, then choose what kind of date to go on. How successful the date is will be determined by the sims' Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs, which set out the kinds of interests and interactions they're looking for in a potential romantic partner.
</p>
<p>Those dates can take place in a new city, which has three districts designed with romance in mind. There's also a new career path, "Romance Consultant", which I'm assuming is like the movie Hitch and not anything more euphimistic. Although there is also a new "Romantic Blanket" which sims can apparently take with them if they decide they want to woohoo outdoors, so who knows.
</p>
<p>As an expansion pack, Lovestruck adds both new systems, like new ways to date and new relationship metrics, and new outfits and items with which to decorate your home. They're the biggest of The Sims' various flavours of DLC - more substantial than Game Packs, and with new systems unlike Stuff Packs or Kits - and the size is reflected in the price, which is £35/$40.
</p>
<p>If that's not too high a price for love, the expansion launches on July 25th.</p>

<p id="xDDAHx">Scattered around the Land of Shadow of the DLC, you’ll run into six of Moore’s Forager Brood friends — non-hostile Lesser Kindreds of Rot. If you speak with them, they’ll each give you a <strong>Forager Brood Cookbook</strong>. You can pick up the Forager Brood Cookbooks 1 through 4 and also 7 before you take on Shadow Keep.</p>


<p id="uMtEMO">One of these Pests — the one on the north side of the Church of the Crusade — will be in bad shape when you find them. Use a <strong>Warming Stone</strong> to heal them, travel back to the Highroad Cross Site of Grace, and then return again to get the cookbook.</p>
<p id="HassG1">Once you heal that Forager and pick up the Forager Brood Cookbook (4) from them, head back to Moore and he’ll give you Forager Brood Cookbook (7). <strong>You have to do this before breaking Miquella’s charm at Shadow Keep</strong>.</p>

<p id="8Gwctn">Moore, as you may have noticed, is quite fond of the Forager Brood. If you kill any of them that you’ve met — after getting the cookbook from them, of course — Moore will invade and attack you. (The trigger for this seems a little fickle, so it may actually take killing two of them to trigger the invasion.)</p>
<p id="lnJ0ta">Defeating him will get you his <strong>Verdigris Greatshield </strong>and <strong>Verdigris armor set</strong>.</p>
<p id="EDfQaP">When you do this, it will kill off Moore and he will disappear from your game. Back at Main Gate Cross, all you’ll find is <strong>Moore’s Bell Bearing</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-paris-board-game-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ticket-to-ride-paris-board-game-review.914889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-paris-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Growing up in the suburbs of Illinois, I remember bringing my dad to and from the train station to get to work in the big city of Chicago. When Ticket to Ride came out later in life, it brought a lot of nostalgia for those big-city dreams in one of my other favorite memories with my family: playing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a>. </p><div id="202549" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride: Paris</h3></p><div><p>Experience the glamour of 1920s Paris in this fast-paced Ticket to Ride edition, racing to visit iconic locations.</p></div></div><p>Family board game nights involving the franchise can bring you places worldwide, and also to different time periods. That's the case with the newest edition, Ticket to Ride: Paris, brings you to the bustling metropolis of Paris, France, in the Roaring Twenties. </p><h2>What’s in the Box</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/ticket-to-ride-paris-1-1719602183470.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The compact box of Ticket to Ride Paris holds a small treasure trove of gaming pieces. It includes a guidebook introducing a new game element, a small board, four bags of colored bus tokens (with an additional spare bag), matching circle colored meeples, destination tickets, and transportation cards adorned with art that evokes the spirit of the Roaring Twenties. The box's thoughtful design, with a plastic compartment for each piece, ensures easy cleanup after the game. </p><p>The board is also small. I could probably fit it in a medium-sized purse or bag if I wanted to. The top possible score on the perimeter of the border is only 50. The city routes are divided by color and are relatively short as well. The eight longest routes are three lengths. There are twelve double routes and twelve single routes. Most of the routes are double routes, with only a handful of exceptions. There are four single three-car routes, two single double-car routes, and only one single-car solo route. </p><h2>Rules and How It Plays</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/ticket-to-ride-paris-2-1719602183471.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Ticket to Ride: Paris is a very beginner-friendly map. I brought this, along with a copy of a junior version (<a href="https://zdcs.link/8B0R7" target="_blank"><u>Ticket to Ride: Ghost Train</u></a>), to a local brewery to play with four friends this weekend. Half of the group wasn’t familiar with the franchise. Half were familiar as we regularly play base game versions digitally in my digital board game community. (Jimmy, it’s your turn over there, by the way.) This version of the game didn’t add as many complexities as other maps, so it made the game quite easy to navigate for everyone there. I was excited about introducing the series to friends.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ticket to Ride: Paris is a very beginner-friendly map.</p></div><p>You can play Ticket to Ride: Paris with two to four players. In a two-player game, I would guesstimate that the game might be more competitive since the game changes slightly with a two-player game versus more. Four was the maximum number of players, so we could see a complete view of how it played with its max capacities solely on its own—especially as I didn’t bring a full version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/1v275" target="_blank"><u>Ticket to Ride</u></a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/JdNON" target="_blank"><u>Ticket to Ride Europe</u></a> with me. (You are recommended to play maps normally with one of those base games.)</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/ticket-to-ride-paris-3-1719602183471.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Several mechanics in the original base games are akin to how others in the franchise operate. Choose your color to play and place your associated meeple on the start zero space on the board's perimeter. Grab the associated buses to go with your color for later placement on the board. </p><p>Next, you’ll distribute each player two face-down secret destination cards from a deck.  Players can choose to take both but must take one of them. After you’ve got your destinations, players will take turns collecting transportation cards to get buses to place along the board on their route. You can only claim one route per turn, so you must think stragetically and choose wisely.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/ticket-to-ride-paris-4-1719602183471.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>You can place routes on any tracks in games with more than two players, even if they are double routes. You cannot claim both routes of a double track, though.</p><p>You have a limited number of buses, so you’ll want to be mindful of your destinations and the number of trains you and your opponents have. The game ends when someone runs out of placeable buses. </p><h2>Build a French Flag for More Points</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/ticket-to-ride-paris-5-1719602183471.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One great addition to Ticket to Ride: Paris is that, as you place your buses, you can create French flags to gain points. French flags are created by making routes with red, white, and blue sets of collected transportation cards. You can only work on one flag at a time. When you complete a colored route with one of the colors in the flag, you’ll be able to keep one of the cards used to work on building a French flag. Completing a flag can only be done with those tricolors, however. Unlike routes, you cannot complete a flag with a rainbow bus. After you complete a flag, you discard those cards and can start on a new one. You’ll gain an additional four points for each completed flag, so you’ll want to use those three colors as a part of your strategy as well.</p><p>One of the magical things about playing games like this is that it inspires folks to discuss travel and transportation. The colored transportation cards each have different forms of transportation from the Twenties, including a trolly, a steamboat, a fancy car, a bicycle, and a croissant truck. It inspired conversations about how diverse travel can be in places worldwide–especially in one focused city. One friend told me how she had taken a day trip to Paris from London by bus. She told us about her thoughts traveling through and seeing some of the sights that were destinations on our board. Sadly, I have not made my way to Paris yet, but now, thanks to the game, I feel a bit of a connection to another part of the world and am inspired to visit new destinations if I ever go there.</p><h2>Where to Buy It</h2><p>Ticket to Ride Paris is available for an accessible price. You can buy it for only $24.99 on <a href="https://zdcs.link/yL84e" target="_blank">Asmodee’s store</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/lVvNO" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p><p><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>'s received its first major update in yonks last year, and then the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-2023-and-team-fortress-2-just-set-a-new-all-time-player-record">nearly 17-year-old game promptly broke its concurrent player record</a>. Still, talk to one of those players and you'll find all is not well with Valve's shooter, which is apparently regularly overrun by bots and cheaters.
</p>
<p>Some players are now reporting "a large ban wave" targeting users of aimbots, however.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Valve themselves have not announced that they've taken any new action, so all we have to go on are reports from the community. 
</p>
<p>One user posted an image of a message they allegedly received from Steam Support. "Our team noticed your accounts were involved in majorly disruptive activity in Team Fortress 2. Accounts dedicated to the disruption of TF2 have been deactivated, and accounts used for other purposes have been locked and banned," says the message.
</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>valve are now banning tf2 bot hosters and sending this message directly to them, stating "Accounts dedicated to the disruption of TF2 have been deactivated"</p><p>VALVE PLEASE KEEP DOING THIS DON'T STOP <a href="https://t.co/PQ9SRZnB60">pic.twitter.com/PQ9SRZnB60</a></p></div>— heavy team fortres 2 (@heavyfortres) <a href="https://twitter.com/heavyfortres/status/1806418629581476180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Another community member claimed to have confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/WeezyTF2/status/1806282466077901226">a "prominent hoster" of bots had been banned. There's much anecdotal evidence that the game has fewer bots in online matches than normal.
</a></p>
<p>Some players also pointed to substantial and sudden dips in Team Fortress 2's player count as evidence of banwaves. At the time of writing, however, the game has had <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/440#1m">a steady and significant increase in its player count</a>.</p>
<p>Players have been begging Valve to take action to clean up Team Fortress 2 for years, often organising under the #SaveTF2 moniker. This isn't the first ban-wave in recent years either, although previous efforts have seemed short-lived, with cheaters swiftly moving back in. For the sake of those still playing, I hope this time is different.</p>

<article id="post-6484">
  
  <div data-hide-featured-media="0">
<p>As the world’s biggest <em>Alan Wake 2</em> Fan (a title I awarded to myself), I was excited to learn that a physical collector’s edition would be made available months after launch. My enthusiasm died off, however, when I looked at the package. <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/alan-wake-ii-collectors-edition/products/alan-wake-2-collectors-edition-ps5">For $200 at Limited Run Games</a>, you can get a physical copy of the game —&nbsp; the only place where you can do so — along with a copy of <em>Alan Wake Remastered</em>, an angel lamp replica, an art book, a keychain, and some digital cosmetics. It’s alright as far as collector’s editions go, but the kicker was that I had already bought the deluxe edition at launch, which included around half of what comes in the box. And there was no way to upgrade. I’d have to spend $200 <em>on top</em> of the $80 I already paid. Even beyond the fun collectibles, that’s basically $300 just for a physical copy, to own the game outright.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking around, I can see similar frustration bubbling across a lot of the video game industry, and it’s reaching a boiling point. As games become more expensive to produce and are therefore becoming more costly to buy, players are lashing out at studios who want to get them to spend more for increasingly diminishing returns, whether through microtransactions or premium editions that offer “free” extras. While many might be worth it, some, like <em>Alan Wake 2</em>’s collectors edition, don’t offer enough for the exorbitant cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everything is very expensive right now. I’m not spending hundreds of dollars on stuff I already own or digital products that aren’t important or useful. And I know I’m not alone in this, either. Something has to change in the video games industry, and looking at special editions becoming increasingly sketchy is an area I think is being overlooked.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While games are more expensive than ever, with $70 being standard for many AAA games these days, the situation could be way worse. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/are-video-games-really-more-expensive">Analysts</a> <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2023/02/10/why-more-new-video-games-now-cost-70/">generally</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/7/21314545/console-video-game-price-increase-70-video-game-ps5-xbox-series-x">agree</a> that based on inflation and rising development costs, games should cost even more than they do now. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-03/ex-playstation-chief-mulls-future-of-gaming-and-his-new-job?srnd=technology-vp">Former Sony Interactive CEO Shawn Layden told Bloomberg</a> in 2021 that many PlayStation 4 games were topping $100 million, and he expected that number to only get higher. At the time, he said $200 million, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233">according to a presentation in the recent Insomniac Games leak</a>, the budget for the PS5’s <em>Spider-Man 2</em> was around $300 million. And while the game sold very well, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ps5-hardware-sales-hit-quarterly-high-but-that-isn-t-good-enough-for-sony">Sony said in its February financials</a> that it was bolstered by its sales of third-party games, not hardware or in-house development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lot of these costs have been offset over the years by purchases made outside of just buying the base game: microtransactions, gacha mechanics, paid DLC, games-as-a-service (GaaS), and premium collector’s editions. As scummy as many of these tactics can be, they do what they’re supposed to do. Live-service games like <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Fortnite </em>do well because players continue to invest in them over time. Regardless of whether you need a <em>Fortnite</em> skin that makes you look like a member of Metallica or not, these companies have become experts at getting you to buy things, which in turn has contributed to keeping full game prices low.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A premium edition has microtransactions built in — “for free,” in a way. Usually, you’ll see a cosmetic pack or a season pass for post-launch DLC in an $80 deluxe edition. Sometimes the studio will put up a limited-time collector’s edition for a couple hundred bucks for the big spenders who want a unique piece of merch or an artbook. The <em>Alan Wake 2</em> deluxe edition, for instance, came with two costumes, a weapon skin, an extra charm for protagonist Saga, and the story DLC expansion pass for an extra $20. While the majority of people will simply buy the standard edition, many will still pay extra for one of these special versions. The deluxe edition here was worth it to me just for the expansion pass. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pay-more-to-play-why-video-game-prices-could-rise-in-2023">IGN’s Rebekah Valentine put it</a>, “many games are already much more expensive than $70, and people happily pay for them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately for studios, as games get more expensive and other factors contribute to higher costs everywhere else, people are becoming wary of premium editions and extra purchases. When the standard edition of a AAA game can cost $70, a higher price tag has to be worth it. They can’t be <em>too</em> expensive, and if they are, the stuff included needs to ensure you that your wallet won’t start crying. You also can’t lock critical features behind paywalls. The same standards for microtransactions apply here as well; if you offer, say, a weapon that gives players a huge advantage, you’re saying you only care about money, not about the players themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While most developers and publishers these days are better about not offering pay-to-win items (or at least are better at hiding it), that hasn’t stopped them from breaking cardinal rules. Recently <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> developer Battlestate Games announced its The Unheard Edition. For $250, players got access to a highly sought-after offline PvE mode and features that gave them a huge advantage at the beginning of seasons. This was especially frustrating for players who purchased other premium editions with a season pass that promised to provide access to all future DLC. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24140541/escape-from-tarkov-the-unheard-edition-250">Battlestate initially refused</a> to offer an upgrade discount or any other avenue for players to get PvE, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/05/23/all-escape-from-tarkov-eod-owners-now-have-access-to-250-pve-mode/">although it eventually relented</a> after immense community backlash.</p>



<p>Big studios have been trying out other ideas, with features that are appealing but fleeting. A recent trend has been including early access periods in special edition pre-orders. Although, even that might not be enough anymore when a game like <em>Concord</em> is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/concord-beta-dates-announced-beta-early-access-launching-july-12/">offering a brief beta period</a> for pre-order owners before launching an open beta the next week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ubisoft hasn’t done anything as openly egregious, but it’s made a habit of giving special edition owners exclusive missions. Its upcoming open-world RPG <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>is now up for pre-order, and people who buy the Gold or Ultimate editions get access to a season pass that features an exclusive Jabba the Hutt mission. The publisher has gotten around more widespread criticism with this strategy by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dont-spend-115-on-star-wars-outlaws-ultimate-edition">offering missions up later through Ubisoft Connect</a> with easy-to-obtain in-game currency, and in the case of <em>Star Wars</em>, players will still get to interact with the big slug boy in the main game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, just because games companies offer up decent extras doesn’t mean players will react accordingly. When <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> released on Steam, people noticed that the store page featured some extra purchases, which you could buy either in the “A Boon For New Adventurers – New Journey Pack,” as a part of the deluxe edition, or piecemeal. While people went to leave negative reviews on the page to complain about it, all of the items — rare as some of them were —&nbsp; could be found or earned in game. So on paper, Capcom was acting fairly. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108587/dragons-dogma-2-microtransactions-dlc-steam-reviews">Oli Welsh wrote for Polygon</a> that a lot of the backlash was due to the restrictive nature of <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2’</em>s game design (you could buy a Portcrystal to initiative fast travel, which is highly discouraged in-game, for instance).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, people were so quick to jump on Capcom for alleged exploitation in this case, and it’s mostly unfounded. You don’t <em>have</em> to get any of the items and you can earn all of them by just playing the game. But you can just tell from how quickly people reacted to this and other recent editions: They’re tired of being taken advantage of.</p>



<p>But to keep making profit (among other things like having to appeal to investors who want consistent growth every year and going into debt through constant, ridiculous acquisitions), studios will keep using the strategies that work. Microtransactions and collector’s editions aren’t going anywhere while they still bring in that much cash. If we must continue down this path, companies need to make purchases fair, listen to feedback, and understand that many just can’t afford digital nonsense. Players don’t need to experience opening their <em>Fallout 76</em> special edition only to find out the canvas bag was actually made of <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/fallout-76-power-armor-edition-canvas-bag-swapped-with-nylon-bag/">cheaper, shittier nylon</a> or that the DLC they were promised might not apply to them. And if I’m going to be surrounded by little tchotchkes from my favorite games, I better not regret paying $200.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Streamer and influencer Guy 'DrDisrespect' Beahm continues to lose partners and support in the wake of allegations concerning his ban from Twitch, with YouTube now preventing him from earning money via his channel.</p>
<p>In a statement issued to <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-youtube-sexting-allegation-minor-1851565750">Kotaku</a>, a YouTube spokesperson said the platform has "suspended monetisation on DrDisrespect's channel for violating our Creator Responsibility policy."</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that this channel, which has 4.7 million subscribers, has also been removed from the YouTube Partner Program "following serious allegations against the creator."</p>
<p>This will apply not only to Beahm's existing channels,but any he creates in the future.</p>
<p>The allegations emerged last Friday, when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">The Verge</a> reported a former member of Twitch's trust and safety team claimed Beahm was banned from that site after sending inappropriate messages to a minor and attempting to arrange to meet them at TwitchCon.</p>
<p>In the wake of the report, Beahm claimed the matter had already been resolved and that "no wrongdoing was acknowledged." After <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/drdisrespect-banned-from-twitch-again">Twitch banned permanently banned him in 2020</a>, he sued the site and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/drdisrespect-banned-from-twitch-again">the case was settled in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, game developer Midnight Society – which Beahm co-founded – announced it had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/midnight-society-parts-ways-with-co-founder-dr-disrespect">parted ways with the streamer</a>, while peripherals firm Turtle Beach dropped its partnership with Beahm.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nickmercs-twitch-ban-transphobia-slur<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Late last night, Nick “Nickmercs” Kolcheff – an associate of <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guy “Dr Disrespect” Beahm</a> who’s recently done a spectacular job of digging his own grave – got <a href="https://x.com/StreamerBans/status/1806584079996899816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspended from Twitch</a>. Following months of sustained anti-trans rhetoric that ramped up in recent weeks, the bro-y streamer is finally facing tangible consequences after dropping the T-slur during a stream. On the upside, it seems like he's learned his lesson and plans to turn over a new leaf.&nbsp;</p><p>Just kidding.</p><p>“Banned for using the word ‘Tranny’ on Twitch,” Kolcheff, who has over 6 million followers on Twitch, <a href="https://x.com/NICKMERCS/status/1806640207216664777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “Apparently that’s a derogatory term. That’s on me. Next time I’ll use ‘mental health disorder.’”</p><p>This raises a lot of questions about the usefulness of Twitch’s rules in a situation like this. These rules <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#11HatefulConduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explicitly forbid</a>, among other things, “expressions of contempt, hatred, or disgust based on a protected characteristic” including “statements that a protected group should not exist.” During a recent stream, Kolcheff literally said that trans people <em>do </em>not exist: “There’s no such thing as trans people,” <a href="https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/1800327448879612330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he said</a> while playing <em>Elden Ring</em>. “That’s something that you created. So have fun with your little dream land, but that shit is not even real.”&nbsp;</p><p>Other incidents have included a 2023 Pride Month invocation of “leave little children alone” rhetoric in response to transgender rights protesters in Florida – which ultimately led Activision to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/9/23755282/call-of-duty-nickmercs-homophobic-comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yank his in-game skin from <em>Call of Duty</em></a> – and a recent dust-up with Ava Kris Tyson, a close friend of Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson who is trans. Tyson was criticizing defenders of Dr Disrespect, which prompted Kolcheff to <a href="https://x.com/NICKMERCS/status/1804626242194362502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reply</a>: "You should be ashamed of yourself. Leaving behind your wife &amp; child, to play pretend. One day you’ll wake up and realize what you’ve done."</p><p>These are just a few examples of a clear pattern of behavior on Kolcheff’s part, one that stretches back an entire year and demonstrably demonizes a marginalized group. But Twitch only opted to ban him after he used a slur, at which point he responded by immediately giving up the game: Cruel language is just the tip of the iceberg, and the substance behind it is the actual point. Kolcheff wants people to know that he believes trans people are delusional – that a desire to embody a different gender is a disorder, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/19/health/is-gender-dysphoria-mental-disorder-treatment-wellness/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is factually untrue</a>, by the way – and he’ll keep saying it until he’s blue in the face. The kinds of ideas he’s propagating are much more harmful than an admittedly shitty term; they are what convince people to fear, loathe, and even <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-religion-arrests-riots-race-and-ethnicity-c65c1090ed923687716114be371e9fdb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do violence</a> to trans folks. On and around Twitch, the damage has already been done, and it sure seems like Kolcheff plans to do more.&nbsp;</p><p>What happens when Kolcheff returns from <a href="https://x.com/CommanderRoot/status/1806596115921240208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what appears to be a temporary suspension</a>? It seems unlikely that Twitch will suddenly start taking action against things Kolcheff has been saying for a year. Meanwhile, he’ll need to be a little savvier about how he says them – he’ll just have to tiptoe around the gargantuan, unmissable minefield that is using a slur – and that’ll be that. That in mind, who is this ban serving? Who benefits from it? Unless Twitch decides to actually enforce its rules when it comes to transphobic dog whistles, plausible deniability be damned, it may as well not be doing anything at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This set isn't one mentioned in their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-2024-roadmap-stars-fallout-modern-horizons-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2024 roadmap</a>, nor is it another Universes Beyond crossover with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-x-fallout-mutant-menace-review-and-improvements" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/assassins-creed-magic-gathering-set-has-me-hooked" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Assassins Creed</em></a>. <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> is designed for players of all skill levels, and as a starting point for newcomers.</p>
<h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundation</em>s announcement</h2>
<p>Wizards of the Coast recently held a preview panel at MagicCon: Amsterdam. That panel, now available in its entirety on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is_ghoPFjrw">YouTube channel</a>, revealed what <em>Magic</em> fans could expect going into the second half of 2024. It opened discussing <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> alongside sneak peeks at the upcoming <em>Bloomburrow</em> and <em>Duskmorn</em> sets.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-anthem-of-champions-artwork.jpg?itok=HjynPzvz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-anthem-of-champions-artwork.jpg?itok=DigR3_CV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to teach someone what an anthem effect is? Here it is.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the panel, <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> is a new Standard-legal set. As the name implies, it is meant to establish a foundation for the new era of the popular card game and help new players get into the hobby. If you have never played <em>Magic</em> before, this set is designed to show why fans love it so much.</p>
<p>The set will contain reprints of fan-favorite cards across the game's history. In addition, the set will contain brand new cards; essentially a 50/50 split of new and old.</p>
<p>The panel briefly showed new card art. It confirmed the return of older cards like <em>Llanowar Elves</em>,<em> Day of Judgment</em>, and <em>Omniscience</em>. They also revealed new cards such as <em>Anthem of Champions</em>, an aptly named Green/White anthem Enchantment, and <em>Nine-Lives Familiar</em>, a literal cat with nine lives.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-borderless-card-artwork.jpg?itok=BdGDP6vp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-borderless-card-artwork.jpg?itok=etmnDJx8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fans, enjoy hunting these down.</figcaption></figure><p>The card artwork in <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> showcases a focus on accessibility and approachability. Cards in this set will contain succinct text and straightforward effects. Furthermore,&nbsp; Enchantment cards going forward will feature Nyx borders. This means Enchantment and Artifact cards will have their own frame, making them more readable.</p>
<p>Naturally, <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> will contain alternate versions of these cards. The panel confirms extended art variants and borderless variants of both the reprints and new cards. The panel even teases the return of certain legendary creatures and Planeswalkers, one even alludes to fan-favorite Chandra Nalaar.</p>
<p><em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> will be released November 15.</p>

            <p>
It's funny to think about names. If circumstances were just a tiny bit different, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkUVRGCidjE">Chuck Spadina</a> could have been up on stage winning over E3 by telling it how breathtaking it is; we might have all have been round the arcade <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-could-have-been-called-kong-dong-nintendo-court-documents-state">giggling at a Kong Dong cabinet</a>; or perhaps sitting down over breakfast for a quick game of Mr Bugs Wordys Nugz.
</p>
<p>
That's the unlikely title developer Josh Wardle once considered for his daily word game phenomenon Wordle before settling on the one that's since become a household name. "Had I called the game Mr. Bugs," Wardle admitted to an audience at the recent <a href="https://config.figma.com/agenda/session?session_id=d418949a2beb&amp;lang=en">Figma Config conference</a>, "I like to think it would not have been successful."
</p>
<p>
Wardle was speaking during a presentation detailing Wordle's long development (thanks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24186786/wordle-original-name-mr-bugs-wordy-nugz-wardle">The Verge</a>), revealing some of decisions he'd made along the way. That journey began in 2013 when, while trying to make something that might appeal to his partner, he mashed together words and Mastermind to make an Android game. Perhaps surprisingly, the core of Wordle was there right from the start, giving players six turns to guess a five-letter word.
</p>

<p>
There were detours and deviations along the way, however. One prototype shown during Wardle's presentation was endless in design, quickly following one word with another, while a second attempt to refine Wordle's essence introduced lives. Nothing quite clicked, and eventually Wardle lost interest, putting the game "on the back burner" for six years. It wasn't until he started regularly playing New York Times games like Spelling Bee in 2020 that an idea struck and, returning to Wordle the following year, he built a version inspired by their once-a-day design.
</p>
<p>
And the rest is history. For the first six months of its existence, Wordle was played solely by Wardle and his partner, but one day they shared the website with family, who shared it with friends, until it turned into the global phenomena it is today. Wardle, of course, stunned the world in January 2022, when he decided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-york-times-buys-puzzle-game-phenomenon-wordle-for-seven-figure-sum">sell his meteorically successful game</a> to the New York Times for a seven-figure sum. And this, he told conference attendees, was simply because, "I didn't want to run a games business. I'm interested in creating things."
</p>
<p>
Nor did he want to monetise the game to turn it into a career. "All of this comes back to [the fact] I'm building the game for my partner," he explained. "I'm not going to show her ads or try and upsell her on a premium subscription... [but] it quickly became apparent to me that there were other people who were going to make money off Wordle, whether I was involved or not." In the end, he added, "selling to The New York Times was a way to just to step away." Would the publication have been quite so interested in Mr Bugs Wordys Nugz? Who can say.
</p>
<p>
In the end, though, Wardle's closing advice for fellow developers was simple: "Don't try to make Wordle. Make the thing that you're passionate about that is meaningful to you. And then everything else will follow from that."
</p>

He says much of the problem boils down to characters not feeling “tanky” enough, and it requires support heroes to focus all their healing on them just to sustain a fight. This means support players are somewhat tethered to tanks, so two of three roles are struggling, while he damage heroes light everyone else up.</p><p>As a result, the team has started using a new internal metric of “tankiness” that measures the number of hero deaths a tank character has compared to how many they “ought to experience.” Keller says that he can’t go into detail for what an expected death rate entails, but says that players’ struggles with the tank role are backed up by the data Blizzard uses internally. Some of this was intentional and a result of recent changes, but most tanks (except Wrecking Ball) moved “a lot further” down in survivability compared to other roles. The headshot damage reduction for tanks helped, but it’s still not where the team wants it.</p><p>Now that the problem’s been identified, Keller says the team is looking to see how they can address this, both with broad changes across the game and targeted tweaks for different heroes.

When I look at it, I'm like, 'We weren't far enough in '[Cyberpunk 2077.'] We thought that we were dystopian, but we just touched the surface."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Dan Hernberg, the executive producer for Project Orion, agreed with Sasko that Cyberpunk's portrayal of social issues was flawed and voiced his optimism for Orion furthering the game's social commentary in ways 2077 fell short. </p><p>"I think the really cool thing about Cyberpunk—and the dystopian future that it has—is there's so much relevance to today, of megacorporations, of people on the fringes, you know, of people just being exploited resources, of the wealth gap, of all these things," Hernberg said. "I think that 2077 allows us to tell these stories in ways where—at the heart of it—there's always relationships and people, but we're in a really broken world and that we can call out some of these things.</p><p>"I think for me that's what Cyberpunk is about, exploring those themes but in a very poignant way," Hernberg continued. "I love the world, and I think that's what we're going to try to do with Project Orion. Really continue to lean into that and continue to say, 'What is [the state of the world ] today,' and what does it look like in a couple of years."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Back in March, CD Projekt Red hired Hernberg, a former head of production at Amazon Games and lead product manager at Blizzard Entertainment, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-hires-veterans-from-mortal-kombat-diablo-control-and-more"><u>one of the veteran developers working on Orion in its Boston studio</u></a>. Although details on Project Orion are scarce, one thing we know for sure about the follow-up title is that the company wants it to follow in the footsteps of The Witcher's evolution. Meaning, that CD Projekt Red aims to have Orion usher in more gameplay enhancements and features than its predecessor once it finally releases. Another rumored idea for the title is that it might include <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-considering-adding-multiplayer-to-cyberpunk-2"><u>Cyberpunk 2077's scrapped multiplayer feature</u></a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review"><u>our review</u></a> of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, we gave the game a 9/10, writing, "Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty completes an immense turnaround for CD Projekt Red's future RPG kickstarted with the anime spinoff, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and its latest 2.0 Update."</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

                <p>After two years, Elden Rings' highly-anticipated DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-world-map-guide/2900-5487/" data-ref-id="2900-5487">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, is finally here. But despite Elden Ring's high praise and nearly universal acclaim from critics, the DLC currently rests at a 70% positive on Steam--and that's after a significant jump up from its former rating. So, what happened?</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ngvBy8YiA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N6ngvBy8YiA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Upon release, many players realized that the game's newest region, the Realm of Shadow, was filled to the brim with tough enemies. Like, <em>extremely </em>tough enemies. Despite the DLC emphasizing the importance of its new leveling mechanic, which relies on items called Scadutree Fragments to help balance the Shadow of the Erdtree so players don't, ya know, immediately wipe the floor with Messmer and his cronies, many players quickly grew frustrated with the DLC's difficulty.</p><p>From Software's games are no stranger to difficulty discourse--just Google the origin of the well-known phrase "get good." But this time, players are review bombing the studio's latest title for being too difficult. Yet on top of the DLC being <em>intended</em> to challenge players the way Elden Ring did back in 2022, we can't help but be a bit frustrated that From Software is more well-know for its games' difficulties rather than, well, just about everything else the studio does.</p><p>In this week's episode of Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss review bombing, why the mantra "get good" is very outdated, and how games like Dark Souls and Bloodborne aren’t just hard for the sake of it. The pair also dig into how the games' actually set players up for success, reward their time and triumphs greatly, and offer so much more than brutal boss battles.</p><p>Spot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news.

Allegedly, Kang told his family that he was traveling to Florida to visit a friend. After arriving in Florida, Kang visited a local hardware store and bought a hammer and a flashlight. Then early on Sunday morning, while dressed in all black clothes and wearing a mask, Kang arrived at Dinh’s house and entered via an unlocked door. Once he got in, Kang reportedly began attacking the victim with a hammer. Dinh’s stepfather heard the commotion and intervened. The two then worked together to subdue the attacker and called the police. </p><p><em>The New York Times </em>reports Dinh was treated at a hospital for server head wounds and was later released. Kang has been charged with attempted murder as well as armed burglary. He’s currently being held in a Nassau County jail without bond.

There are some things that make you say, ‘What in the world was he thinking?’ And there are some things that make you say, ‘You’re not going to believe this.’ This case makes you say all four of those.” </p><p>Police questioned Kang about why he attacked Dinh with a hammer and he simply said: “He is a bad person online.”</p><p>Ironically, <em>ArcheAge</em>—the MMORPG in which Kang and Dinh interacted and which led to this whole attack—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-ten-years-korean-mmo-archeage-is-closing-its-european-and-north-american-servers&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-ten-years-korean-mmo-archeage-is-closing-its-european-and-north-american-servers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shut down due to a lack of users on June 27</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/can-metaphor-refantazio-escape-the-shadow-of-persona-exploring-one-of-2024s-most-interesting-games.914805/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-the-first-hands-on-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Eight years ago, Japanese director Katsura Hashino announced that he was forming a new team within Atlus after more than a decade spent working on the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona series</a> (and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/07/26/catherine-review">Catherine</a>), saying he wanted to try something new. Last summer, his game was finally revealed – <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, an RPG that features plenty of similarities to the Persona games, but has a personality all its own.</p><p>In broad strokes, Metaphor retains many familiar elements from Hashino’s previous games. Like its spiritual predecessors, Metaphor utilizes a turn-based command system built around exploiting the weaknesses of enemies. The main character, an outcast who uses forbidden magic, looks a great deal like the hero of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona 3 Reload</a> thanks in no small part to the art of Shigenori Soejima. Even some of the terminology is the same, a notable example being Tarukaja – a spell that boosts attacks in Persona and now Metaphor (though Hashino denies any link between the two).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Its pedigree and excellent production values has been enough to generate excitement in some RPG circles, with some going so far as to call it their most anticipated game of the year. But others in the broader gaming community are a bit more perplexed, either because of the similarities to Persona, because of the unconventional name, or both. </p><p>So what is Metaphor: ReFantazio really all about? And does it have a chance to step out of Persona’s shadow and establish a fanbase all of its own? These are still open questions, but I did get a little closer to developing my own understanding of Metaphor when I played it at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-of-gaming-2024-schedule-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect">Summer Game Fest</a> earlier this month.</p><h2>About Metaphor's name, and why it doesn't have romance</h2><p>First, that name, which is definitely a mouthful. The Metaphor part is easy enough to understand – Hashino says that he wants players to be able to relate the story to their own lives. In short, he wants it to be a metaphor. “We had all these different ideas. We couldn't think of many good ones so we were like, ‘Okay, just Metaphor. It's easy.’"</p><p>As for the second part, Hashino says, the team wanted to rethink the idea of a fantasy world. Hence, ReFantazio. Okay, so it doesn’t quite roll off the tongue, but you can’t say it’s not memorable.</p><p>As for the game itself, the demo I saw consisted of three different sections – a story sequence, a dungeon crawling sequence, and a boss battle. The demo begins by establishing some of the world through Gallica, a fairy companion who brings a bit of an 80s D&amp;D vibe to Metaphor. </p><p>In the sequence, Gallica relates the legend of a place that looks suspiciously like New York City, with Gallica amazed by a world with no magic, no tribal conflict, and “towers of glass that reach the heavens.” It’s a story that seems to suggest that discrimination is a recurring theme through Metaphor, with many of the main cast members battling prejudice of some sort.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As we developed the concept of the game, we realized our interest in exploring the idea of inner strength and how people overcome limitations</p></div><p>Speaking with IGN in a follow-up email, Hashino confirmed that Metaphor’s story is “closely related to the theme of changing the world for the better.”</p><p>“As we approached this project, we wanted to challenge ourselves to do something different from our past works while still leveraging the comprehensive strength and experience of Atlus as an RPG maker. As we developed the concept of the game, we realized our interest in exploring the idea of inner strength and how people overcome limitations. Essentially we wanted to explore how we can become the best possible versions of ourselves,” he said. </p><p>“To achieve this, we focused on how people perceive each other based on personality or personal interactions. This led us to the idea that biases or prejudices can form around judgements of these characteristics. We created a backdrop to this world around the idea that various characters in this world are exposed to some form of bias or prejudice in this regard."</p><p>While the fantasy world of Metaphor is different from ours in many ways, if we are able to convey it well, we believe fans will be able to find various similarities between it and our own.”</p><p>Ultimately, Hashino says, his main goal for Metaphor was to move away from Persona’s modern setting while sticking to the format he knows best. That means that Metaphor plays a great deal like Persona on a moment to moment basis, which is especially evident in the dungeon crawling and boss battle sequences. It even has summons that look a lot like the demons from Personas. Admittedly, there’s plenty of nuance to be found in these comparisons – among other things, a big part of the strategy is positioning your characters in the front or the back row, and the battles overall are much faster – but on the surface the resemblance is clear.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Persona Review Scores</h3></div></output><p>The most meaningful change can be found in the third section of the demo, which in addition to the boss battle showcases a bit of how the story progresses. Where the latter day Persona games are built around a linear daily school calendar, Metaphor is structured more like a road trip where you have the freedom to go where you please (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-more-than-a-stylish-persona-spin-off/1100-6524497/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hashino compares it to a vacation</a> where you won't be able to see everything in one playthrough).</p><p>Setting a destination on the Gauntlet Runner, the crew’s landship, will take a certain amount of time to reach, during which you can build up your stats by reading books with titles like “Pride and Persuasion” or doing laundry.</p><p>Notably, Metaphor doesn’t have any romantic connections to build, unlike Persona, which Hashino attributes to the desire to avoid making a “romance game.”</p><p>“We made [Persona] as a RPG story about teenagers. And teenagers, they date, they have romance. That's part of the joy of being a young person exploring your boundaries. So that was why we included it in the game…because if we didn't have this in, it wouldn't really feel authentic. For our new gam…we didn't want to include it because it didn't feel as natural, if that makes sense,” Hashino explains.</p><p>“The second point I would like to make is the main plot focus is that there's this character, the protagonist, who is trying to become the next king. And rather than focusing on his love life, we wanted to make sure we have this whole follower system. So we wanted people to focus on that.”</p><h2>Metaphor draws heavily from 80s and 90s fantasy</h2><p>This approach sits at the core of what separates Metaphor from Hashino’s previous work. I’ve often compared the latter day Persona games to something like an anime <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/08/16/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-review">Buffy the Vampires Slayer</a>, featuring Japanese teenagers who deal with high school drama by day and battle demons by night. When I played Metaphor, though, the first show that popped into my head was Aura Battle Dunbine – an early example of the isekai sub-genre featuring a young motorcycle enthusiast who is transported to a fantasy world populated by giant robots resembling bugs.</p><p>Hashino acknowledges that he’s a fan of Dunbine, but chalks up any influence it might have to its significant popularity in the 1980s. More significant may be what Soejima calls “the fantasy boom” of the 1980s and 90s, which gave rise to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/17/record-of-lodoss-war-2">Record of Lodoss War</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a>, and a host of other well-known properties.</p><p>“So I lived through the late '80s and early '90s when there was a fantasy boom over here, and all the fantasy stuff that existed in that era and that previously came from overseas was part of my artistic DNA,” Soejima says. “After that, I read a lot of really serious fantasy stuff, which came into me and mixed into this other base layer and helped form my DNA as well. The first fantasy I interacted with was [Dungeons &amp; Dragons] way, way back in the day. Probably more than books, Wizardry would be what really influenced me from the fantasy genre.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One way or another, Metaphor figures to be an interesting experiment for Hashino and company. Given a new canvas, the team seems keen to put their own stamp on the fantasy genre, drawing from well-known influences and giving them a new spin with their distinct verve and style. It feels at once familiar and invigorating – a fresh approach that still leans into their individual strengths, with a heightened art style and even faster battle system. Atlus, for its part, is treating it like the launch of a new franchise, giving it a global launch with a prime release slot in October.</p><p>“When we were creating this game, we thought, okay, we know that people do like the approach that we take,” Hashino says, “so we have more confidence to realize our vision without fear of how people will react, because we think people will like our game.”</p><p>We’ll be able to see for ourselves when Metaphor: ReFantazio releases October 11 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

                <p>Kenshin Kazama, a 27-year-old Japanese resident in Hitachi, recently admitted that he made death threats to Nintendo via inquiry forms on its website between August 22 and November 29 last year. The reason? He was upset while playing Nintendo's games.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by<a href="https://www.ktv.jp/news/articles/?id=13276" rel="nofollow "> Kansai Television News</a> (via<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/27-year-old-man-admits-cancelling-nintendo-japan-events-by-threatening-to-kill-everyone-for-shitty-games/" rel="nofollow "> Video Games Chronicle</a>), Kazama sent 39 threats and was accused of saying that he would make sure people at Nintendo would regret making a bad game. Kazama went on to threaten to kill those who were involved in making the game. Then he went as far as to threaten spectators at an upcoming event.</p><p dir="ltr">The event Kazama mentioned was believed to be the Splatoon Koshien 2023 National Finals. As the name suggests, it's an event based on Nintendo's popular shooter, Splatoon. The Splatoon Koshien 2023 was originally set to take place in December 2023 and January 2024, but due to the threats, the event was canceled.</p><p dir="ltr">Kazama went on to explain that he made these threats because he was getting angry while playing Nintendo games, and every time he lost, he would get more frustrated.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/28/football-manager-25-will-feature-womens-teams/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A new development update for Football Manager 25 has been released by Sports Interactive, highlighting how this will be a new start for the series. That is because Football Manager 25 will mark the franchise moving to the Unity engine, and it will likely be the main engine for the next 20 years. The first look at the user interface has been shown too, showing the tile and card system.</p>

		
		

<p>What the screenshots show are how Football Manager 25 will be changing the way players interact with the game going forward. The first screenshot shows the updated information screen players will see between highlights during matchdays. On it, you can see that the pitch takes centre stage as normal, with both team tactical line ups on either side of it. Below these are the match stats, match events, and other match scores from around the league. Under all of that is the team line up with player condition. The second screen shows the new Portal, with the Inbox being consigned to history. With the Portal you will have an Agenda list showing tasks that need to be completed, news from the football world, the calendar, and messages from everyone you interact with. The final two screens show player form details, detailing their performance over the last five matches, and how they have contributed to the team.</p>


<p>Football Manager 25 will see other things taken out. Matchday touchline shouts will not be present in the game. They may return in future Football Manager releases, but only if the development team believe they fit properly. The data chalkboard will not be back in Football Manager 25. Create A Club will not be in the game either, though Sports Interactive are aiming to bring it back for Football Manager 26 with major improvements. Versus mode is another mode that will not be in the game, as only 0.5% of players were playing it. Challenge Mode is being revamped as well, with it returning in either Football Manager 26 or Football Manager 27. Fantasy Draft will be part of Football Manager 25 but not day one. This will instead come further down the line in an update.</p>
<p>Miles Jacobson also confirmed in the development update that Football Manager 25 will be the first game in the series to include women’s football, and multiple licenses have been signed. However, the details of which leagues and teams will be playable has not been released yet, with that information coming at a later date.</p>

                <p>Hearthstone's next expansion, Perils in Paradise, is launching on July 23. And while the tropical-themed expansion is mostly about kicking back and relaxing on the beach, everybody knows that when you go on vacation, you should keep a close eye on your wallet. Sure enough, the Rogue package for the upcoming expansion has big burgle synergy, with cards that reward you for exercising the old five-finger discount.</p><p>The leader of the gang is <strong>Treasure Hunter Eudora</strong>, a Rogue legendary card (with a lovely Signature variant). The 6-mana 4/5 Pirate has a Battlecry that gives you a Sidequest token, Eudora's Treasure Hunt. The Sidequest challenges you to play three cards from other classes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325790-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325790" data-ratio="1.4343971631206" data-width="564" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325790-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325790"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325790-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325791-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325792-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_signature.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325793-rogue_vac_464t_enus_eudorastreasurehunt-112025_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325791,1300-4325792,1300-4325793" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4325791-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4325792-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_signature.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4325793-rogue_vac_464t_enus_eudorastreasurehunt-112025_normal.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325791-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325792-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_signature.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325793-rogue_vac_464t_enus_eudorastreasurehunt-112025_normal.png"></figure><p>To help you complete the task, Eudora has brought a couple of scurvy scalawags along with her, and a big spell that will help remove threats while you plan your heist. <strong>Sea Shill</strong> is a 3-mana 3/2 pirate that gives you a 2-mana discount on the next non-Rogue card you play. <strong>Conniving Conman</strong> is a 4-mana 4/4 pirate that lets you double up on your stolen goods by replaying the last card you played from another class.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/28/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-goes-gold-pc-specs-and-20-minutes-of-gameplay-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.</p>

<p>The upcoming "Souls-lite" fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion&nbsp;Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.</p>

<p>We last saw Flintlock during the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-sets-july-launch">Xbox Games Showcase</a> a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: "Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed."</p>
