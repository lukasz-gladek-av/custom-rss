            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289634/nyt-tech-guild-connections-strike-edition-custom-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Striking <em>New York Times</em> tech workers have created a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@nytguildtech/post/DCCV4LruxBh">custom <em>Connections</em> puzzle</a> so fans can get their daily fix without crossing the digital picket line.</p><p>The <a href="https://connections.swellgarfo.com/game/-OB15lz2phb8ai9RwufV">“Strike Edition” puzzle</a> was made on a website that lets people create their own <em>Connections. </em>The workers, part of the New York Times Tech Guild, specifically asked <em>NYT</em> readers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/474209/new-york-times-strike-wordle-connections">not to play <em>NYT</em> games</a> when the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24287600/new-york-times-tech-guild-strike-before-presidential-election">strike began on Monday</a>, so the custom puzzle<em> </em>offers a way to play while still respecting the Guild’s wishes.</p><p>“We have seen a groundswell of support from subscribers who have been proudly tweeting about purposely breaking their game streaks to support our strikers,” says Jen Sheehan, spokesperson for the NewsGuild&nbsp;of New York.</p><p>The Guild didn’t make the website themselves; the site was made by Anthony Salazar, a freelance web developer who operates a creative studio named <a href="https://swellgarfo.com/">Swellgarfo</a>. Salazar tells <em>The Verge </em>that he made the app after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/26/crosswords/new-game-connections.html"><em>Connections</em> launched</a> last summer. “My friends couldn’t get enough and began making their own grids, jankly texting group chats with 4x4 word squares,” he says. Programming the site took about two hours. He didn’t expect anyone besides his friends to use it, but the creator tool has now been used 7 million times.</p><p>“I wasn’t aware that the Tech Guild was using my app, but I’m honored,” Salazar says.</p><p>There are aspects of the website that it’s easy to imagine <em>The New York Times </em>could take issue with, though. In addition to custom puzzles, the site also has a recreation of the <a href="https://connections.swellgarfo.com/archive"><em>NYT Connections</em> archive</a> that’s available to play for free — offering a way to get around <em>NYT’s</em> own <em>Connections</em> archive that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24260742/now-you-can-suffer-through-old-connections-puzzles">just launched</a> as a feature for paid subscribers.</p><p><em>The New York Times </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094234/ny-times-wordle-clones-files-dmca-copyright-takedowns-knockoffs">targeted <em>Wordle</em> clones by filing copyright takedown notices</a> earlier this year, including against at least one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240306172335/https://github.com/cwackerfuss/reactle">shared on GitHub</a> that was strikingly similar to the <em>NYT’s</em> version of the game. It’s not out of the realm of possibility that the publication would do something similar for this <em>Connections</em> site.</p><p>Salazar says he would “happily take down the archive” if asked. He also says that the site uses the <em>NYT’s</em> publicly available API to create the archive, so “there would be many easy ways to completely dismantle that part of my app without even talking to me.” However, Salazar says that he wouldn’t take down the puzzle creator because “there is no <em>NYT</em> intellectual property contained there.”</p><p>The Guild, whose members help build these games, ultimately sees it as a form of support. “What we posted today and will post throughout our strike are fun ways people can support us,” says Sheehan, the NewsGuild spokesperson. “Generally speaking, we hope that <em>The Times</em> is more focused on getting back to the bargaining table than coming for our games.”</p><p><em>The New York Times</em> didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>How often do you make an uninformed purchasing decision regarding video games? Many people wait for reviews—critic and user reviews—before buying a full-price game. Some people refuse to pay the full price. They’ll want for a sale in six to twelve months. But sometimes, you can’t help but play on day one. So, let’s explore a few notable Planet Coaster 2 reviews, many of which offer varying opinions on the theme park management game from Frontier Developments!</p>



<h2 id="h-planet-coaster-2-reviews-paint-a-vivid-picture">Planet Coaster 2 Reviews Paint a Vivid Picture</h2>



<p>If you look on the Planet Coaster 2 Metacritic, you’ll find the park management game currently sits at a ‘Generally Favorable’ score of 82, following 14 critic reviews since its launch on November 6 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. There are notable game reviews from IGN, PC Gamer, TheGamer, and plenty of other outlets that spent a bit of time with the title pre-launch. Here’s a rundown to help you decide whether it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/planet-coaster-2-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worth paying full price</a>!</p>







<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/planet-coaster-2-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Despite how much I enjoy the act of building my ideal park, the original Planet Coaster was neither challenging nor interesting as a management tycoon game, and that has unfortunately not changed. Even after messing with the difficulty settings, of which there are several, I found it almost mindlessly simple to generate infinite money with a small number of flat rides and a high entry fee.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/planet-coaster-2-review-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Overall, Planet Coaster 2 feels like a natural evolution of the first game. Lessons have been learned, features added, mechanics improved, and the customisation of difficulty across the board – career mode has flexible difficulty levels which can be set on a per-scenario basis – really helps tailor the game to your level of experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/planet-coaster-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Structurally, Planet Coaster 2 differs little from the first. You can fix and fiddle with partially built parks in career mode, or construct your own from scratch in variations upon the sandbox. These include unrestrained creativity where money and space are no object, and the more moderated Challenge mode where at least some management skills are required.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/planet-coaster-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 is an ambitious sequel that expands sideways upon the foundation laid by its predecessor. The graphics are stunning, the water slide additions are fun, and the creative potential is immense, but it comes at a cost. The complexity of infrastructure systems interrupts the creative flow, making the impressively customizable experience feel unnecessarily convoluted at times.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/142057/planet-coaster-2-review-score" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShackNews</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>While I was playing Planet Coaster 2 for this review, I kept thinking about RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. Frontier Developments’ initial crack at theme park building and management simulation shares many ideas with their latest attempt. Tinkering with rollercoasters and waterparks in 2024 conjured a sort of nostalgia for this kind of game I didn’t think I’d have. And so, with a heavy heart, I tell you that they got me again.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/planet-coaster-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameGrin</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Planet Coaster 2</em>&nbsp;is one of the pinnacles of the theme park simulator genre and while it doesn’t have a smooth learning curve for newcomers, it’s safe to say that those who have already mastered its systems will enjoy it immensely, with the ability to create anything you want the way you like it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re already paying for Xbox Game Pass monthly, doesn’t it make sense to check out every new release to see if it’s available? Why would you spend extra to check out a new game? Unfortunately, it feels like it’s becoming rare for day-one releases on Game Pass. For example, will we see Planet Coaster 2 on Game Pass? It’s likely, but not yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-planet-coaster-2-on-xbox-game-pass">Is Planet Coaster 2 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p>As of this writing, <strong>Planet Coaster 2 is not yet available on Xbox Game Pass</strong>. Could it happen? Sure! Developer Frontier launched the original Planet Coaster on day one on Game Pass, but they only announced its inclusion 24 hours before launch day. We didn’t get the same notification for its sequel, though. A quick look through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-titles-november-2024-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current Game Pass catalog reveals</a> that, unfortunately, the theme park management sim isn’t available to download for subscribers.</p>



<p>Sadly, the original Planet Coaster is no longer available on Xbox Game Pass. To enjoy Frontier’s unique and colorful management franchise, you must buy a copy. After spending an hour with it after lunch on launch day, I can tell you the sequel is much-improved and genuinely entertaining!</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-play-planet-coaster-2-right-now">How to Play Planet Coaster 2 Right Now</h2>



<p>If you can’t wait to get your hands on Planet Coaster 2—I can’t blame you—then you can buy a copy on:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a></li>



<li><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP2377-PPSA19633_00-PLANETCOASTER200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/planet-coaster-2/9PK5WS0HXQKQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Store</a></li>
</ul>



<p>There is currently no word on whether the theme park construction and management game will release on Xbox Game Pass, and it appears rather unlikely for now, but at $49.99 for the standard edition, it’s worth the asking price. Most people who fall in love with these types of games tend to enjoy them for hundreds of hours over the years, especially once DLC and mod support really kicks off!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-planet-coaster-2-worth-the-money">Is Planet Coaster 2 Worth the Money?</h2>



<p>I won’t go into a full-length review of Planet Coaster 2 here, but after spending a little time with it, I can offer first impressions. As someone who spent hundreds of hours playing the original Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo from developer Frontier, I think the sequel to the theme park game is a vastly improved and fun experience overall. </p>



<p>For the most part, the building felt far more intuitive and freeform, allowing me to move and resize entire setpieces to my liking and tweak minute details easily. So, if you lean heavily into freeform and creative construction, you’ll love Planet Coaster 2.</p>



<p>Just be wary of the copious amounts of DLC likely on its way for the game!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-dev-diary-provides-info-on-fashion-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you're going to be a blood-sucker, you at least want to be fashionable when you do it. In a new dev diary released by The Chinese Room and Paradox Interactive, they've teamed up to discuss how fashion plays a part in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. Each clan has its own set of styles that make it easily identifiable when speaking to them or exploring the streets of Seattle.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-character-trailer-shows-off-the-kindred-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/">four base clans</a> of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 each have their own unique style to represent personality, history, and subcultures through their fashion. When creating the fashion in the game, they wanted to make sure that they were offering players "a variety of styles to suit their tastes."&nbsp; Not only did they make sure that there were different outfits for the Protagonist, but they also made sure that the Foley was fairly attributed to the outfit, with the sounds of shoes or the rustling of clothes. For example, "creating a more stealth-like feeling or the aggressive presence that one might expect between Banu Haqim vs Brujah," says Lead Audio Designer Tessa Verplancke.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Additionally, making sure that outfits matter in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, characters are also able to judge their outfits, such as interactions you have with Tolly. This is shown in a brief clip on the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-fashion-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paradox Interactive website</a>.</p>
<p>As the protagonist in this game, clothing matters because of the sound it can make. For example, if you want to feed on the right Blood Resonance, you need to make sure that you're wearing clothes that fit the mood of the person you're approaching.</p>
<p>"Just knowing that the angry sex worker nearby is full of choleric blood and ready for a fight is just step one. Step two is making sure that you're wearing something that will push them over the edge and really make that blood boil. Dressing and acting like a wealthy John could get them talking, but if you approach looking like someone who likes it rough? That might scare them right out of their angry mood, and then all that delicious choleric potential goes away," says Senior Narrative Designer Arone LeBray.</p>
<p>This dev diary is now the 21st diary released by Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room, providing a wealth of information about the importance of character customization and making sure you know how to dress appropriately for the occasion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289674/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-backward-compatibility<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Nintendo’s next console is going to have a kickass library of games to start. Last night, when there was absolutely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289558/in-case-you-missed-it">nothing else of note happening in the world</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">Nintendo announced that its still-unannounced Switch successor would be backward-compatible with existing Switch games</a>. The announcement is an early sign that Nintendo might be able to avoid the painful transition between consoles and better unify its growing ambitions.</p></div><p>Backward compatibility is not a guarantee of success. The Wii U could play most Wii games, and it still ended up being a failure. But it’s a feature that benefits both consumers and the industry at large. In Nintendo’s case, its inclusion was never a sure thing. While bestselling hardware like the Wii and DS were able to play games from their predecessors, Nintendo often started over from scratch with a new console generation — which meant that players did, too.</p><p>The library of games you had built up over the lifespan of the Nintendo 64 or SNES stayed with that console. This is what has allowed Nintendo to resell <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> across countless devices; if you want to play the classics on the newest console, you usually have no choice but to buy it again. Otherwise, you’re forced to keep a Wii U around in order to enjoy that copy of <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD</em>. It sucks for consumers and it sucks for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23850347/video-game-preservation">video game preservation</a>, given how quickly older titles can become inaccessible.</p><p>Backward compatibility for the Switch is especially notable given what an incredible library it has accumulated. In fact, while the Switch is Nintendo’s second-bestselling piece of hardware, it has sold more games than any other Nintendo platform. During <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">an investor presentation</a>, the company said that the Switch’s “cumulative software sales have reached 1.3061 billion units, setting a new record for a Nintendo gaming platform. More software has been played on Nintendo Switch than on any other Nintendo hardware.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>That’s not a surprise when you think about the games that have come out since 2017: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a>, and a whole lot of <em>Pokémon</em>. Ironically, the Switch was helped in a way by its lack of backward compatibility; Nintendo was able to keep up a steady stream of releases by putting out a number of Wii U ports. The Switch’s bestselling game is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/1/23941695/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-6-dlc-tracks-release-date-characters">an enhanced version of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a>.</p></div><p>The decision to support backward compatibility means that all of those games will immediately be available to anyone who picks up the next console. For existing Switch owners, it imbues their collection with more value; for newcomers, it means they have a huge library to dive into from the jump.</p><div><p>The decision also helps explain why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24185022/nintendo-switch-2024-game-lineup-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Nintendo has barely slowed down with releases, even as the Switch approaches the end of its life</a>. The first-party games that came out in 2024 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24287092/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112407/princess-peach-showtime-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Princess Peach: Showtime</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> — will likely have a lifespan well beyond the final years of the Switch. That’s also why there are still more big Switch games in the works, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em></a>. Nintendo is even making services that exist beyond a single console, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions">the just-launched Nintendo Music streaming app</a>.</p></div><p>Signs have been pointing to this kind of more unified Nintendo for some time. The company’s account system links together various services and games, and more than a decade ago, Nintendo merged its console and portable game development divisions so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17478950/nintendo-switch-structure-success-shinya-takahashi-interview">that everyone was focused on the Switch</a>. It has created more cohesiveness across the company’s offerings, which has become increasingly important <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">as Nintendo branches out in new directions</a>. This has led to at least one sensible decision that sets up the Switch’s successor for a strong start — now we wait to see what oddball decision will make the new console distinctly “Nintendo.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead of a linear campaign, you select a squad of fighters, choose a region, and then progress through random map encounters until you get to a boss fight.</p><p>On the battlefield, fighters like Eri, Fio, and Marco each have unique equipment and skills that can be improved and customized throughout a run. Unlike traditional grid-based strategy games, most attacks happen along a straight line from where the character is currently stationed, making positioning, terrain, and elevation key factors in whether a fight goes your way or not. </p><figure id="" data-id="8430624a57c37f35886e60eb191b5235" data-recommend-id="image://8430624a57c37f35886e60eb191b5235" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A GIF shows a synergy combo in Metal Slug Tactics.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Harkening back to <em>Metal Slug</em>’s original 2D side-scrolling shooter incarnations, your characters accrue a bonus called “adrenaline” as they move around the battlefield. It grants additional advantages and buffs, rewarding versatile and aggressive play rather than just sitting back and turtling. Synergy abilities, meanwhile, let nearby allies join in follow-up combo attacks to press the advantage. </p><p>The result is combat that requires you to think on your feet and adapt to the situation at hand instead of devising a strategy ahead of time and just worrying about the execution. Combined with slick, retro pixel art and a solid soundtrack, the overall <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> experience feels tight, rewarding, and well-balanced between thoughtfully teasing out solutions to the combat puzzles at hand and keeping the action moving with quick missions and straightforward objectives.</p><figure id="" data-id="3ff8857c4603aea8aaa1cbdcac163390" data-recommend-id="image://3ff8857c4603aea8aaa1cbdcac163390" data-format="png" data-width="1137" data-height="631" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An upgrade menu screen uses incredibly tiny text.

While the finished <em>Metal Slug Tactics </em>mostly lives up to the gorgeous trailers fans <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-slug-tactics-is-metal-slug-but-with-turn-based-t-1847076096&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-slug-tactics-is-metal-slug-but-with-turn-based-t-1847076096">have been gawking at for years</a></span>, there are some real shortcomings. I’ve been playing on PlayStation 5 (it’s also on Game Pass), where I’ve experienced both a frustrating amount of stuttering on the performance end and, even worse, some really poorly optimized UI and font sizes on the quality-of-life side.</p><p>Most games nowadays feel designed with a PC monitor a couple of feet from your face in mind when it comes to screen layout and the size of features like action menus and text boxes. Even starting at that baseline, however, <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> was particularly painful to try and read and navigate from a living room setup, even when I moved within five feet of my TV. Checking through Steam and various subreddits, I’ve seen complaints specifically about font sizes and readability for the Switch and PC versions cropping up as well.</p><p>Both the shaky performance and miserable UI (I really wish the UI and fonts weren’t such a headache to decipher on console) can probably be fixed with post-launch patches, but the missing polish and strained eyes are hard to ignore. The rest of <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> is a compelling, if not super deep, retro roguelike strategy experience that’s worth checking out for fans of <em>Metal Slug</em> and games like <em>Into the Breach</em> alike—especially if the team behind the game can get the other issues worked out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unlike Valve's Steam controller, which featured uncommon inputs like dual trackpads instead of thumbsticks, Hori's controller features a traditional controller design. It has all the expected face buttons, shoulder bumpers, triggers, a D-pad, and two thumbsticks that are offset like those on Xbox and Nintendo Switch Pro controllers.</p><p dir="ltr">While the Wireless Horipad for Steam looks like a standard controller, it offers a few extra features you won't find on your typical third-party Windows gamepad--for example, the inclusion of the Steam Deck's Options and Quick Access Menu, which lets you call up and navigate Steam's various Big Picture Mode menus.</p><p dir="ltr">The Steam Horipad also has four additional remappable buttons--two on the front and two back paddles--trigger locks with two stop points, and support for gyro controls and turbo mode. Sadly, there is no rumble functionality, and the thumbsticks lack anti-drift Hall Effect sensors that are becoming more common on third-party controllers--but they do feature touch sensitivity, just like the thumbsticks on a Steam Deck.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">As noted above, the Wireless Horipad for Steam works wirelessly on Windows and Steam Deck, with an estimated 12-hour battery life. This mode uses Steam's proprietary SteamInput controller driver to allow for the Steam-specific functionality, but there's also a Windows-only X-Input mode that is usable over a wired USB connection if you want to play non-Steam games on PC. Windows users will also be able to adjust controller settings like thumbstick sensitivity and button mapping using Hori's desktop app.</p><p dir="ltr">The Wireless Horipad for Steam will cost $60 at launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24289524/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-pc-ps5-xbox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>At one point in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271682/life-is-strange-double-exposure-preview"><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em></a>’s third episode, Max Caulfield tried to discuss the well-being of a student named Reggie with Loretta, another student on campus. Loretta became somewhat bewildered, asking Max who exactly she was referring to. That was when Max realized, much to her chagrin, that she had gotten the two parallel realities of Loretta mixed up. Turns out, one Loretta has met Reggie, but the other hasn’t. (Don’t ask me which; I can’t remember offhand, either.)</p><p>This moment is emblematic of how rapidly <em>Double Exposure</em> flits between its two universes. There’s the “Living World,” in which her best friend Safi was alive, and the “Dead World” where she wasn’t. Several puzzles in the game follow this trajectory: to circumvent certain obstacles when investigating Safi’s death, Max would tear a massive rift into the other reality to gather information she would otherwise not be privy to or grab some useful object as if pulling off a magician’s hat trick before returning to the first.</p><p>While this gimmick is a nifty mechanic that adds a fascinating dimension to Max’s sleuthing,&nbsp;it can also get confusing and tedious, especially as events are spun off in wildly different directions. Even Max’s fastidious note-taking does little to assuage this frustration. Ultimately, while the power does offer a look into the otherwise unseen facets of Max’s life, it’s also troublesome as a mechanic, at times reducing interactions to fetch quests.</p><p><em>This piece contains spoilers about&nbsp;</em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure, <em>its finale, and the first </em>Life is Strange<em>.</em></p><p>This tedium is why, as Max shuttles back and forth between the two realities with the flourish of a seasoned illusionist, there’s a sense that her inner turmoil is only growing. Her interactions vary between realities, and so do the myriad events that take place, leaving ripples in the way her relationships develop between universes. For instance, Max is close friends with the school’s administrative assistant in one universe but merely acquaintances in another. It’s no wonder she often engages in moments of quietude and self-reflection, such as pondering her decision to bombard a friend with relentless questions or ruminating over the dirty laundry of a disgraced colleague.</p><p>Thus it’s no surprise that as Max starts using her powers more, <em>Double Exposure </em>picks up from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271682/life-is-strange-double-exposure-preview">the largely languid pace of the first two episodes</a>. The melodrama has significantly ramped up from episode two’s astonishing cliffhanger, with major twists hinted at and then audaciously delivered with a sleight of hand. While it’s easy for these to become contrived, and for <em>Double Exposure</em> to lose the emotional core of its tale — that is, the game’s smaller, more tender moments of affection — <em>Double Exposure</em> hardly falters, persisting without drowning in these bombastic reveals.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is that Max is learning to live with her grief from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up">the first game</a>. Small yet crucial choices, such as retaliating against a self-absorbed colleague by interrupting his class, using her supernatural powers to unravel clues, and even choosing which love interest to kiss (or none at all), paint a portrait of Max’s identity. Then there’s the pivotal scenario in which Max is seemingly confronted with the prospect of making yet another impossible decision but realizing that she can simply choose not to choose at all. <em>Double Exposure</em> is also at its most confident narratively when it’s chronicling her growth, with the game deftly bringing together the grandiose plot twists and the quieter, more intimate scenes with incredible sentiment.</p><p>But the final episode is where <em>Double Exposure</em> seems to run out of space for such ruminations. Episode five is eventually reduced to a series of rooms, with Max simply jogging from one door to the next to rescue the cast from their ghastly predicament. Familiar artifacts from her past life in Arcadia Bay, like the steel chair used by her ex-professor Jefferson, resurface, creating the macabre quality of a strange lucid dream sequence. A massive bowling alley mascot leers menacingly at Max as she struggles to break out of her restraints again. Binders full of photographs — the centerpiece of Jefferson’s twisted portfolio — taunt Max into perusing them once more. It’s a throwback to Max’s meltdown in the final episode of the original <em>Life is Strange</em>, but it felt like such an obligatory nod that it was more repetitive than inventive.</p><p>More disappointing still is that, in its conclusion, <em>Double Exposure</em> has opted to clumsily reconstruct the series — one beloved for exploring the emotional depths of everyday life — into a sci-fi story featuring a cast of troubled superheroic teens. It fails to understand that these powers, like Daniel’s telekinetic abilities in <em>Life is Strange 2,</em> are merely a lens with which to examine the anxieties of life at a heightened level. Without a stronger emotional hook, this development feels like a ham-fisted attempt to expand <em>Life is Strange</em> into an endlessly repeatable formula, set in another cinematic universe. A bigger failure is how Max is being established as the face of this new direction, with the credits announcing that “Max Caulfield Will Return.” </p><p>Perhaps an ending where Max gets a reprieve from the slew of misfortunes that the world seems to enjoy hurling at her is too idealistic. After all, reality can be just as perverse for the rest of us. But the idea that <em>Life is Strange</em> will present Max’s powers as somehow extraordinary feels a bit discordant. This isn’t the conclusion that <em>Double Exposure</em> deserves.</p><p><small><em>All episodes of </em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure<em> are available now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Workers at the French gaming studio Don't Nod--the developers behind Jusant, Life is Strange 1 and 2, and upcoming release Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage--are set to strike this week due to imminent layoffs. The <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/10/dont-nod-call-for-strike-on-friday-november-8th/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">STJV</a> (Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo, "Video Games Workers Union") announced that the picket line will be next to the studio's headquarters in Paris.</p><p>Last week, the union called for a strike due to the 69 jobs at the studio that are at risk. Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert explained that a new initiative was designed for a "reorganization project to ensure the company's long-term future" amid "deteriorating" financial results.</p><p>"Our half-year results for 2024 reflect the economic underperformance of our latest release, despite solid ratings on Metacritic, as well as the accounting impact of the decisions we had to take. The initial performance support measures announced last spring no longer seem sufficient to maintain the company's competitiveness," Guilbert said <a href="https://www.actusnews.com/en/dontnod/pr/2024/10/16/2024-half-year-results" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in a statement</a>.</p><p>"As a result, today we presented a reorganization project to the employee representative bodies, which could set Don't Nod on a new development trajectory," he added. "I am fully conscious of the impact this project may have on all our employees. Securing our company's resources and restoring its ability to perform more in an increasingly competitive and selective industry is extremely necessary."</p><p>STJV pointed out its demands and countered the statement with why the workers are striking and how it can be called off.</p><p>"We demand that management immediately give up on this irresponsible and unfair layoffs plan. We demand that the studio’s workers, who are the most competent people, have an actual say in all decision-making. We demand the presence of Oskar Guilbert in the negotiations, and that he takes full responsibility as CEO," it read. "This layoff plan is absurd, violent, and will not save our company. We therefore call on our colleagues to continue their mobilization with a one-day strike on Friday, November 8."</p><p>Despite having to pause productions of two future releases due to lackluster sales of both Juscant and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, Don't Nod <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-nod-pausing-two-projects-after-jusant-banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-flop/1100-6526667/" data-ref-id="1100-6526667">still has high hopes for Lost Records: Bloom and Rage</a>, out in February.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-spin-off-arcane-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-report-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Both seasons of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> spin-off Arcane cost a total of approximately $250m USD to create and promote, making it the most expensive animated series of all time.</p>
<p>That's according to a new report by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/riot-games-arcane-hollywood-netflix-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-1236196655/">Variety</a>, with sources telling the publication the $250m figure covered production and promotion costs for Arcane's two seasons, comprised of 18 episodes in total. The show's first nine episodes are said to have seen a production cost "north of $80m", while the second set of nine episodes - which will make up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">the show's final season</a> - reportedly had a production cost "approaching" the $100m mark.</p>
<p>Variety claims development costs were pushed up due to "a labour-intensive approach and frequent cost overruns triggered by delayed script deliveries after the second season was put into production with only a fraction of the season written".</p>

<p>In addition, League of Legends developer Riot reportedly spent $60m promoting the first season of the animated spin-off, which released on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> in 2021. Variety says this figure is more than other studios would ordinarily spend to promote a show they weren't distributing.</p><p>When the publication asked Riot about Arcane's price tag, Riot co-founder and chief product officer Marc Merrill said, "We're more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players' time." Merrill refrained from confirming or denying whether the reported $250m figure was accurate.</p>
<p>The Riot exec added the company's "ambitions in entertainment haven't changed" since Arcane's release. "We were never intending to operate like a traditional studio with traditional timelines," Merrill said. "What <em>did</em> change as we learned more was our expectations of ourselves: We realised that getting it right takes a lot more time than we'd originally expected, and so we recalibrated our development, output goals and teams with that in mind."</p>
<p>Arcane's second season is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-arcane-season-two-will-launch-in-november-2024">set to air on Netflix, starting 9th November</a>. As for season one, our Chris called it "a thrill, full of welcome colour and life" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-act-1-review-riots-glossy-animated-netflix-series-opens-with-a-striking-if-familiar-bang">Eurogamer's review</a> (which was based on the first four episodes), although he still had a few reservations. Following its debut, Arcane subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-league-of-legends-animated-show-arcane-wins-an-emmy-for-outstanding-animated-program">won the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As nearly a decade has passed since its release and Sony has yet to revisit the franchise with another game, some indie developers have taken it upon themselves to make their own Bloodborne games. The latest unofficial Bloodborne game in development, Bloodborne: Top Down Arena, gives the title a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-games-like-diablo/2900-4750/" data-ref-id="2900-4750">Diablo-like action-RPG</a> makeover. While the project is far from finished, the game's creator, Maxime Foulquier, has posted a video that shows the gameplay in action.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853835793388953662" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>HUNTERS! I haven't touched Bloodborne Remake for a year for 50 reasons (too big, too risky to finally be C&amp;D).</p><p> But last week I decided to start a new project from scratch, Bloodborne Top Down Arena<br>Maybe you won't like it, but I'm enjoying developing it and playing it 😂 <a href="https://t.co/OPont0sS45" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/OPont0sS45</a></p></div>  — Maxime Foulquier (@MaximFoulquier) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853835793388953662?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>As Foulquier noted in the tweet above, he originally had more ambitious plans to remake Bloodborne before he abandoned that out of fear of getting a cease-and-desist from Sony. The video features the Hunter fighting a few enemies, and it makes Bloodborne seem well suited for an entire game in this format.</p><p>Foulquier also <a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853834672347758739" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared his belief</a> that Bloodborne: Top Down Arena is different enough from the original Bloodborne to escape a takedown notice from Sony. That's why he doesn't plan to release it on Steam. He also acknowledged that another fan creation, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloodborne-kart-is-releasing-soon-with-a-new-legally-distinct-name/1100-6522387/" data-ref-id="1100-6522387">Bloodborne Kart</a>, had to be delayed and completely reworked to avoid legal consequences from Sony. However, keeping the Bloodborne name on his own game may only invite Sony's lawyers to go after Foulquier as well.</p><p>Until Sony gets back around to Bloodborne, fan content may be the only way to get anything new. One of the most intriguing fan-made projects is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-graceborne-mod-brings-bloodborne-to-the-lands-between/1100-6524641/" data-ref-id="1100-6524641">Graceborne</a>, an Elden Ring mod that brings elements that originated in From Software's previous title into the developer's current franchise. That title is currently in its alpha stage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-cs2-ranks-how-to-get-global-elite/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It is no secret that CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) is one of the biggest esports out there. Even after its predecessor, CS:GO, handed the game the torch, Counter-Strike has continued to thrive. But do you know of all the ranks in CS2 competitive?</p>



<p>Here are all the CS2 ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-cs2-ranks">CS2 Ranks</h2>



<p>CS2 ranks fall under a much more complicated system than many other games. To heavily reward players, ranks are not thrown around lightly within the shooter. With 18 ranks as a whole, CS2 has one of the most immersive and impressive ranking systems.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-cs2-ranks">All CS2 Ranks:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Silver 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver Elite Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Distinguished Master Guardian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legendary Eagle</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legendary Eagle Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Supreme Master First Class</strong></li>



<li><strong>Global Elite</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While these are the traditional CS2 ranks, the game also has Premiere Mode, which is a more popular ranked system. </p>







<h2 id="h-all-counter-strike-2-premiere-mode-ranks">All Counter-Strike 2 Premiere Mode Ranks</h2>



<p>Premiere mode, unlike regular CS2 ranked, requires players to pick and vote on maps to ban before competing. After winning 10 placements in Premiere, you will be given a rating, which is a bit different from the system in the game’s traditional ranked mode.</p>



<p><strong>Here are all Premiere mode ranks in CS2 compared to the game’s traditional ranks:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1,000 – 7,501 (Gray):</strong> Equivalent to Silver Elite Master</li>



<li><strong>7,502 – 11,831 (Light Blue):</strong> Equivalent to Gold Nova 1 to Gold Nova Master</li>



<li><strong>11,832 – 14,998 (Dark Blue):</strong> Equivalent to Master Guardian to Master Guardian Elite</li>



<li><strong>14,999 – 18,401 (Light Purple):</strong> Equivalent to Distinguished Master Guardian to Legendary Eagle Master</li>



<li><strong>18,402 – 19,999 (Purple):</strong> Equivalent to Supreme Master First Class</li>



<li><strong>20,000+ (Dark Purple):</strong> Equivalent to the Global Elite</li>
</ul>



<p>The Counter-Strike Premiere mode is much more focused on points than it is on actual ranks. Still, though, players should be striving to hit Dark Purple, which is the equivalent to Global Elite in the game’s regular ranking system.</p>



<p>To rank up, simply winning matches will skyrocket you through the ranked system, but beware, the competition will be extremely difficult later on, as CS2 has a much more precise competitive base than other games.</p>



<p>What rank are you in Counter-Strike 2?</p>

One of Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness' big innovations back in 1995 was its focus on naval and airborne combat, and the leaked internal alpha includes artwork showcasing a human warship sailing on a stormy sea.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4395489-warcraft2remasteredleakedart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395489" data-ratio="1.3333333333333" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4395489-warcraft2remasteredleakedart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395489"></a><figcaption>Leaked artwork for Warcraft 2: Remastered, via Wowhead.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4395489-warcraft2remasteredleakedart.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Blizzard is currently gearing up for the Warcraft franchise's 30th anniversary, and will be hosting a livestream on November 13 to celebrate. The developer has stated the stream will have "something for everyone," including fans of the old Warcraft strategy games. There is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2024-canceled-but-blizzard-has-big-warcraft-plans-in-store/1100-6522953/" data-ref-id="1100-6522953">no BlizzCon this year</a>, so fans are expecting some big announcements normally reserved for Blizzard's annual fan convention to instead be made during the 30th anniversary-stream.</p><p dir="ltr">That certainly makes it seem like Warcraft 2: Remastered will be announced during the livestream, but Blizzard so far has not officially announced the game. It wouldn't be the first classic Blizzard title to receive the remaster treatment, with Blizzard having previously remastered the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-20">StarCraft</a> in 2017 as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-798">Diablo 2</a> in 2021 as Diablo 2: Resurrected.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard also, infamously, remastered one of the most beloved RTS games of all time with 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-iii-reforged/" data-ref-id="5000-504202">Warcraft 3: Reforged</a>. Often hailed as Blizzard's first "bad game," the remaster for many fans wasn't what was originally promised, and in many ways felt like a step down from the original Warcraft 3. The reception to Warcraft 3: Reforged was so bad that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-expands-refund-requests-for-warcraft-3-re/1100-6473492/" data-ref-id="1100-6473492">Blizzard offered "no-questions asked" refunds</a>, with a later report stating the game was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-3-reforged-a-victim-of-mismanagement-pressure-from-activision-and-budget-cuts-report/1100-6494287/" data-ref-id="1100-6494287">victim of budget cuts and mismanagement</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">There is evidence to suggest Blizzard may be giving Warcraft 3: Reforged a redo as well. A Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-might-be-floating-a-warcraft-3-reforged-relaunch/1100-6510801/" data-ref-id="1100-6510801">survey asking players about a potential Reforged relaunch</a> last year generated headlines. Last month, the game's public test realm servers briefly showed an unannounced 2.0 build before being removed several hours later, but nothing has been officially announced.</p><p dir="ltr">Not content to wait for an official Blizzard remaster, fans have already taken to updating Warcraft 2 for the modern age. One fan project, called Warcraft: Chronicles of War, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/impressive-warcraft-2-fan-remake-using-warcraft-3-reforged-is-available-now/1100-6520147/" data-ref-id="1100-6520147">reimagines Warcraft 2 using Warcraft 3: Reforged's engine</a>. Its Horde campaign is currently playable for free for those who already own Reforged.</p><p dir="ltr">As fans wait for more news during the 30th anniversary-livestream, Blizzard has offered a number of ways to celebrate the franchise across its various games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-world-of-warcraft-crossover-will-let-players-fight-for-the-horde-or-alliance/1100-6526485/" data-ref-id="1100-6526485">Warcraft-themed skins in Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's latest update is almost entirely centered around the game's 20th anniversary, letting players tackle "Timewalking" versions of original WoW dungeons and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-bringing-back-its-most-iconic-armor-sets-for-massive-20th-anniversary-update/1100-6526277/" data-ref-id="1100-6526277">earn updated versions of some of the game's most iconic armor sets</a>.</p>

            <p>
Sorry, lovers of hats on pets; <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has warned players to stop adorning their fluffy friends with fancy headwear, as doing so currently appears to be causing performance drops in the latest version of the farm life sim.
</p>
<p>
The ability to put hats on pets is, of course, arguably the most significant feature to be added to Stardew Valley (or indeed any game ever) as part of this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">chunky 1.6 update</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-latest-update-adds-a-new-friend-to-retrieve-lost-items-and-more">mobile and consoles</a>. But, unfortunately, it seems the ensuing cuteness overload is proving just too much for the game to handle behind the scenes.
</p>
<p>
Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853889827294650577">shared the news</a> in a post on social media, telling players, "If you are experiencing performance issues in Stardew Valley 1.6, remove all hats from pets." There's probably a very sensible, serious technical reason for the performance drop, but because this is Stardew Valley, fans have demanded an official in-game lore explanation for the sudden required removal of pet hats, and Barone has <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853890739413082199">happily obliged</a>.

"There's rumours of a strange rash affecting pets' ears in Zuzu City," Barone explained, "and we just want to make sure those ears can breath for a few days." Thankfully, pets won't be permanently denied their adorable headwear and Barone has promised, "We will address the problem as soon as possible."

Hat-related performance drops are far from the only bug to emerge following Stardew Valley's 1.6 update on consoles and mobile, but it's so far the most amusing, even in a game where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-blames-missing-chicken-bug-on-a-pesky-wild-coyote-running-amuck">chickens are suddenly vanishing en masse</a>. But the good news is fixes are in the works - and mobile players can even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-on-mobile-now-includes-a-secret-experimental-multiplayer-mode-unlocked-with-the-konami-code">try out a (no longer) secret multiplayer mode</a> while they wait.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-2-remaster-leaked-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>remaster may have just been leaked ahead of a major celebration for the franchise's 30th anniversary, which is due to take place next week.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gkkzj1/warcraft_2_remastered_internal_alpha_leaked_via/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Redditor Neggy5</a>, a <a href="https://blizztrack.com/view/w2rd?type=versions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new listing on tracking site BlizzTrack</a>, which monitors changes in the backend of the company's Battle.net service, points to the existence of an internal alpha test for something called&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2: Remastered</em>.</p>

<p>All things considered, it's pretty difficult to imagine that this is anything other than a reworked modern version of the seminal 1995 RTS, which was originally titled&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-2-remaster-leak-original-shot.jpg?itok=PEyMoc8Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-2-remaster-leak-original-shot.jpg?itok=Eas5tPeJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A remaster of classic 1995 RTS&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>could be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>The listing gives practically nothing away, as you might imagine, but it does potentially confirm the existence of a remaster that may well be announced during next week's celebration.</p>

<p>According to the Redditor who discovered the listing, an upcoming update for the controversial&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 3: Reforged&nbsp;</em>was also discovered on the BlizzTrack website, so it seems that Blizzard's attempts to redeem that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-3-reforged-developer-update-does-little-to-satisfy-irate-fans">ill-received rework</a> also continue, although the nature of said update hasn't been revealed.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that none of this has officially been confirmed; this could well just be an experimental attempt on Blizzard's part to go through options rather than a confirmation that something concrete is in the works.</p>

<p>Still, the timing of this leak seems pretty serendipitous with the&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>anniversary stream due to air next week, so I wouldn't be surprised if a&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>announcement was officially made at that point.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-blizzard.jpg?itok=ScnB5hX3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-blizzard.jpg?itok=wGY516Vx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blizzard recently released&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>The War Within</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>anniversary stream airs a few months after Blizzard released&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em>, the tenth major expansion for the long-running MMORPG, which launched back in August.</p>

<p>It's also arriving after developers on said MMO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union">formed Blizzard's first wall-to-wall union</a> back in July, which essentially means said union represents the entire studio rather than a single unit within the company.</p>

Here, the <em>only</em> way to add new cards to your deck is to engage with systems that endlessly encourage you to spend real-world money within the app, on top of an array of other systems that peter out just before you’re done, unless you fork out. And when it comes to <em>Pokémon</em>, that feels <em>wrong</em>.</p><p>I’m a fool, but not <em>that</em> big of a fool. I get why free-to-play mobile games are designed to encourage their users to spend money. These products are not charities, they’re businesses, and this is a model that has proven to be enormously lucrative. Exploitative, controversial, and in some countries even illegal, but undeniably successful.

If you want to compare it to the video games world, the next largest property is <em>Mario</em> at a measly $57 billion. There’s a reason this property, primarily focused on children and those who loved it as children, can afford to run <em>TCG Live</em> for free. And, of course, this total was estimated before The Pokémon Company ever dipped its toes in the toxic waters of gacha gaming. What I’m saying is, while any corporation always wants infinitely more money, <em>Pocket</em> isn’t a last-gasp attempt to survive from a struggling business. It’s not an essential move to calm bailing shareholders. It’s just a pure act of astonishing greed aimed at children.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974"><em>Pokémon</em> Fan Calculates How Long It Will Take To Collect Every Card In <em>TCG Pocket</em></a></span></p><p>There’s a version of <em>Pocket</em> that could have existed and would have made sense from The Pokémon Company, co-owned by Nintendo, Creatures Inc., and Game Freak. It’s a stripped-down, <em>Marvel Snap</em>-like card game with an option to pay for a battle pass. And that’s it. It’d make a <em>fortune</em>. As it is, this new app offers a Premium Pass that looked like it was going to be a battle pass equivalent for a rather pricey $10 a month. It’s there. Beyond that, all the other systems could have been powered by in-game actions. It’d be a great solution for an IP aimed at kids, while also loved by adults; like <em>Fortnite</em>, if your kid really gets into it, buy them a Premium Pass to enjoy it even more. Buy yourself one. Go wild.</p><p>Instead, what we really have is an app that’s been built from the ground up to exploit its players, building gambling loops where real-world money can be spent on opening sealed packs in the hope of scoring rare rewards.</p><p> This is no better underlined by the game’s only imposed limit on spending, which it says will prevent players from using more than 750 Poké Gold a day to open packs. That amount of Gold would cost $120 per day. That’s where this app draws the line. And there are no options to add your own personalized spending limits to help protect those prone to overspending or getting hooked—surely the most basic good-faith offering that should be in place. </p><h2 id="h7785"><a id=""></a>From training to draining</h2><figure id="" data-id="8857ee1334e5441e44062a1439a7ff33" data-recommend-id="image://8857ee1334e5441e44062a1439a7ff33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A selection of cards available in Pocket, on a blue background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A selection of cards available in Pocket, on a blue background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8857ee1334e5441e44062a1439a7ff33" data-recommend-id="image://8857ee1334e5441e44062a1439a7ff33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A selection of cards available in Pocket, on a blue background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, there is absolutely and unequivocally a legitimate way to enjoy <em>Pocket</em> without spending any money.

(It’s impossible not to add that if you’re used to the full version of the TCG, it’s oddly frustrating to have such a repetitive deck, no Stadium cards, and so few Trainers and Tools.) So yes, it is possible to play <em>Pocket</em> for free. It’s just that’s clearly not what’s intended.</p><p>In fact, to even be able to access the battles, you’re <em>forced</em> to go through all of the loops that’ll eventually be suggesting you pay real money. You must go through tutorials that have you opening pack after pack after pack, picking Wonder Picks, and displaying your favorite cards for others before the tab to take part in battles unlocks. Even then, you’re dragged through an unskippable series of tiny tutorials, where with each step you complete you just so happen to be rewarded more of those Pack Hourglasses that reduce the time before you can open another pack.</p><p>You’re then given all these Missions–small tasks to complete of an incidental nature, some triggered by competing in battles–that thrust more hourglasses upon you! You’ve now got over 150! That’s like 12 more packs to open! And woah, opening those packs triggered more missions and you’ve got another 40 hourglasses! Three more packs and a few hourglasses to spare! And don’t forget to Wonder Pick! That one-in-five chance of getting a card you half-want unlocks even more rewards right now! Oh, and what’s this, there’s a new type of CPU battle, where you can win the chance to try to pull a Lapras card! And it rewards you yet another type of hourglass to keep trying! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506">Until it doesn’t!</a></span></p><h2 id="h7786"><a id=""></a>But this is <em>Pokémon</em></h2><p>I keep hearing the voice of the frustrated reader, crying, “Yeah, but it’s a free-to-play app, dumbass. This is what they do.” And I just keep coming back to the same reply: Yeah, but this is <em>Pokémon</em>.</p><p>I think the <em>Fortnite</em> comparison is a useful one, here. <em>Fortnite </em>is indisputably another product aimed at getting parents to pay unfathomable amounts of money to play a free game. It makes billions of dollars a year, despite being even more blatantly open to being played for free, with its in-game currency sold on plastic cards in every grocery store. My son got piles of V-bucks for his recent birthday, and I pay for his Battle Pass. I’m acutely aware of how well it works. And yet, as problematic as so much of it may be, it’s nothing compared to <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>.</p><p>In <em>Fortnite</em>, there’s nothing on which you can spend real-world money that affords you any advantages. Everything that can be bought is cosmetic, even in the Battle Pass. And that Battle Pass? It lasts 12 weeks (roughly three months) and costs around $9.50. For this, you get regular (cosmetic) rewards for an enormous 200 levels. You get loads, and cannot pay to win.</p><p>In <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>, real-world money can buy you access to vastly more packs of cards, Wonder Picks, and turns at Events, all of which can give you significant advantages in the battles. The better your cards, the better your decks, and the more you’ll win. And that Premium Pass? It lasts just one month and costs $10. For this, you get a series of tasks that unlock you…11 Pack Hourglasses, eight Wonder Hourglasses, and 29 “Premium Tickets,” that let you buy a bunch of cosmetics. That’s right—11 of the items anyone wants, less than half as many as you’ll be given for completing a rudimentary mission in your opening hours of the game. Completing everything it offers takes a couple of hours, at most, and then it just sits fallow. You also get one extra pack to open a day, which is really what you’re paying for here. You get so little, and you’re paying to win.</p><p>It’s no surprise that <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em> hasn’t even tried to launch in Belgium, where loot boxes are outlawed, and nor in the Netherlands, where a similar law is being sought.</p><h2 id="h7787"><a id=""></a>The Wooloo are gambling</h2><figure id="" data-id="34853f6ea775c4056ba80cd57a73f258" data-recommend-id="image://34853f6ea775c4056ba80cd57a73f258" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mewtwo pack artwork." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Mewtwo pack artwork." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34853f6ea775c4056ba80cd57a73f258" data-recommend-id="image://34853f6ea775c4056ba80cd57a73f258" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mewtwo pack artwork." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a fan of the real-world TCG, I was excited to play this streamlined version, especially after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-marvel-snap-1851653373&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-marvel-snap-1851653373">playing it at Gamescom earlier this year</a></span>. At that preview demo, we weren’t shown any of the gacha elements, and questions about them were responded to with, “We’ll have to get back to you on that.” I said at the time that I feared many more ways to spend Gold other than speeding up pack opening would be revealed by launch, adding, “Gacha plus kids makes me uncomfortable.” But I still let myself hope a bit. It’s <em>Pokémon</em>, right?</p><p>And yes, let’s address the problematic nature of those real-world card packs too. Are they gambling? Very probably, depending on the motivation behind buying them. However, there’s a huge difference for children’s minds in something like a stamina meter that could be refilled with the touch of a button to maintain a feedback loop, and nagging your parent into taking you to the store to buy another $5 pack.</p><p>I feel very sure that in <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>, The Pokémon Company has made a big error in judgment. While it already is proving enormously successful (with reports of $20 million made in its first week), the reputational harm that I suspect will follow could outweigh it. I foresee mainstream news stories about kids who’ve spent thousands on cards via their parents’ credit cards, alongside the more specialist press reporting on just how grim the pull rates are when you don’t spend money. Already, the man behind the deeply influential <em>Pokémon</em> news site <em>Serebii</em>, Joe Merrick, has tweeted, saying of the current Lapras event, “It took…10 Pikachu, 8 Clefairy, 6 Mankey and 5 Butterfree. A total of 29 packs before I finally got the Lapras. Now to not touch this event again.”</p><p>After this first week of people experiencing <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>’s initial dopamine rush of endless packs to tear open, and the flow of rewards feeding into satisfying loops, I think we will now see the game’s huge audience collectively hitting the cut-off point, the moment when the dealer suddenly ups his prices now that the drug is in your system. I think it’s going to be reputationally ugly for The Pokémon Company, and I suspect the absolutely god-awful Premium Pass is going to need massive revision ASAP, likely with a heavy dump of apologetic in-game rewards for purchasers (something problematic in itself).</p><p>Yes, once again, this sort of shit is grimly normal in the mobile space, and there’s a vast industry built around the exploitation of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_roller&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_roller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whales</a></span> in free-to-play gacha gaming. Or, let’s call it by its name: gambling. But, yet again, <em>this is Pokémon</em>. It’s Pokémon just undeniably selling gambling to children.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I didn’t have much time to complete such a monumental open-world adventure. So, despite spending countless hours exploring the Wild West, <em>RDR </em>fell on the back burner until the following summer, when I finally sat down one weekend to grind through the entire story.

Despite the cost, a heavy dose of nostalgia washed over the community and the open-world western now sits at ‘Very Positive’ on Steam, as of this writing, with thousands of reviews from the community. Of course, like any other game release, you have those posting negative reviews due to the price, boycotting the studio, or are upset because of performance issues. Everyone’s opinion is valid, but take every review with a grain of salt.</p><p>First, let’s start with the positive reviews. There are loads of them, with the clear majority of the many thousands of user reviews left behind being positive. Most of them shout from the rooftops about the game’s stable performance, with plenty of PC-specific graphics settings to tweak the experience. Of course, then you have those proclaiming it’s one of the best stories told in gaming, with the most memorable characters and setpieces. To some extent, they’re not wrong.</p><p>However, even the positive reviews note the price tag associated with the remake. At $50, Rockstar is asking for a lot from long-time fans, especially for such an old port. In fact, the vast majority of negative reviews point towards its price tag as the reason for their review. </p><p>If you’re still considering the recent PC release of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>,

And so all that’s very exciting. And then in certain instances, we’re also doing animation series, or live-action films to augment that and be part of those roadmaps.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That innocuous mention of a new Virtua Fighter has already set tongues wagging within the fighting game community. Virtua Fighter hasn’t seen a mainline release in years, leaving mini-game appearances in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s Yakuza games and the 2021 release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a> to tide fans over. IGN has asked Sega for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter, which includes characters such as Akira Yuki, Pai Chan, and Wolf Hawkfield, is on the hardcore end of the fighting game spectrum, with slower-paced gameplay that challenges players to master its mechanics in order to enjoy success. Virtua Fighter 5, which first released in 2006, is considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time. Could Sega now be ready to release Virtua Fighter 6, nearly 20 years later?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During The Game Awards 2023, Sega announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-golden-axe-and-more-are-in-development-game-awards-2023"><u>new games in the Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi franchises</u></a> alongside the teaser trailer, below. The video shows brief clips of each of the games set to return.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has said its Crazy Taxi reboot, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crazy-taxi-reboot-an-open-world-massively-multiplayer-aaa-game-sega-says">is an open-world, massively multiplayer AAA game</a>. There is no release date yet for the Crazy Taxi reboot or any of the other new games announced at last year's Game Awards. Perhaps we’ll find out more in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Nintendo has shed further insight on its approach to mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>In today's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">Corporate Management Policy Briefing</a>, Nintendo stated that while it would "not rule out the possibility of further mergers and acquisitions", its current "priority is to organically expand the organisation". This is so "new staff members are able to fully learn and understand our creative culture" at Nintendo.</p>
<p>The Mario maker seldom partakes in acquisitions, only making a handful in recent years. In May, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-acquisition-since-2022-and-its-from-embracer">company acquired Shiver Entertainment</a> from Embracer. Shiver is a studio responsible for porting the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> onto Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>This particular deal marked Nintedo's first acquisition since 2022, when it purchased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-buying-animation-studio-it-will-rename-nintendo-pictures">Dynamo Pictures</a> (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-officially-launches-its-nintendo-pictures-animation-studio">subsequently became Nintendo Pictures</a>) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-acquiring-long-time-development-partner-srd">SRD</a>. In 2021, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-buying-luigis-mansion-3-developer-next-level-games">Nintendo purchased Next Level Games</a>, the studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion-3">Luigi's Mansion 3</a>.</p>
<p>That same year, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/05/nintendos_ready_for_acquisitions_when_the_time_is_right">said</a> any acquisitions it makes would be determined by the company's need to keep pace with "rapidly advancing technological innovation". The following year, Nintendo president <a href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1489149335203815431">Shuntaro Furukawa</a> stated: "Our brand was built upon products crafted with dedication by our employees, and having a large number of people who don’t possess Nintendo DNA in our group would not be a plus to the company."</p>
<p>Then, last year, Furukawa <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nikkei-shuntaro-furukawa-interview-switch-support-until-early-march-2025-increase-in-in-house-developers-and-thought-process-behind-acquisitions.770663/">explained</a> Nintendo does not "reject the use of M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions)", adding "if an organisation that does not understand Nintendo's creative approach is brought into the fold, it may not produce the expected results".</p>
<p>Furukawa closed: "On the other hand, for companies with a similar development approach, we can form various partnerships with them, not limited to M&amp;A."</p>

<p>As a limited time mode, Launch Royale is a step back to the origins of the game, which has evolved and changed an awful lot since 2019 – a time when battle royale still felt rather novel. All of the characters released since then are snuffed back out of existence, you no longer have EVO Armor or Ability Upgrades, and get what many will consider to be a mure pure experience from it.</p>
<p>Old hands will be able to immediately lean back into the early meta of weapons, strategies and drop points, but there’s also some incentives beyond that. Launch Royale Challenges will unlock Legends, earn rewards that include Apex Packs and more.</p>
<p>Beyond that, this season will also see the revival of the original medic and healer character, Lifeline. Outside of Launch Royale, she will sport a new kit that includes teleporting the healing drone direct to allies and dropping a circular healing forcefield.</p>

<p>There’s also Rift Relics that can be retrieved from strange portals, which will feature overpowered weapons and Boost Kits to give you a real leg up in a match, and a new universal, character agnostic melee, the Raptor’s Claw. This can be unlocked through the Void Mercenary Store between now and 7th January,</p>
