		<p>The first trailer for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sonic-the-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> movie has arrived, showing Team Sonic’s battle with Shadow the Hedgehog, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/16/keanu-reeves-is-reportedly-playing-shadow-in-sonic-3-movie/">confirmed to be voiced by Keanu Reeves</a>. Sonic 3 is set to release in cinemas on 20th December 2024.</p>
<p>Here’s the trailer, but you’re probably best off not watching it if you’d like there to be any surprises left for the final film.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic the Hedgehog 3 | Official Trailer (2024 Movie) Ben Schwartz, Jim Carrey, Keanu Reeves" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSu6i2iFMO0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 sees Shadow unleashed upon the world, a darker counterpart to Sonic whose appearance was teased at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Would he be Robotnik’s latest lackey to get revenge on Sonic? Well, the trailer completely spoils that aspect of the story, but it’s a bit of a no-brainer that Jim Carrey’s Robotnik would return, and he’s larger than life as usual… especially with his waistline.</p>
<p>Keanu Reeves has become one of the most popular and beloved actors in Hollywood in recent times, thanks in no small part to his action-packed John Wick series, and honestly, I think he’s a great bit of casting for Shadow, thanks to the often quite neutral tone to his voice. He’s joining Idris Elba’s Knuckles, Ben Schwartz’s Sonic and Colleen O’Shaughnessey’s Tails in the recording booth, who all did a fine job for the second film.</p>

<p>Shadow’s appearance adding another layer to the franchise which has just introduced Tails and Knuckles to the film’s universe. Shadow debuted in Sonic Adventure 2 in 2001 as a new arch nemesis to Sonic with many of the same abilities and powers, but a darker and edgier tone. Shadow has since become a mainstay of the video game franchise, though as more of an antihero as opposed to a villain, even using guns in the 2005 spin-off game Shadow the Hedgehog – this was not a series highlight.</p>
<p>With almost perfect timing, Shadow is making a comeback in video games as well, with Sonic X Shadow Generations, an expanded remaster of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 game with a whole new story for Shadow. We’ve just been hands on with this at Gamescom 2024 – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/27/sonic-x-shadows-generations-preview-what-no-guns/">read our Shadow Generations preview here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/14/best-sonic-games-top-10-movie/">The top 10 best Sonic the Hedgehog games of recent times</a></p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/28/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-movie-review/">reviewed Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a> earlier this year, giving it a great 8/10 score and saying, ”</p>
<p>“Sonic the Hedgehog 2 kicks on from the 2020 origin story with a bigger and even more bombastic sequel, fleshing out the Sonic universe while riffing on superhero movies and globe-trotting adventures. With another film in the works (and a mid-credits scene to tease it), this blue blur is set to be a family-friendly staple for quite some time to come.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2014 <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> released the 5th edition of "The World's Greatest Roleplaying Game" and now as we wrap up 2024 players are able to get their hands on the first of the three new <em>D&amp;D 2024 Core Rulebooks</em>. The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e 2024 Player's Handbook</em> is a reference book that allows players to learn the rules of the game and create their own character, ready to embark on an adventure!</p>
<p>For this review, we're only focusing on the <em>Player's Handbook</em>. When the 2024 <em>Dungeon Master's Guide </em>releases on November 12th, and 2024 <em>Monster Manual </em>releases on the 18th of February (in 2025) we'll be reviewing them separately.</p>
<p>The PHB is broken up into three different segments that ease the player logically into the world of <em>D&amp;D</em>, creating their characters, and then additional resources and references for items, spells, and more that the player or DM may need.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-intro.jpg?itok=gU4r4R5a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-intro.jpg?itok=El325zb1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Welcome to a whole new era of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></figcaption></figure><h2>How To Play <em>D&amp;D</em> In The Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e 2024 Player's Handbook</h2>
<p>Opening strong, the book begins with an explanation of the History of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons,</em> how to use the book, and how to play the game.</p>
<p>Information is laid out in a logical way to provide context for the next instructions. The book describes the roles of those at the table and what kinds of adventures the party might go on before adding in information about the tools of the game (dice), how ability checks work, and how combat plays out.</p>
<p>From the third paragraph of Chapter 1 the 2024 <em>PHB</em> demonstrates one of the smart additions to the Player Handbook, scripted examples.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-roleplay-example.jpg?itok=nUYcsgaV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-roleplay-example.jpg?itok=FaUIKqpN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For those nervous to get into roleplay the book details social interactions nicely...</figcaption></figure><p>For anyone who has played <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> before, reading these rules will make sense as you have the context to frame the situations, but for a new reader wanting to understand their role as a Player and how they fit into the greater structure of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> these scripted examples do a lot of heavy lifting to introduce concepts.</p>
<p>The first example provided in the book of scripted play is a conversation between a DM and their two players. Here the DM describes a scene before the players ask to perform investigations. A nice addition here to their conversation isn't just the DM performing their roles, but also gives an example of the DM politely asking the players to not overload them with questions.</p>
<p>While there's no assumption that a player might be a problematic player, this does immediately set a tone to the players to be aware that your DM is doing a lot, and also gives DMs implicit permission that they don't always need to be responding to every players beck and call.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-combat-example.jpg?itok=ec1entlm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-combat-example.jpg?itok=5TS3q8Ml 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>...it also explains the how and why of combat</figcaption></figure><p>Later on in this chapter larger examples are provided for exploration and combat, in these we don't just get to read about the steps the DM and each player (and their character) are taking, but also we get to learn the rationale behind why they're making those decisions.</p>
<p>Some lessons that are highlighted during these examples are that it's worth rolling regardless of whether you have Proficiency, how light can alter how much you can see, and that it's important for a player to know their spells as their DM may not know them all.</p>
<p>The compression of eight pages of rules into two pages of combat example might not allow for everything to be covered, but for a new player hopping in it gives a good ground level of knowledge to then build upon.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Layout Improvement</h2>
<p>Immediately after reading just the introductory chapter, I've been impressed about the books layout, starting with simple rules and then building upon them creates an excellent environment for learning.</p>
<p>One thing that I would have liked to see, as is common with other games where new editions expand upon previous rules, would be an indication of where something is new. While I'm very familiar with the rules of <em>D&amp;D 5e</em> I'm not going to say I know them all like the back of my hand. An indication that something has received a tweak, or is completely new would be helpful for those who aren't starting their adventures in <em>D&amp;D</em> with the <em>2024 Core Rulebooks</em>, but are interested in reviewing what's new.</p>
<p>That being said when something needs to be referenced, the book makes accessing that information easier than ever with an eighteen-page rules glossary at the back of the book. (Something that I will likely make a few copies of to always have readily available around my table)</p>
<h2>Character Creation</h2>
<p>Moving into the character creation section where in 2014<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> you'd pick your Race, then Class, with Background coming last. The new order of character creation is to pick your class, then your character Origin which is comprised of your background as well as your species.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-classes-and-subclasses.jpg?itok=2xM2ug3M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-classes-and-subclasses.jpg?itok=vwzHWIlx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The available Classes and Sub-Classes in the 2024 PHB</figcaption></figure><p>An effort has been made to make the content available from the 2024 <em>PHB</em> work with the content from 2014 but as is going to be the case with such a large overhaul there are going to be some times where the pieces don't fit nicely together.</p>
<h3>Classes</h3>
<p>Contained in the 2024 <em>PHB</em> are twelve different classes, each with four available subclasses. Compared to the 2014 <em>PHB</em> (and the numerous additional sub-classes added over the past decade) there is a lot that has been paired down.</p>
<p>It was interesting reading through the sub-classes that remained (with a variety of tweaks) or the new sub-classes and how they offer brand new options for a class. The available sub-classes offer good variety in the types of archetypes that each of these classes can represent.</p>
<p>A good example of this is in Druid class. The available Circles are the Circle of the Land, Circle of the Moon, Circle of the Sea, and Circle of the Stars. Depending on whether your druid wants to pull power from nature, from the animal inhabitants of the land, from the water of the world, or from the stars each is its own different take on playing a Druid.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-druid-wildshape.jpg?itok=VZDN04bz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-druid-wildshape.jpg?itok=9NvCFgOW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The druid changes are the only ones I feel missed the mark</figcaption></figure><p>These more unique identities from the classes help to make each character more unique in comparison to another, especially when you then factor in the differences that an Origin adds.</p>
<p>For the types of abilities you'll be obtaining through both your class and sub-class I was excited to read most of them. In terms of the overall vibe of the character customization changes in relation to Class and Sub-Class I'd be excited as a player to be rolling up a D&amp;D 2024 character.</p>
<p>In terms of abilities getting downgrades, I believe it's the Druid who has suffered the worst overall. Wildshape, a mechanic that's core to the druid experience, is being altered to be far less powerful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will still take on the physical traits and attacks of a beast that you wildshape into, but instead of using their HP as your own you will instead gain Temp HP equivalent to your druid level.</p>
<p>Wildshaping might offer a better AC than your standard form, but you won't get to have the entirety of the animal's HP on top of your own to survive with. A Crocodile's 13 HP might not be a lot, but for a squishy druid at level 4 it's far better than 4 Temp HP.</p>
<h4>Multiclassing</h4>
<p>A table for multi-classing spellcasters has been added that allows for fans of picking up multiple forms of spellcasting to have a better time with. To use this table you add up the levels of your different classes, some classes count for less of a level such as a Paladin being ½ a level and an Arcane Trickster being 1/3rd a level.</p>
<p>This lets you know that if you have three levels as an Arcane Trickster and 4 levels as a Bard you'd be level 5 on the Multiclass Spellcaster table.</p>
<h3>Origins &amp; Species</h3>
<p>Origins have taken over from the place of Backgrounds. Each Origin now influences a number of character traits that had previously been attributed to your race (now species) such as which Ability Scores you have proficiency in, your skill and tool proficiencies, and your starting equipment.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-origin.jpg?itok=CBWvUIEF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-origin.jpg?itok=8s5DVbgu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every Origin features relevant artwork and the game mechanic information&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Origins also all provide a special feat that is specific to your Origin that has been designed to be useful to your character throughout their whole career.</p>
<p>With 16 Origins, each holding more weight on the build of your character it allows for a lot more versatility within the character.</p>
<p>For 2014 <em>D&amp;D</em> if you and a friend were both an Arcane Trickster there wouldn't be too much variance between your characters if you selected a different background. With Origins an Arcane Trickster that is an Entertainer vs an Arcane Trickster that is a Wayfarer will be more distinct.</p>
<p>Part of putting more mechanical weight on Class/Sub-Class and Origin is that it frees up the Species to have more variety outside of the mechanics. Your Goliath doesn't need to be the biggest and beefiest warrior on the block, they can have studied books all their lives and it won't be going against their entire way of life.</p>
<p>I enjoy this redistribution of mechanics and roleplay as a way to create more meaningful permutations of different characters. It allows the book to present to me only 48 sub-classes, but allow for thousands of character variants before we even get into roleplay decisions.</p>
<h2>Spells, Components, and Summoning</h2>
<p>A lot of the spells in the 2024 <em>PHB</em> have been altered in slight ways. Spotchecking a variety of spells that I know my players and I commonly uses I've found tweaks as small as altered wordings, while other spells add or remove entire aspects of the ability.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-spell-list.jpg?itok=5S7uugDa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-spell-list.jpg?itok=2R-YodWa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look closely as there are many slight differences</figcaption></figure><p>A quick example of this would be that Faerie Fire acts the exact same, Goodberry changes from being able to choose to create up to 10 vs 2024 always making 10, and Power Word Kill now does 12d12 damage if the target is above 100 HP.</p>
<p>Most of the spell changes that I've read have been -- at the very least -- positive for a player, if not an overall improvement. As so many of these changes are so slight whether you like, dislike, or are ambivalent to these changes will really be up to the player/those at the table.</p>
<h2>Monster Stat Blocks</h2>
<p>As a forever DM one of the nicest aspects of the <em>2024 PHB</em> is the insight that it offers to creature statblocks. Inside the <em>PHB</em> there are stat blocks for beasts for Druids to Wildshape into, creatures that can be summoned, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-stat-block.jpg?itok=TAuczE_C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-stat-block.jpg?itok=4gKBZDJY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>And yes, the cat now has darkvision</figcaption></figure><p>With the updated look important information like the creatures AC, HP, Initiative, and Speed are clearly laid out at the top of the stat block. We also get a detailed break down of the creatures stats, what their base modifier would be for anything, as well as their saves.</p>
<p>This quick glance to find the same info in the exact same place, and the math already being done helps to alleviate stresses for DMs and players alike, especially as they're summoning or transforming any of these creatures.</p>
<h2>Controversy! The Confused Loxodon In The Room</h2>
<p>Ultimately reading over the rules of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player Handbook</em> has felt most comparable to reading through the changelog of a video game. There's plenty of balancing going on, new abilities appearing while old ones change or potentially even disappear.</p>
<p>While I've enjoyed the vast majority of the updates provided by this <em>PHB</em> it rests in a strange place that it's not a full step to a new edition, and it's not even a half-step like we've seen<em> D&amp;D</em> take before.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-comparisons.jpg?itok=vyolYifa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-comparisons.jpg?itok=NvUi4bP2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new Fighter class page from the 2024 PHB laid over the 2014 PHB</figcaption></figure><p>As a book of mostly backward-compatible errata, there's a sense of hesitancy that all players can feel from Wizards of the Coast, that they don't want to create a new edition and lose the fanbase that has been very publicly growing but that they want to continue to update it.</p>
<p>This messaging has resulted in a situation that ultimately makes it harder for those who play the game. If I'm playing in multiple tables, I will invariably have some questions: which rules are they using? Would cherry-picking certain rules and spells make the players or the DM too powerful? How much 'fixing' of things does a DM need to perform to make the game feel fun? What's the impact of one player using 2014 abilities and another is using 2024 abilities?</p>
<p>For a casual table like mine, I don't imagine we'll have much issue progressing forward into these new rules tweaks during, or at the conclusion of our current campaign… but that doesn't change the fact that I've dedicated quite some time looking at builds and compatibility to reach that conclusion.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy the 2024 Player's Handbook?</h2>
<p>As a standalone product, a book that any person can buy off the street to learn how to be a player of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition</em> I think this book absolutely nails what it's going for. Throughout the course of the book, you'll be taught, with plenty of examples, how to play the game. You'll be able to create characters that offer greater variety in gameplay mechanics with the new Origin system, and you'll learn all you need to about the different feats, spells, magic items, and more.</p>
<p>If you're happy with what you already have available to you with the 2014 Player Handbook and all of the expansions that have since been released though a lot of what you'll find here are changes, that I mostly found were improvement, with a few completely new elements.</p>
<p>By finding this weird place of not being a full or even half step the 2024 PHB would be my recommendation for a new player, but for someone who owns all the books you can likely wait until more of the core books, or even a few adventures have been released before you look at this more seriously.</p>

<p>This has been an interesting, and slightly complicated review to work through. While there's a lot going on in the almost 400 pages that is the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player's Handbook</em> the majority of it is small alterations if you compare it to what's previously been available.</p>
<p>Unless you're picking apart spells and comparing them you might not even notice or realize some of the subtle changes that are taking place. I can imagine for many you might end up unintentionally gaslighting yourself or suffer from the mandela effect when a spell comes up in a game and you just can't be certain if it's changed or not.</p>
<p>As a player the options that I have seen excite me, while the majority might not be entirely new sub-classes altering the way you play the game completely there's enough there to optimize or improve play. Of course, my heart does go out to the druid fans for such an incredible blow.</p>
<p>If you're interested in seeing what kinds of changes there are for <em>D&amp;D 5e</em> in this weird "update that isn't meant to be an update" then it's a fun book to pick up, but for the time being and immediate future it's likely not going to be a 'must have' at anyone's table.</p>

            <p>Nintendo Direct brings us a gift, and one in the form of exciting news about history's most squirrel stuffed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s. Can you really claim 108 characters when five of them are flying squirrels with different colour capes? Never mind all that. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden">Suikoden</a> 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars has a new release date: March 6, 2025.</p>
<p>I’ll get into details in a minute, but since it came up in Slack chat earlier, I’d first like to share with you the differences between the 1995 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a>’s EU PS1 one cover art:</p>

<p>Truly, astonishing stuff.</p>
<p>The remaster was originally set to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-two-classic-suikoden-rpgs-are-coming-to-pc-as-an-hd-remaster">release last year</a> after being announced by Konami at the 2022 Tokyo Game Show, but never materialised. Today, we finally got a new date locked down via Nintendo Direct. Here’s the latest trailer:</p>

<p>The game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932640/Suikoden_III_HD_Remaster_Gate_Rune_and_Dunan_Unification_Wars/">Steam page</a> highlights the following details:</p>
<blockquote><p>・All background illustrations have been upgraded to HD</p>
<p>・Updated effects breathe new life into the pixel art animation</p>
<p>・New environmental sounds effects to immerse yourself in this fantasy world</p>
<p>・Battle SFX are also now HD and add a new level of realism</p>
<p>・Newly added auto-save</p>
<p>・Battle Fast Forward</p>
<p>・Conversation Log</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a bit more detail on a few of these items in the Ninty trailer. Battles can now be bumped to 2x or 4x speed, and there's also single-button autobattle option - although I swear this was in the menu in the original anyway. Another detail the Steam page doesn’t mention: getting these both in a single package hopefully means the games carrying your save over will be nicely painless. It wasn’t too impactful, but there are a few secrets you can unlock in the second game if you’ve fully completed the first.</p>
<p>As Brendy will tell you from the time I tried to cram a Suikoden bit in his best JRPGs list despite them not being out on PC yet, these games are incredibly special to me. Everything I’ve seen so far seems positive. I don’t actually know what an ‘emu-lator’ is, but this seems like a far easier way to play them on modern hardware than enlisting the help of an emu.</p>
<p>If you need something to keep you going until next March, there’s always spiritual successor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes">Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</a>. “A turn-based JRPG that accommodates those familiar with Suikoden or those who don't know what a Suikoden is,” wrote Edders in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-review">his review</a>. “Embrace the old-school quirks and there's a wonderful journey to be had here.”</p>
<p>Eiyuden director and Suikoden co-creator Yoshitaka Murayama sadly passed away earlier this year, though I do find it heartening that he got to see just how much Suikoden meant to people when Eiyuden smashed its Kickstarter goals.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/jason-blundell-is-heading-a-new-studio-at-sony-to-work-on-a-new-sci-fi-action-game-with-bungie-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A former Call of Duty: Black Ops Executive Producer has joined Sony to work on a brand new game with Bungie for PlayStation.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/GirlGlitcher/status/1828312905097302244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GirlGlitcher</a>, Jason Blundell has taken on a role as the head of a new studio within Sony. This studio is developing a new game alongside Destiny 2 developer Bungie that is “an action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe”.</p>







<p>The claim says that Bungie had been working on this game already before Blundell’s arrival, and, likely, before Sony started restructuring the studio. It was also doubled down that it’s not in the Destiny or Marathon franchise. </p>



<p>Blundell spent over a decade at Treyarch working on Call of Duty before leaving in 2020 to form his own studio, Deviation Games. Deviation was working on a new game for PlayStation Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deviation-games-hit-with-layoffs-with-playstation-game-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before it was hit with layoffs</a> and ultimately shut down in March 2024. Blundell had left Deviation in September 2022.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time since Blundell left Deviation that he was linked with Sony. Back in May, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-sony-forms-new-studio-of-former-deviation-games-devs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it was reported</a> that Sony had formed a new studio with former Deviation employees to work on an unannounced IP. It has yet to be confirmed that Blundell was working with this new studio, though all signs point to that <a href="https://x.com/JCbackfire/status/1736852589927702938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being the case</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony and Bungie for comment on the claims. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly. </p>



<hr>



<p>What do you think this new game from Sony and Bungie could be, and do you think Jason Blundell could have success if he’s leading the studio?

Capcom Fighting Collection 2 will be the first re-release of both Power Stones since the PSP's Power Stone Collection. Project Justice received a PlayStation Online version, but only in Japan. Capcom vs. SNK 2 got a PlayStation Network port back in 2013, but no other re-release.</p>

Today's double-feature of a Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase and Indie World brought a smattering of new announcements, as the Switch heads into its final Christmas. 
</p>
<p>
The shows were light on any real bombshells, perhaps to be expected with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> on the horizon. But in their place there was still plenty to keep you busy over the coming six months, with eye-catching indie games, retro game collections and a wave of ports.
</p>
<p>
You can watch the full show below, or recap it announcement by announcement underneath.

Moving over to games with bigger budgets, the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase began with... Tetris! In time for the game's 40th anniversary, Tetris Forever includes a raft of classic Tetris games (Tetris! Tetris 2 + Bombliss! Tetris Battle Gaiden!) plus a new Tetris "experience" named Tetris Time Warp where you play as one of several classic Tetris styles at the same time. It's due later this year. (And also NES Tetris is coming to Nintendo Switch Online this winter.)

            <p>Amazon Prime Gaming is offering members the chance to scoop up three games set in Lord of the Rings' Middle-earth at no additional cost.</p>
<p>This latest promotion is all to celebrate the second season premiere of The Rings of Power on Amazon, which starts on 29th August.</p>
<p>The three games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor Game of the Year Edition</li>
<li>Lego The Lord of the Rings, via GOG code</li>
<li>Middle-earth: Shadow of War, on Amazon Luna via the Prime Gaming offer wherever Luna is available</li>
</ul>
<p>I am quite fond of the Lego games, so would recommend giving that a go if you haven't yet. Also, unlike the Lego Hobbit games, the Lego Lord of the Rings includes the whole story.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-the-lord-of-the-rings-review">Lego Lord of the Rings review from 2012</a> (again, what is time?!) called it "charming and delightful, faithful to the source yet cheekily irreverent, and packed with features that feed into each other in satisfying ways". In fact, Dan Whitehead said it marked "another highpoint in the Lego series".</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home?filter=Game&amp;ref_=SM_FreeGameswithPrime2023_PRA">find more details on Amazon's Lord of the Rings game promotion here</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann recently said the company was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-still-trying-to-find-the-hook-for-its-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">still trying to find the "hook" for its Lord of the Rings MMO</a>, stating the team doesn't "just want to go and do the same thing over" with its Middle-earth game.</p>
<p>"While it's tempting sometimes with an existing IP, that's not the point of doing it. You've got to find a fresh twist, and we're still, I think, in that period where we really want to find out what could be the hook, what could be the thing which is different to all the other games out there," Hartmann said. "So it's a little bit early."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>For all the years of build up and anticipation, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/starfield">Starfield’s</a> launch last September didn’t exactly set the world alight. It took a bold step into sci-fi with its interstellar adventure, but felt like it didn’t quite explore its galaxy of possibilities as fully as it could have done. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/starfield-shattered-space-dlc-revealed-coming-to-xbox-and-pc-later-this-year/">Launching on 30th September, Starfield: Shattered Space</a>, the first big expansion for the game, looks set to take one of the dangling threads of potential and head down a dark and twisted rabbit hole.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield: Official REV-8 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rA1z1DbA_Io?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout the version of Starfield that shipped, you can see the vestigial remnants of some of the many gameplay experiments and ideas that Bethesda explored through the game’s eight years of development. Some remain as gameplay elements with little meaningful purpose, like building bases to refine fuel for space travel that was eventually made practically limitless, while others were left as dangling threads waiting to be revisited, like House Va’ruun.</p>


<p>This bunch of fanatical space serpent worshippers were easily one of the most enigmatic aspects of the main game. Ostensibly one of the biggest factions in the Settled Systems, alongside the United Colonies and FreeStar Collective, they were almost nowhere to be seen, outside of historical context and having Andreja as one of your possible companions. The presence of Va’ruun’kai, their homeworld, was kept a closely guarded secret as they retreated into isolation.</p>
<p>Also weird as heck experiments. Shattered Space reveals the location of Va’ruun’kai and the capital city of Dazra in the wake of a reality tearing experiment by their leading scientists, with extra-dimensional beings flooding through.</p>


<p>Va’ruun’kai promises to be a dark and unsettling locale to explore, the planet shrouded in deep, dark reds and purples from its sky that lend it a deeply ominous tone, while Dazra itself has been engulfed in a spatial anomaly and surrounded by a suspended explosion. Still, Dazra is basically the one safe place left on the planet, with the Va’ruun evacuating other settlements and places from across the planet to reach its relative safety.</p>
<p>House Va’ruun is threatened on all sides, the most eye-catching being the enemies that can burst out from another reality, whether they’re new long-limbed bugs or humanoids that are reminiscent of Spider-Man villain Mister Negative or Destiny’s Taken. There’s the potential to explore some real cosmic horrors through this rend in time and space that they’ve created, especially if Bethesda choose to reveal more about the Great Serpent itself.</p>

<p>While the trailers look to lean in on the horror aspect, I’m not sure the expansion will really be all that terrifying. Battling these enemies, Bethesda is pushing the combat in a subtly different direction that might ramp up the pressure and challenge you in different ways. There could be more zero-G battles, you’ll have more hostiles to deal with when exploring the wider surface of Va’ruun’kai and you’ll probably want the Rev-8 to help outrun things, but also there’s a shifting emphasis on enemies that will bullrush you and try to get within melee range. If you went through the main game hunkering down behind cover constantly, that might no longer be an option in Shattered Space as you’re pushed to stay mobile and make use of the jet pack.</p>
<p>However, just as impactful to this expansion will be the threats to House Va’ruun from within. There’s a power vacuum at the top of this space empire and all of the sub-factions and lesser figures are vying to step up to the big time. You’ll no doubt have a hand in deciding you gets to lead House Va’ruun into the future, and there will no doubt be the full gamut of reasonable leaders and full-on galaxy destroying nutters.</p>

<p>With the galaxy of systems and planets already generated, Bethesda’s expansions to Starfield can take on a much more hand-crafted approach. Shattered Space is the first fruits of this labour, building within this established framework to expand the universe narrative and make this a game worth revisiting.</p>

			<p>After months of silence, <a href="https://wccftech.com/suikoden-iii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-announced-for-pc-and-consoles/">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars</a> has finally resurfaced, and with a final release date to boot.</p>
<p>In today's Nintendo Partner Direct, it has been confirmed that the collection featuring the first two entries in the beloved JRPG series by Konami will be released on March 6th on Nintendo Switch. Konami has yet to confirm the release date for PC and PlayStation consoles, but it will likely be the same as the Nintendo Switch release. A new trailer showcasing some of the remasters' features was also shared online, and you can find it below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Suikoden I&amp;II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4m7YHLlDq40?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As showcased in the trailer above, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars will come with plenty of improvements over the original releases, such as enhanced visuals featuring pixel sprites and environments with new screen effects and shadow animations, redone character portraits and more. The two games will both receive some gameplay improvements and new quality-of-life features such as a dialogue log, auto-battle, the ability to speed up battles, and more. For the rest, it will be the same classic JRPGs that fans have come to love. The second game, in particular, is considered by many the best entry in the series and one of the best JRPGs ever released, thanks to its excellent story and gameplay.</p>
<p>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars launches on March 6th on Nintendo Switch. The game should be released on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles on the same day.</p>

<h3><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>sure does look pretty</h3>

<h3><em>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2&nbsp;</em>jumpscares its way to Switch this holiday</h3>

The game supports solo play or co-op locally and online.</p><p>Horizon is just the latest franchise to be adapted for a Lego game, following the likes of Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, and Marvel.</p><p>As for the Horizon game series, no new entries have been announced, though a multiplayer title is said to be in the works. Beyond that, a live-action TV show based on the franchise was announced for Netflix but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-horizon-live-action-series-reportedly-not-moving-forward/1100-6524712/" data-ref-id="1100-6524712">may no longer be moving ahead.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Usually, video game consoles get cheaper as the years pass by. But that's not the case for the PS5 in Japan. In fact, Sony is about to raise the price for both PS5 models there by 13,000 yen on September 2, which is roughly about $90 in the US.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1828334413110820877?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, The Verge senior reporter Tom Warren highlighted the price hike for the PS5 in Japan. He also pointed out that this will be the third time Sony has raised the price for the system in Japan since the PS5 launched in late 2020.</p><p dir="ltr">For instance, almost exactly two years ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-price-increasing-in-europe-canada-and-more/1100-6506882/" data-ref-id="1100-6506882">Sony increased the price for PS5 in a lot of regions outside the US</a>, including Japan. Sony cited global inflation and adverse currency trends as the reasons behind the price hikes at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-hardware-sales-are-on-the-decline-but-sony-is-still-looking-healthy/1100-6525590/" data-ref-id="1100-6525590">Sony revealed that PS5 hardware sales were down</a> about 27% year over year for the company's first quarter of fiscal year 2024--April 1 to June 30. Lifetime sales of PS5 have surpassed 60 million systems.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, a new report says <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-coming-this-year-could-be-600-playstation-showcase-in-september-report/1100-6526118/" data-ref-id="1100-6526118">a PS5 Pro could be coming this year and cost $600</a>. The expected release date for the new system would be October or November, and the price could go as high as $700.</p>

		<p>Yakuza Kiwami, the 2016/17 remake of the PS2 classic, is coming to Nintendo Switch on 24th October 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yakuza Kiwami – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 8.27.2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fa4LtKgIVtA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first game in the long-running Japanese crime thriller series (though not the earliest story told in the series, which would be the prequel Yakuza 0), Yakuza Kiwami sees the iconic protagonist Kazuma Kiryu come out of prison 10 years after taking the fall for a murder, and then being dropped right back into the battle between yakuza clans.</p>
<p>There’s an epic story to be told here, but this is also a dense open world that’s full of things to see and do. Kamurocho, a fictional district of Tokyo based on the real-life Kabukichō district is a haven for side missions, mini-games and random enemy encounters.</p>
<p>Bringing the series to the Nintendo Switch for the first time is a pretty great move by RGG Studio and Sega, though we’ll have to wait and see how the game handles the jump to the low powered system. The game did originally launch for PS3 and PS4 in Japan in 2016, though only the PS4 version was localised for other regions. There’s other great places to play this, including Xbox consoles, PC and even PC handhelds… but there’s also just something to the Switch and its relatively light handheld form that will surely appeal.</p>

		<p>The beloved Coffee Talk visual novel series will carry on with Coffee Talk Tokyo, coming to Nintendo Switch in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Coffee Talk Tokyo – Indie World Showcase 8.27.2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ae4dp4ZKREo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Coffee Talk team at Toge Production – represented by AJ and Dio in the announcement – is carrying on the legacy of co-creator and writer Mohammad Fahmi Hasni, who sadly passed away in early 2022. They’ve reunited with co-writer of Episode 2, Anna Winterstein of Chorus, and Kimitaka Ogawa, writer and English-to-Japanese translator who localised the originals.</p>
<p>Combined, they are producing Coffee Talk Tokyo, bringing a more Japanese flavour to the game with things like a matcha latte, while listening to the stories of&nbsp;love, loss, joy and sadness that your patrons share.</p>
